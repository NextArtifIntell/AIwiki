However, in this comment article, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol is vulnerable to an entangle-measure attack by a dishonest participant and an outsider, and a collusion attack by dishonest participants. In addition, theoretically it cannot guarantee the unconditional security because the hash function is not a perfect one-way function.},

  abstract     = {Multi-domain vehicle to grid (V2G) is a network environment in which numerous service providers offer charging and discharging services to EV users. This can enhance energy management and traffic flow for efficient intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, the combination of multiple domains can suffer from various security vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for robust countermeasures. Moreover, existing multi-domain V2G protocols utilized a central trusted authority (TA) which can create a single point of failure (SPOF), or required high computational resources. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain authentication protocol for secure and efficient V2G services using consortium blockchain. The proposed protocol provides lightweight intra-domain authentication using hash functions and XOR operators. Furthermore, the proposed protocol ensures secure cross-domain authentication by integrating elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and physical unclonable function (PUF). Therefore, the proposed protocol can establish trust, enable efficient communications, and prevent congestion at charging stations. To validate security robustness, comprehensive evaluations are conducted using “Real-Or-Random (ROR) model”, “Scyther tool”, and informal analyses. Comparative computational overheads of the proposed and related protocols are measured using “Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL)” testbed experiments. Additionally, a simulation of the practical deployment is conducted using “Network Simulator-3 (NS-3)”. Results indicate that the proposed protocol can improve ITS by providing secure and efficient services for multi-domain V2G environments.},

Real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation is critical to meeting the dynamic energy demands of EV systems. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based automated market maker (AMM) that utilizes constant function products to establish an effective self-regulating pricing system for EV energy market prices. Our unique State of Charge estimation system leverages blockchain-based oracles to efficiently handle requests and monitor EV-oriented energy markets. This enables precise monitoring of battery states and achieves improved SoC values through the interior point method. Experimentation on a blockchain network reveals cost-effective energy regulation within EV systems and enhanced SoC estimation predictability within Energy Markets. All contracts undergo rigorous testing and are deployed at a gas cost of $2.1913742~x 10^{7}$ Wei.

To build a more complex, expressive probability distribution, we incorporate normalizing flows into lane map generation, enhancing realism.

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the probability of crashes is crucial for preventing traffic crashes and mitigating their impacts. However, the imbalance in crash data, irregular road network structures, and heterogeneity in multi-source data pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this study introduces a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network traffic crash prediction model based on Voronoi diagrams that considers geographical spatial distribution. Initially, this study introduces a spatial partitioning method based on Voronoi diagrams, grounded on the geographic spatial distribution characteristics of traffic crashes. It constructs a novel graph structure with spatial units within Voronoi diagrams as nodes and the shared length of different road types between units as edges. This graph structure integrates the spatial distribution characteristics of crashes with the graph structure, substantially contributing to addressing the zero-inflation problem inherent in spatial units constructed on a grid basis. Subsequently, the study employs a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) and Transformer encoder to build the VSTGCN (Voronoi-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network) crash prediction model, evaluating its effectiveness using real data from New York City. Comparisons with eight baseline models demonstrate that VSTGCN outperforms them in all evaluation metrics. Moreover, the paper conducts model ablation studies from different perspectives, such as feature modules and graph structure composition, revealing that the chosen spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal features significantly influence the model’s predictive performance, with spatial features having the most substantial impact. Finally, the novel graph structure based on Voronoi diagrams proposed in this study shows a clear advantage in model effectiveness compared to traditional graph structures. This research can effectively handle complex crash data structures and accurately predict crash probabilities, providing a reliable basis for developing measures to prevent crashes and alleviate their impacts.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle driving behavior analysis and detection tasks have become an indispensable part of intelligent transportation systems. Accurate pattern recognition of potential anomalies during the movement of entities is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Current methods typically analyze vehicle trajectories independently without considering potential interactions among vehicles. To address this limitation, some studies have integrated graph attention mechanisms to capture the influence of neighboring vehicles during the aggregation process. However, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are constrained by the univariate nature of attention heads and coefficients, thus lacking flexibility. In this work, we not only consider the social dynamics among neighboring vehicles but also delve into the limitations of GAT models. We propose a Vehicular Social Dynamics Anomaly Detection (VSD-AD) model based on the Recurrent Multi-Mask Aggregator (MMA) enabled Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture to maximize the learning of relational embeddings among neighbors in a highway vehicle network. Furthermore, we apply Node Feature Quantisation (NFQ) to the encoder output to mitigate the complexity of neighbor relationships. Our model is flexible and customizable for different highway scenarios, suitable for large-scale highway vehicle video data. To validate real-world applicability, we further assess its performance on both the simulated dataset and real-world traffic dataset, where our model outperforms other mainstream methods in terms of detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with the internet of things (IoT) guarantee useful advantages such as facilitating ground communications in regions where the availability of connectivity is restricted owing to physical obstacles. However, the data transmitted by sensors and IoT embedded in UAVs are facing new security issues and privacy challenges with the known security attacks over time. To address these security attacks and threats and meet lightweight UAV communication requirements, a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme is essential. Recently, researchers have designed a lightweight blockchain-enabled AKA scheme with privacy-preserving for UAVs to provide useful and reliable services. However, we prove that the existing scheme is fragile to various security attacks and does not ensure mutual authentication. Thus, we propose a robust and lightweight blockchain-based AKA scheme for PUF-enabled UAVs, called RLBA-UAV to enhance the security problems of the existing scheme. We demonstrate the security of RLBA-UAV by using informal/formal security analyses such as the ROR oracle model and AVISPA simulation. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance comparison analysis between RLBA-UAV and related schemes for UAVs. We demonstrate an implementation of a network simulator (NS) 3 compliant with IEEE 802.11p standards to show its validation and feasibility that RLBA-UAV is appropriate for practical UAVs. Thus, RLBA-UAV offers enhanced security and operational efficiency compared to related schemes and can be applied to practical blockchain-based AKA systems for UAVs.},

This study investigated the degree of visual-manual distraction and secondary task performance of drivers by four center screen layouts (single, joint, vertical and horizontal screens) in smart cockpits. Twenty-four drivers used the four smart cockpit layouts to complete three secondary tasks on real roads: a dashboard viewing task, a song switching task and a specified music playing task. Drivers’ visual-manual demands were measured by eye-tracking and task completion performance, and drivers’ cognitive demands were assessed by Likert scales. The results showed that the type of smart cockpit layout had a significant effect on both drivers visual-manual behavior and task performance, with the horizontal cockpit layout having the least effect on driver visual-manual distraction, while the vertical layout resulted in the highest level of visual demand and distraction. Performance on complex secondary tasks was more likely to be affected by the smart cockpit layout than on simple secondary tasks.

  abstract     = {Temporal information plays a pivotal role in Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) driving scene understanding, which can alleviate the visual information sparsity. However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

A key feature of this work is the open-world setting, where the new events can be detected via the model trained from the known events. A scenario-guided Transformer-enabled multi-modal unknown air crisis event classification is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a memory-augmented feature representation module to improve the cross-modal feature fusion in the basic Transformer network, where the textual and image features of the air crisis events are extracted through the pre-trained models. Then, a scenario-guided mechanism is proposed to pivot the pseudo event simulation to approximate the distribution of unknown events effectively. Specifically, an end-to-end scenario attention with a cross-event mask module is presented to select the valid samples of pseudo events and filter out the invalid ones. Finally, the unknown event classifier is designed to classify the known classes and recognize the unknown events simultaneously. Moreover, a specialized multi-modal dataset on air crisis events is proposed as a benchmark, named AirCrisisMMD. The extensive experiments are performed on the AirCrisisMMD and CrisisMMD datasets, where the latter is the publicly available multi-modal crisis event dataset. The results verify the superior performance boost of the proposed method compared with the highly related state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The accurate representation of pavement in three-dimensional (3D) space is pivotal for road infrastructure management. However, the sparse measurement from affordable equipment, such as 2D LiDAR, has limited the fully utilization of 3D pavement data. This paper aims to address this challenge by exploring the point cloud upsampling for pavement area. Specifically, Pavement-PU, a novel data-driven model is designed to enhance the quality and efficiency of dense point cloud generation task.

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) face critical challenges in mitigating the risks posed by traffic accidents, necessitating accurate traffic accident risk forecasting (TARF) to enhance safety and operational efficiency. Existing methods employ Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to predict traffic accident risks based on traffic dynamics. To address the sparsity of traffic accidents in TARF, these methods employ specialized data transformations or cost-sensitive loss functions, which require manual adjustments to parameters. Additionally, they fail to consider the asynchronicity between the occurrence probability and the potential severity when estimating risks. In this study, we propose DualRisk, a novel TARF model motivated by the observed asynchronous relationship between traffic accident occurrences and severity. DualRisk comprises a spatiotemporal encoding module that captures both recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns, and a two-branch prediction module that simultaneously estimates the occurrence probability and potential severity of accidents. We specifically address the sparsity issue by estimating zero-inflated distributions in the occurrence probability branch, thereby eliminating the need for manual parameter adjustments. Our approach demonstrates consistently superior performance, with the final results averaged over multiple experimental runs. Compared to the suboptimal method, our model reduces the average mean absolute error by 4.26% and improves the Recall metric by 2.86%. Additionally, case studies with visualizations illustrate DualRisk’s capability to capture the asynchronicity in TARF, underscoring its practical application value in real-world environments.},

  abstract     = {The uncertainty in maritime transportation dramatically impacts liner shipping efficiency; to improve operational stability, timely recovery of vessel schedule in liner shipping service is essential after disruptions; however, recovery actions usually cause vessel carbon emissions to increase. In order to reduce the effect of disruption and carbon emissions of liner shipping, in this study, we develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming mathematical model that contains three recovery strategies and considers the costs of the vessel’s voyage in liner shipping service, with emphasis on taking into account the carbon emission and container cumulative delay costs. An adaptive genetic algorithm (RLSGA) is developed to solve the model based on reinforcement learning and simulated annealing algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted on a real liner shipping route to investigate the effectiveness of the model and method. The results indicate that compared with the CPLEX, the proposed RLSGA can provide a more effective vessel schedule recovery solution after disruption occurrences within 20 seconds of all test cases and has a less than 1% deviation rate. Implementing the model in the liner shipping service can lead to a reduction in carbon emissions, cost savings on voyages, and an obvious decrease in the number of containers affected by disruptions. Moreover, this work also analyzes the potential of clean fuel on vessel schedule recovery and obtains managerial insights. The research findings can provide a meaningful reference for liner shipping companies in operation decision-making.},

It coordinates the lane-changing decisions and longitudinal trajectories of CAVs to form platoons based on each vehicle’s target lane, aiming to reduce the negative impact of lane-changing maneuvers on traffic flow and improve platoon formation efficiency. Mathematically, a vehicle model for platoon formation is developed which couples the lateral lane-changing and longitudinal car-following behaviors of vehicles. A model predictive control-based mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem is formulated, which optimizes all vehicles’ lateral and longitudinal trajectories and improves maneuverability and efficiency. In contrast to the majority of existing studies, the configurations of platoons to be formed are not predefined and can be jointly optimized to further improve flexibility. Moreover, the framework that integrates configuration decisions, trajectory planning and control is executed dynamically with a rolling horizon based on real-time traffic states to enhance reliability. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct simulation experiments in SUMO to implement the cooperative platoon formation in a typical three-lane traffic flow with different traffic demand levels. The extensive comparison results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in improving traffic flow speed and platoon formation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the joint optimization problem for trajectory planning and radio resource allocation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications with the aim of maximizing data collection. Rather than decomposing the problem into subproblems, as most current approaches do, we express the quantity of data gathered by a UAV-assisted network as a function of both the size of the resource block allocated to all ground devices and their average upload rate. Based on this formula, it can be concluded that the problem of maximizing the average data collection can be reduced to minimizing the flight trajectory if each device communicates with the UAV within the maximum allowable coverage of the UAV. To address this issue, we propose an advanced hierarchical clustering algorithm that divides larger network-scale scenarios into many disjoint subregions to determine the initial hovering positions of the UAV. The non-convex minimization trajectory problem is decomposed into a series of convex optimizations to minimize path segments along the trajectory, based on the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Subsequently, the communication optimization process is modified to assign specific upload times for each device. The effectiveness of the optimization algorithm is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which show its superior performance in terms of average rates of data collection and upload failures.},

In the upper level of the framework, an optimization model is formulated to determine the number and locations of CSs, and the configuration of MESVs. Based on these planning results, in the lower level, an operational planning model is established to optimize the charging power of the EVs in the CSs and the operation strategy of the MESVs. The outputs of the lower-level model are fed back to the upper level to update the planning result. This process iteratively proceeds until convergence. Business models are established for the MESVs in working days and holidays separately to accommodate the CSs in serving the EV charging demand of the highway and support the interaction between the CSs and the grid.

  abstract     = {Under extreme conditions, vehicles may encounter critical instability and cause traffic accidents due to the tire force saturation. In such cases, accurately predicting the vehicle instability is conducive to vehicle safety because drivers or vehicle controllers can be alerted and take early interventions to ensure driving safety. However, the existing stability assessment methods tend to be conservative, hard to quantify, and often ignore the coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics, as well as the nonlinear characteristics of tires. Simultaneously, under extreme operating conditions, the assessment of vehicle potential risk imposes higher demands on the prediction accuracy of vehicle motion states. To address these 2 issues, this paper proposes a predictive vehicle stability assessment method using 3-dimensional Lyapunov exponents (3D-LEs) for a nonlinear vehicle system. Firstly, a nonlinear 8-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model is constructed for an electric vehicle, aiming to capture the coupling dynamic characteristics and the tire force saturation under extreme conditions. To minimize the simulation-reality disparities, the vehicle parameters are automatically calibrated through Bayesian optimization using field test data. Secondly, to predict the potential risk of vehicle instability precisely, a physics-informed neural network based state prediction module is established for the vehicle stability assessment system. The ordinary differential equations of the vehicle system are integrated into neural networks to obtain physically consistent predictions of vehicle dynamic motion. Finally, the 3D-LEs, encompassing lateral motion, yaw motion, and roll motion, are employed to concurrently evaluate vehicle stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive vehicle stability assessment method accurately evaluates the stability of predicted state sequences, enabling safer and more stable control under extreme conditions.},

By introducing the second-order Runge-Kutta method without complex operation to discretize the continuous-time vessel model, a high-precision discrete-time model is first obtained to ensure the controller design accuracy in discrete-time systems. Then, a novel finite-time discrete position tracking controller is developed by constructing a coordinate transformation to address the underactuating problem of surface vessels and convert position tracking error into expected velocity command. The compound disturbance is estimated and compensated by a high-order finite-time discrete disturbance observer. The current research on large sampling period control faces the shortcoming of adjusting parameters repeatedly to accommodate varying sampling periods while balancing convergence speed. To address it and enhance control system adaptability to large sampling periods while reducing operating losses and communication burdens on the sensing system, a novel adaptive reaching law is proposed based on existence conditions of the discrete-time sliding mode control system. Given this, a discrete-time sliding mode based finite-time velocity tracking controller is proposed to achieve stable velocity tracking over a large sampling period range. Finally, all tracking errors are demonstrated to converge within a finite time to a small region near zero. Two examples of comparative simulations validate the efficacy of the developed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has spurred innovations in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), but it also faces increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. Traditional defense mechanisms often fall short in handling emerging and complex attacks due to the lack of flexibility to adapt to the rapidly evolving IoV environment. An emerging solution is to employ Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to enhance IoV security, which depends on the quality, quantity, and freshness of the threat data used for fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative vehicular threat sharing framework that utilizes vehicular honeypots to gather threat data for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby bolstering IoV security. Local differential privacy is leveraged to safeguard the vehicles’ privacy. Given that vehicles have different privacy preferences that may change over time, it is critical to design an appropriate incentive mechanism to encourage sustainable participation in the dynamic IoV environment. Moreover, since privacy preferences are the private information of the vehicles, an information asymmetry exists between the vehicles and the IDS cloud server. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic contract-based incentive mechanism that considers the dynamically changing privacy preference during long-term participation. The optimal contract is derived to maximize the expected utility of the IDS cloud server. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed dynamic contract based incentive mechanism and validate the effectiveness of the LLM-based threat classification in handling complex threats.},

With the continuous advancement of deep learning techniques, including self-attention mechanisms and graph convolution networks (GCNs), we can better understand the nonlinear relationship of spatio-temporal data. Despite increasing interest in long-series transportation forecasting, there are very few long-term spatio-temporal predictions focused on PBS data. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal attentional graph convolutional network (ST-AGCN) designed to predict demand accurately over a 24-hour horizon, addressing the limitations of existing models and the characteristics of PBS data. The core innovation of our model is the integration of a probabilistic self-attention mechanism (Probsparse self-attention) for predicting long-term temporal dependencies and Chebyshev GCN for extracting complex spatial dependencies within the encoder-decoder framework. This integration significantly reduces computational time. Additionally, we devise a PBS data-based spatial weighting calculation method to generate the spatio-temporal graph, which facilitates capturing more inter-station relationships to improve computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results compared with seven baseline models on real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

In this work we show that resilience can be attained by making use of a system-theoretic property known as disturbance decoupling. We first show how disturbance decoupling is obtained in nominal platooning protocols without attacks: then, in the presence of FDI attacks, we propose compensation strategies that guarantee to recover the nominal performance of the platoon. The proposed compensation strategies can cope with platoons of heterogeneous vehicles and are designed towards string stability. Numerical experiments, also performed in a SUMO-Veins co-simulation environment with different platooning scenarios under FDI attacks, validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols in handling cyber-attacks and platoon heterogeneity.},

Operators of public charging stations need to utilize EV scheduling algorithms that can satisfy charging demands with a minimum number of simultaneous charging sessions. In this paper, we propose EV charging scheduling algorithms that meet the charging demands and deadlines of EV users while minimizing the number of simultaneous charging sessions. An uncertainty-aware deep learning (DL) framework is also used to predict EV arrivals at a charging station. The predicted EV arrivals in turn are used to help the charging operator estimate how many charging sessions to order from the grid. Our DL model not only predicts the mean EV arrival rates but also the upper limits of EV arrivals, which enhances robustness against uncertainty in EV arrivals and helps estimate the maximum charging demand for a given interval. Moreover, to overcome the challenge of insufficient EV charging data for DL models, we construct a synthetic data model that takes into account multiple factors influencing EV arrivals, such as weather, events, weekdays, and weekends. Both online and offline approaches in the design of EV scheduling algorithms are utilized. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of active charging sessions used to serve EV users. We also compare their performance with a baseline algorithm which is an offline optimal algorithm based on a mixed integer linear problem formulation.},

  abstract     = {Detecting cracks is a crucial task to ensure the safety of engineering. However, the complexity of the crack background and the highly uneven pixel ratio between the crack and the background significantly limit the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Therefore, an efficient and innovative algorithm for crack detection is proposed, which utilizes a transformer and a multilevel cross-scale weighted feature fusion module, as well as a progressive transfer learning (TL) strategy. Firstly, in terms of existing algorithms, there are limitations in terms of high leakage and false detection rates, as well as a lack of generalization ability, therefore, a F2N-CrackNet model is proposed, which consists of two efficient feature fusion modules and a Nested Multi-level Attention with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (NMA-ASPP). Secondly, to tackle sparse and unevenly distributed bridge crack data, enhance model detection capabilities, and expedite convergence, a progressive three-stage hybrid TL strategy incorporating across-domain, inter-domain, and inner-domain transferring is proposed, by migrating knowledge from related domains. Finally, to enrich experimental data supporting and validating the proposed model and the transfer learning approach, a new group of experimental data set is offered, comprising hundreds of high-resolution bridge crack images collecting in Shanghai by using a digital camera. Additionally, an efficient human-computer interactive labeling approach combined with morphological processing is devised. Experiments conducted on both open-source and private datasets reveal substantial performance improvements in crack detection achieved by the proposed model and TL strategy. On private data, the model achieves an 81.28% MIoU, exceeding or approaching the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while simultaneously reducing training time by 5–8 seconds per round compared to SOTA. Meanwhile, the performance on multiple sets of open-source data is similarly elevated.},

  abstract     = {A key component to enabling the safe, secure, and efficient operations of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones, is the ability to surveil such vehicles in flight. Remote identification systems (e.g., Remote ID) are designed to serve such purposes, and lay the foundations for denser, more advanced UAS operations. However, given the individualized nature of many commonly-envisioned UAS use cases (e.g., door-to-door package delivery), the design of remote identification systems must consider the trade-offs between surveillance versus consumer privacy. To this end, we present a comprehensive method for first characterizing the surveillance coverage of remote identification systems, then integrating in privacy from the perspective of plausible deniability: Surveillance gaps present opportunities for enhanced trajectory privacy, but too many gaps hinder the original purpose—surveillance and safety—of remote identification systems. We apply our method to realistic urban geographies (San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles) where future UAS operations may perform door-to-door package deliveries between vendors and consumers. We provide ranges for the number of remote identification receivers needed to cover 50-95% of simulated UAS trajectories, then compute a privacy score based on the level of afforded plausible deniability. Our design and analysis framework contribute to the integration of UAS into the future intelligent transportation and smart city landscape, and will be useful for airspace designers, UAS fleet operators, air navigation service providers, and city planners interested in ensuring vehicle safety while considering data usage and an individual’s privacy.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft detection holds significant importance in both civilian and military fields, such as air transportation control and battlefield situational awareness. Deep learning-based methods for aircraft detection can obtain promising detection performance with sufficient and labeled samples. However, current public aircraft datasets are mainly from top-down perspective images, lacking multi-perspectives samples, which limits their applicability. Therefore, we construct a multi-perspectives aircraft dataset (MAD), encompassing 10 distinct classes, and making up of 13,205 images and 18,908 instances. Moreover, the imbalanced and similar classes are common issues in aircraft detection. We design an adaptive threshold focal loss (ATFL) function to alleviate the class imbalance through dynamically adjusting the loss weights between different classes. Meanwhile, the dynamic visual center (DVC) module which can effectively capture both local and global information of target is proposed to distinguish the aircraft classes that share similar feature. Finally, we evaluated several state-of-the-art methods on the constructed MAD dataset as baselines for future research.The experimental results verify that the recognition performance of the current state-of-the-art model can be improved after the application of ATFL and DVC.

  abstract     = {Road transport infrastructure is a crucial component of the entire infrastructural network. Timely and efficient maintenance of roads requires accurate and effective evaluation of pavement health, of which cracking is an important aspect. However, accurately assessing pavement cracks across large-scale road networks remains challenging due to spatial variations, which diminish the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods. This study developed a novel spatial machine learning (SML) model and employed laser scanning data and satellite remote sensing images to assess road segment-based crack severity across the state-level road network in the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. Geocomplexity is introduced to measure the complexity of local patterns and spatial dependence among neighboring road segments. Results showed that SML can accurately and effectively predict pavement cracks on a large spatial scale with an accuracy (AC) from 0.524 to 0.701. In the SMLs, laser-scanning pavement variables contributed 34.15% to 43.33% of the total explainable variations, and geocomplexity variables also contributed significantly, ranging from 27.35% to 49.92%. The SML model exhibited the highest coefficient of determination ( $R^{2}$ ) and AC for crack prediction compared with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The findings provided a deep insight into large-scale crack deterioration by considering the spatial characteristics and achieved high-resolution crack assessment to support road maintenance decision-making. The spatial machine learning approach and the concept of geocomplexity can be widely applied to address large-scale spatial tasks in road engineering.},

Nevertheless, most available solutions face challenges such as limited commercial availability, high infrastructure costs, lack of intelligence, and incomplete coverage for all road users. To address these obstacles and bolster road safety, this manuscript introduces an innovative intelligent crosswalk featuring speed bumps with integrated light signaling, facilitating precise pedestrian detection through artificial intelligence. The design methodology incorporates resins, aggregates, and reinforcing fibers, cold-injected into an aluminum mold. Notably, the system operates autonomously on solar power, ensuring sustainability and robust protection against environmental elements. To validate the crosswalk, quantitative indicators of road safety improvement are compared against a conventional crosswalk and a prior system based on fuzzy logic. A comprehensive ROC analysis of the implemented machine learning techniques revealed an accuracy rate of 99.11% in pedestrian detection, representing a substantial leap forward in road safety. In addition, a study assessing the system’s impact on user behavior found a 46.5% improvement in pedestrian trajectory, along with speed reductions observed for both pedestrians (10.24%) and drivers (32.83% during the day, and 70.6% at night). The study was further completed with an analysis of the opinion of users who perceived a significant improvement in safety and compliance with regulations with the intelligent crosswalk, highlighting the potential of the system to significantly contribute to the enhancement of road safety.},

To address the vital sparse reward problem of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), the trajectory evaluation function of the dynamic window algorithm (DWA) is referred to construct the primary reward strategy, and a secondary incentive reward is constructed based on velocity obstacle (VO) to eliminate potential collision risks. To improve the efficiency of training, the electronic chart (EC) and Unity3D are used to build an immersive simulation platform. Based on it, simulations are made to verify the performance.

The system uses probe vehicle information as well as information from the control logic to enhance the real-time queue length estimates and does not require historical queue data. Through comprehensive simulation experiments involving a single vehicle approaching a traffic signal, as well as simulations of a signalized intersection covering various market penetration levels (MPLs) and varying demand levels, the fuel savings achieved by the ECO-CACC-I system are quantified. The developed queue estimation algorithm provides a significant improvement over the traditional use of shockwave theory alone. In addition, results of the ECO-CACC-I system demonstrate average fuel savings of up to 10.57% and 18.89%, respectively without and with consideration of the queueing process from the perspective of an individual vehicle. Furthermore, an average fuel saving of 16.5% is achieved for the isolated intersection simulations at a 100% MPL. While significant marginal savings are achieved from a single-vehicle perspective when considering the queue, this is not the case for a network-wide perspective, where the consideration of the queue process only results in a 2% overall enhancement in terms of fuel savings.

To address these challenges, we explore the existence and sources of partial observability in ATSC, formulating it within the framework of Markov decision processes. The global ATSC problem is factorized and decoupled to reveal structural properties in underlying system dynamics. This enhanced understanding reveals the dominant information that should be considered by decentralized controllers and guides the derivation of eMARLIN+. Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrates eMARLIN+’s effectiveness in enhancing agent-level coordination and surpassing strong baselines in minimizing travel delay.

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) play pivotal roles in intelligent maritime navigation for the modern maritime industry. Many artificial intelligence maritime applications based on AIS data have dramatically benefited traditional operations and managements in the field of maritime industry, and also provided state-of-the-art predictive analytics for vessel collisions and route optimization. However, the problem of modeling the interactions of vessels in complex waters still needs to be adequately addressed. In this paper, we focus on using spatiotemporal AIS data to model and forecast multiple vessel trajectories amid dynamic interaction patterns, and we propose a forecast model based on a novel neural network, namely a spatiotemporal multi-graph fusion network (STMGF-Net). The innovative STMGF-Net comprises three crucial modules. First, a Spatiotemporal graph construction module generates interaction graphs of various navigation modes, such as motions, risks, and attributes of vessels, Second, a multi-mode fusion module embeds and fuses the above interaction graphs into STMGF-Net. Finally, squeeze-and-excitation and temporal convolutional networks are introduced as Squeeze-and-excitation temporal convolutional modules to enhance the overall efficiency of the model significantly. Overall, the STMGF-Net can recognize complex spatiotemporal interaction patterns among neighboring vessels so as to capture and integrate these interaction features for achieving high-precision prediction performance in intelligent maritime navigation. In numerical experiments, three water areas of Zhoushan Islands, Yangshan Waters, and Yangtze River Waters are used as training and testing datasets. The results show that STMGF-Net improved prediction errors of average and final distance with increase of 49.637% and 50.622% than classic and state-of-art graph neural networks.},

  abstract     = {With the booming adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) globally, the need for reliable and resilient EV Charging Monitoring (EVCM) systems has become crucial. A major challenge in real-time EVCM is the handling of missing data caused by unexpected events, which can impair both real-time monitoring and its downstream applications. To address this vital yet underexplored issue, we propose a curriculum guided multi-feature fusion transformer (CurriFusFormer) learning framework – a novel approach designed to enhance the resilience of EVCM systems against real-time information omissions. Our framework integrates curriculum learning with a multi-feature fusion transformer model, capable of handling various patterns and rates of missing data, ranging from random to block omissions. This innovative approach leverages spatial, temporal, and static features to generate accurate real-time estimations for missing values in diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on a real-world EVCM dataset demonstrate that CurriFusFormer can perform well with $R^{2}$ ranging from 0.92 to 0.83 given the rising missing rate from 30-90%, outperforming seven popular and state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with high missing rates and complex patterns, such as, at 90% missing rate, kNN ( $R^{2} =0.65$ ), XGBoost ( $R^{2} =0.78$ ), BRITS ( $R^{2} =0.79$ ), TFT ( $R^{2} =0.80$ ), and GRIN ( $R^{2} =0.82$ ).

Due to the high velocities and few landmarks, robust deconfliction relies on precise positioning and synchronization. However, intentional spoofing attacks aimed at inducing navigation conflicts threaten the reliability of conventional techniques. Here, we address these concerns by establishing a baseline on the impact of novel conflict-inducing spoofing attacks on existing geometric navigation methods. Based on the impact of the attacks on the navigation, reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to counter the effects of spoofing attacks. In order to counter the effect of spoofing in randomized dynamic airspace conditions, a zero-sum action-robust (ZSAR) RL based on mixed Nash equilibrium objective is used. The proposed methodology yields an improved number of conflict-free paths while reducing average conflicts compared to existing state of the art RL strategies, thus making it suitable for deploying autonomous aircrafts.},

  abstract     = {Collision avoidance systems that utilize both steering and braking have been widely studied. However, information about the tire-road friction coefficient, which plays a critical role in collision avoidance, is assumed to be a known constant value in many studies. Because of this, it is difficult to properly respond to changes in road surface conditions that commonly occur in practice. In this paper, a collision avoidance system that estimates and applies the tire-road friction coefficient in real-time is proposed to overcome these limitations. First, a path planner and tracking controller are designed. It applies friction coefficient changes to the algorithm and provides prompt feedback of the updated vehicle state variables. Next, a friction coefficient estimator is proposed that enables rapid and highly accurate estimation in a short period of time, even in collision avoidance situations where sufficient excitation required for estimation may not be continuously achieved for a long time. Finally, by integrating the collision avoidance system and the friction coefficient estimator, the estimated tire-road friction coefficient is applied to the collision avoidance system in real-time, and the reactions are used to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient again. This demonstrates the excellent collision avoidance performance despite changes in road friction and also proves the virtuous cycle interaction of the integrated system.},

  abstract     = {As a promising battery-sharing service, battery swapping has become one of the most important electric-scooter (called e-scooter) energy refueling mechanisms. However, by analyzing a battery swapping dataset of 108,574 e-scooter drivers and 41,358 batteries and surveying 224 of these drivers, we find that drivers are facing insufficient energy replenishment during the battery swapping process, i.e., swapping out an undercharged battery from the battery swapping station. To identify the root cause, we perform a data-driven analysis and reveal an imbalance in spatial and temporal swapping behavior patterns, which causes a significant decrease in battery charging time. Inspired by these findings, we design iSwap, a novel spatio-temporal battery swapping recommendation system, which improves drivers’ swapping experience by proactively coordinating spatio-temporal unbalanced behavior patterns. iSwap considers not only drivers’ individual temporal preference for swapping time recommendation (i.e., when to swap) but also the complex mutual influence among drivers for swapping station recommendation (i.e., where to swap). To perform the two tasks efficiently, we propose a swapping behavior-aware phase demand balancing schema and a submodularity-based near-optimal swapping station recommendation algorithm. Finally, through the evaluation, iSwap improves the probability of swapping out a fully charged battery by 42.1% and driver satisfaction by 16.8% compared to the ground truth.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) have shown remarkable performance in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), especially for the traffic object detection. However, as the ITS is applied to a wider range of traffic scenarios, the increasing demand for the trade-off between detection performance and power resources has become inevitable. A biologically interpretable spike-driven traffic object detector for challenging scenarios is proposed in this paper, named SpikeTOD, achieving the trade-off between the accuracy and power consumption. Firstly, the spike neural network (SNN) is employed to realize energy-efficient object detection in traffic scenarios. And a local modulation-based integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron is designed, which provides an efficient way to convert the traffic detection model from ANN to SNN. Secondly, a biology-inspired detail-guided context-aware network (DCNet) is proposed to improve the detection performance. The integration of detail coherence and global priors is leveraged to selectively emphasize object features and improve the detection capabilities within challenging conditions. As far as we know, this is the first application of SNN in traffic object detection tasks. SpikeTOD achieved a mAP@50 of 46.11% on the BDD100K dataset with a power consumption of 4.73E-03J, demonstrating a more efficient trade-off in detection accuracy and power consumption. Notably, SpikeTOD maintained an average missed detection rate of 44.56%, further contributing to its overall efficacy in traffic object detection. Further, we conducted on road test by deploying SpikeTOD on Jetson Xavier NX and Loihi to demonstrate that model achieves a better balance between accuracy and power consumption.},

  abstract     = {Customized bus is considered an effective means to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce traffic-related environmental pollution caused by the increasing number of private cars. Exploring potential passenger information as the first stage of customized bus service has become a popular topic. Unlike manual investigation and passenger request methods, current studies utilize data mining methods to actively explore potential passengers from various historical travel data. However, the existing data mining methods only consider the spatiotemporal features of potential passengers and neglect the semantic features related to customized bus services, which play an important role in determining whether passengers are willing to use services. In this paper, we treated the exploration of potential customized bus passengers as a binary classification problem based on private car trajectory data. Then, we propose a novel data mining method, named iTrAdaboost-DTCN, which combines the strengths of deep learning and transfer learning. In detail, it integrates state-of-the-art deep neural networks by constructing a deep trajectory classification network (DTCN), which can automatically extract semantic feature representations to help improve classification accuracy. Due to the lack of city-wide labeled customized bus passenger information in practice, it also integrates instance-based transfer learning through improved TrAdaboost, which solves the learning problem of the target classification domain with limited labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can explore potential passengers more effectively than other baseline methods. Furthermore, we apply our method to real-world scenarios and compare three travel characteristics of identified customized and non-customized bus passengers.},

At each choice dimension, players are involved in a typical congestion game. This game has a feature that the output of one choice dimension serves as an input of another one, and the costs paid by players in different choice dimensions are interdependent. Focusing on the joint congestion game with destination and route choices (i.e., select which destination and which route to complete a trip), we show the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium under mild assumptions in a nonatomic game setting. Then we investigate the property of the general quantal response equilibrium (QRE) for the joint congestion game in which players have perception errors of their costs (characterized by a probabilistic distribution). The QRE condition for the joint congestion game is further extended to the case where the analyst has only incomplete information about players’ perceived costs. A specific cross moment QRE model using the mean and covariance information is accordingly developed to account for both the analyst’s and players’ imperfect information/perception. We present an equivalent convex program that promises a unique solution for the cross moment QRE model, and provide a polynomial algorithm to solve it. Numerical results illustrate the features of the developed model for the joint congestion game and demonstrate the efficiency of the solution algorithm on two realistic transportation networks.},

  abstract     = {Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) is a crucial technology in intelligent vehicles that relies on either explicit or implicit representations. Explicit methods are prevalent in real-time systems, offer precise geometric control, and are easy to visualize. However, they struggle with complex, dynamic environments and require high storage capacity. On the other hand, implicit techniques excel in handling intricate, changing shapes due to their compact representation and inference ability while requiring more complex display and rendering processes. A combination of both types of representations could significantly enhance the performance of VSLAM, but the cross-data association method for standalone explicit and implicit representations is still lacking. To this end, this paper proposes a data association scheme that bridges the gap between explicit and implicit representations by individually modeling the uncertainties in each representation. Our approach features a multi-level feature selection process tailored for data association. It initially extracts coarse-level features during explicit representation generation based on Bayesian estimation and refines them using the implicit representation based on ray sampling, which enhances robustness while reducing rendering costs. We rigorously evaluated our proposed methodology against current state-of-the-art approaches using public datasets and real robot scenes. The results show that our coarse-to-fine feature selection method outperforms existing techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively, suggesting its potential to significantly boost the contemporary VSLAM system performance.},

However, the lack of global information and time-varying nature of VEC networks present challenges to make effective resource allocation decisions under long-term constraints. Motivated by this, we aim to investigate a dynamic resource allocation scheme with diverse tasks. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize average task delay under long-term constraints of energy consumption and system cost for cloud-edge collaboration offloading. For the coupling of resource allocation decisions between different time slots, we propose a Lyapunov online resource allocation (LORA) algorithm. LORA transforms the formulated problem into a problem of minimizing the upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty function. We then decompose the latter into multiple subproblems and provide the corresponding algorithms for solving them separately. Experimental results show that our proposed LORA reduces energy consumption and system cost by 10.1% and 4.2%, respectively, compared to DO, and reduces average task delay by 15.1% compared to ECSCO.},

  abstract     = {Real-time and efficient prediction of plausible trajectories of surrounding traffic agents is essential for autonomous driving. In reality, the motion of agents depends not only on their goal intents, but is also constrained by road topology. Especially for vehicles, lane geometry can significantly influence their future trajectories. In this paper, the constraining and guiding roles of lane networks are investigated, and a novel vehicle trajectory prediction model based on the goal lane segment is proposed. Specifically, a Dual-Stream Cross Attention Module (DSCAM) is developed that incorporates goal lane segment prediction into the process of collecting various interaction information. This achieves scene-consistent predictions while reducing resource consumption and inference latency. Then, learnable refinement tokens are used to adaptively refine coarse-grained trajectories during the feature decoding process, with the goal of improving prediction accuracy and ensuring temporal consistency. Extensive experiments with the Argoverse-1 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our model performs competitively and well-balanced. Notably, on the nuScenes, our model with only 0.44 million (M) parameters has an inference latency of less than six milliseconds (ms), making it ideal for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that require high computational resources, operational efficiency, and prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) is an essential technology that enables vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) to protect against malicious intrusions. CIDS, however, is unable to prevent accidents if an anomalous vehicle is detected. Detecting anomalies and notifying vehicles in the VANET rapidly is thus essential, considering technical challenges such as communication efficiency, vehicle velocity and privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer privacy-aware trust evaluation CIDS framework, termed 2PT-CIDS, tailored to VANET. In 2PT-CIDS, vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cooperate efficiently to enhance anomalous vehicle detection and notification. Considering its potential privacy leakage, we then present two types of game-theoretic information incentive mechanisms. In the case of traffic congestion, the privacy-aware incentive mechanism is presented based on the Stackelberg game. A Barycentric Lagrange interpolation (BLI) based algorithm is then proposed to speedy achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE). In the case of traffic smooth, the varying high velocities of vehicles are involved and a noncooperative game-based mechanism is proposed. The optimal NE decision selection is reconstructed as a Markov decision process (MDP) and the NE point is obtained via the designed novel reward-shaping double duelling deep Q network (D3QN) learning algorithm. Simulation results highlight the superiority of 2PT-CIDS over existing CIDS and potential application algorithms for VANET, effectively enhancing anomaly detection and notification considering communication cost and vehicle privacy.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of the modern transportation era, road design needs to emphasize landscape and recreational functions more than traditional safety functions. However, quantifying drivers’ subjective perceptions and the objective visual landscape characteristics that influence them remains challenging due to the subjectivity of landscape perception, and the limitation of data size and the complexity of environmental information capture. This paper aims to overcome these limitations, based on deep learning techniques to achieve high-precision automatic identification and rapid processing of spatial visual elements in the highway landscape. Based on supervised fully connected neural networks, the ELO scoring algorithm, and ArcGIS, it realizes the quantitative evaluation of subjective perception emotions and visual mapping representation. Furthermore, the paper integrates optimization algorithms with deep learning, employing a Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) enhanced XGBoost regression model to analyze the interplay between spatial features and subjective experiences. The model’s effectiveness is confirmed through comparative experiments and SHAP analysis, offering insights into the coupling of subjective and objective data. The research results provide theoretical methods and quantitative analysis tools for the digitalization and refinement of highway landscape design, and also help researchers and urban planners to understand the interaction between subjective perception and objective semantics, providing new ways and insights for highway landscape planning and design.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be employed as short-term aerial base stations or as access points for User Equipments (UEs) to communicate with other UEs effectively. However, communication links may be obstructed by buildings, leading to poor data transfer performance and significant energy consumption. Deploying Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) as part of the UAV-assisted communication system proves to be an effective means to avoid building obstructions and enhance wireless information quality. However, the complexity of communication relationships in multi-UAV systems with RIS-aided communication poses a significant challenge in energy reduction. Therefore, this study investigates a new RIS-aided multi-UAV communication framework for edge computing systems. The system aims to meet the quality-of-service (QoS) for UEs while minimizing the total energy consumption. To optimize the total energy consumption of RIS-aided multi-UAV communication, the impact of communication between multiple UAVs and differences between UE clusters on that system’s performance is also considered. We introduce a Stackelberg game to deal with the communication relationship between multiple UAVs and design a K-means-based clustering algorithm to segment UEs periodically. A model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm grounded in maximum entropy is proposed to jointly optimize UAV trajectory design, phase shift control, and power allocation to reduce energy consumption further. Experimental results indicate that the system proposed performs favorably concerning both energy consumption and throughput.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation in driving scenarios is important for modern autonomous driving technology. While the existing methods have shown promising results in segmenting normal-condition images, their performance in adverse scenes remains unsatisfactory due to limited visual field and lack of annotation. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation method with the transformer architecture, namely ACSegFormer, for driving-scene adverse conditions, aiming at mining image features in visually restricted scenes. Three effective training strategies are proposed in ACSegFormer to learn the latent image context relations and to reduce the gaps between different domains: an entropy-based pseudo label correction scheme that refines the target domain predictions with the normal reference predictions, an optimal transport-based inter-domain alignment module that performs domain alignment on the outputs of transformer encoder, and a masked context learning module that enhances the model’s ability to perceive the missing information of target domain image. Our ACSegFormer has no additional training parameters on top of the existing transformer segmentation framework, which can be easily used for self-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. The experimental results show that our ACSegFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on driving-scene segmentation benchmarks in adverse conditions, including Dark Zurich and ACDC.

To overcome the drawbacks of the existing graph/network-based train delay propagation models, we introduce three timetable-based parameters to enable the proposed BN structure, called context-aware BN (CBN), to recognize the context information in train operations. In addition, the model is established based on updating time horizons (multiple updating time horizons forming the prediction horizon), capable of performing uncertainty quantification and prediction in flexible horizons (i.e., from 5 minutes to 1 hour ahead). The CBN model is calibrated on the train operation data from the Swiss railway network. Experimental results show that the context parameters improve the accuracy and lower the variance of the model, compared to the standard models without considering the timetable parameters. The uncertainties of train operations in a range of prediction horizons were quantified using the CBN model. The results demonstrate that the uncertainty grows near-linearly with the increase of prediction horizon; specifically, long-distance trains exhibit significantly higher uncertainty than short-distance trains. Finally, the CBN was built on a network model, maintaining the interpretability and easy-understanding quality of train delay propagation models.},

Such a public network is open to various security risks. Overall, protecting personal information on VANET is a vital responsibility. The integration of fog computing and VANETs has gained significant importance in recent years, driven by advancements in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and intelligent transportation systems. However, ensuring secure communication in fog-based VANETs remains a major challenge. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel authenticated key agreement protocol that achieves mutual authentication, generates a secure session key for secret communication, and provides privacy protection without the use of bilinear pairing. We rigorously prove the security of our proposed protocol, which is designed specifically for fog-based VANETs, and has been shown to meet their stringent security requirements. Moreover, we performed formal and informal analysis that shows our proposed protocol is highly efficient,our protocol’s computational and communication overhead are lower than those of other relevant protocols by 45.570% and 29.432%, respectively. Finally we use NS-3 simulation to prove that our proposed algorithm is a practical and scalable solution for secure communication in fog-based VANETs.},

Insecure wireless communication used for these applications is vulnerable to many attacks and it can endanger lives, create traffic congestion, and compromise privacy of the users. A robust authentication and key establishment mechanism can prevent security attacks, and also provide additional security features. In this paper, a novel, smart card-based, robust mutual authentication protocol namely VAuth for VANET is proposed. This scheme enables secure communication among entities while also preserving the anonymity and privacy of the users. To preserve unlinkability, VAuth uses pseudo-names, one-time secrets, and verification tokens. Correctness and security goals of the proposed protocol are proved using the formal method BAN logic and the automated tool Scyther respectively. A comparison of the scheme considering communication cost, computation cost, security functionalities, and storage cost is presented.

However, it is challenging to apply centralized framework to meet the rigorous requirements of intelligent services in VANETs, such as ultra-low latency, high security and reliability. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving deep learning scheme named FEDL, which is built on a decentralized framework (abbreviated as EDVAN). This customized EDVAN structure decomposes computing tasks into each edge computing node equally. By combining the Voronoi diagram the network communication delay and overhead are alleviated tremendously. Furthermore, the FEDL scheme utilizes functional encryption to establish secure data communication and drop-allowance parameter aggregation module, achieving to resist inference attacks and eliminate the straggler effect. Finally, we apply the NS-3 simulator to simulate EDVAN’s communication environment. Three real traffic datasets are utilized to show the FEDL model is accurate lossless and efficient.

  abstract     = {This paper presents systematic experimental and related analytical studies for the accurate channel modeling of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) radio channels in mountainous plateau environments (MPEs) at the 376MHz band which is allocated for emergency communications. The measurement campaign has been conducted in the Ailao Mountains (Yunnan Province of China) and the influence of this mountainous environment on the radio channel characteristics in the power domain has been thoroughly investigated. The time-varying characteristics of the measured V2V radio channels have identified the stationarity time based on the local scattering function as a prerequisite for accurate modeling. Furthermore, Akaike’s information criteria and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests have revealed that the Weibull probability distribution function is the best fit for the measured data. With the Weibull shaping parameter, the line of sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) channels can be conveniently and accurately classified. As large variations of the LOS probability and the shape parameter over long communication distances and LOS/NLOS conditions have been observed, an analytical approach using a 3rd order sum of sinusoid functions has been used to model them. Through this model, the maximum distance for LOS communications has been derived directly from the measured data. The large-scale propagation properties, including path loss, shadow fading, and shadow fading correlation, have been thoroughly studied, and accurate path loss models specifically for the MPEs have been proposed. Moreover, a new shadow fading correlation model has been presented. Compared to previously known models, this model is more accurate and more suitable for long-distance emergency communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative perception is an effective way for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to surpass their sensing limitations, by sharing information like intermediate features extracted from images or point clouds with each other. To reduce bandwidth consumption, feature filtering is adopted by existing methods to share only the most valuable information. However, these methods assume that the features on the same channel across all spatial regions or those in the same spatial regions across all the channels are equally important. This assumption results in coarse-grained feature filtering, which greatly decreases the cooperative perception performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fine-grained channel-spatial feature filtering scheme, named SwissCheese, for communication-efficient cooperative perception. The key idea of SwissCheese is to exploit the disparity in semantic information on features between different spatial regions on different channels. Specifically, a fine-grained collaborative attention module is developed to jointly learn fine-grained attention along the channel-spatial dimensions. Moreover, a dual-dimensional feature selection strategy that selects sparse features for transmission based on the current available bandwidth is designed to achieve optimal perception performance. Experiment results show that SwissCheese significantly reduces the transmission data size by 90% with a subtle loss in perception performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate anticipation of pedestrian crossing intentions is critical for preventing pedestrian-vehicle conflicts and ensuring road safety. This issue is a significant focus in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving. However, current approaches often face challenges, such as high computational costs due to complex scene understanding and inadequate consideration of spatiotemporal dependencies in pedestrian actions. To handle these challenges, we propose RAIDN (real-time action-interaction dual-branch network), which comprises the pedestrian action encoding and traffic-object interaction modules to anticipate pedestrian crossing intentions in real time. The pedestrian action encoding module employs a multi-scale graph transformer, efficiently extracting the intrinsic topology of long- and short-term action variations. This module effectively addresses issues of information redundancy in multi-channel graph convolution networks and local limitations in multi-scale temporal convolutions. Subsequently, the traffic-object interaction module introduces an interaction relation graph convolution network to excavate relevant traffic-object interactions, thereby shortening the prolonged scene semantic inference. Finally, global average pooling and attention layers fuse the action and interaction cues for real-time intention anticipation. The effectiveness of RAIDN has been validated on public datasets JAAD and PIE, achieving competitive metrics with Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall rates of 0.89/0.92, 0.80/0.89, 0.66/0.85, 0.65/0.82, and 0.72/0.89 respectively. Notably, RAIDN demonstrates a remarkable inference time of just 0.28ms, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods and establishing its suitability for real-time applications in intelligent transportation and autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {The demand for high-precision navigation and positioning is growing rapidly with the advancements in autonomous driving and intelligent robotics. Nowadays, many studies have been conducted on the fusion of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation systems (INS), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) because of their complementary characteristics. Notably, in multi-source fusion, it is crucial to precisely model the uncertainty (covariance) of each sensor. While GNSS and IMU covariance modeling are mature, LiDAR covariance modeling remains unsophisticated, resulting in a suboptimal fusion of GNSS/INS/LiDAR. In this work, the LiDAR covariance modeling method is proposed, including the original point cloud covariance, the localmap covariance, and the observation covariance modeling. A point cloud selecting approach based on the eigenvectors and centroids is also introduced to maintain valid surface and edge feature points, thereby reducing repeated observations. These above methods are applied to the tightly coupled RTK/INS/LiDAR_PPL (G+I+PPL) system based on the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) to further improve positioning accuracy and covariance consistency. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better covariance consistency in comparison to LIOSAM and FASTLIO. Meanwhile, G+I+PPL with fused point-to-plane/line (PPL) observations outperforms compared to RTK/INS (G+I) and RTK/INS/LiDAR_CP (G+I+CP) using closest point (CP) observations, in the right, front, and up (RFU) directions, demonstrating a positioning improvement in performance by (50.7%, 58.6%, 54.3%) and (46.2%, 55.0%, 58.8%), respectively.},

  abstract     = {Prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) has been widely used to learn class-wise domain-invariant features for domain generalization semantic segmentation. These methods assume that the prototypes in different domains are invariant. However, the prototypes in different domains have discrepancies as well. First, the prototypes of the same class in different domains may be different. Second, the prototypes of different classes may be similar. To address these issues, a calibration-based multi-prototype contrastive learning (CMPCL) approach is proposed, which contains an uncertainty-guided multi-prototype contrastive learning (UMPCL) and a hard-weighted multi-prototype contrastive learning (HMPCL). Specifically, the UMPCL uses an uncertainty probability matrix, derived from element-wise discrepancies between the prototypes of the same class, to calibrate the weights of prototypes for alleviating the discrepancy between the prototypes of the same class in different domains. The HMPCL uses a hard-weighted matrix that is generated by the similarity between the prototypes of different classes, to calibrate the weights of the hard-aligned prototypes for alleviating the issue of similar prototypes between different classes, with hard-aligned prototypes referring to those exhibiting such similarity. Furthermore, since the learned class-wise domain-invariant features may overfit the prototype in the source domain, multi-prototype contrastive learning is used in the UMPCL and HMPCL to avoid this risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance over current approaches on multiple benchmarks of domain generalization semantic segmentation.

  abstract     = {Traditional conflict analysis methods, relying on the assumption of constant velocity, often fall short in capturing the dynamic nature of driver behavior randomness during the interaction process. Predicting all potential collision trajectories proves crucial for comprehensive safety analysis. To address the challenge of accounting for trajectory randomness in car-following scenarios, this study introduces a noise-enhanced generative adversarial network, named Car-Following GAN, designed for predicting collision trajectories based on data from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS). The model employs an encoder-decoder framework, integrating a noise enhancement module to capture the intrinsic randomness of driving patterns. Demonstrating notable robustness across varying environmental conditions, our model showcases adaptability for trajectory prediction in diverse driving scenarios. A conflict measure, termed the Rear-end Collision Risk Index based on Car-Following GAN (RCRIC), is proposed to quantify the risk of a rear-end collision. Our approach conducts a comprehensive case analysis to assess the impact of various traffic risk factors on RCRIC. The results underscore that our noise-enhanced approach significantly improves the trajectory prediction accuracy of the model when compared to other noise addition methods. This enhancement is observed across various prediction time windows and under different weather conditions. Moreover, RCRIC, derived from the model employing our noise-enhanced approach, effectively mirrors the dynamics of rear-end collision risk by explicitly incorporating trajectory randomness into its assessment. Furthermore, the findings underscore the significant influence of light conditions, traffic density, and weather conditions on driving risk.},

  abstract     = {In recent research, clustering algorithms have been utilized to analyze smart card travel patterns. However, these methods often struggle due to the need for a predetermined number of clusters and the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality. To address these issues and improve travel pattern recognition from smart-card transactions, a new framework has been proposed. This framework uses autoencoders to extract low-dimensional representations from transactions and an ensemble of deep clustering models to identify patterns. Additionally, it compares geodetic and network distances between stations for feature extraction. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to automatically determine the number of clusters and effectively mitigate overfitting using the Sharon index based on Rademacher complexity. When applied to the London metro smart card benchmark with more than 10,000 samples, the framework identified 7 clusters of travel patterns, compared to 3 clusters by baseline methods. Each cluster corresponds to a specific day of the week, uncovering distinct travel behaviors across the week. Furthermore, within each cluster, the framework detected three daily sub-patterns: morning peak, midday, and evening peak. This resulted in 21 unique travel patterns, allowing a detailed analysis of both weekday and weekend travel dynamics. These findings were validated using the Davies-Bouldin, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz indices. The impact of the starting time for daily services has also been analyzed, showing that daily travel patterns are highly sensitive to this parameter.},

In this paper, a fault-tolerant prescribed performance control approach is put forward to solve the problem. It achieves DP with the prescribed speed and accuracy in the sense that the DP errors evolve within the preselected performance envelops whenever the sensor faults happen. It is also inherently robust against the unknown vessel dynamics and ocean disturbances. Thus, the common assumptions on the partially known vessel nonlinearities and the differentiable disturbances are eliminated. On the other hand, there is no need for disturbance estimation, parameter identification, function approximation, fault detection, fault isolation or fault estimation, yielding a control simplicity. Finally, a pair of comparative simulations on Cybership II are carried out to validate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation benchmarks in the realm of autonomous driving are dominated by large pre-trained transformers, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational costs and prolonged training durations. To lift this constraint, we look at efficient semantic segmentation from a perspective of comprehensive knowledge distillation and aim to bridge the gap between multi-source knowledge extractions and transformer-specific patch embeddings. We put forward the Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation (TransKD) framework which learns compact student transformers by distilling both feature maps and patch embeddings of large teacher transformers, bypassing the long pre-training process and reducing the FLOPs by &gt;85.0%. Specifically, we propose two fundamental modules to realize feature map distillation and patch embedding distillation, respectively: 1) Cross Selective Fusion (CSF) enables knowledge transfer between cross-stage features via channel attention and feature map distillation within hierarchical transformers; 2) Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) performs dimensional transformation within the patchifying process to facilitate the patch embedding distillation. Furthermore, we introduce two optimization modules to enhance the patch embedding distillation from different perspectives: 1) Global-Local Context Mixer (GL-Mixer) extracts both global and local information of a representative embedding; 2) Embedding Assistant (EA) acts as an embedding method to seamlessly bridge teacher and student models with the teacher’s number of channels. Experiments on Cityscapes, ACDC, NYUv2, and Pascal VOC2012 datasets show that TransKD outperforms state-of-the-art distillation frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method.

Then, the joint robust design of subcarrier groups, beamforming vectors, and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS is formulated as a stochastic bi-objective optimization problem to maximize expected localization and communication metrics. Due to the nonlinearity of the multi-objective function and the coupling between optimizing variables, the resulting problem is highly non-convex. Accordingly, we transform the expected achievable rate into an analytical form and further develop a novel unified successive convex approximation (U-SCA)-based iterative algorithm to obtain a robust resource allocation strategy. In particular, we derive closed-form solutions of beamforming vectors and the phase-shift matrix of RIS to decrease the computational complexity. In addition, we also analyse the convergence of the proposed U-SCA-based algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.},

Hence, we introduce an innovative multi-information integrated navigation approach that leverages visual semantics in conjunction with a lightweight high-definition (LHD) map for absolute position refinement. This method enhances the navigation solution by integrating a vehicle-mounted GNSS/INS system with the precise localization capabilities of road semantics, such as lane lines and poles, through camera vision. We establish a comprehensive road semantic measurement model in the pixel frame to directly use raw pixel data for a tightly coupled integration process. Additionally, we examine the distinct contributions of lane lines and poles to the estimation of navigation error states using a simplified measurement model. Field tests with land vehicles demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method and show that the longitudinal and lateral positioning errors decrease to 0.43 meters and approximately 0.27 meters, which are significant enhancements due to road semantic cues.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) platoon is regarded as a promising means of improving traffic efficiency and safety. This study focuses on addressing a Multi-Vehicle Motion Planning (MVMP) problem for CAVs aiming to form a platoon in the mixed traffic flow with both CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV), which utilizes the cooperative capabilities of the multi-vehicle queue. Generally, the MVMP problem would be formulated into a centralized form, which is numerically intractable due to the computational complexity. In addition, the uncertainty of human drivers’ behavior in mixed traffic presents a challenge in motion planning for multiple CAVs simultaneously. To overcome these issues, we propose a decentralized MVMP framework based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, which splits the MVMP problem into a series of lane change tasks. The MCTS algorithm is applied to determine an optimal lane change decision, facilitating the advancement of platoon formation based on the current vehicle state. Subsequently, we establish both the longitudinal position adjustment model and the lane change motion planning model to efficiently execute the lane change maneuver, as well as taking into account some evaluation factors such as safety, rapidity, and comfort. Finally, we develop a simulation platform using SUMO and MATLAB to simulate a three-lane freeway with mixed traffic. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can efficiently organize individual CAVs in the three lanes into a platoon under 20 scenarios including multiple traffic demands and CAV ratios. Furthermore, compared to the existing methods, the proposed approach achieves a better performance in terms of platooning proportion, time consumption, and time delay.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) are consistently criticized for their inadequacies in harmoniously interacting with human-driven vehicles (HV), primarily attributed to the lack of sociality, a key human trait that balances individual and group rewards. Understanding sociality is essential for smooth AV navigation but remains challenging. To address this, we propose a Game-Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GT-IRL) approach to quantify individualized sociality in driving interaction. Our approach identifies the sociality-preference parameters of a pre-designed reward function that integrates the ego agent’s rewards and the group rewards shared by all the interacting agents. Instead of presuming an agent is propelled by the maximization of its own rewards, the game-theoretical mechanism is utilized within the IRL structure to capture the fact that human drivers take into account others’ interests. We validated our method using human driving data from an unprotected left-turn scenario. The results demonstrate that the proposed GT-IRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in better reproducing the evolution of the left-turn interaction at both semantic and trajectory levels. Additionally, cross-dataset analysis reveals variations in sociality due to geographical differences (China vs. the U.S.) and the nature of the interacting entities (AV vs. HV or HV vs. HV).},

  abstract     = {Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage casual inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport’s delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Conventional traffic prediction relies on complete observation data. However, data missing is common in cities due to equipment failure, network interruption, etc., which poses a huge obstacle to traffic prediction. In this paper, we design a novel Spatiotemporal Ego-graph Domain Adaptation framework (SEDA) to predict traffic state in data missing scenarios. Based on the multi-dimensional topological information of local network (ego-graph), isomorphic ego-graphs are aligned across the missing data in target domain and the external data in source domain to obtain alternative data. Furthermore, a Dual-branch Cross reCoupling method (DCC) is proposed to reconstruct missing features according to the alternative data. Experimental results on real public datasets with 10%-40% missing show that SEDA averagely outperforms both the state-of-the-art knowledge transfer-based prediction baselines and the incomplete data prediction baselines by more than 0.45% and 0.86%. Ablation experiments and visualization analysis further demonstrate the effectiveness of SEDA components.},

The framework comprises of two modules: the data augmentation module and the anomaly detection module. The data augmentation module designs multiple alternative generative adversarial networks for sample augmentation. To achieve the end-to-end classification, the anomaly detection module improves the residual network by creating a deep residual shrinkage network with self-attention (DRSN-SA). An online monitoring system was installed and operated continuously for several years on a high-speed turnout of a continuous beam bridge to validate the proposed framework. The collected data includes displacement, stress, and temperature. The proposed framework has demonstrated excellent performance, generalizability, and deployability through sufficient model comparison.

Many video anomaly detection methods have been introduced in traffic scenarios, and they have achieved some promising results. However, there still exists a large room for improving the traffic anomaly detection performance. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach, the Dual-Stream Anomaly Detection Network (DS-ADN), specialized for traffic anomaly detection. DS-ADN introduces optical flow data and utilizes inter-flow information interaction coupled with the Multi-Scale Attention Fusion Module (MSA-FM) to comprehensively merge RGB and optical flow data. It features an innovative depth-based prediction loss function that adapts to the vehicle’s regular shape and events at different distances under the surveillance camera. This adaptation occurs through block-wise average pooling and weighted allocation across varying depths. Considering the prevalent issues of datasets dedicated to traffic anomaly detection generally containing a single type of anomaly, this paper introduces the Traffic Surveillance Dataset (TSD) containing multiple anomalies for model validation. Extensive experiments on the TSD dataset highlight the better performance of our DS-ADN, manifesting an AUC gain of over 8.8% compared to other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, DS-ADN achieves competitive performance across three widely-used anomaly detection datasets that contain multiple anomalies, including UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, demonstrating its generalization ability.},

This paper is the first to compare and assess different distributed model predictive control (MPC) approaches, i.e., cooperative distributed MPC, serial distributed MPC, and decentralized MPC, for virtually coupled trains with a nonlinear train dynamic model. To make a balanced trade-off between computational complexity and efficiency, we also propose and assess convex approximations of the above control approaches. Furthermore, we are the first to introduce the relaxed dynamic programming approach to analyze the stability of the MPC-based nonlinear train control problem. By using the relaxed dynamic programming approach, a distributed stopping criterion with a stability guarantee is developed for the cooperative distributed MPC approach. In real life, masses of trains are different and can change at stations due to changes in passenger loads. This change in mass can significantly affect the dynamics and control of the virtually coupled trains when not taken into account in the control design. Therefore, we explicitly consider heterogeneous train masses when designing MPC approaches. We evaluate the different distributed MPC approaches through case studies based on the data of the Beijing Yizhuang Line. Simulation results indicate that the cooperative distributed MPC approach has the best tracking performance, while the serial distributed MPC approach can reduce communication requirements and computation capabilities with sacrifices of tracking performance.},

As a sub-module within autonomous driving, research in traffic sign detection and recognition has significantly advanced with a growing focus on utilizing deep learning methods. Nevertheless, in complex real-world road scenarios, traffic signs often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, with the majority of instances concentrated in a few frequent categories and a scarcity in the remaining ones. Considering conventional Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition methods are crafted using manually curated datasets, the class imbalance may detrimentally impact the efficacy of the detection model. In this paper, we first propose a gradient-guided loss reweighting model that dynamically reweights the loss for positive and negative samples based on the cumulative gradients across each category. Additionally, a classification bias-based refinement module is proposed to fine-tune these weights during training, based on the false positive and false negative rate. This serves to suppress a drop in precision for tail categories resulting from the gradient-guided loss reweighting module, thus further balancing the entire training process for improved results.

This enables distributed agents to learn a globally optimal low-carbon control strategy in a cooperative and adaptive manner.

  abstract     = {Void underneath a slab is a common damage type in airport cement concrete pavement. Existing methods mainly use ground penetrating radar (GPR) images and deep learning to detect the voids but face two problems: inherent limitation of image-wise deep learning and imperfect GPR datasets. This study has proposed a signal-wise cascade deep network (SWC-net) to detect voids underneath slabs, which was trained by a dataset with real-world and simulation GPR signals. In the study, a multi-phase heterogeneous pavement model was first built, in which each pavement layer was reconstructed based on the real-world morphologies and distributions of aggregates and other materials. The model was then used for the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of GPR signal propagation. The simulation signals were merged with real-world GPR signals to generate a void signal dataset covering comprehensive pavement conditions. Finally, the proposed SWC-net was trained by the merged dataset to detect voids. The inputs of the network were the GPR signals, while the outputs were the signal classes and abnormal intervals of voids to perform signal-wise void detection. The experiments on Nanjing Dajiaochang and Xuzhou Guanyin airports showed that the FDTD results generalized the signal dataset by simulating different real-world conditions, while the proposed network outperformed the image-wise deep networks on void detection.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking is a crucial responsibility for autonomous vehicles as they strive to avoid collisions. During combined-slip emergency situations where steering and driving/braking joint control are required, the nonlinearity and coupling of tire forces become increasingly important, rendering a linear tire model-based controller ineffective and leading to degraded path-tracking performance. Such degradation can ultimately jeopardize vehicle stability. To address the aforementioned issue, we establish a hierarchical coordinated controller for four-wheel independent drive (4WID) autonomous vehicles, specifically tailored to handle combined-slip trajectory tracking and yaw stability control, considering variable tire cornering stiffness. At the upper level, a model predictive lateral motion controller is engineered based on a novel combined-slip UniTire-Ctrl model. The predictive model captures the intricate nonlinear and coupling characteristics of tire forces through an analytical expression of effective cornering stiffness. This enables the controller to account for the impact of longitudinal force on lateral motion control and coordinate the front-wheel steering angle and direct yaw moment in an efficient manner. Additionally, a linear quadratic longitudinal motion controller is developed to follow the desired longitudinal speed. The lower-level torque distribution controller is constructed to prioritize vehicle stability by minimizing tire adhesion utilization. Finally, the effectiveness of the controller under combined-slip conditions is validated through the CarSim and Matlab/Simulink co-simulation platforms, which demonstrates that the developed combined-slip motion controller with UniTire-Ctrl model exhibits superior tracking precision and stability under extreme combined-slip conditions.},

Despite traditional pose graph optimization enhancing pose accuracy, its integration with deep learning may lead to error accumulation due to insufficient motion information exchange. Our method, GraphAVO, concentrates simultaneously on the adjacent and interval co-visibility correspondence to establish a feature and pose graph optimization for pose consistency. We design a graph-assisted Windowed Feature Graph Refinement (WFGR) component to operationalize pose graph optimization for deep feature refinement. The geometric consistency is further constrained by a Cycle Consistency Loss. Additionally, the Cascade Dilated Convolution Fusion (CDCF) component is incorporated to handle different degrees of pixel movement, facilitating the joint detection of slight and distinct motion cues for subsequent feature enhancement. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Malaga, RobotCar, and self-collected outdoor datasets have demonstrated the promising performance and generalization ability of GraphAVO. It achieves competitive results against classical algorithms and outperforms related state-of-the-art methods by up to 24.4% and 40.1% on average translational and rotational evaluation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Understanding surface congestion is essential for improving taxiing efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in busy airports. Diverging from the traditional input-output and dynamics analysis, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to study the complete dynamic process of airport surface congestion and recovery. This framework employs a stochastic hybrid system to model multi-timescale dynamics, integrating continuous states and discrete modes of surface operations under uncertainty. First, the probabilistic reachable set for the input-output state is computed via a chance-constrained optimization program to represent the relationship between the number of aircraft taxiing out and the departure throughput. Next, the discrete modes are divided based on taxiing efficiency and traffic load, utilizing tailored congestion contour regression and density-based clustering, respectively. Finally, the transition trajectory incorporating mode information is constructed to depict the complete process from congestion formation to subsequent recovery, followed by employing an unsupervised algorithm to identify representative patterns. The proposed framework is verified using two years of real-world datasets from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, China. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with the baselines. Moreover, this work also reveals some intriguing findings, such as the diverse multi-timescale dynamical phenomena, and their implications for practical airport surface operations.},

  abstract     = {Information-centric networking (ICN) allows data to be cached at each node in the network. It is vital in vehicular networks (VNs) to improve caching performance and reduce content delay in high-traffic scenarios. In cooperative VNs, the requested content can be cached in the base station or nearby nodes without fetching the requested content from the server. The existing content popularity approaches face challenges in predicting popular content due to a time-varying environment, resulting in popularity being changed frequently. It is hard to predict such content in highly dynamic vehicular traffic. Therefore, the current approaches are less practical in a realistic scenario. This paper proposes an intelligent caching method for massive traffic in VNs to address these issues based on deep transfer learning (DTL). The primary purpose of this study is to reduce the system cost and content delay by increasing the cache hit rate based on popular data in dynamic traffic. The proposed solution uses a collaborative cache with social interaction among clusters to share the most popular content (MPC). Furthermore, it designs a time-varying mechanism to predict content popularity in a highly dynamic environment and share the widespread knowledge with other target nodes based on DTL. In addition, a content update method is developed to address the content replacement in a cooperative cache environment. Based on thorough analysis and evaluation, similar and dissimilar contents on base stations are classified among source and target clusters. The extensive simulation and experimentation confirm that the developed work achieved better than baseline studies.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral pedestrian detection is an important task for many around-the-clock applications, since the visible and thermal modalities can provide complementary information especially under low light conditions. Due to the presence of two modalities, misalignment and modality imbalance are the most significant issues in multispectral pedestrian detection. In this paper, we propose MultiSpectral pedestrian DEtection TRansformer (MS-DETR) to fix above issues. MS-DETR consists of two modality-specific backbones and Transformer encoders, followed by a multi-modal Transformer decoder, and the visible and thermal features are fused in the multi-modal Transformer decoder. To well resist the misalignment between multi-modal images, we design a loosely coupled fusion strategy by sparsely sampling some keypoints from multi-modal features independently and fusing them with adaptively learned attention weights. Moreover, based on the insight that not only different modalities, but also different pedestrian instances tend to have different confidence scores to final detection, we further propose an instance-aware modality-balanced optimization strategy, which preserves visible and thermal decoder branches and aligns their predicted slots through an instance-wise dynamic loss. Our end-to-end MS-DETR shows superior performance on the challenging KAIST, CVC-14 and LLVIP benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/MS-DETR .},

  abstract     = {To ensure effective communication and monitoring, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) with limited energy must always work together. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a Trusted Dynamic Leader Selection for FANETs (TDLS-FANET), which aims to designate a leader drone that will guide other drones. Using a trust-based mechanism, the proposed approach discerns reliable neighboring Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) while identifying and isolating potential malicious UAVs. According to the proposed scheme, trust score is calculated based on three parameters including quality of service (QoS), social trust, and fitness score. A number of parameters are taken into account when calculating the direct trust between neighboring UAVs, including the delay, packet delivery ratio, and signal strength. Indirect trust is derived from recommendation trust. Based on the residual energy and average distance of drones that are closer to the base station (BS), a fitness score is calculated. On the basis of their final trust scores, the system forms an efficient classification of clusters. TDLS-FANET can also select dynamic leaders among several drones based on their physical constraints at varying intervals. To assess performance characteristics such as energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, and transmission delay of the proposed TDLS-FANET with the existing trust based models, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TDLS-FANET reduces delay by 24%, lowers energy consumption by 19%, and increases packet delivery rates by more than 30%. It can limit delay by up to 41% in extreme situations. In FANETs, the proposed method improves accuracy and adaptability by selecting the dynamic leader drone efficiently. As a result, the performance metrics of TDLS-FANET are superior to those of existing systems.},

Two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing domain-adaptive methods that rely on clustering algorithms: 1) generation of false pseudo labels due to clustering errors and 2) significant distributional disparities between the source and target domains that can mislead the learning process. This study tackles these two challenges with an adversarial style-irrelevant feature learning framework guided by refined soft pseudo labels. This framework not only enhances the confidence level of pseudo labels but also mitigates domain distributional disparities, leading to improved domain-adaptive capabilities. Specifically, a centroid similarity ranking is utilized to refine soft pseudo labels. This process preserves knowledge from hard-to-distinguish categories while discarding the easy-to-distinguish ones. This approach strengthens learning from more difficult samples. In addition, with the guidance of the refined soft pseudo labels, an adversarial domain style feature branch is introduced. This branch aims to reduce the style information contained in vehicle features and narrow the distributional disparities across domains, thereby improving the domain-adaptive capability of the vehicle re-identification model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain vehicle re-identification.},

  abstract     = {Road crack segmentation from on-board cameras is a highly desirable yet challenging task for road condition inspection and maintenance. However, existing methods trained on small-scale datasets present limited performance from such challenging perspectives due to the lack of sufficient prior knowledge and effective generalizability. To address this limitation, this paper incorporates a vision foundation model named Segment-Anything-Model (SAM) and fully leverages its rich prior knowledge and strong generalizability to achieve crack segmentation. Also, we construct a customized crack segmentation dataset shot from on-board cameras. Considering the direct use of SAM might not correctly segment cracks, some lightweight and learnable crack adaptation layers are developed and integrated into SAM’s image encoder, which take the patch embeddings of the input image and its high-frequency components within road regions as joint inputs. During training, the parameters of the crack adaptation layers are fine-tuned to acquire domain-specific knowledge, while the parameters of the image encoder remain frozen, preserving SAM’s rich prior knowledge. Additionally, a sparse prompt generation method is proposed based on the high-frequency components within road regions, which guides the SAM model to better focus on high-frequency regions that may contain cracks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an improved average precision of 8.14% compared to Mask2Former. Furthermore, the parameter-efficient transfer learning framework significantly reduces the number of parameters requiring fine-tuning, thereby improving efficiency and reducing training costs.

Amazon Fresh, GrubHub, UberEats, Postmates, InstaCart, and DoorDash are rapidly growing and are sharing the same business model of consumer items or food delivery. Existing food delivery methods are sub-optimal because each delivery is individually optimized to go directly from the producer to the consumer via the shortest time path. We observe a significant scope for reducing the costs associated with completing deliveries under the current model. For this, we model our food delivery problem as a multi-objective optimization, where consumer satisfaction and delivery costs, both, need to be optimized. Taking inspiration from the success of ride-sharing in the taxi industry, we propose DeliverAI - a reinforcement learning-based path-sharing algorithm. Unlike previous attempts for path-sharing, DeliverAI can provide real-time, time-efficient decision-making using a Reinforcement learning-enabled agent system. Our novel agent interaction scheme leverages path-sharing among deliveries to reduce the total distance traveled while keeping the delivery completion time under check. We generate and test our methodology vigorously on a simulation setup using real data from the city of Chicago. Our results show that DeliverAI can reduce the delivery fleet size by 15%, the distance traveled by 16%, and 50% higher fleet utilization w.r.t point-to-point delivery systems.},

  abstract     = {With the advancements in artificial intelligence technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized for various smart applications, such as surveillance systems. However, because of their limited computing resources and battery capacity, it is necessary to offload computationally intensive tasks to ground infrastructure, such as edge servers and vehicles. This approach faces challenges, especially in densely populated cities where edge servers may process tasks slower because they receive requests not only from UAVs but also from a number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Additionally, in the case of private vehicles, their highly dynamic and unpredictable mobility, coupled with self-interested tendencies may result in a reluctance to share computing resources without incentives. Addressing these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV task offloading scheme utilizing public buses pursuing public service objectives. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the UAV’s system cost, including energy consumption and task completion delay, and an algorithm based on the successive convex approximation method is introduced. Public bus information and a map of Seoul are utilized in the simulation to ensure the real-world applicability of the proposed method. The simulation results indicate that our method not only reduces the system cost compared with that of other benchmark schemes but also notably improves the task completion rate.},

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60% $\sim ~90$ %). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf {8.3} \times $ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.},

However, the complicated dynamic characteristics of MHSTs and the unreliable train-to-train (T2T) (wireless) communication modes are challenging the conventional control approaches. Focusing on the adverse impact from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and faded channels caused by the T2T networks, the study designs a distributed adaptive iterative learning controller (DAILC) with recovery and compensation mechanisms, which is a model-free approach. Relying on the novel equivalent linearization strategy, a DAILC is established by using the distributed tracking errors, and the theoretical analysis has verified the complete tracking performance of MHSTs. The results in simulation test demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DAILC and the effectiveness of the recovery and compensation mechanisms.},

Place recognition identifies a place using query sensor data and a known database. One of the main challenges is to develop a model that can deliver accurate results while being robust to environmental variations. We propose two multi-modal place recognition models, namely PRFusion and PRFusion++. PRFusion utilizes global fusion with manifold metric attention, enabling effective interaction between features without requiring camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibrations. In contrast, PRFusion++ assumes the availability of extrinsic calibrations and leverages pixel-point correspondences to enhance feature learning on local windows. Additionally, both models incorporate neural diffusion layers, which enable reliable operation even in challenging environments. We verify the state-of-the-art performance of both models on three large-scale benchmarks. Notably, they outperform existing models by a substantial margin of +3.0 AR@1 on the demanding Boreas dataset. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art unsupervised object re-identification (Re-ID) methods conduct model training with pseudo labels generated by clustering techniques. Unfortunately, due to the existence of inter-ID similarity and intra-ID variance problems in vehicle Re-ID, clustering sometimes mixes different similar vehicles together or splits images of the same vehicle in different views into different clusters. To enhance the model’s ID discrimination capability in the presence of such kinds of label noise, we propose an inter-intra cluster reorganization approach (ICR) to reorganize the relationship between instances within and between clusters, which can provide higher-quality contrastive learning guidance based on existing clustering results. In the intra-cluster reorganization, we design a camera-aware maximum reliability sub-cluster organization approach, which reorganizes each cluster into several intersecting sub-clusters of higher quality based on the finer intra-camera clustering results. We further design a novel metric called centroid reliability to measure the reliability of intra-cluster contrastive learning. In the inter-cluster reorganization, we propose an ambiguous cluster discrimination criterion to measure the probability that two clusters belong to the same vehicle. Based on this criterion, we design a focal contrastive loss to adaptively re-organize the contribution of ambiguous clusters in model training to perform better contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on VeRi-776 and VERI-Wild demonstrate that ICR is effective and can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

As a consequence, there is a growing interest in studies that employ biometric signals to categorize the emotions of drivers, and driver state monitoring technologies are assuming a greater level of significance within the automotive sector. The objective of this study is to develop a lightweight stacking model that classifies drivers’ emotions into seven distinct categories by combining statistical electroencephalography data, psychological survey data, and driver behavior data. Our objective is to effectively combine individual machine learning models using reinforcement learning, and achieve optimal performance by combining strong and weak learners. To overcome the drawbacks of previous works that select individual models arbitrarily and optimize the weight in assemble model, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning based model selection for stacking. The proposed model introduces a novel feature by providing varying rewards based on the contribution of individual model to the overall performance, with the aim of enhancing the weaker model selection. The final results show that the meta-model achieves the highest performance when using a decision tree, with an accuracy of 0.8543 and an F1-score of 0.8462, which is an improvement of 0.266 and 0.2875 compared to before applying reinforcement learning, respectively. Experimental findings validate that our method can contribute to the improvement of road safety through the identification of emotional shifts in drivers and the development of appropriate interventions.},

  abstract     = {5G-based mmWave wireless positioning has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning in recent years. Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of fusing line-of-sight (LoS) 5G signals with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for an improved positioning solution. However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are expected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to erroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G single-bounce reflections (SBRs) and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban environments. In addition, we integrate the proposed 5G-based positioning with a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a wheel encoder. Moreover, the integration is realized using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as an alternative to the widely utilized extended Kalman filter (EKF) within the 5G-based positioning research community. We performed two test trajectories in the dense urban environment of downtown Toronto, Canada. For each trajectory, quasi-real 5G measurements were generated using a ray-tracing tool incorporating 3D map scans of real-world buildings, allowing for realistic NLoS and multipath scenarios. For the same trajectories, real motion data were collected from two different low-cost IMUs. Our integrated positioning solution was capable of maintaining a level of accuracy below 30 cm for approximately 97% of the time, which is superior to the accuracy level achieved when SBR signals are not considered, which is only around 92% of the time.},

  abstract     = {Understanding pedestrian route choices is pivotal for deciphering individual behaviors and informing decisions in urban planning. Unlike motorized transportation, primarily influenced by the built environment of the origin and destination, pedestrian route choices are also shaped by individual characteristics. Traditional route choice models often employ multi-segment training based on these characteristics, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneity among pedestrians within a unified framework. Additionally, these models frequently rely on oversimplified utility assumptions and neglect the implications of Markov decision sequences, potentially resulting in a misinterpretation of genuine route choice preferences. Addressing these, we introduce the Maximum-Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Individual Covariates (MEDIRL-IC) framework, which accounts for the stochastic nature of state transitions in Markov decision process. Building on MaxEnt-IRL, MEDIRL-IC uses deep neural networks to separately fit constant individual features and dynamic built environment features before integration, effectively capturing the non-linear reward function in pedestrian scenarios. We further enrich model interpretability using a graph-based causal discovery algorithm, offering insights into complex feature interactions. Validations on a pedestrian mobile signaling dataset affirm MEDIRL-IC’s superior balance between model fit and interpretability. Our contributions present urban planners with a robust analytical tool, facilitating the data-driven design of pedestrian-centric urban landscapes.

  abstract     = {In traffic sign recognition tasks, recognition of road signs by observing synthetic reference images is a human-like ability that can be performed by one-shot learning algorithms. One-shot object recognition is a challenging task for deep neural networks in which a deep model classifies query examples based on support images. It becomes more difficult when there is a domain shift between support and query samples. The generalization of a deep model on an unknown domain with different distributions is another problematic task in on-shot recognition. This work introduces a novel deep network named SeqNet to overcome the aforementioned problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work outperforms all state-of-the-art models in one-shot traffic sign recognition and one-shot logo identification by superior results. Our proposed SeqNet model generalizes to unseen domains without further model fine-tuning on the test data. Also, we show how using transferred knowledge from an irrelevant but large domain could reduce the network parameters that result in model size reduction. By utilizing the power of transferred knowledge from a large deep model the SeqNet becomes smaller and has about 6X fewer parameters than its competitors. The smaller size of the SeqNet architecture enables it to be used in resource-constrained devices in many applications such as smart vehicles. The experimental results depict that our proposed SeqNet performance is ameliorated by large margins, with up to 20% accuracy for one-shot classification and 30% area under the curve (AUC) for image retrieval tasks.},

Existing methods either enhance recognition accuracy through complex models or minimize resource requirements by utilizing low-performance models and low-resolution inputs, both of which pose challenges in real-world applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel ultra-lightweight ALPR system specifically designed for deployment on microcontrollers, offering a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for large-scale applications. We simplify the process by decoupling ALPR into three sub-tasks: detection, localization, and recognition. For each sub-task, specific improvement strategies such as Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE)-based keypoint localization, adaptive data augmentation, and multi-voting recognition mechanism are designed. Our proposed system naturally mitigates the issues of large perspective transformations frequently encountered in real-world settings. As a supplementary contribution, we introduce and release the TJLP dataset. Practical application and superior performance of our method have been demonstrated on resource-limited devices like RV1106 (ARM Cortex-A7 with a 0.5 TOPS NPU), achieving an inference speed of 22 FPS with a power consumption of 629 mW.

However, in intelligent transportation, there are serious issues with location awareness and privacy protection of existing data cleaning schemes. Therefore, we propose a location-aware and privacy-preserving data cleaning framework (PriSPA) which provides a cleaned dataset consisting of the samples from adopted data suppliers at qualified locations while ensuring the privacy of locations, spatial constraints and sensitive samples. We combine boolean secret sharing with XOR operations to make sure that it is possible to figure out whether a location complies with spatial constraints without leakage. More specifically, we ensure privacy using key agreement, secret sharing, authenticated encryption and random permutation. We seriously analyze the security of PriSPA and conduct comprehensive experiments to prove its security, effectiveness and efficiency. Based on the comparisons with the raw traffic forecasting framework, we observe that PriSPA improves the precision of the model with 17.6% - 32.7% error reduction.},

Specifically, we first propose a personalized local training round allocation algorithm to balance energy costs and accelerate model convergence. Next, in order to further guarantee security, we embed an attack module based on Gini impurity.

  abstract     = {As a means of mass transportation, the safety and passengers’ comfort of maglev trains are paramount. Nevertheless, evaluating the two indices of maglev trains is challenging based on individual error measures. Of note, track irregularities on a maglev line may introduce unsafety concerns and discomfort for passengers. Finding a suitable control scheme that balances trade-offs is a complex issue. This paper presents a new model for chassis control to address this challenge, jointly considering secondary suspension dynamics (connecting chassis and carriage) and track irregularities. Then, we first develop an adaptive disturbance observer(ADO) and a novel safe backstepping control barrier function (CBF) to reject track irregularities and prevent physical contact (unsafety issue), and extend to address ride comfort. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed method associated with the conflicts between safety and passenger comfort is analyzed. Finally, The trade-off between safety and ride comfort is mediated by a quadratic program (QP). A substantial amount of simulation results validate that the proposed control method addresses the ride comfort and safety of maglev trains well.},

  abstract     = {Predicting accurate future trajectories of agents is essential for autonomous navigation in complex scenarios. Although numerous work has made great progress on this goal, it is still challenging due to the uncertainty and continuity of behavioral intentions of agents, where uncertainty means the instantaneous multimodality of motion behavior, while the continuity refers to the consistency and stability of behavioral intention of an agent over a period of time constrained by its final destination. These factors easily affect the improvement of prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction method, Stacked Conditional VAE (S-CVAE) with Incremental Greedy Region (IGR). Specifically, the IGR is designed to enlarge the coverage of candidate waypoints/endpoints by reformulating the waypoints/endpoints prediction problem as candidate region generation, which can further encourage and model multimodality of behavioral intentions. Meanwhile, to exploit the inherent continuity between adjacent behavioral intentions of an agent, the S-CVAE architecture is constructed to transmit the behavioral intentions of one agent by inserting intermediate waypoints with IGR into the potential trajectories from the observed path to the final endpoint, and also enhances the reliability of the generated waypoints/endpoints in the next moment, further improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction. Our method is evaluated on several public datasets, including nuScenes, Apolloscape, SDD, INTERSECTION, Waymo, and VTPTL. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance on these datasets. Especially in nuScenes and VTPTL, the accuracy is increased by at least 11.11% on average ADE and 2.40% on average FDE compared with state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Traffic object detection under variable illumination is challenging due to the information loss caused by the limited dynamic range of conventional frame-based cameras. To address this issue, we introduce bio-inspired event cameras and propose a novel Structure-aware Fusion Network (SFNet) that extracts sharp and complete object structures from the event stream to compensate for the lost information in images through cross-modality fusion, enabling the network to obtain illumination-robust representations for traffic object detection. Specifically, to mitigate the sparsity or blurriness issues arising from diverse motion states of traffic objects in fixed-interval event sampling methods, we propose the Reliable Structure Generation Network (RSGNet) to generate Speed Invariant Frames (SIF), ensuring the integrity and sharpness of object structures. Next, we design a novel Adaptive Feature Complement Module (AFCM) which guides the adaptive fusion of two modality features to compensate for the information loss in the images by perceiving the global lightness distribution of the images, thereby generating illumination-robust representations. Finally, considering the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotations in the existing event-based object detection datasets, we build a DSEC-Det dataset, which consists of 53 sequences with 63,931 images and more than 208,000 labels for 8 classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFNet can overcome the perceptual boundaries of conventional cameras and outperform the frame-based methods, e.g., YOLOX by 7.9% in mAP50 and 3.8% in mAP50:95.

Current wisdom of MDE often achieves blurred or even indistinct depth boundaries, degenerating the quality of vision-based intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents an edge-enhanced vision transformer bins network for monocular depth estimation, termed eViTBins. eViTBins has three core modules to predict monocular depth maps with exceptional smoothness, accuracy, and fidelity to scene structures and object edges. First, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to circumvent the loss of depth information at various levels during depth regression. Second, an image-guided edge-enhancement module is proposed to accurately infer depth values around image boundaries. Third, a vision transformer-based depth discretization module is introduced to comprehend the global depth distribution. Meanwhile, unlike most MDE models that rely on high-performance GPUs, eViTBins is optimized for seamless deployment on edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Google Coral SBC, making it ideal for real-time intelligent transportation systems applications. Extensive experimental evaluations corroborate the superiority of eViTBins over competing methods, notably in terms of preserving depth edges and global depth representations.},

Currently, the IDS activity is manually supervised by law enforcers, i.e., law enforcers empirically choose a taxi and inspect it. The pressing problem of this scheme is the dilemma between the limited number of law-enforcers and the large volume of taxis. In this paper, we propose a computational method that helps law enforcers efficiently find the taxis which tend to have the IDS activity. Firstly, our method converts the identification of the IDS activity to a supervised learning task. Secondly, two kinds of taxi driver behaviors, i.e., the Sleeping Time and Location (STL) behavior and the Pick-Up (PU) behavior are proposed. Thirdly, the multiple scale pooling on self-similarity is proposed to encode the individual behaviors into the universal features for all taxis. Finally, a Multiple Component-Multiple Instance Learning (MC-MIL) is proposed to handle the deficiency of the behavior features and to align the behavior features, simultaneously. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set shows that the proposed behavior features have a good generalization ability across different classifiers, and the proposed MC-MIL method suppresses the baseline methods.},

Combined with the guidance principle, a cooperative formation control algorithm is proposed by employing the DETM and neural networks (NNs). The communication burden in the channel from the sensor to the controller and from the controller to actuator has been reduced for the merits of the proposed DETM. Unlike the existing results, the proposed DETM can activate the threshold parameters, adaptive parameters and NNs weight estimators at the triggering times synchronously. This releases the computation burden greatly. Considerable effort has been made to guarantee the semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability via the Lyapunov theorem.

While a bulk of prior works have explored LPR approaches for unconstrained situations on CPU and GPU servers, these methods result in huge power dissipation, and are ineffective in challenging scenes. In this work, we present a mixed-precision (MP) Transformer hardware architecture to meet the requirements of power efficiency and satisfactory LPR accuracy in unconstrained scenarios, dedicated to implementing power-efficient edge accelerators for difficult LPR tasks. Firstly, MP-LPR Transformer model is proposed, where novel mixed-precision quantization and non-linear approximation techniques are tailored for low bit-width inference. Secondly, vector tiling systolic array Transformer architecture (VTSATA) is proposed with unique vector tiling systolic array (VTSA) and vector ALU (VALU) designs, where VTSA is used to accelerate matrix multiplications, and VALU is used to process non-linear operations. Finally, a FPGA accelerator prototype based on our approach is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that our hardware platform can reduce power consumption more than $20\times $ compared to GPU platforms, and for challenge subset on CCPD dataset, our method can further improve nearly 1% accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {To decrease the risk of collisions and ensure safe navigation, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) was developed to broadcast real-time ship states information, such as ship position and sailing speed. Due to the real-time characteristic of AIS data, it, hence, has been widely used to construct a data-driven model for ship trajectory prediction, which can provide onboard decision support for navigators. However, data provided by AIS is sometimes partially missing or simply wrong. Poor quality of AIS data can degrade the performance of data-driven models and lead to large uncertainty in the predicted ship positions. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid model to reduce uncertainty by integrating the multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) model predictions and historical trajectory information. Historical trajectories provide useful prior knowledge to calibrate the performance of MOGP model predictions. This model is built through three steps: 1) extracting historical ship trajectory information from the route that a ship is following; 2) predicting ship positions with a data-driven predictor built by an MOGP; and 3) obtaining a trajectory by knowledge fusion of historical information and predicted results. The experiment shows the proposed hybrid model outperforms other data-driven models and has small errors and uncertainty quantification of the ship position prediction. Especially for the 6-minute position prediction, its RMSE is over 100 meters smaller than other methods.},

Moreover, the vehicle frequently transports the same occupants carrying specific objects. Indeed, there is a rich body of work on predicting users’ future destinations. However, existing computational approaches primarily rely on offline learning methods that require stationary data distributions, thus not accounting for situations in which traveling habits may change over time. The present research focuses on individual mobility prediction for an advanced driver assistance system within the In-Vehicle Information Systems domain. Specifically, we propose a novel approach based on the framework of Dynamic Neural Fields that learns the traveling routines of a vehicle, including the drivers, passengers, and objects. In our neurodynamics approach, the learning takes place continually and online, allowing the system to accommodate changes in traveling habits over time. The proposed strategy goes beyond learning the mobility routines of a vehicle, enabling predictive assistance for questions like When is the next departure? Where to go? but also extended assistance such as predicting Who is the next driver? Which passengers/objects will enter/leave? We evaluate the performance of the approach in predicting trip information on 11-week datasets of real traveling routines. A vehicle with such cognitive abilities has the potential to improve drivers’ readiness, enhance trip comfort, and prevent objects from being forgotten.},

To address this issue, this work develops a dual-stage learning framework to quantify driver cognitive workload continuously.

A novel driver workload dataset is constructed for the evaluation, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in estimation accuracy.

Most current UDA vehicle re-ID research ignores the mining and utilization of attribute information. Meanwhile, the Convolutional Neural Networks-based (CNN-based) network will cause the loss of fine-grained information, reducing the expression and generalization ability of vehicle features. To alleviate such issues, we are motivated by the Transformer, which can exploit distinguishable attribute information and fuse multimodal features effectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multimodality Adaptive Transformer Network (MATNet) to intensify the ability to learn vehicle fine-grained features related to attributes. Moreover, the noise contained in pseudo-labels assigned by cluster algorithms interferes with the performance of the UDA vehicle re-ID method. We also design the Dual Mutual Dynamic Update Pseudo-Label generation strategy (DMDU) to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels and alleviate error accumulation. The strategy is based on mutual learning, which can effectively utilize the congruous and particular knowledge of the two models to generate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, including VeRi-776 and VehicleID, illustrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The lane-changing behavior exerts a profound influence on the dynamic attributes of traffic flow and road safety. Accurate analysis of lane-changing behavior not only facilitates the comprehension of traffic phenomena and the prevention of traffic accidents but also contributes to constructing a dynamic and realistic background traffic flow for autonomous driving tests. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional lane-changing dynamics model based on force by abstracting the motion of the vehicle as the variation in acceleration under the influence of forces. Specifically, based on the similarity analysis of factors affecting acceleration and constitutive relationships, the three types of forces to which the vehicle is subjected are represented by a combination of basic visco-elastic elements, while the driver’s attention to the current and target lanes decreases and grows during the lane changing process is analyzed. This model not only comprehensively delineates the lane-changing process but also represents the influences of driver characteristics, neighboring vehicles, and road conditions. In order to verify the performance of the proposed model, we identified the parameters using the least squares method (LSM) based on the highD naturalistic driving dataset. Comparative results illustrate that the lane-changing dynamics model effectively capture complex lane-changing behaviors and their interactions between ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles through a simple and unified way.},

  abstract     = {For personalized human-machine cooperative (HMC) control, traditional model-driven approaches, which rely on predefined driver-vehicle-road (DVR) models, often struggle to adapt to individual driver differences. To address this, a data-learning shared control strategy based on game output regulation and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is presented. Firstly, considering the differences in driver’s characteristics, vehicle-road dynamics and human-machine interaction, an uncertain DVR system is established. Subsequently, robust output regulation (ROR) is utilized to handle road curvature perturbations and ensure closed-loop system stability. Subsequently, a dynamic game framework between the front-wheel steering system (AFS) and the active rear-wheel steering system (ARS) is further developed to ensure both vehicle stability and path-tracking accuracy in complex environments. Finally, the AFS-ARS optimal control strategies are iteratively learned and updated by ADP, using online DVR system data, without requiring prior knowledge of specific drivers or vehicles. Through driver-in-the-loop experiments, it is demonstrated that the presented method exhibits good adaptability to different drivers.},

We aim to minimize expected delivery losses, especially in scenarios where delivery requests are randomly and independently generated for each EM, with fluctuating time distributions and limited BSS capacity. Our MARL benefits from a reservation mechanism and a profit-aggregated central system, which greatly reduces the complexity of MARL. Furthermore, to address the inherent non-stationary problems of MARL, we propose a decentralized agent-based MARL framework, named Decentralized Agents, Centralized Learning Deep Q Network. This framework, leveraging a tailored learning algorithm, achieves peak-averse behavior, reducing delivery losses. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the resulting DQN algorithm for determining when to visit the BSS, and a greedy algorithm for deciding which BSS to visit. Computational experiments using real-world delivery data are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. The results demonstrate that the hybrid approach maximizes the overall profit of the entire EM fleet in a challenging environment with limited BSS capacity.},

Different from common vehicle systems, the challenges lie on the safety-guaranteed cooperation of independently controlled carriers with inherent connections brought by the rigid payload, which results in complex system dynamics and multiple time-variant uncertainties. A constraint-oriented “leader-follower” modeling and control framework is introduced, and a trajectory generation method based on the diffeomorphism is creatively proposed to generate closed-form collision-free trajectory for the payload in the bounded environment. To achieve safety-guaranteed trajectory following under uncertainties, a transformed adaptive robust control strategy (TARC) is designed through constraint relaxation, and the coordination of the carriers is realized. An implementation with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrates the effectiveness of our trajectory generation and tracking control framework. The collision-free trajectory set is efficiently generated, and the CTS can be kept strictly inside the safe corridor with high tracking accuracy, which is extremely hard for the baseline methods.},

And cyber-physical system (CPS) can support integrated, efficient and reliable operations of diverse critical intelligent transportation infrastructure and services. Considering the limitations imposed by the communication range and computing capabilities of single agent, a novel method for combining macro traffic optimization with microscopic traffic flow models from a CPS perspective is presented. This approach takes into account not only exceptional events but also the propagation of congestion waves. Specifically, we analyze macroscopic traffic patterns and transmit optimization results to the microscopic level, as inputs to the microscopic traffic flow model, thereby influencing individual vehicle. Furthermore, the intelligent driver model, incorporating a molecular dynamics-based representation of how multiple leading vehicles impact the ego vehicle is investigated. By leveraging CPS-based macro traffic analysis, we improve the car-following model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy, we conducted simulation experiments from both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives under mixed traffic environment. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in optimizing vehicle fuel consumption and improving traffic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the high-speed railway mobile networks (HSRMN), where multiple railway-side sensors (RSs) are deployed along the track to sense environmental data, and multiple train-mounted sensors (TSs) are deployed on the train to collect train data. Both RSs and TSs are scheduled to transmit their sensed data respectively to the ground base station (BS) in a time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. To keep the data received at the BS from the RSs as fresh as possible and also ensure that the TSs complete the given uploading tasks, an optimization problem is established to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of the data gathered from RSs by jointly optimizing sensors’ scheduling and transmission power control constrained by the maximum transmission power budget of RSs and TSs. Since the problem is non-convex and lacks an explicit expression of the objective function and the prior information about future channel state, we present a deep Q-learning network (DQN)-based method to solve it. Particularly, the BS is viewed as the agent, and the action space is constructed by scheduling policy and power control. To further accelerate the convergence speed of the presented DQN-based solution framework, an action space-reduced (ASR) version of the DQN-based method, i.e., the ASR-DQN-based method, is designed by deriving a closed-form solution to the optimal transmission power for a given sensors’ scheduling policy. Numerical simulations show that, compared to the DQN-based method, the ASR-DQN-based method decreases the number of episodes required for convergence by about 23% and reduces the running time by about 41%. Moreover, compared with three baselines, i.e., the random method, the round-robin method, and the deep-Sarsa method, our presented ASR-DQN-based method achieves the lowest average AoI and has the best robustness among these compared methods.},

Firstly, based on the self-built fatigue dataset and transfer learning method, an adaptive fatigue detection model with strong generalization capability is established to enable multi-view driver fatigue detection. Then, the idea of multi-clustering and adding offset parameters is introduced into the classical contrast loss function, and the D-InfoNCE loss function is designed to realize the accurate identification of the driver’s specific distraction behavior under open set detection. Subsequently, a driving risk assessment system is developed to quantify driving risk based on the vehicle driving risk factors when fatigued or distracted driving occurs. Finally, the proposed driving risk assessment system is validated by the datasets and driver-in-the-loop test bench. The results show that the proposed framework can accurately detect the driver’s fatigue state and distraction behavior and give ADAS the corresponding driving risk levels to enhance driving safety.},

Specifically, by detecting dynamic vehicles and static buildings/trees through LiDAR point clouds via machine learning, scatterers are divided into static and dynamic scatterers. Furthermore, statistical distributions of parameters, e.g., distance, angle, number, and power, related to static and dynamic scatterers are quantified under high, medium, and low VTD conditions. To mimic channel non-stationarity and consistency, based on the quantified statistical distributions, a new visibility region (VR)-based algorithm in consideration of newly generated static/dynamic scatterers is developed.

When sensing devices cannot fully cover an entire road, it is necessary to accurately predict the travel time of individual vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-state traffic factor state network (DS-TFSN), which combines macro traffic states and micro vehicle travel states. Based on the DS-TFSN, a digital twin framework is proposed for freeways. This framework can realize long-distance freeway supervision and vehicle tracking by predicting the travel time of specific vehicles in unsupervised road sections to ascertain their driving process. As the core of digital twin frameworks of freeways, the freeway section travel time prediction model based on the DS-TFSN considers the interactions among macro factors, micro factors, and environmental factors. The model divides the macro traffic state and micro vehicle travel state, and adds them as inputs to the LSTM model. A new vehicle-specific deep learning method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy in terms of the freeway section travel time. The results show that, for freeways, more accurate prediction results are achieved during both normal hours and holidays. The MAPE of the prediction results using the dual-state traffic factor state network decreases by 6.2%, at most, and the proportion of vehicles with a prediction error of less than 1 second per kilometer increases by 54%, at most.},

It is non-trivial to reduce the noise effect in the multi-agent system, as each agent may generate defective feature representations with aleatoric uncertainty, and such uncertainty will be further amplified in the collaborative stage due to deterministic collaboration models. To mitigate the negative effects of weather noise on the collaborative framework, we proposed a method called Co-Denoising, which incorporates a two-stage denoising approach within the intermediate collaborative framework. In our method, a sampling-based noise filtering is first performed at each agent to make a coarse denoising. Then, during the collaboration stage, the global feature representations are expanded through Bayesian neural networks to improve the robustness against environmental noise. The extensive experiments on sunny and rainy datasets have indicated the proposed collaborative perception method can significantly reduce performance degradation under adverse weather.},

Two key innovations are presented in this work. Firstly, it adopts a direct point cloud registration and map updating system in contrast to the traditional feature-based SLAM. In this way, the system can effectively exploit the fine structure of the environment and maintain robustness when confronted with non-structural road scenes. Secondly, an improved strong tracking extended Kalman filter (STEKF) is proposed to exclude anomalous GPS data in the back-end processing. Experiments show that FAST-LiDAR-SLAM achieves single-frame pose estimation in $20~ms$ for solid-state LiDAR tests, outperforming Faster-LIO in accuracy.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a two-layer structure Internet-distributed energy management strategy (ID-EMS) for connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to deal with two significant challenges in the real-time global optimization process. One is that the traffic flow information from the commercial intelligent transportation system (ITS) is insufficient to accurately predict future driving conditions, which is alleviated by introducing the computer vision-based detection method for traffic flow density. The other is the conflict between global optimality and real-time capability, which the algorithm complexity analysis solves. Namely, the maximum problem size of the global optimization under a given computing power is derived to ensure real-time capability. Finally, an Internet-distributed vehicle-in-the-loop (ID-VIL) simulation platform is introduced to evaluate the proposed ID-EMS’s feasibility through an on-road driving experiment. Some extreme conditions, such as heavy calculation load and network failure, are also tested.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-package delivery system, where a cargo UAV collects the parcels of ground users, and finally delivers them to the destination. One key aspect of this system is to ensure a stable and reliable connection between the UAV and the base station (BS) throughout the mission for the safety of the UAV flight. To this end, we minimize the communication outage time between the UAV and the BSs while maximizing the value of the packages picked up via optimizing the UAV path and pick-up design. Although the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity, we propose a connectivity-aware delivery (CAD) framework that divides the delivery mission into the path design phase and the pick-up design phase to address this challenging problem. Specifically, in the path design phase, we design the optimal flight path between any two package collection points of the UAV based on deep reinforcement learning to reduce the expected communication outage duration. In the pick-up design phase, we propose a genetic algorithm based pick-up algorithm which decides the selection and order of the packages to be picked by the UAV to maximize the value of the picked-up parcels under the constraints of the UAV’s load and energy. Extensive experiments and comparative studies demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in terms of both the outage rate and total value of the picked packages.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle light inspection is a crucial aspect of vehicle inspection, as vehicle lights play a vital role in understanding vehicle behavior. Due to diverse ambient illumination, non-uniform vehicle light standards, and complex light states, existing vehicle light recognition methods perform poorly, especially in turn signals. To realize intelligent vehicle light inspection, an accurate and real-time intelligent vehicle light recognition method is urgently needed. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer-based vehicle light recognition method, TrVLR, which effectively models sequential information and global relationships of the vehicle light image sequence, resulting in precise recognition. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone to extract features from vehicle light area video. Then, we adopt a Transformer encoder to encapsulate the long sequential information of the entire video. Next, a Transformer decoder is used to contextualize each image throughout the video and output the classification information of each image. Finally, we predict the state of the lights in each image by feed-forward networks (FFNs). Experiments demonstrate that our method obtains state-of-the-art results in headlights, taillights, and turn signals with F-measures of 93.34%, 91.64%, and 88.17%, respectively. Notably, TrVLR surpasses CNN-LSTM by 7.01% in turn signal recognition. Our method has been successfully applied to intelligent vehicle light inspection, and the video demo is shown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8E78Pwkcxo .},

  abstract     = {The visible-light camera, which is capable of environment perception and navigation assistance, has emerged as an essential imaging sensor for marine surface vessels in intelligent waterborne transportation systems (IWTS). However, the visual imaging quality inevitably suffers from several kinds of degradations (e.g., limited visibility, low contrast, color distortion, etc.) under complex weather conditions (e.g., haze, rain, and low-lightness). The degraded visual information will accordingly result in inaccurate environment perception and delayed operations for navigational risk. To promote the navigational safety of vessels, many computational methods have been presented to perform visual quality enhancement under poor weather conditions. However, most of these methods are essentially specific-purpose implementation strategies, only available for one specific weather type. To overcome this limitation, we propose to develop a general-purpose multi-scene visibility enhancement method, i.e., edge reparameterization- and attention-guided neural network (ERANet), to adaptively restore the degraded images captured under different weather conditions. In particular, our ERANet simultaneously exploits the channel attention, spatial attention, and reparameterization technology to enhance the visual quality while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on standard and IWTS-related datasets have demonstrated that our ERANet could outperform several representative visibility enhancement methods in terms of both imaging quality and computational efficiency. The superior performance of IWTS-related object detection and scene segmentation could also be steadily obtained after ERANet-based visibility enhancement under complex weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {Identifying distracted drivers is crucial for enhancing driving safety and advancing intelligent driver assistance systems. Recently, researchers have applied Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models for driver state decision. However, both models often suffer from several issues such as numerous parameters and low detection efficiency. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Convolution Vision Transformer (CoViT) model for distracted driver identification, leveraging techniques such as Low Complexity Attention Mechanism (LCAM), Multi-scale Dilation Convolution (MSDC), and Depth Separable Convolution (DSC). Moreover, the CoViT model features a typical “pyramid” structure, enabling effective feature extraction across different scales. Subsequently, the proposed system is trained and evaluated using the publicly available driving behavior datasets SFD2 and 100-Driver, as well as real-world road experiments. Experimental results show that the CoViT model yields high recognition performance, with mean Accuracy (mAcc) scores of 95.17%, 97.89%, and 93.54% on the recorded dataset, SFD2 dataset, and 100-Driver dataset, respectively. These scores surpass those obtained by similar lightweight models. Furthermore, ablation experiments reveal that deep and dilated convolution significantly enhance model performance. In addition, the CoViT model demonstrates its applicability to real-time driving behavior detection tasks, with a parametric count of just 1.24M — a reduction of 2.67M compared to MobileNetV3 — and an online inference Frames Per Second (FPS) of 159.13.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction of surrounding vehicles in complex environments is essential for autonomous vehicle trajectory planning. Accurate motion prediction requires accurately estimating the state information of the surrounding vehicles. For this purpose, a moving horizon estimation with interacting multiple model (IMM-MHE) algorithm is first proposed here. The algorithm can match multiple vehicle maneuvers, but also fully utilizes the historical information obtained during the driving process, achieving a high estimation accuracy. Second, a moving horizon estimation with variable structure interacting multiple model (VSIMM-MHE) framework is designed. Time-domain adaptation is proposed to solve the problem that the fixed time domain of some models cannot be filled due to model activation and elimination. A new interaction method is proposed to solve the problem that models cannot interact because the starting timesteps of their time domains are different. The proposed framework reduces not only the computational burden, but also the final estimation error caused by the model not matching the current maneuver. Third, based on a model set consisting of different kinds of intention models, a VSIMM-MHE algorithm is proposed. This algorithm introduces residual information into the model classification method, reducing the dependence on the accuracy of the model probabilities. It can not only accurately estimate the state information of surrounding vehicles in a complex environment, but also identify the model that best matches the current maneuver and effectively predict the motion trajectories of surrounding vehicles through model probabilities. Finally, joint simulation with SCANeR studio, Carsim and Simulink and hardware-in-the-loop experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of not only the two proposed estimation algorithms but also the motion prediction of surrounding vehicles using the model probabilities in the VSIMM-MHE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the estimation of dynamic route choice behavior of drivers with incomplete fixed location-based sensor data, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) data. Unlike global positioning system (GPS) data providing continuous vehicle trajectories, the location-based RFID sensors record vehicles only when they pass by but may not record all vehicles. These bring challenges for route choice modeling since empty sensor observations will also influence the likelihood of routes that do not cross these sensors. Also, it requires the essential integration of dynamic traffic conditions into the modeling process as observation paths may share the same sensor detection sequence but exhibit different travel times. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a dynamic recursive logit model to estimate vehicle route choices with RFID data, enabling the characterization of the likelihood function of sensor observation paths without the need for path enumeration between consecutive detections. Also, we develop a probabilistic dynamic link utilization estimation method to infer the actual path of each vehicle from the available sensor observations. It serves as a validation process to ensure that the route choice behavior can comprehensively reflect traffic flow dynamics. The proposed methods are evaluated using both a simulated dataset on the Sioux Falls network and a collection of real-world RFID data in Chongqing, China. The simulation results show that the proposed method can recover true choice parameters and perform significantly better compared with static models. The real-world experimental results highlight its efficacy in aggregated link flow prediction and individual trajectory reconstruction.},

Most fusion methods for 3D detection rely on an accurate alignment and calibration between 3D point clouds and RGB images. However, such an assumption is not reliable in a real-world self-driving system, as the alignment between different modalities is easily affected by asynchronous sensors and disturbed sensor placement. We propose a novel Fusion network by Box Matching (FBMNet) for multi-modal 3D detection, which provides an alternative way for cross-modal feature alignment by learning the correspondence at the bounding box level to free up the dependency of calibration during inference. With the learned assignments between 3D and 2D object proposals, the fusion for detection can be effectively performed by combining their ROI features. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method is much more robust in dealing with challenging cases such as asynchronous sensors, misaligned sensor placement, and degenerated camera images than existing fusion methods. We hope that our FBMNet could provide an available solution to dealing with these challenging cases for safety in real autonomous driving scenarios.},

During the DTs synchronization process, the time-varying nature of the physical environment may result in loss of DTs synchronization data. In order to better ensure the fidelity of DTs and the safety of autonomous driving, we propose a DTs-assisted distributed federated reinforcement training framework with fidelity guarantee. In this framework, the DTs leverage its predictive function to fill the lost data during the vehicle synchronization to its twins, ensuring a high fidelity in mapping the vehicle state. Then the model undergoes training through distributed federated reinforcement learning within the DTs environment.

  abstract     = {The efficient operation of urban bus networks largely depends on optimised scheduling conducted before the one-day operation, crucially relying on reliable origin-destination (OD) information. Passengers travel on direct and transfer trips due to complex infrastructure and services in bus networks. These two differential behaviours necessitate a model that captures topological differences to accurately predict the OD matrix. Responding to this need, we propose a graph-based deep learning model, termed the Direct-Transfer Heterogeneous Graph Network (DT-HGN). This model is designed to predict the OD matrix whilst expressly distinguishing direct and transfer passenger behaviour. DT-HGN articulates direct and transfer trips as distinct graphs, each characterised by its unique adjacency matrix. The model’s architecture embraces two principal blocks: a Spatio-Temporal (ST) construct and an Auto-Encoder (AE) component. The ST-block applies a Gated Recurrent Unit model and a Graph Convolutional Network to discern features of direct and transfer trips, considering both temporal and spatial dimensions. Conversely, the AE-block utilises a heterogeneous graph convolutional network to transmute the two heterogeneous graphs into latent features. Our real-world validation process, executed over a two-month period on an urban bus network, attests to DT-HGN’s robust ability in accurate OD matrix prediction, outperforming contemporaneous state-of-the-art models. This study addresses the crucial need for a comprehensive network-level OD matrix and provides a new perspective for optimising the entire public transport network by accurately depicting station-to-station demand. The approach extends beyond the limitations of traditional bus lines, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis and improvement of urban public transport systems.},

  abstract     = {Maritime and shipping are unambiguously the cornerstones of the global economy and transportation. To improve efficiency, maritime sector activities are focused on the realization of Smart Shipping (SMS), leveraging 6G Communications, Energy Efficiency (EE) and Machine Learning (ML). However, conventional Centralized Machine Learning (CML) cannot be easily applied in the maritime, mainly due to the drawbacks: (i) prohibitive data communication overhead and bandwidth limitations, since CML requires centralization of massive data through transmissions from heterogeneous sources, (ii) excessive energy consumption associated with massive data transfers, (iii) remarkable transmission errors due to harsh propagation conditions, and (iv) data privacy violation, since the data carries sensitive and commercial information. This article proposes a two-fold Federated Learning (FL) scheme (FedShip) to improve the privacy, EE and communication-efficiency of future 6G maritime networks. FedShip uses the Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) principles to exploit the signal superposition property and ensure that local models are accurately and efficiently combined. Using real data regarding the fuel consumption of multiple cargo ships, we compared the FL performance, building multiple timeseries forecasting models, with collaborative ML baselines. AirComp performance was also assessed using simulation data about channel measurements. After optimizing the hyperparameters of the local models, extensive results revealed that: (i) FL shows enhanced fuel prediction accuracy (95.5% relative to the CML), while ensuring data privacy and (ii) AirComp can be adopted to combine the local models with low computation error, offering significant EE and spectrum efficiency improvements, especially when dense 6G scenarios are considered.},

  abstract     = {Technological advances in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) industry have brought significant advantages in enhancing the cost-efficiency of railway applications. However, GNSS vulnerability to external jamming necessitates enhanced protection ability of the GNSS-based train localization system. This paper proposes a resilient train localization solution under the tightly-coupled integration scheme. This solution maximizes the utilization of multi-source information from train-borne sensors, including INS, odometer, and the trackmap database. Based on the existing localization scheme, it achieves a compatible way to address different jamming-intrusion situations without altering the GNSS receiver structure, addressing both the GNSS failure and degradation caused by jamming. Using an odometer/trackmap-enabled equivalent measurement logic, the continuity of localization can be guaranteed against GNSS failure under strong GNSS jamming. A robust filtering algorithm enabled by a jamming discrimination mechanism is proposed for GNSS/INS integration to mitigate the negative effect from degraded GNSS measurements, reducing the hazards by jamming with an intermediate power level. Based on the field data and a jamming test platform, results under two typical jamming scenarios are evaluated to demonstrate the necessity and superiority of the proposed solution. It also emphasizes the importance of the full-life-cycle resilience of GNSS-based train localization under the railway operation environment.},

  abstract     = {Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) cooperate through vehicle to every-thing (V2X) wireless communication to achieve platooning control, which can substantially increase the capacity of roads and reduce the risk of accidents. However, wireless communication systems may encounter abnormal situations in actual traffic environments, such as data packet loss, signal interruption, and communication module damage, which will cause the switching of communication topology among vehicles, thus affecting the performance of platooning system. To address this problem, a self learning-based comfort and energy-efficient platooning control strategy through cloud for CAVs with switching topologies and state estimation is proposed. First, we use weighted data fusion to process the original data. Simultaneously designing a rule to ensure that the acceleration change rate at switching moment remains smooth. Then, we introduce the adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) to get a high-precision state estimation in the abnormal communication scenario and thus to ensure acceptable passenger comfort level. Finally, a double-dueling-deterministic policy gradient ( $\rm \mathbf {D^{3}PG}$ ) algorithm is proposed to achieve the platooning control, and a reliable self-learning platoon strategy was established using iterative learning, prior knowledge and data correction. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method can ensure car-following performance, comfort, and energy efficiency of CAV in abnormal communication scenarios.},

Under a finite field of view of the environmental perceiving sensor, a novel guidance algorithm based on tracking differentiator and receding horizon optimization is proposed to generate a smooth guidance signal, respecting the physical limits on the system state including pitch attitude, velocity, and acceleration. To track the guidance signal and the preset forward velocity accurately, a hierarchical control strategy with kinematics and dynamics levels is raised. At the kinematics level, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) is employed for the vehicle to track the guidance signal and produce a virtual pitch velocity signal. At the dynamics level, an adaptive fast integral terminal sliding mode controller is developed based on the actuated dynamic model of the LUAUV with dynamic uncertainties, matched disturbances, and mismatched disturbances. It can be guaranteed that the tracking errors of the virtual pitch velocity and preset forward velocity locally converge to zero in finite time. Through the high-fidelity visual simulations, the proposed scheme has higher precision, faster single-step solution speed, and stronger robustness than the conventional MPC.},

To handle the potential interaction between the ego vehicle and pedestrian that possibly exists but is occluded by front vehicle, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based motion planning algorithm is proposed in this study. Firstly, a naturalistic driving dataset of vehicle-pedestrian interaction is established, based on which it is found that in the case of pedestrians passing or not, there are significant differences in front vehicle driving behavior. Then, a probability estimation approach for the presence of pedestrians in the occluded area is designed, which can achieve 91.9% accuracy in the naturalistic driving dataset. A phantom pedestrian model is established to quantify the uncertainty in the occluded area, which is further used to construct the chance constraint of the SMPC planning problem. Finally, a naturalistic driving data based simulation and a pedestrian-driver-in-the-loop experiment are carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. Both simulation and experiments show that our algorithm can effectively utilize the perceived information to speculate pedestrian presence beyond sensing range, thereby enabling proactive decisions to achieve safety, comfort and traffic efficiency in vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The proposed framework may find applications in interaction planning problems with uncertainty challenges.},

This task presents challenges that include efficient training on large datasets, accurate classification in imbalanced scenarios, and sensitivity to high imbalance ratios (IR). This paper introduces a novel approach, the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machine-based Decision Tree (NDT-IFTSVM), aimed at addressing these issues. NDT-IFTSVM integrates IFTSVM and decision tree methodologies, offering an efficient solution for multi-class classification. The proposed algorithm constructs a decision tree comprised of a series of two-class IFTSVMs. To enhance balance and separability, the multi-class method iteratively divides into two sets based on distance between class centres and instance distribution. This recursive process continues until each subset exclusively contains a single class, facilitating effective classification. To handle highly imbalanced datasets, NDT-IFTSVM incorporates a rational weighting strategy. Additionally, we refine NDT-IFTSVM by introducing a regularization term that maximizes the margin between the bounding and proximal hyperplanes, mitigating the impact of noise and outliers. Finally, a coordinate descent system with shrinking by an active set is applied to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical evaluations employ the bootstrap technique with a 95% confidence interval and statistical tests to quantify the significance of performance improvements. Experimental results on 12 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing promising outcomes compared to other techniques documented in the literature.},

However, since the container storage dataset collected from the yard suffers from multiple sources and data drift, it is difficult to guarantee that the container rehandling probability prediction model directly trained on container storage dataset performs consistently well on different container blocks. To address above issue, we take each container block as an independent data domain and propose a novel multi-domain merging adaptation (MDMA) approach, which includes the three stages of domain merging, domain adaptation and aggregation. In domain merging stage, we merge data domains into several domain cluster for limiting the number of the source cluster and boosting the knowledge transfer. In domain adaptation stage, the prediction model learns the domain-invariant representation for each pair of the source and target clusters by distribution matching manner. In aggregation stage, the domain- invariant features are adaptively aggregates together by feed-forward network. Extensive experiments are conducted on the container rehandling dataset, and the results demonstrate the performance and practical values of the proposed MDMA approach.},

FrictionSegNet combines semantic segmentation and friction estimation by learning a shared latent space that encompasses both semantic segmentation and friction coefficient information. An objective function is designed for this task and minimised using *geco to train the model, providing the ability to control the balance between improved predictions and uncertainty measurement. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to jointly estimate tyre-road friction and surface type by learning the joint latent space of semantic segmentation and friction coefficient information. The results suggest that it is possible to identify low-friction surfaces, e.g. snow or ice, and estimate upcoming road friction in real time from a camera only. As it is of interest to develop techniques that require less training data, numerical experiments were performed using transfer learning from a dataset consisting of images of various road surfaces. This led to better performance and faster convergence during training. FrictionSegNet achieved per-pixel accuracies of 97% and 95% when identifying snow and ice respectively, and RMS errors of 0.04–0.09 when estimating $\mu $ values achievable by a truck *abs on gravel, dry and wet asphalt, snow, and ice surfaces.},

Although natural scene text detection has been extensively studied, yielding noteworthy results, little research has focused on traffic text detection.

In light of these challenges, we propose an end-to-end traffic text detection framework that can effectively detect traffic text captured by in-vehicle cameras in various driving scenarios.

To optimize such train ticket-grabbing service, a vital accompanying task is to predict the train ticket-grabbing success rates for users during their train ticket-grabbing process to help them make decisions. Although many endeavours have been made towards the traffic prediction problem, none of them was dedicated to solving the ticket-grabbing issue. That is, prior methods ignored the unique properties exhibited in the ticket-grabbing scenario, such as the specific spatial relationship between stations and trains, the collaboration and competition relationships between different routes, and the temporal periodic pattern in ticket-grabbing. In this paper, we propose a novel Infomax-based Period-aware Transformer (IPT) tailored for predicting the success rate of train ticket-grabbing that will be displayed on OTPs, which is to our best knowledge the first attempt along this line. IPT contains three modules: i) a multi-view node embedding module, which serves to model the special spatial relationships between stations and trains by employing the intra- and inter-graph aggregation layers; ii) an infomax-based graph representation learning module, which aims to learn a high-level node embedding by training a discriminator to distinguish different types of edges in the route graph; iii) a period-aware Transformer module, which intends to discover the ticket-grabbing temporal periodic dependencies by designing a periodic activation function.

  abstract     = {Automatic pavement surface crack segmentation is crucial for efficient and cost-effective road maintenance. Despite fully-supervised crack segmentation methods have achieved significant success, the laborious task of pixel-level annotation hampers their widespread applicability. To address this issue, this paper presents a weakly-supervised pavement surface crack segmentation method based on Dual Separation and Domain Generalization (DSDGNet). Firstly, a crack image formulation model (CIFM) is developed by separating the crack image into a background component and a crack component. Additionally, we treat the crack component as a linear fusion of the pavement texture component and the crack mask. Secondly, a local-to-global learning method (L2G-L) is proposed to learn complete crack via local learning based on a random cropping and pasting algorithm. This idea stems from the observation that the crack component can be separated into several local regions, akin to the local regions found in hand-drawn crack components. Thirdly, A progressive interaction training algorithm (PIT) is crafted to train the image generation model by leveraging both generated and real images, thereby narrowing the divide between generated and authentic crack images. Finally, realistic and diverse crack images, along with their crack masks, are generated to facilitate the training of fully-supervised segmentation models. A generalizable loss is proposed to enhance the model generalization ability by combining reconstruction, segmentation, and domain adversarial losses. Extensive experiments on six public pavement crack datasets show the effectiveness and superiority of DSDGNet in weakly-supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {In simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), the detection of a true loop closure benefits in relocalization and increased map accuracy. However, its performance is largely affected by variation in light conditions, viewpoints, seasons, and the presence of dynamic objects. Over the past few decades, efforts have been put forth to address these challenges, yet it remains an open problem. Focusing on the advantages of visual semantics to achieve human-like scene understanding, this research investigates semantics-aided visual loop closure detection methods and presents a novel coarse-to-fine loop closure detection method using semantic local and global descriptors (SLGD) for visual SLAM systems. The proposed method exploits low-level and high-level information in a given image thus combining the benefits of local visual features invariant to viewpoint and illumination changes, and global semantics extracted from the specific semantic regions. Robustness is achieved against long-term autonomy through the fusion of global semantic similarity with semantically salient local feature similarity. The proposed SLGD-Loop outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection methods on a range of challenging benchmark datasets with significantly improved Recall@N and higher recall rate at 100% precision.},

The multi-level fusion between multiple sensors was implemented by fusing data collected from different sensors in different system modules. In the front-end of the system, the camera and the LiDAR assisted each other. The LiDAR point clouds provided 3D information for the feature points in the image. The moving objects elimination method based on the image can remove the points on the moving objects in the LiDAR point clouds for localization accuracy improvement and static 3D scene reconstruction. To further improve the localization accuracy, a combination of visual loop closure detection and LiDAR loop closure detection was utilized to ensure the global consistency of scene reconstruction. At the system’s back-end, the observation model of different sensors was integrated to construct a multiple constraint factor graph with nonlinear optimization to obtain the optimal system states. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed multi-sensor fusion-based localization and scene reconstruction algorithm could operate robustly in multiple complex dynamic scenes.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control (TSC) has been one of the most useful ways for reducing urban road congestion. The challenge of TSC includes 1) real-time signal decision, 2) the complexity in traffic dynamics, and 3) the network-level coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can query policies by mapping the traffic state to the signal decision in real-time, however, are inadequate for different traffic flow environment. By observing real traffic information, online planning methods can compute the signal decisions in a responsive manner. Unfortunately, existing online planning methods either require high computation complexity or get stuck in local coordination. Against this background, we propose an explicit multiagent coordination (EMC)-based online planning methods that can satisfy adaptive, real-time and network-level TSC. By multiagent, we model each intersection as an autonomous agent, and the coordination efficiency is modeled by a cost function between neighbor intersections. By network-level coordination, each agent exchanges messages of cost function with its neighbors in a fully decentralized manner. By real-time, the message-passing procedure can interrupt at any time when the real time limit is reached and agents select the optimal signal decisions according to current message. Finally, we test our EMC method in both synthetic and real road network datasets. Experimental results are encouraging: compared to RL and conventional transportation baselines, our EMC method performs reasonably well in terms of adapting to real-time traffic dynamics, minimizing vehicle travel time and scalability to city-scale road networks.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have shown promising progress in various visual object detection tasks, including monocular 2D/3D detection and surround-view 3D detection. More importantly, the attention mechanism in the Transformer model and the 3D information extraction in binocular stereo are both similarity-based. However, directly applying existing Transformer-based detectors to binocular stereo 3D object detection leads to slow convergence and significant precision drops. We argue that a key cause of that defect is that existing Transformers ignore the binocular-stereo-specific image correspondence information. In this paper, we explore the model design of Transformers in binocular 3D object detection, focusing particularly on extracting and encoding task-specific image correspondence information. To achieve this goal, we present TS3D, a Transformer-based Stereo-aware 3D object detector. In the TS3D, a Disparity-Aware Positional Encoding (DAPE) module is proposed to embed the image correspondence information into stereo features. The correspondence is encoded as normalized sub-pixel-level disparity and is used in conjunction with sinusoidal 2D positional encoding to provide the 3D location information of the scene. To enrich multi-scale stereo features, we propose a Stereo Preserving Feature Pyramid Network (SPFPN). The SPFPN is designed to preserve the correspondence information while fusing intra-scale and aggregating cross-scale stereo features. Our proposed TS3D achieves a 41.29% Moderate Car detection average precision on the KITTI test set and takes 88 ms to detect objects from each binocular image pair. It is competitive with advanced counterparts in terms of both precision and inference speed.},

In view of this, the long-established pre-timed and actuated control methods for traffic signals are inadequate to make extensive use of the comprehensive traffic states of conventional and connected entities provided by installed sensors and vehicular ad hoc network. To compensate for this shortcoming, signal spatio-temporal logic (SSTL) specifications are proposed as functions of traffic states to express the mobility and safety objectives to be achieved via model predictive control (MPC). MPC allows for a robust optimization of traffic signal timing against all realizations of additive bounded disturbances, meaning random incoming traffic, such that an SSTL specification is satisfied, if feasible; otherwise, it is violated as little as possible.},

  abstract     = {Under a changing driving environment, a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon relies strongly on the acquisition of accurate traffic information from neighboring vehicles as well as reliable commands from a centralized supervisory controller through the communication network. Even though such modalities are imperative to ensure the safe and efficient driving performance of CAVs, they led to multiple security challenges. Thus, a cyberattack on this network can corrupt vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which can lead to unsafe or undesired driving scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we propose a cyberattack detection-isolation algorithm comprised of a unified V2V and V2I cyberattack detection scheme along with a V2I isolation scheme for CAVs under changing driving conditions. The proposed algorithm is constructed using a bank of residual generators with Lyapunov function-based performance guarantees, such as disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of our proposed algorithm through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations using real-world highway and urban driving data. The results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the cybersecurity of CAVs by detecting cyberattacks on CAV platoons and isolating infrastructure-level traffic manipulation.},

Current facial landmark-based methods usually use a two-stage paradigm, where faces and facial landmarks are localized separately.

To address these challenges, we present a refined YOLO network named YOLOFaceMark that can simultaneously detect faces and their facial landmarks. Furthermore, we introduce a drowsiness detection model based on facial landmarks. This model utilizes extracted eye and mouth information to identify drowsy states. We optimize the original YOLO components through structural re-parameterization, channel shuffling, and the design of a dual-branch detection head with an implicit module. These enhancements are designed to improve the accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate the real-time performance and accuracy of YOLOFaceMark on public datasets, including 300W and COFW. Additionally, we conduct further validation to demonstrate our ability to achieve effective and robust drowsiness detection solely based on the facial landmarks detected by YOLOFaceMark.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to prevent accidents caused by drivers’ errors and reduce road traffic risks. Due to the nature of heavy vehicles, whose collisions cause more serious crashes, the weights of vehicles need to be considered when making driving strategies aimed at reducing the potential risks and their consequences in the context of autonomous driving. This study develops an autonomous driving strategy based on risk anticipation, considering the weights of surrounding vehicles and using hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. A risk indicator integrating surrounding vehicles’ weights, based on the risk field theory, is proposed and incorporated into autonomous driving decisions. A hybrid action space is designed to allow for left lane changes, right lane changes and car-following, which enables AVs to act more freely and realistically whenever possible. To solve the above hybrid decision-making problem, a hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm with an attention mechanism (AT-HPPO) is developed, providing great advantages in maintaining stable performance with high robustness and generalization. An indicator, potential collision energy in conflicts (PCEC), is newly proposed to evaluate the performance of the developed AV driving strategy from the perspective of the consequences of potential accidents. The performance evaluation results in simulation and dataset demonstrate that our model provides driving strategies that reduce both the likelihood and consequences of potential accidents, at the same time maintaining driving efficiency. The developed method is especially meaningful for AVs driving on highways, where heavy vehicles make up a high proportion of the traffic.},

This paper is driven by the objective of minimizing costs while fulfilling all service requests. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for the CB service design problem that jointly optimizes routes, timetables (including the arrival and holding time of each vehicle at each stop), and request-route assignment schemes, with particular consideration for a heterogeneous fleet. The model is subsequently linearized and solved using a Column Generation (CG) based decomposition algorithm, which produces precise solutions for small and medium-scale cases. To address the challenge of solving large-scale cases, we hybridize an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) into the CG framework (CG-IGA) to enhance efficiency in solving the pricing subproblem. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments, involving the Sioux Falls network and a real-world road network in Beijing, are conducted. Computational results show that: (1) the optimality can be achieved for small and medium-scale cases when applying the CG algorithm; (2) the CG-IGA exhibits an exceptional performance compared to other solving methods for large-scale cases in terms of optimality and time-efficiency; (3) the holding control strategy allows for trade-offs between timeout costs and operating costs while improving the flexibility of CB services; and (4) the application of heterogeneous fleets bring at least 17.28% reduction of operating costs and ensures high utilization of transport resources.},

  abstract     = {Missing data in time series is a pervasive problem that serves as obstacles for subsequent traffic data analysis. Consequently, extensive research works have been conducted on traffic missing data imputation tasks. The state-of-the-art traffic data imputation models are mostly based on recurrent neural networks. However, these methods belong to autoregressive models which are highly susceptible to error propagation. The attention-based methods are non-autoregressive models that can avoid compounding errors and help achieve better imputation quality. Moreover, the attention-based methods in now widely applied and have achieved remarkable results, whereas their application on traffic data imputation is still limited. Thus, this paper proposes Self-Attention Graph Convolution Imputation Network (SAGCIN) for spatio-temporal traffic data. To ensure the accuracy of data imputation, it is necessary to fully capture the spatio-temporal contextual information of traffic data to impute missing values. To this end, the SAGCIN model incorporates self-attention mechanism with diffusion graph convolution network. The SAGCIN model consists of two spatio-temporal blocks with a spatio-temporal encoder and an imputation decoder. The encoder learns spatio-temporal representations specialized for traffic data imputation tasks. Based on the learned representation, the decoder performs two stages of imputation operator for missing data. A joint-optimization training approach of imputation and reconstruction is introduced for SAGCIN to perform missing value imputation for traffic data. Empirical results demonstrate that SAGCIN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation tasks on relevant real-world benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) provide an alternative to traditional mobility and a sustainable means of transportation. As a result, electric vehicle sales are increasing across Europe, prompting researchers to wonder about the impact of EVs on smart grids. The proposed framework simulates users’ activities, highly characterising individual behaviour using Time Use Survey (TUS) data to estimate EV usage and consumption. Then, for each trip, the routes between origin and destination are determined, simulating in separate modules i) the driving behaviour, ii) the motion of the EV and its discharge considering spatial data and iii) the charge considering users’ preference. Thanks to the spatial information openly available, it is possible to characterise the simulation and improve EV consumption estimation. Different scenarios are analysed to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed framework by exploiting its modularity. The individuals’ heterogeneity is considered by using an agent-oriented approach. Furthermore, the simulation proceeds on a time-step basis to enable the use of the simulator in a co-simulation environment for future purposes, such as the integration of power networks. The results indicate that achieving a high realism with limited, i.e. containing scarce data for the problem under study, is feasible, enabling researchers to make informed decisions about future mobility.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) incorporates temporal abstraction into reinforcement learning (RL) by explicitly taking advantage of hierarchical structures. Modern HRL typically designs a hierarchical agent composed of a high-level policy and low-level policies. The high-level policy selects which low-level policy to activate at a lower frequency and the activated low-level policy selects an action at each time step. Recent HRL algorithms have achieved performance gains over standard RL algorithms in synthetic navigation tasks. However, these HRL algorithms still cannot be applied to real-world navigation tasks. One of the main challenges is that real-world navigation tasks require an agent to perform safe and interactive behaviors in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose imagination-augmented HRL (IAHRL) that efficiently integrates imagination into HRL to enable an agent to learn safe and interactive behaviors in real-world navigation tasks. Imagination is to predict the consequences of actions without interactions with actual environments. The key idea behind IAHRL is that the low-level policies imagine safe and structured behaviors, and then the high-level policy infers interactions with surrounding objects by interpreting the imagined behaviors. We also introduce a new attention mechanism that allows the high-level policy to be permutation-invariant to the order of surrounding objects and to prioritize our agent over them. To evaluate IAHRL, we introduce five complex urban driving tasks, which are among the most challenging real-world navigation tasks. The experimental results indicate that IAHRL enables an agent to perform safe and interactive behaviors, achieving higher success rates and lower average episode steps than baselines.},

Most existing works minimize domain disparity by concentrating on different levels through adversarial learning. However, adversarial learning do not consider the different influences on under-aligned and well-aligned samples as they merely match distinct distributions with consistent weight. To address this issue, we design a novel scale-disentangled and uncertainty-guided alignment for domain-adaptive object detection (SDUGA), consisting of three main components: (1) Disentangled scale coarse module, which decouples scale information from global image features and performs individual alignment across domains for the corresponding scale by training domain classifiers in an adversarial learning manner; (2) Disentangled scale fine module, which generalizes the disentangled scale alignment to instance-level adaptation, reinforcing the distribution alignment across domains from multi-scale local instance level; (3) Uncertainty-guided coarse-to-fine attention alignment, which adjusts weights for various samples adaptively by generating the uncertainty-guided attention map, thus enforcing the detector to converge more on alignment for under-aligned samples and avoid misaligning well-aligned ones. Extensive experiments over three challenging domain-shift object detection scenarios demonstrate that SDUGA gains superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Vessel trajectory clustering, which aims to find similar trajectory patterns, has been widely leveraged in maritime applications. Most traditional methods use predefined rules and thresholds to identify discrete vessel behaviors. They aim for high-quality clustering and conduct clustering on entire sequences, whether the original trajectory or its sub-trajectories, overlooking the behavioral significance and evolution characteristics. To resolve this problem, we propose a Predictive Clustering of Hierarchical Vessel Behavior (PC-HiV). PC-HiV first utilizes hierarchical representations to transform every trajectory into a behavioral sequence. It then predicts evolution at each timestamp of the sequence based on the representations. By applying predictive clustering and latent encoding, PC-HiV improves clustering and predictions simultaneously. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that PC-HiV effectively captures behavioral evolution discrepancies between different vessel types (tramp vs. liner) and near emission control area boundaries. Additionally, the results show that PC-HiV outperforms NN-Kmeans and Robust DAA by 3.9% and 6.4% in terms of purity scores, thereby proving the superiority of the proposed PC-HiV over existing models.},

  abstract     = {The acquisition of both local and global features from irregular point clouds is crucial for 3D object detection (3DOD). Current mainstream 3D detectors neglect significant local features during pooling operations or disregard many global features of the overall scene context. This paper proposes new techniques for simultaneously learning local-global features of scene point clouds to enhance 3DOD. Specifically, we propose an efficient 3DOD network in indoor point clouds, named SimLOG, which utilizes simultaneous local-global feature learning. SimLOG has two main contributions: a Dynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module to recover local features lost during pooling, and a Global Context Aggregation(GCA) module to aggregate multi-scale features from various layers of the encoder to improve scene context awareness. Unlike traditional local-global feature learning methods, our DPI and GCA modules are integrated into a single feature learning module, making it easily detachable and able to be incorporated into existing 3DOD networks to enhance their performance. SimLOG demonstrates superior performance over twenty competitors in terms of detection accuracy and robustness on both the SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2 datasets. Specifically, SimLOG boosts the baseline VoteNet by 8.1% of mAP@0.25 on ScanNet V2 and by 3.9% of mAP@0.25 on SUN RGB-D. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/chenbaian-cs/SimLOG .},

To provide a solution to this problem, we propose an explainable deep neural network that jointly predicts driving actions and multimodal environment descriptions of traffic scenes, including bird-eye-view (BEV) maps and natural-language environment descriptions. In this network, both the context information from BEV perception and the local information from semantic perception are considered before producing the driving actions and natural-language environment descriptions. To evaluate our network, we build a new dataset with hand-labelled ground truth for driving actions and multimodal environment descriptions. Experimental results show that the combination of context information and local information enhances the prediction performance of driving action and environment description, thereby improving the safety and explainability of our end-to-end autonomous driving network.},

Due to the fact that it is a time-sensitive task, the problem of proximity detection requires to judge whether two vehicles are close to each other in a very short time. However, the battery life and computation capacity of vehicles are limited in the actual scenario. Therefore, how to solve this problem with low latency and energy consumption is an important issue. In this paper, we investigate the Joint Optimization of the Latency and Energy consumption problem in the scenario of Proximity Detection, namely, JOLE-PD, which is formulated into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem. The DDPG-CMOA method is proposed to find a tradeoff between latency and energy consumption, achieving the Pareto optimal solutions. Besides, NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) and MOEA-D (Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition), as the typical algorithms to solve multiobjective optimization problem, are used as the baseline methods to compare the performance of DDPG-CMOA method under different parameters. The experimental results show the proposed DDPG-CMOA method requires much lower running time and has strong generalization ability. Moreover, the solutions obtained from the DDPG-CMOA method have a slightly better ability of convergence and diversity.},

Consequently, ensuring safety while improving the energy efficiency of AVs has gained increasing importance. In this study, we offer an optimal intelligent system (OIS) by applying a multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm to an integrated control system, including an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and an Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) that augments safety and lessens the energy consumption for Conventional AVs. In this - system, a predictive model is developed by defining the desired acceleration of the ego vehicle. The vehicle then follows a longitudinal path to track the lead vehicle on the same highway lane, ensuring a safe following distance while minimizing tracking errors. Subsequently, an Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) is introduced to optimize the torque output of the internal combustion engine, aimed at reducing the energy consumption of the ego vehicle. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the ego vehicle is conducted to account for disturbances and signal loss scenarios. In this way, a band-limited white noise is considered for road power demand (RPD) and measuring signal of lead vehicle velocity, simultaneously. Moreover, two different scenarios are designed regarding signal-losing circumstances and interruptions in receiving the signal of lead vehicle velocity. The optimal solutions reveal a strong independence between safety and fuel consumption, showing that their performances significantly affect each other. The optimal solutions reveal a strong interdependence between safety and fuel consumption, showing that their performances significantly affect each other. The results demonstrate that the optimal approach can significantly reduce fuel consumption while maintaining safety and effective collision avoidance performances.},

Due to the features of decentralization, complexity, and heterogeneity in intelligent transportation systems, the key issue is ensuring the legality and trustworthiness of all participating parties. Traditional methodologies such as public key infrastructure provide services for verifying the legitimacy of entities with certificates. However, even if a vehicle is legally registered, trust in its behavior is not always assured. Recently decentralized trust management systems (DTMS) are proposed to solve the trust issue. However, achieving both dependability and efficiency remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel DTMS based on the consortium blockchain. We in particular focus on the dependability of trust evaluation, where trust computation is performed on both vehicles and RSUs. To achieve a sustainable trust environment, we propose an incentive model whereby the raters can earn rewards for providing honest ratings. Instead of utilizing the consensus algorithm based on the Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), we implement a verifiable delay function (VDF)-based consensus model within the trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure efficiency and security for the consortium blockchain. In addition, we design a smart contract on top of the blockchain to assist the system in detecting a specific attack against the trust system, known as the on-off attack. Through extensive experiments, the results of trust assessment and blockchain performance demonstrate the dependability and efficiency of our proposed DTMS.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles detection (IVD) provides information to manage traffic efficiently, drive autonomous vehicles and feed data to intelligent traffic management systems (ITMS). IVD is a challenging task for the close proximity vehicles in lane-less traffic and heterogeneous systems. Most vehicle detection models are complex and limited to multi-scale feature extraction due to the involvement of existing feature extraction backbones. Also, they do not include heterogeneous traffic vehicles, usually present in developing countries. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-class vehicle detection (MCVD) model to detect vehicles in heterogeneous traffic using a realistic traffic dataset from a developing country. MCVD is a deep learning (DL) model that consists of a convolutional neural network backbone called VDnet, a light fusion bi-directional feature pyramid network (LFBFPN) and a modified vehicle detection head (MVDH). VDnet extracts multi-scale features from the traffic input images using feature reuse methods. LFBFPN combines these features bi-directionally and provides robust feature maps. Finally, MVDH is applied to detect multi-class vehicles and classify them into respective categories. The proposed model achieves 91.45% mean average precision (mAP) on the heterogeneous traffic labeled dataset (HTLD). The proposed MCVD is tested over Nvidia Jetson TX2 edge computing boards to verify the real-time performance. It achieves 17 frames per second (FPS) on TX2. The performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed MCVD model is fast, accurate and better than the existing works.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle and pedestrian detection (VaPD) is one of the most critical tasks in an advanced driver assistance system which help the driver to drive safely and save the pedestrian life. VaPD is a typical object detection problem that requires a trade-off among accuracy, speed, and memory consumption. Most existing methods focus on improving detection accuracy, while ignoring VaPD requires real-time detection speed with limited computational resources. Thus, it is of primary importance to study light-weight and real-time VaPD methods for embedded devices, that is hardware platforms with limited computation and memory resources. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a low-rank (LR) Tiny YOLO v3 architecture that meets the requirements of real-time VaPD on embedded systems. The architecture has been developed starting from Tiny YOLO v3 adopting a convolutional neural network compression technique based on Tucker tensor decomposition, able to reduce the computational complexity of the network. A wide experimentation has been carried out on two embedded platforms, Raspberry Pi 4 and NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2 GB, and two datasets commonly used for VaPD, PASCAL VOC and KITTI dataset, showing the superiority of the LR Tiny YOLO v3 with respect to the state-of-the-art networks in obtaining the best compromise between inference time, accuracy and memory occupancy.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving (AD) endows vehicles with the capability to drive partly or entirely without human intervention. AD agents generate driving policies based on online perception results, which are crucial to the realization of safe, efficient, and comfortable driving behaviors, particularly in high-dimensional and stochastic traffic scenarios. Currently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to derive and validate AD policies have witnessed vast research efforts and have shown rapid development in recent years. However, a comprehensive interpretation and evaluation of their strengths and limitations concerning the full-stack AD tasks remain uncharted. This paper presents a survey of this body of work, which is conducted at three levels. First, it analyzes the multi-level AD task characteristics and delves deeply into the current DRL methodologies primarily employed in AD. Second, a taxonomy of the literature studies is constructed from the system perspective, identifying six modes of DRL model integration into an AD architecture that span the entire spectrum of AD policy processes, from perception understanding and decision-making to motion control, as well as verification and validation. Each literature review comprehensively encompasses the main elements of designing such a system, including modeling partially observable environments, state and action spaces, reward structuring, and the design and training methodologies of neural network models. Finally, an in-depth foresight is conducted on how the eight critical issues of AD application development are addressed by the DRL models tailored for real-world AD challenges.},

However, highly complex AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD. One way to mitigate this challenge is to utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To this end, we present the first comprehensive systematic literature review of explainable methods for safe and trustworthy AD. We begin by analyzing the requirements for AI in the context of AD, focusing on three key aspects: data, model, and agency. We find that XAI is fundamental to meeting these requirements. Based on this, we explain the sources of explanations in AI and describe a taxonomy of XAI. We then identify five key contributions of XAI for safe and trustworthy AI in AD, which are interpretable design, interpretable surrogate models, interpretable monitoring, auxiliary explanations, and interpretable validation. Finally, we propose a conceptual modular framework called SafeX to integrate the reviewed methods, enabling explanation delivery to users while simultaneously ensuring the safety of AI models.},

However, the presence of uncertainties stemming from various sources poses a risk to the communication network and can alter the network topology, potentially causing instability in the multi-vehicle system. These uncertainties originate from two main sources: internal multi-vehicle system and external traffic environment. Time delays and packet losses contribute to uncertainties within the internal multi-vehicle system due to the uncontrollability of communication quality. Additionally, the dynamic nature of traffic environments introduces uncertainties related to the number of vehicles, interaction relationships, tasks, and destinations, thereby affecting communication resources and network topologies. Consequently, it is imperative to study the uncertainties faced by the multi-agent system and explore consensus methods for addressing these uncertainties. Notably, this study represents the first comprehensive review of consensus methods for both platooning and broader multi-agent cooperation in the presence of uncertain networks. Furthermore, a systematic summary of multi-agent consensus methods is presented, explicitly addressing two aspects of network uncertainty: imperfect communication transmission and the intricacies of traffic dynamics. The conclusion provides insights into open research issues, paving the way for future studies aimed at enhancing overall multi-vehicle system performance, including aspects such as convergence rate, robustness, and resilience.},

By sharing data across diverse traffic participants and coordinating with VRCIS, ICVs can achieve enhanced perception accuracy and superior driving decisions, surpassing autonomous vehicles that rely solely on onboard sensors. Existing literature explores VRCIS’ overall architecture, applications, and deployment status. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive review focusing on the overarching architecture of ICV’s perception and its associated technologies, which are fundamental to VRCIS from an information integration perspective. This gap hinders the development of a robust perception framework for VRCIS, including the crucial perception technologies specific to it. This survey seeks to bridge this gap by offering an exhaustive review of the designed VRCIS perception framework and its specific perception technologies. Firstly, an overview of VRCIS’ perception architecture is provided, and the application relationships among various perception technologies are elucidated. Then, single-node, multi-node, and vehicle-road-cloud collaborative perception technologies are explored in sequence.

In response to these challenges, mixed-reality technology has shown some great potential in ensuring safer experiments. It enables vehicles to interact simultaneously with physical and virtual objects, thereby, duplicating critical scenarios to help the vehicle to learn how to adapt.

First, to understand the views of the environment, this review considers end-to-end requirements in high-speed railway communication and the demand for seamless communication to achieve the desired Quality of Service. The second perspective on network communication considers the properties of Information-Centric Networking, which leverages the inherent idea of using packet data as a first-class citizen and an embedded mobility technique. The last approach is delivery/physical environment, which directly corresponds to and interacts with the user’s device/equipment through large bandwidth leverage by light fidelity. The three mentioned aspects of railway communication are surveyed, which results in identifying critical factors to achieve a better quality of service in a high-speed railway environment: resource allocation, load balancing, and traffic engineering. The three critical factors need supporting parameters to realize the ever-demand content-hungry paradigm in a high-speed environment. Thus, the main contribution of this work is to present supporting parameters gathered from notable works that have been scrutinized for their appropriateness to serve network communication and content delivery under quality of service demand.

  abstract     = {The advent of technology has led to substantial progress in the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), indicating that AVs will become a generic mode of transport in the near future. However, there is a long journey ahead before we fully transition into an era dominated by AVs. Consequently, it is anticipated that traditional vehicles (TVs) and AVs will share the roadways in the coming years. AVs and TVs exhibit marked differences in aspects such as response time to signals and capability to share destination information. These differences suggest that traffic control policies designed exclusively for TVs may be substantially different from those suitable for a blend of AVs and TVs. To reconcile these disparities, the separation of lanes or roads for AVs and TVs could present a more effective strategy for traffic management. Moreover, the optimal traffic signal pattern at each intersection could depend on the AV-to-TV ratio. Through the implementation of an intelligent transportation system, the traffic control system can better manage mixed-flow scenarios for multi-intersection positions. This study defines a multi-intersection mixed traffic control problem (MIMTCP), in which both AVs and TVs pass through multiple signalized intersections. In addressing the MIMTCP, three primary subproblems were identified: traffic signal control, lane allocation, and trajectory planning. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the scholarly efforts directed at resolving these subproblems through the use of optimization algorithms, data-driven learning-based methodologies, and simulation-based approaches. Finally, we delve into promising research opportunities within each subproblem, with an emphasis on the development of strategic solutions and methodological approaches.},

In contemporary mobility contexts, comprehending and accurately predicting drivers’ behaviours are crucial for informing efficient transportation planning, enhancing traffic safety, reducing emissions, and improving driving efficiency. An increasing number of researchers have explored a variety of machine learning (ML) models to identify, classify, and predict drivers’ behaviours. However, the reliability of these results is often undermined by the complexities associated with the data characteristics, contexts, and the authors’ expertise. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive investigation into the effect of driving behaviour on vehicles’ performance, driver identity, and driving activities. This research aims to compare various ML methods to establish a conclusive and generalisable empirical benchmark. The experiments were divided into three phases: estimation of fuel consumption, driver identification, and driver actions’ prediction from drivers’ behaviour during motion. The experiments evaluate prediction accuracy, performance, and computational cost using a different range of temporal and nontemporal ML models and eight datasets from diverse sources, which resulted in 9 tables of outputs. The results have been gauged and scored precisely, and then high-rated and ineffective algorithms were pinpointed for each task. This study is the most in-depth investigation, providing an exhaustive comparison of different ML models for predicting three main criteria of driving behaviour, marking it as the most detailed investigation in this field.},

However, frequent changes in the topology of VANETs have resulted in poor vehicle communication quality, highly susceptible to communication link breaks and data transmission reliability decreases, and the cost of vehicular communication increases continuously. In this paper, an Adaptive K-medoids based on Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (AK-GPSR) algorithm is proposed in multi-channel vehicular network communication of urban scenario. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm, aiming to form high-quality link communication, more stable network topology, and improved data information transmission reliability. First, the proposed AK-GPSR algorithm applies Gap statistic to evaluate the K-medoids algorithm and select the best K value. Further, the K-medoids algorithm clusters the vehicles in the simulation area by the optimal K-value to divide the K clusters. Finally, the packets are forwarded from the source vehicle to the destination vehicle or Road Side Unit (RSU) using the forwarding method of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed AK-GPSR algorithm has good performance and applicability in multi-channel vehicular network communication.},

  abstract     = {Road surface conditions, especially geometry profiles, enormously affect driving performance of autonomous vehicles. Vision-based online road reconstruction promisingly captures road information in advance. Existing solutions like monocular depth estimation and stereo matching suffer from modest performance. The recent technique of Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) perception provides immense potential to more reliable and accurate reconstruction. This paper uniformly proposes two simple yet effective models for road elevation reconstruction in BEV named RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo, which estimate road elevation with monocular and stereo images, respectively. The former directly fits elevation values based on voxel features queried from image view, while the latter efficiently recognizes road elevation patterns based on BEV volume representing correlation between left and right voxel features. Insightful analyses reveal their consistence and difference with the perspective view. Experiments on real-world dataset verify the models’ effectiveness and superiority. Elevation errors of RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo achieve 1.83 cm and 0.50 cm, respectively. Our models are promising for practical road preview, providing essential information for promoting safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles.

  abstract     = {Traditional insurance policy models involve cumbersome multiparty verification and processing, leading to a prolonged and time-consuming procedure resulting in claim leakage. The existing insurance and blockchain-based systems have no module specifically for electric vehicles to cover physical damage. This becomes particularly significant in electric vehicles (EVs), where insurance is essential due to the high cost of vehicle parts and the vehicles themselves. Electric vehicles with various sensors and IoT devices are susceptible to physical damage and attacks. To address these challenges and provide robust financial support to policyholders, an enhanced blockchain-based electric vehicle insurance policy (BE-VIP) is proposed to cover vehicle damages. BE-VIP leverages sensory and telemetry data from vehicle sensors, IoT devices, and drivers’ behavior for a more comprehensive analysis. However, the insecure nature of the public network in the internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) exposes it to various security threats and attacks. Recognizing this, BE-VIP emphasizes implementing a lightweight privacy-preserving and efficient authentication protocol to enhance network security. A secure driver-driving score (DDS) is proposed to reward and punish the vehicle based on driving behavioral data and easy insurance policy transfer from the previous owner to the current owner. To prevent fraudulent accidental claims, a YOLOv8 model-based damage detection model is combined with IPFS to create permanent evidence of an accident. The feasibility of the BE-VIP model is rigorously evaluated through a comprehensive analysis, considering factors such as computational complexity and gas consumption required for execution over the Ethereum blockchain network.},

Then, to carry out the platoon objective within given time, a novel finite-time sliding mode control scheme is further developed, wherein the unknown nonlinear dynamics is approximated by a fuzzy logic system (FLS), and both compound individual vehicle stability and string stability are assured. In particular, asymptotic convergence with zero spacing error is also hold under the given control scheme.

This paper focuses on the relatively unexplored domain of Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) in the context of detecting adversarial attacks. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of six prominent adversarial example detection methods, each representing a distinct detection category and well-regarded within the research community. Our methodology involves adapting these techniques, originally developed for general image classification (IC), to the unique challenges posed by traffic sign images, characterized by their complexity due to factors like varying environmental conditions and a large number of classes. Our study reveals insights into their effectiveness, with the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) method outperforming others with 83.42%, 86.42%, and 99.96% detection rates; 0.08%, 0.05%, and 0.04%, false positive rates; and 0.02sec, 0.01sec, and 0.02sec detection times for Chinese, Belgium and German traffic sign datasets, respectively. NSS’s superiority is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Our study also sheds light on the often-neglected aspect of detection time in IC, which plays a vital role in ensuring operational efficiency and safety for autonomous vehicles. Our research highlights the need for customized defense strategies tailored to the TSC domain, considering our evaluation’s findings. By identifying promising techniques for detecting adversarial attacks in TSC, we contribute to enhancing the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems.

With the development of the Internet of Things and Sharing Economy, a new long-haul trucking strategy (a novel swap-body mode) we design, in which drivers cooperate in completing all transportation tasks by exchanging goods, has great potential for practical application to alleviate these two issues. In this paper, we developed a concise mixed integer programming model with dedicated efficient cuts to formulate the new mode and its two restricted versions and designed a heuristic minimum empty-load algorithm and an ant colony optimization algorithm to efficiently provide exchange solutions. Our experimental results show that the novel swap-body mode can reduce the total operating costs and the average working hours of drivers by an average of 34.06% and 29.29%, respectively, compared to the traditional mode. Its excellent performance remains under severe restrictions and various conditions, indicating its robustness, and remains when demands have different distribution characteristics claiming its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing(MEC) ensures continuous MEC services by promptly restoring overloaded or disabled MEC infrastructure. Equipped with sufficient computing resources, UAVs deploy to areas needing MEC, such as task offloading and entertainment services. However, in areas with paralyzed edge nodes, vehicle users are unable to verify the legitimacy of UAVs as they cannot access to the trusted authority(TA). Furthermore, the integrity of UAV-assisted MEC environments can be compromised by malicious attackers, as all network participants rely on wireless communication for their interactions. Many authentication schemes have been proposed for UAV environments. However, these schemes encounter a problem of having to communicate through TA for authentication with vehicle users, which makes them difficult to apply to UAV-assisted MEC environments. Therefore, we propose a new broadcast authentication protocol, which can recover MEC services using MEC-equipped UAVs. The proposed protocol can provide UAVs and vehicle users with high reliability via a self-certified public-key cryptosystem, which can verify the legitimacy of the communication partner without the TA. Moreover, we guarantee the user privacy and preserve sensitive information using biohash technology. We verify the security robustness of the proposed protocol using various simulation tool, informal, and formal analyses. We also estimate the practical deployment of the proposed protocol using “Network Simulator-3”. Moreover, we estimate the computation and communication overheads and compare with other existing protocols. The results show that the proposed protocol is feasible and provides users with convenient and seamless intelligent transportation services in UAV-assisted MEC environments.},

In this paper, we propose E-Argus, a system that leverages the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by the memory of drones. It is a basic fact that, with all types of drones, the implementation of arbitrary behavior must be digested in the built-in memory, and electromagnetic radiation is thus generated. Specifically, the memory clock drives the switching regulator causing current fluctuations that generate EMR signals at the clock frequency. E-Argus combines the relationship between the flight pattern of the drone and the memory EMR signal, analyzes the unique side-channel signatures, and utilizes advanced neural network-based identification; E-Argus can accurately detect and identify various types of illegal drones. We designed a system prototype based on USRP B210 and conducted experiments in a wide range of scenarios.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the task of Auditory Referring Multi-Object Tracking (AR-MOT), which dynamically tracks specific objects in a video sequence based on audio expressions and appears as a challenging problem in autonomous driving. Due to the lack of semantic modeling capacity in audio and video, existing works have mainly focused on text-based multi-object tracking, which often comes at the cost of tracking quality, interaction efficiency, and even the safety of assistance systems, limiting the application of such methods in autonomous driving. In this paper, we delve into the problem of AR-MOT from the perspective of audio-video fusion and audio-video tracking. We put forward EchoTrack, an end-to-end AR-MOT framework with dual-stream vision transformers. The dual streams are intertwined with our Bidirectional Frequency-domain Cross-attention Fusion Module (Bi-FCFM), which bidirectionally fuses audio and video features from both frequency- and spatiotemporal domains. Moreover, we propose the Audio-visual Contrastive Tracking Learning (ACTL) regime to extract homogeneous semantic features between expressions and visual objects by learning homogeneous features between different audio and video objects effectively. Aside from the architectural design, we establish the first set of large-scale AR-MOT benchmarks, including Echo-KITTI, Echo-KITTI+, and Echo-BDD. Extensive experiments on the established benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EchoTrack and its components.

  abstract     = {Intelligent detection of pavement damage is crucial to road maintenance. Timely identification of cracks and potholes helps prolong the road service life. Current detection models fail to balance accuracy and speed. In this study, we propose a fast damage detection algorithm named FPDDN to achieve real-time and high-accuracy pavement damage detection. FPDDN integrates the deformable transformer, D2f block, and SFB module to predict pavement damage of different sizes in multiple branches. The deformable transformer allows the FPDDN to exhibit adaptability to geometric variations in road defects, thereby improving the detection accuracy of irregular defects such as cracks. D2f block is mainly used to lightweight the network and increase the inference speed. The SFB module can significantly decrease the loss of information during downsampling of small-sized objects. This integration enhances the model’s ability to extract global damage features, reduces the loss of information on small-scale defects, and improves the synergy between deep and shallow feature layers. The model’s performance was evaluated using the RDD2022 dataset, focusing on inference speed and detection accuracy. When compared to state-of-the-art models such as YOLO v8, FPDDN has a parameter count that is only one-fifth of that of YOLO v8x, yet it surpasses YOLO v8x in detection accuracy. The FPDDN achieved an F1 score of 0.601 and a mAP50 of 0.610 on the RDD2022 dataset, outperforming the compared models. Additionally, the algorithm achieved a balance between accuracy and speed with an inference speed of 1.8ms for pavement damage detection.},

Meanwhile, considering the lack of an effective framework for the proposed TSI task in existing works, we design a multi-task learning architecture (TSI-arch) to detect and recognize various traffic signs with drastic changes in sizes and aspect ratios. Meanwhile interpreting these signs into a natural language like a human according to Chinese design criteria of road traffic signs. Furthermore, the absence of a public TSI available dataset prompts us to build a traffic sign interpretation dataset, namely TSI-CN. The dataset consists of real road scene images, which are captured from the highway and the urban way in China from a driver’s perspective. It contains rich location labels of texts, symbols, and guide panels, and the corresponding natural language description labels. Experiments on our TSI-CN dataset demonstrate that the TSI task is achievable and the TSI architecture can interpret traffic signs from scenes successfully even if there is a complicated semantic logic among signs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent sensing for transportation systems is receiving widespread attention due to its dynamic flexibility and collaborative capabilities, where the target sensing error is limited by the spatio-temporal error caused by agent localization and formation steps. This paper considers the sensing problem of non-cooperative targets (UAVs or vehicles) by cooperative asynchronous agents (UAVs). This paper develops a framework where the formation of agents and the allocation of resources are jointly optimized. In particular, we reveal the error coupling of measurement and motion noises on target sensing accuracy by Fisher information analysis. Then we propose bandwidth allocation and agent activation strategies in the localization step, which simultaneously improve the position accuracy of agents and the quality of sensing signals. In the formation step, we design motion planning algorithms to increase sensing information about targets. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed algorithms that minimize the effects of localization and control errors on target sensing.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems generate an unprecedented amount of high-dimensional traffic data. The proper analysis of such data can transform traffic monitoring mechanisms. However, existing monitoring methods for detecting abrupt changes in traffic patterns have two limitations. First, they do not capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic data and are not equipped with a built-in mechanism to handle missing observations. To address these limitations, this study proposes a dynamic, robust tensor completion method to monitor and detect changes in partially observed traffic data streams. The proposed method simultaneously completes and decomposes the partially observed data into a sum of a low-rank tensor that captures the spatiotemporal patterns and a sparse tensor that captures anomalies. Subsequently, the proposed method defines a statistic monitored by an exponentially weighted moving average control chart to detect abrupt temporal changes. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation and case studies. The simulation results indicate the proposed method outperforms all benchmarks. It can also detect changes more than twice as fast as other benchmarks in terms of average run length in most scenarios. The proposed method is also applied to the traffic data in New York City to evaluate its performance in detecting unusual traffic patterns when Hurricane Sandy hit the city. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in quickly detecting unusual changes at both network and road segment levels. Particularly, the proposed method detects changes in traffic patterns approximately twelve hours earlier than the next best alternative benchmark method.},

  abstract     = {To achieve accurate traffic forecasting, previous research has employed inner and outer aggregation for information aggregation, and attention mechanisms for heterogeneous spatiotemporal dependency learning, which results in inefficient model learning. While learning efficiency is critical due to the need for updating frequently the model to alleviate the impact of concept drift, limited work has focused on improving it. For efficient learning and accurate forecasting, this study proposes the dynamic spatiotemporal straight-flow network (DSTSFN). Breaking the aggregation paradigms employing both inner and outer aggregation, which may be redundant, the DSTSFN designs a straight-flow network that employs bipartite graphs to learn directly the dependencies between the source and target nodes for outer aggregation only. Instead of the attention mechanisms, the dynamic graphs/networks, which outdo static ones by possessing time-varying dependencies, are designed in the DSTSFN to distinguish the dependency heterogeneity, making the model relatively streamlined. Additionally, two learning strategies based on respectively the curriculum and transfer learning are developed to further improve the learning efficiency of the DSTSFN. Our study could be the first work designing the learning strategies for the multi-step traffic predictor based on dynamic spatiotemporal graphs. The learning efficiency and forecasting accuracy are demonstrated by experiments, which show that the DSTSFN can outperform not only the state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor for accuracy by achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy and requiring only 8.98% of the average training time, but also the SOTA predictor for efficiency by achieving a 9.26% improvement in accuracy and requiring 91.68% of the average training time.},

An algorithm is also proposed to realize some actual traffic scenarios such as multi-lane vehicle merging and a single vehicle joining or exiting a platoon. In contrast to the existing results, under stochastic FDIAs, the considered fault directions can be unknown, time-varying, and limitless continuously transformed, as well as the fault frequency is not limited. A novel Nussbaum function with a bounded and adjustable amplitude is constructed using the idea of time-elongation (instead of amplitude-elongation) to attenuate the control input shocks caused by the amplitude-elongation Nussbaum function and to solve the ULRFD problem effectively. Furthermore, two Zeno-free event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs) respectively for velocity and angular velocity are constructed to reduce the communication cost on the controller-actuator channels. It is worth mentioning that a passive intrusion-tolerant method without introducing any additional learning parameter is adopted to solve stochastic FDIAs on the controller-actuator channels. This simplifies our controller structure and reduces the online computational load. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and supremacy of the proposed control strategy and algorithm.},

In response, we propose a novel hierarchical heterogeneous multi-agent (HHMA) framework designed for underwater search scenarios. This framework integrates three types of vehicles moving in different domains—unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles, effectively overcoming the limitations of single or double-agent configurations. We begin by elucidating the advantages of the HHMA system in target searching, providing the kinematic modeling, while also transforming sonar detecting data and defining the search problem. The mission is decomposed to three human-comprehensible subtasks that are adaptive to both environmental conditions and equipment capabilities: moving, target estimating and trajectory planning. The target estimating subtask is effectively modeled as a Markov Decision Process, retaining its memory capability. Additionally, we extend multi-agent reinforcement learning to multi-policy reinforcement learning, facilitating the training of interdependent policies. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through simulations, comparing it with rule-based methods. Simulation results underscore the significance of the HHMA system and validate the proposed training methodology.},

Firstly, a zonotopic observer satisfying the peak-bounded index is proposed to reduce the influence of uncertainties and improve the accuracy of fault estimation. Moreover, with the aid of the zonotopic observer, the range of the sliding surface affected by the estimation errors and model uncertainties can be evaluated, and the dynamic quasi-sliding mode domain (QSMD) can be obtained. As a result, the dynamic QSMD can help design the parameters of the sliding mode fault-tolerant controller, ensure the stability and convergence of the entire closed-loop control system. Meanwhile, the conservative problem caused by manual parameters setting is avoided.

  abstract     = {Recently, low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) methods by exploiting the global low-rankness of the target tensor have shown great potential for traffic data imputation. However, in real-world transportation networks, traffic data usually suffer from more complicated structural missing patterns than random-missing patterns, e.g., tube-missing patterns due to disruptions in wireless connections or slice-missing mechanism caused by sensor maintenance. As the naturally low-rank structure of traffic data in several missing scenarios, the existing LRTC methods indeed refrain from desirable performance for imputing traffic data. To tackle the complicated missing scenarios, we propose a convolutional low-rank tensor representation (CLRTR). Especially, CLRTR represents each unfolding matrix of the tensor as a sum of convolutions between two-dimensional (2D) filters and the corresponding low-rank coefficients, which allows us to simultaneously reveal the local patterns and the low-rankness of traffic data. Based on the CLRTR, we introduce the corresponding low-rank metric CLRTR-rank. Based on the suggested low-rank metric, we propose a traffic data imputation model that is well-suited to the complicated missing data scenarios. To implement the resultant imputation model, we design the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive numerical experiments on several real-world traffic datasets for both traffic data imputation and downstream traffic data prediction highlight the superiority of our model over the existing state-of-the-art matrix/tensor models for extensive missing scenarios.},

However, these schemes either lack sufficient anonymity, physical security, or electricity consumption data aggregation for electricity dispatch. In light of these considerations, we propose a comprehensive solution—a physically secure and privacy-preserving charging authentication framework with data aggregation, comprising two foundational schemes. The first scheme introduces a fully anonymous authentication system. In this approach, an Electric Vehicle (EV) seeking charging generates a random signature for its charging request. Subsequently, a Charging Station (CS) verifies the signature, granting charging services upon successful validation. Notably, this process guarantees the EV’s real identity remains undisclosed, even to the Control Center (CC). Moreover, this scheme also addresses potential physical attacks through the incorporation of a physical unclonable function. The second scheme involves a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, aggregating total electricity consumption of CSs in a given area while simultaneously preserving individual CSs’ electricity consumption data from potential leakage. Subsequently, the aggregated electricity consumption data is transmitted back to the CC, enabling efficient electricity coordination. A detailed security and privacy analysis demonstrates that our proposed framework meets intended security and privacy objectives. The final performance evaluation underscores the advantages of our proposed framework in comparison with related work.},

  abstract     = {Travel time reliability is a major factor affecting travelers’ route and mode choice behaviors, which is an important aspect of intelligent transportation systems. The calculation of travel time reliability measures is founded on the travel time distribution function. In practice, directly fitting the route-level travel time distribution function using complete route-level travel time data is challenging. As an alternative to route-level travel time data, segment-level travel time data are more abundant and easier to obtain. However, existing estimation methods of route travel time distribution function either neglect travel time correlation among segments, or rely on historical route-level data, or assume a single distribution type for all segments or routes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a moment-based method of estimating the route travel time distribution function that uses only segment-level travel time data. The proposed method estimates the correlation coefficients of segment travel times using the Rearrangement Inequality. Then, the four moments of route travel time are analytically derived. By further employing the corrected Cornish-Fisher expansion, the proposed method ultimately provides an analytical expression for the route travel time distribution function without assuming the distribution functions of segments or routes. The accuracy of the method is examined using data from a license plate recognition system on an expressway in Shenzhen and taxis GPS in Beijing. The proposed method enables a precise calculation of route travel time reliability in road networks that is quite important to travelers’ behavioral decisions and managers’ operational decisions.},

Leveraging Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) technology, SAVs can potentially operate continuously meet passenger demands, presenting a complex challenge known as the SAV routing and dynamic wireless charging problem (SVRCP). However, traditional heuristic algorithms, which typically reliant on extensive experiential rule settings, fall short in addressing the multiple objectives and complex constraints of SVRCP. Therefore, we propose a Deep Slack Induction by String Removals-based Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) framework, specifically designed to optimise cost-efficiency and energy stabilisation in SAVs operating with DWC conditions. First, a traffic-vehicle cooperation model, grounded in real-world road networks, is constructed to facilitate interactions for the DSRL’s encoder. We then integrate the Slack Induction by String Removals algorithm to adaptively optimise the DSRL parameters, enhancing the decoder’s ability to find reliable solutions. Experiments show that DSRL outperforms heuristic methods in optimising route cost and stabilising the State-of-Charge (SOC) of SAVs, while achieving a more centralised $\Delta $ SOC distribution, ensuring the continuous operational capability of the SAVs. The results across instance sizes and DWC power demonstrate DSRL’s robust generalisation capabilities and efficient training capabilities facilitated by transfer learning. Additionally, sensitivity analysis from the perspectives of depot location, passenger distribution, and power levels offers insights for DWC road layout.},

  abstract     = {With the benefits of compact size and cost effectiveness, the solid-state LiDAR (SSL) has emerged as the preferred choice for the mass-produced vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). To ensure precise and dependable mapping for ADAS, it is essential to accurately fuse LiDAR and inertial measurements through precise extrinsic calibration. However, the existing extrinsic calibration methods primarily target the mechanical LiDAR and global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS), with limited research dedicated to the extrinsic calibration of SSL and GNSS/INS for the mass-produced vehicles. To achieve accurate calibration between the SSL and GNSS/INS, we develop a targetless extrinsic calibration method based on multiple constraints, called MCSGCalib. Specifically, we first propose a high-level geometric feature extraction approach based on the adaptive voxel to efficiently obtain the high-level geometric features for the SSL. Based on the extracted geometric features and ego-motion information, we construct multiple derived-friendly constraints, and fuse the motion constraints and geometric constraints into a unified manifold optimization framework in order to accurately estimate extrinsic parameters for the mass-produced vehicles, even in the presence of degenerate motions. To validate the performance of MCSGCalib, we conduct comprehensive experiments using the data collected from our mass-produced vehicles equipped with RS-LiDAR-M1, a recently released SSL extensively deployed in the mass-produced vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the MCSGCalib in calibrating the extrinsic parameters between the SSL and GNSS/INS, showcasing its potential in enhancing the reliability and quality of the SSL and GNSS/INS fusion for ADAS.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing academic interest as well as commercial exploitation of millimetre-wave scanning radar for autonomous vehicle localisation and scene understanding. Although several datasets to support this research area have been released, they are primarily focused on urban or semi-urban environments. Nevertheless, rugged offroad deployments are important application areas which also present unique challenges and opportunities for this sensor technology. Therefore, the Oxford Offroad Radar Dataset (OORD) presents data collected in the rugged Scottish highlands in extreme weather. The radar data we offer to the community are accompanied by GPS/INS reference – to further stimulate research in radar place recognition. In total we release over 90 GiB of radar scans as well as GPS and IMU readings by driving a diverse set of four routes over 11 forays, totalling approximately 154 km of rugged driving. This is an area increasingly explored in literature, and we therefore present and release examples of recent open-sourced radar place recognition systems and their performance on our dataset. This includes a learned neural network, the weights of which we also release. The data and tools are made freely available to the community at oxford-robotics-institute.github.io/oord-dataset},

  abstract     = {Dense depth recovery is crucial in autonomous driving, serving as a foundational element for obstacle avoidance, 3D object detection, and local path planning. Adverse weather conditions, including haze, dust, rain, snow, and darkness, introduce significant challenges to accurate dense depth estimation, thereby posing substantial safety risks in autonomous driving. These challenges are particularly pronounced for traditional depth estimation methods that rely on short electromagnetic wave sensors, such as visible spectrum cameras and near-infrared LiDAR, due to their susceptibility to diffraction noise and occlusion in such environments. To fundamentally overcome this issue, we present a novel approach for robust metric depth estimation by fusing a millimeter-wave radar and a monocular infrared thermal camera, which are capable of penetrating atmospheric particles and unaffected by lighting conditions. Our proposed Radar-Infrared fusion method achieves highly accurate and finely detailed dense depth estimation through three stages, including monocular depth prediction with global scale alignment, quasi-dense radar augmentation by learning radar-pixels correspondences, and local scale refinement of dense depth using a scale map learner. Our method achieves exceptional visual quality and accurate metric estimation by addressing the challenges of ambiguity and misalignment that arise from directly fusing multi-modal long-wave features. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the NTU4DRadLM dataset and our self-collected challenging ZJU-Multispectrum dataset. Especially noteworthy is the unprecedented robustness demonstrated by our proposed method in smoky scenarios. Our code will be released at https://github.com/MMOCKING/RIDERS .},

  abstract     = {To realize the benefits expected and ensure user privacy and data security simultaneously, a cost-efficient edge federated learning (FL) architecture over multiple base stations (BSs) is proposed for the intelligent transportation system (ITS) based on connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Firstly, in the proposed FL architecture, the road side units (RSUs) are designed to train the machine learning (ML) model with the BSs equipped with edge servers collaboratively. In this way, since the autonomous vehicles do not participate in model training, the negative impact of unreliable communication caused by vehicle mobility can be eliminated. Then, considering that the limited amount of data involved within the coverage of a single base station (BS), the FL architecture over multiple BSs at network edge is proposed for better learning performance. Along this line, the joint edge aggregation and association problem is studied, and a set function optimization problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the costs considering latency and energy consumption comprehensively. Finally, after analyzing the complexity, monotonicity, and modularity of the problem formulated, the NP-hardness optimization problem is further decomposed and transformed, and an innovative solution is proposed. The abundant simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the cost-efficient FL architecture proposed.},

  abstract     = {Air-ground Integrated Mobility (AIM), as a disruptive mode of travel, has the tremendous potential to alleviate ground traffic congestion issues substantially. However, the primary challenge in achieving this leapfrog development lies in ensuring driving safety. Receiving collision warnings in time within a limited distance can significantly reduce collision risks, which is crucial for ensuring driving safety in AIM. However, due to challenges in aerial network coverage, ensuring the communication quality of aerial Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAVs) remains difficult, thereby affecting the effective transmission of messages. Furthermore, the integration of ground Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) with aerial PAVs in AIM results in significant differences in user resource requirements. Given the complexity of the AIM environment and the high mobility of PAVs, it is challenging to rapidly and accurately capture user communication quality. Therefore, addressing the differential resource requirements of users in this environment is particularly challenging. To this end, we propose a personalized resource allocation strategy assisted by a Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) in AIM. This strategy aims to meet the personalized resource requirements of users while maintaining the maximum Perception Response Time (PRT), thereby ensuring driving safety. Specifically, the CKM in AIM is constructed to obtain channel states through environment-aware communication. Next, a 3D collision warning system is designed to analyze rigorously the maximum PRT of vehicles under different motion states in avoiding collisions. On this basis, with the help of CKM, the channel knowledge of the user’s location is obtained to quantify the communication and computing resources required by each user to maintain the maximum PRT. Finally, we establish the PRT-driven resource optimization problem and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to seek the optimal resource allocation strategy. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method effectively enhances safety and resource utilization in AIM under resource constraints and uneven distribution.},

  abstract     = {Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging aviation concept envisioned to provide urban transportation with safe and on-demand air travel for both passengers and cargo. In UAM, maintaining a minimum separation between aircraft is a safety requirement that becomes challenging to meet amidst congested air traffic and off-nominal conditions, such as Loss of Control In-flight (LOC-I) of aircraft. Often, separation loss caused by LOC-I results in subsequent separation losses, triggering domino effects as one aircraft maneuvers to avoid another aircraft experiencing LOC-I in congested air traffic. This paper therefore presents an on-the-fly, integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework to address the separation losses caused by LOC-I. A Behavior Tree-based decentralized decision-making is employed to execute a separation assurance task assigned by the provider of service to UAM (PSU), coordinating and selecting the necessary maneuvers based on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) right-of-way rules to resolve the encountered separation losses. To execute the selected maneuver, an optimization-based receding horizon trajectory planning is employed to generate safe and optimal trajectories by taking into account the aircraft dynamics, maneuver direction, and minimum safe separation distance between aircraft. Further, a UAM simulation environment is developed for verification and testing of UAM traffic management algorithms, allowing the implementation of on-the-fly conflict detection, tasking, and planning algorithms to resolve the separation losses. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by considering various separation loss scenarios arising from LOC-I, such as overtaking, converging, and head-on separation losses, within the developed UAM simulation environment.},

  abstract     = {Distracted driving poses a serious threat to traffic safety and remains a widespread problem, highlighting the crucial need for effective recognition of distracted drivers. However, developing models that can generalize across diverse and changing real-world driving conditions is profoundly challenging. Variations in factors like lighting, weather, vehicle type, and drivers complicate generalization. Addressing this critical limitation is key to building recognition models with robust performance for practical deployment. This study presents a novel two-stage unsupervised domain adaptation framework to tackle the important challenge of recognizing distracted drivers across differing environments. The framework first constructs softly assigned class prototypes capturing underlying data structure by aggregating features locally and reweighting sample-prototype relationships globally, which increases the accuracy of class representations. The framework then aligns the probabilities between test samples and prototypes across source and target domains using soft distributional alignment, reducing domain gaps without explicit labeling of the target data. A growth control function balances prototype alignment with classification and adversarial losses. Experiments on distracted driver and object recognition datasets demonstrate this two-stage approach outperforms previous methods, especially under changing driving environments, which is an important problem distracted driving detection research must overcome to effectively enhance road safety.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection is an important task in computer vision, which is also an important part of intelligent transportation systems. For privacy protection, thermal images are widely used in pedestrian detection problems. However, thermal pedestrian detection is challenging due to the significant effect of temperature variation on the illumination of images and that fine-grained illumination annotations are difficult to be acquired. The existing methods have attempted to exploit coarse-grained day/night labels, which however even hampers the model performance. In this work, we introduce a novel idea of regressing conditional thermal-visible feature distribution, dubbed as Illumination Distribution-Aware adaptation (IDA). The key idea is to predict the conditional visible feature distribution given a thermal image, subject to their pre-computed joint distribution. Specifically, we first estimate the thermal-visible feature joint distribution by constructing feature co-occurrence matrices, offering a conditional probability distribution for any given thermal image. With this pairing information, we then form a conditional probability distribution regression task for model optimization. Critically, as a model agnostic strategy, this allows the visible feature knowledge to be transferred to the thermal counterpart implicitly for learning more discriminating feature representation. Experiment results show that our method outperforms the prior art methods, which use extra illumination annotations. Besides, as a plug-in, our method can averagely reduce about 2% MR on KAIST dataset, and improve about 1% mAP on FLIR-aligned and Autonomous Vehicles datasets without extra calculation for test.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the imputation of spatiotemporal traffic data has emerged as a critical area of research within intelligent transportation systems. A commonly employed approach is low-rank matrix/tensor completion combined with additional spatiotemporal regularization techniques. However, many existing methods simply incorporate these regularizations into the low-rank model, resulting in models that are highly sensitive to trade-off parameters and yield mediocre results. Motivated by this problem, in this paper, we propose a method called Low-Rank Tensor Completion with 3D Spatiotemporal Transform (LRTC-3DST) for traffic data imputation, which effectively integrates low-rankness with three types of spatiotemporal characteristics in a fused manner and thus avoids trade-off parameters. We first design three specific transformations including graph Laplacian transform, fractional difference transform and periodic circulant transform for encoding the spatial local consistency, temporal local consistency and approximate periodicity of 3D traffic data, respectively. Then the LRTC-3DST model is proposed by using the truncated tensor nuclear norm on the three spatiotemporal feature tensors. The proposed model is optimized via the alternating direction multipliers method. Extensive experiments on a series of real traffic datasets demonstrate that our LRTC-3DST significantly outperforms numerous related methods, even when the missing rate is as high as 99%.

The reference X-dynamics together with a conditional disturbance cancellation scheme are developed to avoid the cancellation of beneficial nonlinearities and beneficial disturbances, respectively, which can reduce energy consumption without any optimization calculation or hardware alteration. Importantly, the error signals can converge to a predefined bound within the predefined time interval. Both the settling time and the residual bound can be arbitrarily user-defined, which are independent of initial states and control gains. Especially, to avoid singularity and alleviate chattering, a continuous piecewise function and a quadratic fraction inequality are constructed. The utilization of the proposed predefined-time fault-tolerant control facilitates satisfactory ride comfort with low energy cost.

  abstract     = {Fast charging technology is crucial for widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption. To enhance efficiency and scalability, charging equipment manufacturers are shifting towards a modular architecture in fast charging stations (FCSs). This architecture features multiple converter modules and charging ports, allowing flexible power allocation through module-to-port assignment. However, it introduces challenges, particularly when ports operate with fewer modules, necessitating EV charging scheduling schemes to allocate limited FCS capacity while maintaining high quality-of-service (QoS). Traditional scheduling methods are ill-suited for modular FCS settings due to unique characteristics such as discrete module-to-port allocation, state-of-charge-dependent charge curves, and power ramp rate limits. This work proposes a social welfare-inspired EV scheduling framework for modular FCSs, using lexicographic optimization and receding horizon control. The framework includes a computationally efficient charge curve model based on sliding convex hulls and a mathematical model tailored for modular FCSs. The three-stage lexicographic model, derived from Rawlsian and Benthamite social welfare theories, accommodates customer preferences and EV characteristics for high QoS provision. A welfare score metric, adapted from social welfare theories, is also introduced for multi-faceted QoS assessment. Across ceteris paribus experiments, the proposed framework consistently outperforms three benchmark methods, with a margin of up to 34% in welfare scores over the second-best method. In a diverse set of randomized EV arrival scenarios, the framework enables a median welfare around 85%, outperforming the benchmarks by at least 7.8%, with statistical tests confirming its significance. Moreover, ramp rate violations are kept at a minimum, while the computational efficiency and scalability are verified.},

In this partly known nonlinear system, an optimal control algorithm using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed to deal with the communication latence and drivers’ reaction time, which can stabilize the system under the influence of dead zone and saturation with minimal cost. There are three contributions in this paper. Firstly, in the used ADP algorithm, a critic neural network (NN) is designed to estimate the optimal value of the cost function, which is updated using online data instead of pre-gathered data. This means that the proposed controller can adapt to different parameters of different systems. Secondly, the reaction time of human driver and the time latence of the V2V communication are considered as the state and input delay of the nonlinear system, by adding the terms of delayed states to the optimal value function, the influence of the time delay can be minimized in the process of the critic NN updating. Thirdly, the saturation and dead zone of actuator are considered, by designing a new utility function of control value, the control value is limited from being out of the expected range. Under this condition, the stabilization of the overall system and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is proved and validated by means of simulation results.},

Many advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including functions like lane-keeping assist and car following, are already implemented in vehicles for controlled environments such as highways. However, to enhance the capabilities of current ADAS, it is essential to extend their application to more general scenarios, like urban driving. Urban environments pose considerable challenges due to the high density of traffic participants, including pedestrians and cyclists, whose behaviors are unpredictable and necessitate strong interactions with self-driving vehicles. Addressing these complex interactions through real-time decision-making is particularly challenging but crucial for effective operation in real-world urban settings. This paper aims to bring the decision-making process of autonomous driving techniques closer to real life by proposing a motion planning and decision-making framework that utilizes game theory to formulate and consider strong interactions. Additionally, we introduce a human-like attention-based traffic actor filter to enable the autonomous vehicle to focus on critical traffic participants with a higher risk of collision. The framework is tested in both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that the algorithm can make safe and efficient decisions under various traffic scenarios involving multiple types of traffic participants in real time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a neural adaptive formation control problem for underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Considering the limitation of communication distance and the security of formation systems, collision-free and connectivity maintenance are guaranteed by defining a prescribed-time tuning function and proper error transformation. Furthermore, a new nonlinear first-order filter, solving the complexity problem, is designed to promote the system performance. Subsequently, neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate USVs’ dynamics and their transient performance is improved by prediction error. By blending prediction errors and neural approximation, it is guaranteed the general external disturbances and approximation errors are compensated via constructed disturbance observers (DOs), simultaneously. Meanwhile, utilizing the minimal number of learning parameters (MNLPs) methodology, the number of NNs’ learning parameters can be significantly reduced. It is rigorously proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded via Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are presented to verify the effectiveness and advantages of theoretical results.},

Although previous studies in simulated environments provided insights into human-automation interaction, real-world experiences can differ significantly. The research was conducted on a segment of German interstate with 30 participants lacking familiarity with SAE Level 3 ADS. Pre- and post-driving questionnaires were used to assess changes in acceptance and trust. Supplementary metrics included post-driving ratings for usability and user experience. Findings reveal a significant increase in acceptance and trust following the first contact, confirming results from prior studies. Factors such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Condition, and Perceived Safety were rated higher after initial contact with the ADS. However, inadequate communication from the ADS to the human driver was detected, highlighting the need for improved communication to prevent misuse or confusion about the operating mode. However, it’s worth noting that most participants already had a high affinity for technology. Although overall reception was positive and showed an upward trend post first contact, the ADS was also perceived as demanding as manual driving. Future research should focus on a more diverse participant sample and include longer or multiple real-traffic trips to understand behavioral adaptations over time.},

Nevertheless, an insufficient protection for complete avoidance safety risks in time with limited and fluctuate spacing separation between consecutive trains is introduced. A time-space occupancy band model is established to hold a safety protection in time-space dimension and assess the transport capacity for train operation under virtual coupling. In addition, a train trajectory planning method aimed at improvement of transport capacity, is proposed as a two-step program consisting of train followed operation trajectory planning based on Markov Decision Process and a trajectory multi-objective optimization for train convoy. In order to meet the requirement of the train trajectory dynamic adjustment under disturbance, an approach based on trajectory strategy set is designed by two stages to consider objectives of safety and punctuality. Based on the field data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway line, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed model and method. A comparative analysis of the track resource occupancy for several application condition under virtual coupling, and signaling systems is provided. The results indicate that the effective performance of proposed method in terms of trains separation and track resource occupancy, and show that virtual coupling is a more satisfactory blocking mode that could provide a higher track resource utilization while operation conditions are taken into account.},

This paper proposes a hybrid structure named DK-former, a lightweight and robust deep kernel Gaussian process transformer network, aiming to tackle non-linear small samples, high model parameters, and environmental variations, providing a distinctive solution that enhances robustness and adaptability in intelligent transportation systems. The whole structure is trained end-to-end based on the Bayesian framework. First, introducing convolutional random Fourier features facilitates effective non-linear sample feature mapping, capturing complex patterns inherent in traffic signs and enhancing computational efficiency. Second, the transformer model refines feature representations with its powerful self-attention mechanism to capture the global relationship between traffic sign pixels. Furthermore, the hybrid structure enhances the generalization capability of the model, allowing it to adapt to diverse scenarios, such as varying lighting conditions and weather fluctuations commonly encountered in real-world traffic environments. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DK-former for traffic sign recognition. The model has achieved an outstanding recognition accuracy of 99.09% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, superior to current state-of-the-art deep kernel learning traffic sign models with only 8.3 million parameters. Experiments on Indian and Chinese datasets comprehensively demonstrate the generalization of the model across different geographies and environments.

  abstract     = {This research addresses the increasing demand for advanced navigation systems capable of operating within confined surroundings. A significant challenge in this field is developing an efficient planning framework that can generalize across various types of collision avoidance missions. Utilizing numerical optimal control techniques, this study proposes a unified optimization-based planning framework to meet these demands. We focus on handling two collision avoidance problems, i.e., the object not colliding with obstacles and not colliding with boundaries of the constrained region. The object or obstacle is denoted as a union of convex polytopes and ellipsoids, and the constrained region is denoted as an intersection of such convex sets. Using these representations, collision avoidance can be approached by formulating explicit constraints that separate two convex sets, or ensure that a convex set is contained in another convex set, referred to as separating constraints and containing constraints, respectively. We propose to use the hyperplane separation theorem to formulate differentiable separating constraints, and utilize the S-procedure and geometrical methods to formulate smooth containing constraints. We state that compared to the state of the art, the proposed formulations allow a considerable reduction in nonlinear program size and geometry-based initialization in auxiliary variables used to formulate collision avoidance constraints. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed unified planning framework is evaluated in two contexts, autonomous parking in tractor-trailer vehicles and overtaking on curved lanes. The results in both cases exhibit an improved computational performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {For autonomous vehicles (AVs), the ability for effective end-to-end perception and future trajectory prediction is critical in planning a safe automatic maneuver. In the current AVs systems, perception and prediction are two separate modules. The prediction module receives only a restricted amount of information from the perception module. Furthermore, perception errors will propagate into the prediction module, ultimately having a negative impact on the accuracy of the prediction results. In this paper, we present a novel framework termed BEV-TP, a visual context-guided center-based transformer network for joint 3D perception and trajectory prediction. BEV-TP exploits visual information from consecutive multi-view images and context information from HD semantic maps, to predict better objects’ centers whose locations are then used to query visual features and context features via the attention mechanism. Generated agent queries and map queries facilitate learning of the transformer module for further feature aggregation. Finally, multiple regression heads are used to perform 3D bounding box detection and future velocity prediction. This center-based approach achieves a differentiable, simple, and efficient E2E trajectory prediction framework. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-TP over traditional pipelines with sequential paradigms.},

Fixed and state-dependent control input bounds account for various technical limitations as well as for road boundary respect. The solution of the formulated joint Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is computed by use of a very efficient Feasible Direction Algorithm, which exploits the structure of the state equations to map the OCP into a reduced Nonlinear Programming Problem.

The AF pertains to perform various tasks in short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans. This greatly increases the applicability of swarm systems. There are however two major challenges for the control design: smooth task transitions and guaranteed collision avoidance. We adopt the constraint-following approach to address these. First, for agile formation, a plateau activation function is proposed to generate a sequence of consecutive and disjoint formations. For collision avoidance, a distance-gauge function is proposed. Second, by taking the objectives of agile formation control and collision avoidance as desirable constraints, the agile formation together with collision avoidance are both cast into a constraint following control problem. Third, to evaluate the constraint-following error, a performance measure $\beta $ is introduced and then an agile formation control is designed to render the $\beta $ -measure to be asymptotically convergent to zero. By this, the swarm system can follow the agile formation constraint and collision avoidance constraint. Therefore, agile formation and collision avoidance are both accomplished.},

  abstract     = {Due to energy constraint and reliability consideration, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have fewer independent actuators than their degrees of freedom (DOFs). Additionally, the position and velocity of AUV are sometimes limited due to physical constraints. The current solutions, such as Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) and Nonlinear State Dependent Function (NSDF), depend on the upper bounds of virtual controllers and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique. This paper develops a new trajectory tracking controller for underactuated AUV systems with state constraints. A quasi-linear relationship is established between the independent and dependent variables of the transformation function. The Nussbaum functions are employed to address algebraic loop problem, which avoids using the DSC and any approximator. Moreover, an auxiliary controller is introduced to deal with underactuation problem. The Lyapunov theory proves that the proposed controller can guarantee asymptotic tracking of desired trajectory while keeping the position and velocity of the AUV within their constrained bounds. The method can be extended to the nth-order parametric-strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Finally, both simulation and experimental results reveal that tracking performance can be guaranteed by the proposed control scheme.},

The software in this study applies machine learning technologies like Yolo, GPS positioning, and online Internet connectivity to automatically detect and locate road damage on the traffic network map. The study successfully developed software capable of automatically identifying road damage or signs of pavement quality degradation before they become more severe. The results of this study help support transportation management agencies by providing an overview of the health of each road within a road network and aiding in the efficient allocation of road maintenance funds. The software in this research not only achieves the goal of modernizing road patrol and maintenance activities but also opens avenues for exploring Industry 4.0 technologies in the development of intelligent traffic management systems.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation techniques play a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, especially in accurately parsing the environment and ensuring safe decision-making. Despite significant progress in this technology, challenges remain in terms of the cost of labeling data and the adaptability of the model when deployed to multiple target domains. Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) techniques integrate active learning and domain adaptation to adapt models from the source domain to the target domain while actively selecting the most helpful samples for labeling. However, current ADA approaches still face challenges in exploring more efficient sample selection mechanisms and mitigating data imbalance problems. This study proposes an innovative framework: Dynamic Weighting and Boundary-Aware Active Domain Adaptation (DWBA-ADA) to enhance cross-domain semantic segmentation in an autonomous driving environment. The framework emphasizes the simultaneous use of uncertainty and diversity information to identify critical image regions. The framework is improved in two ways: first, increasing the sampling proportion of minority categories, thus improving the model’s accuracy in recognizing them; and second, focusing on the identification of boundary regions across categories, thus enhancing the model’s adaptability in complex scenarios. Domain adaptation experiments across various autonomous driving datasets (e.g., GTAV, SYNTHIA, and Cityscapes) show that our DWBA-ADA approach improves the performance by 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively, compared to the current state-of-the-art MADAv2 approach under the same annotation budget and network architecture constraints.

  abstract     = {Despite the substantial progress in predicting human mobility, most existing methods fail to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns under significant interventions such as COVID-19, which disrupt the routine of human mobility. To fill this gap, this paper presents a unified framework for learning human mobility in both regular and intervened scenarios through explicit modeling of the intervention and the intervened system. To be concrete, we design a novel Deep State-Space Model (DSSM) called AGC-ODE: Adaptive Graph Controlled Neural Ordinary Differential Equation for human mobility prediction during COVID-19. The transition equation that describes continuous-time dynamics of human mobility is parameterized with a graph-controlled Neural ODE, and the latent control that guides the equation propagating is inferred through the multi-head gating filters. Additionally, an information capacity constraint is applied to foster the disentanglement of interventions. Lastly, AGC-ODE utilizes a data-driven initialization strategy to improve DSSM’s initial state estimation. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis on two real-world datasets of Beijing and the U.S. to demonstrate the superiority and interpretability of our model. Furthermore, we introduce a deployed system that is based on AGC-ODE and how it helps epidemic prevention during the COVID era and work resumption in the post-COVID era.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Intelligent Transportation, connected vehicles can access a variety of latency-sensitive cloud services to improve real-time road traffic conditions, driving safety and driving comfort. However, as the number of cloud service providers (CSPs) increases, vehicles and CSPs should efficiently complete authentication to ensure consistency and timeliness of IoV services. Moreover, many services are realized via public wireless channels, which are vulnerable to various security attacks and threats. Therefore, this paper proposes a secure and efficient authentication scheme for blockchain-enabled IoV based on quantum key distribution (QKD), called QBMA-BIV. The QBMA-BIV supports efficient authentication and re-authentication between vehicles and multiple servers through the lightweight signature algorithm and the quantum authentication keys. In QBMA-BIV, the authentication phase is achieved based on the QKD network and blockchain assistance, which is not dependent on third-party trusted centers and avoids the threat of a single point of failure. Furthermore, the security analysis demonstrates that QBMA-BIV could resist potential security attacks. Performance analysis also shows that QBMA-BIV could reduce computation and communication costs by 78.58%– 86.87% and 38.39%- 81.91% compared to related schemes. Simulation and experiments show that QBMA-BIV has outstanding feasibility.},

A linearized longitudinal vehicle platoon dynamic model is investigated, which simultaneously considers the bounded external disturbances and leader control input. By representing the switching topologies model in terms of a continuous-time Markov process, a distributed adaptive control scheme is developed such that follower vehicles can synchronize their velocities and accelerations with the leader while preserving the intended distance. The outstanding feature of the proposed distributed adaptive control scheme is that it avoids acquiring global information associated with communication topology. Besides, the design procedure is scalable since the control gain can be derived by only solving a linear matrix inequality offline related to the vehicle dynamics parameters, which means that the method remains applicable when the platoon size changes. Finally, the efficacy of theoretical findings is substantiated through the utilization of simulations.},

In such a model, a multi-information cross-validation algorithm is introduced to ensure the credibility of RTK/INS tight integration. Meanwhile, a backward quality checking model is generated based on the result of the calculated credible positioning error level, which can optimize the positioning results of RTK/INS integration furtherly. After the mathematical model descriptions, a simulated test and a real experiment are adopted to evaluate this presented method. Results illustrated that: 1) envelope level of the credible factor for the real error can reach the centimeter level and the average probability of unenveloped error is within 2%; 2) after applying the quality control scheme based on credible positioning feedback information, the positioning results of RTK/INS integration are improved by 67.6%, 78.9%, and 77.3% on average.},

  abstract     = {Crash risk evaluation studies mainly established the relationship between the macro traffic status and crashes. However, the impact of risky driving behavior, a significant factor in crashes, has not been thoroughly investigated due to the data collection limitations of fixed detectors. In this study, the risky driving behavior data generated by Connected Vehicle (CV) techniques was introduced along with traffic flow data to develop the crash risk evaluation model. An LSTM + Transformer approach was developed, in which the Transformer could extract the non-aggregated spatial-temporal features of risky driving behaviors and LSTM learn the temporal patterns of traffic flow. An ensemble layer was proposed to integrate the macro traffic status features and micro driving behavior, and automatically fit their weights to optimize crash risk evaluation performance. Data from a Chinese freeway was used for empirical analysis. The results show that the proposed LSTM + Transformer model achieved high model accuracy (77.7%), recall (68.6%), and AUC (0.785), with average improvement of between 5.34%, 15.69%, and 5.97%, respectively, compared to existing LSTM, XGBoost, SVM and Logistic Regression (LR) models. Moreover, utilizing risky driving behavior data by incorporating the macro traffic status has proved to capture the pre-crash traffic flow turbulence more precisely. The model results explained by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveal that higher frequency, longer duration and greater acceleration of risky braking behavior increase the number of road vehicles affected, thereby heightening the crash risks. These findings could help the deployment of proactive traffic management and target CV control strategies to reduce crashes.},

  abstract     = {In recent literature, the value of electric vehicles (EVs) for the resilience enhancement of urban microgrids has been shown. Furthermore, on a larger scale, there has been a growing recognition of the potential of EV cooperation in enhancing the overall resilience of smart cities. To this end, the city can be partitioned into a set of blocks, each encompassing buildings. Within each block, EV traveling time can be ignored. As a step forward, this study presents a Preventive Energy Management (PEM) strategy along with a rescheduling procedure by cooperation of EVs, local distributed energy resources (DERs), and buildings in different city blocks. Based on the available information related to the amount of curtailed loads, two cases are modeled and studied. In the proposed PEM strategy, EV owners’ opt-in preferences such as arrival and departure times, and the city block in which they are willing to give energy services are modeled. As a more realistic consideration, the proposed model does not consider the buildings’ load as a lumped load, instead the PEM strategy is designed to consider each of the buildings separately. The resulting optimization model is flexible enough to enable EVs to switch from one building to another to provide energy in different time slots. By applying disjunctive-constraint-based transformation, the model is recast as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) that could be efficiently solved by commercial optimization solvers. The proposed approach is applied to a benchmark and the results are analyzed. According to the results, using EVs in the PEM strategy has been proven to be effective and the importance of the length of the period of service and opt-in preferences for optimal scheduling are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Airside taxi delays have adverse consequences for airports and airlines globally, leading to airside congestion, increased Air Traffic Controller/Pilot workloads, missed passenger connections, and adverse environmental impact due to excessive fuel consumption. Effectively addressing taxi delays necessitates the synchronization of stochastic and uncertain airside operations, encompassing aircraft pushbacks, taxiway movements, and runway take-offs. With the implementation of mixed-mode runway operations (arrivals-departures on the same runway) to accommodate projected traffic growth, complexity of airside operations is expected to increase significantly. To manage airside congestion under increased traffic demand, development of efficient pushback control, also known as Departure Metering (DM), policies is a challenging problem. DM is an airside congestion management procedure that controls departure pushback timings, aiming to reduce taxi delays by transferring taxiway waiting times to gates. Under mixed-mode runway operations, however, DM must additionally maintain sufficient runway pressure—departure queues near runway for take-offs—to utilize available departure slots within incoming arrival aircraft steams. While a high pushback rate may result in extended departure queues, leading to increased taxi-out delays, a low pushback rate can result in empty slots between incoming arrival streams, leading to reduced runway throughput. This study introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based DM approach for mixed-mode runway operations. We cast the DM problem in a markov decision process framework and use Singapore Changi Airport surface movement data to simulate airside operations and evaluate different DM policies. Predictive airside hotspots are identified using a spatial-temporal event graph, serving as the observation to the DRL agent. Our DRL-based DM approach utilizes pushback rate as agent’s action and reward shaping to dynamically regulate pushback rates for improved runway utilization and taxi delay management under uncertainties. Benchmarking the learnt DRL-based DM policy against other baselines demonstrates the superior performance of our method, especially in high traffic density scenarios. During a typical day at Singapore Changi Airport, DRL-based DM reduces peak taxi times by 1-3 minutes on average, saves 26.6% in fuel consumption, and contributes to more environmentally friendly and sustainable airside operations.},

We present the Adaptive Decentralized Emergent-based Platooning system, or ADEPT for short, an emergent behavior based autonomous platooning approach that adopts a bottom-up, biologically inspired approach where each vehicle follows a set of simple rules to execute platoon maneuvers. In this paper, we evaluate ADEPT’s network performance against centralized platooning using a platooning simulator and show that ADEPT is able to yield superior network utilization. Additionally, we study the interplay between our emergent platooning system and vehicle characteristics and dynamics such as engine performance, weight, center of mass, friction, speed, and acceleration, and evaluate using a robot simulator equipped with an open dynamics physics engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT’s controller is string stable when subject to different maneuvers and disturbances. In addition to evaluating ADEPT’s controller stability, we propose methods that enable ADEPT to handle real-world conditions such as curved roads, vehicle following and obstacle avoidance. Our experimental results show that our dynamic radius of curvature determination method helps maintain inter-vehicle gap at 99% of the desired gap including on curved roads. Even during disturbance events, the gap errors are kept within the desired deviation. Using inspiration from lane assist technology, we propose a vehicle following technique that, according to our experimental results, yields high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients and an additional 4 vehicle clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge computing systems provide easy-to-deploy and low-cost services at those areas with inadequate infrastructure by deploying UAVs as moving edge servers for large-scale users. However, user devices are generally distributed unevenly in a large area, which makes it difficult for existing efforts to cope with this realistic scenario for optimal deployment of UAVs. Therefore, this paper considers a multiple UAV (Multi-UAV) Collaborative edge Computing (UCC) system by utilizing collaboration among them to split computation tasks at UAVs to balance the load and improve resource utilization. In order to maximize the energy-efficiency of the UCC system under the satisfaction of the delay constraint, we study the joint problem of UAV deployment, task collaborative offloading, computation and communication resource allocation in UCC system. We propose a bi-level optimization framework to solve the formulated non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem. In the upper level, the UAV deployment is optimized based on an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm, and in the lower level the offloading decision and resource allocation are optimized based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of multi-UAV collaborative computing, with the proposed framework achieving a 32.4% reduction in energy consumption and an average 30% increase in task completion rate compared to DDPG, ToDeTaS, and other benchmark schemes.},

At the leader layer, a novel three-dimensional (3-D) path-following formation controller endowed with spatial-temporal decoupling and path invariance advantages is presented for multiple quadrotors to accomplish a preassigned formation pattern along implicit paths. At the follower layer, in light of neighboring transmission, a containment controller is proposed that actuates several unmanned vehicles to access the convex hull generated by the leaders. Besides, by incorporating an event-triggered criterion with a state predictor, an aperiodic transmission strategy is established to alleviate the communication burden and evade unnecessary resource wastage. Subsequently, to recognize the actuator faults and uncertainties, guided by invariant manifold principle, unknown system dynamics estimators (USDEs) are elaborated on the strength of straightforward filtering operations. Finally, the stability of entire closed-loop system is proved according to Lyapunov analysis and input-to-state stability (ISS), while the effectiveness and superiority are demonstrated by simulations.},

In practice, data-sharing barrier makes it challenging to acquire SPAT data, impeding traffic management applications. Existing SPAT estimation methods mainly focus on partial estimation for selected time periods, and use data from multiple days, with a potentially problematic assumption that the same signal timing plan is applied across all the days. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method to estimate SPAT information using trajectory data from radar vision integrated camera (RVIC) sensors. The method is validated against real-world traffic light state data in China. The results show that the method can make an accurate estimation of time-of-day (TOD) division, cycle length, phasing scheme, and phase duration. It outperforms previous studies in cases with a limited number of observations. Further, with a sensitivity test, we derive the minimum amount of data required for the proposed method, which is quantified explicitly using the capture rate of the actual green-start times of each movement. The method estimates SPAT information daily, supporting signal evaluation and optimization functionalities. It can also drive Artificial Intelligence - Internet of Things applications, for example, providing red or green light countdown for drivers and extending infrastructure coverage for automated and connected vehicles.},

While current efforts predominantly address short-term predictions, the imperative for long-term forecasting is undeniable, particularly for strategic operational planning and resource management. Equally important is the explainability of these forecasts, which is critical for effective decision-making. To meet these needs, our study introduces an innovative approach to airport performance forecasting with the Linear-Diffusion Graph Network (LDGN), an explainable and probabilistic model. The LDGN is intricately structured, comprising stacked temporal linear layers and graph diffusion layers that harness the clarity of linear time series models. This configuration adeptly captures the nuanced interactions between graph-based diffusion processes and the dynamic spread of conditions across airport performances. Departing from conventional point forecasts, the LDGN produces a probabilistic output, prioritizing predictability and a strong capacity for generalization. The model’s pre-training is enhanced with stochastic mask reconstruction, a technique that significantly improves its ability to generalize. Through rigorous testing on real-world datasets, we have validated the LDGN’s superior performance in both long-term and very long-term forecasting. Our results demonstrate not only high accuracy and explainability but also a robust capacity for uncertainty quantification.},

Firstly, collaborative vehicles are employed to perform edge computing in a more reasonable manner, effectively mitigating the task resource overload problem of fixed edge computing servers. Secondly, reliable and efficient transaction processing is achieved through the use of blockchain LN technology in transaction communication between vehicles. Thirdly, EdgeCloudSim is used to simulate the workload, and PCNsim is used to implement the LN energy trading scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the edge computing scheme with collaborative mobile devices can reduce the task failure rate by 80%.

  abstract     = {Stochastic traffic demands and turning ratios are critical factors in coordinated signal control. However, existing studies ignore the spatial-temporal dependencies of traffic flows between adjacent intersections and signal cycles. Turning ratios are usually assumed to be deterministic. This study develops a two-stage stochastic programming model for two-way coordinated adaptive signal control under stochastic traffic demands and turning ratios. A hierarchical multi-objective function is developed for overflow management and operational efficiency under both over- and under-saturated traffic. The primary and secondary objective functions minimize residual queue lengths and average vehicle delays, respectively, which are formulated considering spatial-temporal dependencies for the coordinated traffic flow. In stage one, a base coordinated signal timing plan is optimized to maximize the expected performance under stochastic scenarios. In stage two, adaptive cycle lengths and green times are determined by setting the tolerance factor for the base green times to maintain the stable traffic flow. The concept of Phase Clearance Reliability (PCR) is extended to decouple the interaction between the two stages. The deterministic equivalent problem of the proposed model in one signal cycle is modified to optimize the base signal timing plan for serving the stochastic exogenous and endogenous traffic demands up to certain PCR values. A PCR-based gradient algorithm is designed for solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly improve traffic operation compared to six benchmarks.},

This limitation hinders their ability to accurately capture the oscillation dynamics of vehicle platoons, which are critical for simulating and evaluating mesoscopic and macroscopic traffic phenomena such as congestion propagation, stop-and-go, string stability and hysteresis. To fill this gap, our study introduces a hybrid physical model-driven and data-driven framework, Multiscale Car-Following (MultiscaleCF), aimed at explicitly capturing mesoscopic oscillation dynamics within data-driven car-following models. MultiscaleCF offers two methodological advancements in the development of machine learning-based car-following models: the recursive simulation of a platoon of vehicles to reduce compound error and mesoscopic feature engineering using domain-specific attributes. Evaluated using the OpenACC database, the MultiscaleCF framework exhibited a simultaneous improvement in both microscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulation patterns. It outperforms the baseline model in microscopic trajectory prediction accuracy by up to 21%. For oscillation dynamics, it outperforms the baseline model by 42%, 32%, 29% and 42% in duration, amplitude, intensity, and hysteresis magnitude, respectively.},

However, currently existing detection methods do not usually pay close attention to the global, local and multi-scale feature information of road crack images, resulting in poor detection effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a road crack detection model that combines the global and local multi-scale attention network (GLMANet) and enhanced feature pyramid network (EFPN). The GLMANet can effectively extract useful global, local and multi-scale feature information of crack images through a novel global and local multi-scale attention mechanism. Meanwhile, EFPN utilizes global adaptive attention module and multi-receptive field feature enhancement module to mitigate information loss during feature map generation, enhancing the representation of advanced semantic features in the feature pyramid. Leveraging faster region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN) as the object detection architecture, we conduct experimental evaluations on both publicly available crack datasets and a dataset we collected. The proposed model achieved optimal detection performance across all three datasets. In comparison experiments with the current state-of-the-art crack detection methods, the proposed model outperformed other models, with AP and AP50 increasing by up to 16% and 11%, respectively, validating its effectiveness and superiority. Additionally, the model achieved a good balance between complexity and detection performance with 79.2 GFLOPs and 72.60 million parameters.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates economical scheduling of charging for an electric vehicle (EV) in a typical household with an intelligent charging management system. The problem formulation considers rooftop solar power generation, time-varying domestic energy consumption, real-time pricing of electricity, and user preferences. This task traditionally takes the form of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, but we demonstrate its equivalence to linear programming (LP) to reduce computational complexity. The LP problem can be solved to global optimality if all future information is known, which is unrealistic in practice and replaced with forecasting. Learning-based methods such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) eliminate the need for a forecaster and make online decisions rapidly using a learned policy. We propose an approach based on imitation learning that leverages the knowledge of an LP expert by learning from its optimal demonstrations instead of learning from scratch in DRL. Our approach trains a deep neural network (DNN) based policy efficiently in a supervised manner and incorporates a safety post-processing mechanism that enforces strict constraint satisfaction. Numerical studies on real-world data show that the proposed approach achieves $23~ \sim ~220$ times speedup compared to DRL for DNN training, and the total electricity cost is far lower than DRL as well, which is strikingly close to the lower bound in theory.

  abstract     = {To ensure safe and efficient intelligent transportation systems (ITS), autonomous driving systems must have excellent abilities about object detection and environmental perception. Fusing data from multiple sensors can overcome inherent limitations of single-sensor perception in 3D object detection for autonomous driving. LiDAR is great at pinpointing objects but doesn’t capture their velocity. Radar, on the other hand, accurately measures velocity but doesn’t provide height details. Fusing Radar and LiDAR can extend the detection range and improve the detection performance for dynamic objects. Nevertheless, direct integration of two sensors for performance improvement is hindered by different data characteristics and noise distributions. To address this, we propose a novel fusion framework termed LiDAR and Pseudo 4D-Radar fusion under Bird’s-Eye-View, dubbed L4R-BEVFusion, to overcome the challenge of multi-modal fusion. Specifically, Radar is a sensor that lacks object height information, we firstly design a pseudo 4D-Radar generation process that includes the sparse to dense(S2P) module and the height completion(RHC) module to transform the original 3D-Radar feature map into pseudo 4D-Radar feature map that is more dense and has enriched height information. Secondly, the fusion framework encodes the LiDAR features and the pseudo 4D-Radar features into the same Bird’s-Eye-View(BEV) through cross-guided BEV encoder(CGBE) module. Extensive experiments show that L4R-BEVFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance (71.3% NDS and 66.7% mAP) for detecting dynamic objects(only use LiDAR and Radar) on the NuScenes dataset.},

This paper introduces a machine learning (ML) approach for precise remaining range estimation (RRE) in EMs. To select the most appropriate method, a comparative analysis of various ML methods is firstly conducted using consistent data derived from a standard riding profile. An EM model is then used to assess the proposed strategy against traditional approach. Experimentation is conducted using a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation system under real-world conditions to evaluate the performance and applicability of the developed model in real-time conditions. The training accuracy achieves 96.9% while the testing attains 95.8% of accuracy score with the representative riding profile.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing pedestrian crossing decisions, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide precise insights into both global and local predictions. The results show that heightened willingness to urgently cross the street is correlated with more noticeable knee flexion and leg alternation, a narrower shoulder in sight, and larger strides. Conversely, frequent body rotation may suggest a temporary reluctance to cross. Additionally, there is an indication that pedestrian crossing intention can be influenced by group size, vehicle movement and contextual features. Finally, practical suggestions based on our results are provided for automated driving scenario testing.},

  abstract     = {Detecting concealed cracks before they become reflective cracks is crucial for the proper design and maintenance of roads. However, research on quantitative recognition and intuitive three-dimensional (3D) characterization of concealed cracks is still at an exploratory stage, so this paper proposes a pixel-level segmentation network based on the You Only Look Once for Panoptic (YOLOP) enhancement, which can quantitatively segment the distresses while performing pixel-level detection of concealed cracks in asphalt pavements. Firstly, gprMax was used to numerically simulate and summarize the characteristics of internal cracks in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images. The relationship between the actual area with crack characteristics and the occupied pixel area in GPR images was then established. The improved YOLOP was utilized to enhance the detection speed and accuracy of concealed cracks, and in terms of a single index, the R-index increased the most by 40%, the P-index increased the least by 26% and the F1-score increased by 37%. Additionally, the segmented crack region was reconstructed in three dimensions using the computed tomography (CT) imaging principle. The vertical height, longitudinal length, cross-sectional area, and volume of the crack region were estimated. This thesis presents important research on the accurate detection and intuitive characterization of concealed cracks in asphalt pavements. It can serve as a theoretical guide for practical engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Real-Time Traffic Flow Prediction (RT-TFP) is one of the critical technologies for implementing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), enabling rapid and accurate prediction of real-time traffic flow at intersections. RT-TFP typically needs to be deployed on-site edge devices for real-time traffic flow calculation that requires low inference latency and minimal computational resources. However, the existing Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) models are generally based on spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which are complex and require high computational resources and relatively high inference times that can hardly be deployed on edge devices. To this end, this work proposes a simple RT-TFP model, SpatioTemporal-MultiLayer Perceptron (ST-MLP), which requires low computational resources and inference times. The base idea of this work is to establish a spatio-temporal MLP model to replace the STGNN model for conducting the TFP, which is much faster and simpler. Specifically, first, a TempEncoder is proposed to encode the temporal information into the MLP features. Then, a Spatiotemporal Mixer is proposed to mix spatial information into the temporal-enriched MLP features. After, MLP features are distilled from a complex STGNN model to obtain a simple MLP that inherits complete Spatial-Temporal information of the traffic graph. The experimental results on four real-world datasets show the proposed model achieves competitive prediction accuracy with STGNN models in much fewer computational resources and lower prediction time costs. It is worth noting that, the proposed method is faster than the compared STGNNs by an average of 21.62 times (~10.81s $\rightsquigarrow ~\sim 0.50$ s). Interestingly, the proposed ST-MLP even has a −3.23% error rate decreasing on average compared to the corresponding STGNN model. Moreover, the error rate of the proposed ST-MLP decreases over pure MLPs by −3.92% $\sim -42.62$ %. The source code is available at: https://github.com/zhangjunfeng1234/ST-MLP},

  abstract     = {License plate detection and recognition (LPDR) is of paramount importance in the Intelligent Transportation Systems. Most existing license plate (LP) detectors rely on anchors, rendering them vulnerable to multi-scale LPs, especially those of smaller scales, which limited the overall performance of LPDR. Another issue prevalent in LP datasets arises from the inherent ambiguity in manual labeling standards. Owing to this uncertainty, certain small-scale LPs that are distinctly detectable often suffer from annotation omissions. The presence of such noisy data has a detrimental impact on the training of LP detectors. In this paper, we propose ALPD, an anchor-free LP detector along with three key designs, namely the Multi-To-One scale-fusion block (MTO) for cross-scale feature integration, the Multi-Domain Feature Simulation (MDFS) for narrowing the disparities across multiple domains even the unseen ones, and the decoupled heads for better optimizing classification and regression tasks. Besides, ALPD incorporates a semi-supervised training framework using an abstention strategy known as arbitration, wherein a Teacher model and a Student model are trained collaboratively, enabling the supplementation of missing annotations for small license plates. Furthermore, it possesses immunity to model performance degradation when fed with massive quantities of unlabeled or even mislabeled data. The arbitration method along with a penalty factor can effectively guarantee the pseudo-label quality and balance complexity between the Teacher and Student tasks, thus preventing the Student from being constrained by ambiguous pseudo-labels. ALPD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two widely recognized benchmarks and exhibits its robustness and generalizability on the All-round CCPD dataset.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Currently, most models need to pay more attention to the delay (history) state to improve forecasting performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic delay differential equation spatiotemporal network for traffic flow forecasting, named D3STN. First, our method integrates dynamic delay state optimization into delay differential equations to enhance delay state inputs and model forecasting performance. In addition, we propose a hybrid graph neural network and convolution multi-head attention mechanism. With the hybrid graph neural network, our method takes the multi-granularity correlation relationship into account to capture spatial characteristics from relevant nodes. With the convolution multi-head attention mechanism, our method balances the attention distribution between short-term and long-term attention. Empirical experiments are executed on highway traffic flow and metro flow datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. The results demonstrate that D3STN achieves significant advancements in traffic flow forecasting tasks. Compared with CorrSTN (baseline), D3STN makes improvements of 10.93%, 16.24% and 24.56% in terms of the MAE, RMSE and MAPE, respectively, on the HZME (outflow) dataset.},

  abstract     = {A voyage optimization algorithm is an essential component in a ship’s routing concerning safety, energy efficiency, arrival punctuality, etc. In this study, predictive optimization is integrated with an Isochrone-based voyage optimization algorithm for energy-efficient sailing. Different waypoints generation and grid partition strategies in search spaces are proposed to achieve smooth convergence toward the destination, and costs ahead of the current sailing time stages are estimated in the cost function to avoid the local suboptimization. Based on these measures, this paper introduces the Isochrone-based predictive optimization (IPO) method that can achieve enhanced and robust performance in real-time multi-objective voyage optimization. The unrealistic routes with abrupt turns that occur in the traditional Isochrone and graph search methods are avoided. The IPO method can suggest energy-efficient routes in diverse sailing environments, while complying with punctuality requirements in voyage planning. Meanwhile, it requires a few computational resources that enable online and real-time adjustment during voyage execution, adapting to dynamic sailing environments. Its efficiency and effectiveness are demonstrated by six case study voyages from a chemical tanker with full-scale measurements, and further compared with other widely used voyage optimization methods. The results show that the proposed method can provide smooth routes with subtle turns with 5% fuel reduction on average for all case voyages, with around 40 seconds runtime.},

Therefore, designing effective methods that not only address coverage balance but also take into account user’s satisfaction is a problem that needs to be addressed. We investigate the problem of regional coverage balance with users’ satisfaction and propose a service selection method based on transfer learning. This method comprises user’s trajectory prediction and service’s reputation to recommend services to users. In the user’s trajectory prediction part, an incentive mechanism is considered to ensure an even distribution of taxi services in each sub-region. Taking the service providers’ moving as the input, we design an adaptive ant colony algorithm that incorporates transfer learning to provide users with the optimal services. We validate the effectiveness of this method with datasets collected from the real world and compare the performance with existing regional coverage balance strategies. The experimental results show that user’s satisfaction increases by 53%, and the imbalance reduces by 24%.},

This study focuses on comprehensive analysis of drivers’ lane change execution processes on expressways using an instrumented vehicle, encompassing various surrounding factors through 3D LiDAR sensor. A dataset of 59 licensed drivers covering approximately 4000 kilometers was analyzed, resulting in the identification of 2578 discretionary lane changing events. Contrary to the conventional assumption of instantaneous lane changes in microscopic traffic simulations, this study places emphasis on the temporal aspect, specifically addressing the duration of lane changes. Using a Random Effect Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) approach, the panel shape of the data and the unobserved variability linked to lane change durations were considered. Several factors were discovered to influence these durations, including the subject vehicle’s speed, speed variation and longitudinal acceleration, as well as the gap and relative speed of the lead vehicle in the current lane, space gap in target lane, relative speed of vehicles in the target lane, vehicle density, lane change direction, drivers’ gender, age group, and driving experience. The findings have inferences for microsimulation software and the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV).

In this context, this paper proposes a cooperative perception algorithm that considers localization uncertainty and information correlation and asynchrony. Specifically, a hierarchical split covariance intersection (SCI) approach is proposed to efficiently fuse the information from local sensors and connected devices. To bridge the reference disparities of information among CAVs, we incorporate localization uncertainty into the connected information fusion through a coordinate transformation approach based on the cubature rule, which unifies the references. Then, the covariance boundedness of the whole proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed, demonstrating to some extent the safety guaranteed by our algorithm in practical applications. Finally, we build a high-fidelity driving simulator and collected real trajectory data from 80 drivers. The simulation and driver data testing results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Multifrequency observation space representation (OSR) corrections of real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning with multiple GNSS systems, particularly those that supported the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)-2 and BDS-3 systems, were implemented. We also applied some RTK quality control strategies for smartphone, which include optimizing the observation stochastic model, using the TDCP model to estimate precise temporal positions between adjacent epochs for one-step prediction of positional parameters, and prioritizing the fixing of satellite ambiguity parameters where the optimal and suboptimal solutions are consistent to address the issue of half-cycle slips. Compared with open-sourced software, our strategy significantly improves RTK positioning accuracy in complex environments.

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the most promising technology for improving high-speed train’s energy efficiency and operation quality. Existing solutions, however, suffer from three significant limitations: 1) They cannot effectively constrain the huge exploration space generated by high-speed trains under high temporal deformability and long-distance trips; 2) The reward function has no adaptability to the different energy-efficiency difficulties of different travel schedules, and the agent will receive incorrect reward signals, requiring manual adjustment; 3) They do not avoid the invalid action sequences of the agent well. To address this challenge, we propose a revolutionary Boundary Constrained and Pre-evaluated Reinforcement Learning (BCPRL) approach to alleviate these issues. This approach combines the Shrink Trajectory Exploration Space (STES) module, the Pre-evaluated Energy-efficiency Scenario Complexity (PESC) module, and the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) module and uses a hybrid of STES and TD3 to make train operation decision-making to improve the operation quality and learning efficiency of the agent. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the BCPRL approach, which, by drastically reducing the exploration space and getting the agent the correct reward signal, not only maintains excellence in efficiency and punctuality but also far surpasses the other baseline approaches in learning efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Compared with other steering systems, Four-Wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) can control not only yaw motion but also their unique side-move motion to provide intelligent vehicles with stronger trajectory tracking capabilities. However, existing 4WIS wheel angle control often aims at zeroing the sideslip angle of the Center of Gravity (CoG), which inhibits the unique side-move motion of 4WIS vehicles. Especially under large-curvature turning conditions, relying only on yaw motion, the system is prone to entering a state of nonlinear instability; its trajectory tracking accuracy and stability are difficult to guarantee. In response, this paper proposes a 4WIS vehicle instantaneous center of rotation (ICR) tracking control method under large-curvature turning conditions. It converts traditional wheel angle control into ICR control. Through the coordinated control of side-move and yaw motion, trajectory tracking accuracy and stability are ensured under large-curvature turning conditions. The proposed ICR tracking control includes two parts: ICR control and trajectory decomposition. ICR control constructs a polar coordinate system with the vehicle CoG as the pole and establishes a decoupled mapping of side-move and yaw motion to the ICR. By predicting and optimizing the deviation between the ICR and its reference, the side-move and yaw motions are coordinated to achieve effective tracking of large curvature trajectories. Trajectory decomposition mainly converts the trajectory tracking target into the ICR control reference. By combining the particle model and trajectory curvature, polar coordinates are used to decompose the trajectory curvature into side-move and yaw curvatures, and through rolling optimization of lateral and heading errors, the target trajectory is decomposed into side-move and yaw control reference. HIL experimental results show that the proposed ICR tracking control strategy can effectively improve the trajectory tracking performance of 4WIS vehicles under large-curvature turning conditions.},

In this paper, we propose a novel pavement crack detection framework, Crack-U2Net, which innovatively incorporates a two-level nested U-Net architecture for feature learning. This design enables the learning of intra-stage multiscale features without introducing significant memory and computation costs, resulting in substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, to solve the challenge of insufficient training data, we propose a Geometry-based Data Augmentation (GDA) strategy, aiming to expand the pavement dataset while preserving the pavement geometry. Extensive experiments on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway point cloud dataset demonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of Crack-U2Net over the state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average precision, recall, F $1\text - $ score, and accuracy of 83.8%, 77.6%, 80.1%, and 95.8%, respectively.},

In such cases, the presence of trained leaders is crucial to provide guidance for evacuation and ensure the safety of those evacuating. However, determining the optimal positions of leaders in complex environments to guide the maximum number of pedestrians presents a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose an Entropy-Based Maximum Coverage Model(EMCM) to enhance evacuation guidance. Initially, we employ the social force model to describe pedestrian movement characteristics, while the environmental features of the evacuation area are delineated using a navigation network. Subsequently, we introduce an urgency model grounded in evacuation entropy to quantify the urgency experienced by pedestrians. Thirdly, we frame the problem of leader positioning as an optimization challenge focused on maximizing entropy coverage, thereby increasing the number of individuals a leader can effectively guide. Finally, we employ AnyLogic to construct simulation scenarios that visualize the leadership process. This innovative method holds the potential to offer valuable support in the formulation of effective evacuation strategies during emergency situations.},

Among those, autonomous drifting is a promising idea that takes the control possibilities of a vehicle beyond what is currently achievable by active safety systems such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC). This paper explores for the first time the use of torque vectoring in autonomous drifting vehicles with multiple motors. The idea is to keep the vehicle drifting along a predefined path, with desired sideslip angle and vehicle speed. Considering a rear-wheel-driven vehicle with one motor per each rear wheel, a 3-wheel vehicle model with load transfers is used. The control formulation is a feedforward action coupled with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on a steady-state linearization of the vehicle dynamics. Experimental results on the full-scale prototype MARTY demonstrate the actual feasibility of the concept, with very good tracking performance in steady-state conditions - as per design - and along more challenging quasi-equilibrium trajectories.},

While there has been extensive research on autonomous navigation in open waters, less focus has been given to coastal waters due to the complexity of the environment and traffic flow. In order to resolve this problem, the dynamic adaptive decision-making method for ship autonomous navigation in coastal waters is presented. A digital twin environment model tailored to the characteristics of coastal waters has been developed, which can dynamically replicate the current ship navigation environment by incorporating multi-source heterogeneous information from ship equipment. The autonomous navigation decision-making method is obtained by integrating an Improved Velocity Obstacle (IVO) for ship collision avoidance and a Line of Sight (LOS) algorithm for ship trajectory tracking. Moreover, a time-rolling algorithm is employed to facilitate specific navigation decision-making in time-varying environments and to account for the uncertainty of target ship motion over time. This comprehensive algorithm has been tested and validated in two different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed navigation decision-making method is reasonable and effective for the ship navigating in the coastal water, particularly in multi-ship encounter situations of target ships suddenly altering course or changing speed.},

The approach can handle scenarios involving simultaneous cut-in preclusion and cut-in yielding. Considering the limited rationality of human drivers during lane change, this strategy incorporates a bounded rationality-based game process to restrict discretionary cut-ins while safeguarding AV’s interests, including efficiency, safety, and comfort. The well-designed RL framework captures the exhibited randomness of both the cut-in and preceding HDVs, enabling the AV to effectively handle cut-in maneuvers and reduce speed disturbances. Simulated experiments demonstrate the high generalization capability of our strategy in reducing preceding speed disturbances (e.g., achieving a minimum reduction of 34.5% in traffic disturbances compared to two baselines), and preventing discretionary cut-in maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {Although artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress recently, there remain various technical issues and ethical problems before autonomous vehicles can be available to the general public. In the interim, collaboration between automated systems and human drivers becomes a promising solution, where the merits of machine intelligence and human intelligence are blended in a complementary way. To this end, the paper proposes a reference-free human-vehicle shared control framework based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, a personalized human-like driver agent is derived from highway driving data by means of generative adversarial imitation learning integrated with Gaussian mixture model. The driver model is responsible for real-time interaction with the reinforcement learning agent to relieve the burden of human operators in the course of training. Then, a copilot agent learns the policies to cooperatively control the vehicle steering based on three distinct implementations for the search of the best coordination strategy. Heuristic reward functions are designed to guide the agent policy optimization for multi-objective equilibrium between driver synchronization against intervention. To verify the control performance of the proposed shared driving system, simulation experiments with driver models and human-in-the-loop tests with real-life participants are conducted in the end of this paper. The results demonstrate that the shared steering control method can effectively follow human intentions, facilitate driving goals, improve road safety and reduce driver’s workload simultaneously in the challenging dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Road traffic signs can improve the pressure of environmental traffic, and the real-time accurate recognition of traffic signs is conducive to the promotion and development of intelligent vehicles. However, in various complex application scenarios such as tilted and deformed traffic signs, there still have the following problems: First, the feature selection of the existing traffic recognition model only considers its network layer information and fails to retain the salient feature information with strong discriminatory power effectively, and the feature enhancement is easy to introduce background noise. Second, the existing traffic sign recognition models are difficult to deploy on mobile devices and systems, resulting in weak learning capability of feature representation in deep learning backbone network, and low robustness of the high-level feature fusion performance. Therefore, we propose a cascade attention mechanism, which can associate a series of attention units using a cascade approach, and design a cascade attention feature enhancement module, which can effectively improve the feature selection and feature enhancement performance in the traffic sign recognition process. Then, we design a lightweight deep learning model and propose modal fusion, a high-level feature-guided feature refinement mechanism, and a mutual attention enhancement module. In addition, the interrelationship between traffic signs and deep modal features is given, which can effectively enhance the feature representation learning ability of the lightweight deep learning model and significantly improve the efficiency and robustness of the model. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the most excellent recognition results on several traffic sign datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the NP-hard vehicle routing problems (VRPs). While much success has been achieved, most of the previous studies solely focused on single-depot VRPs, which became less effective in handling more practical scenarios, such as multi-depot VRPs. Although there are many preprocessing measures, such as natural decomposition, those scenarios are still more challenging to optimize. To resolve this issue, we propose the multi-depot multi-type attention (MD-MTA) to solve the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP) and multi-depot open VRP (MDOVRP), respectively. We design a multi-type attention in the network to combine different types of embeddings and the state of the environment at each step, so as to accurately select the next node to visit and construct the route. We introduce a depot rotation augmentation to enhance solution decoding. Results show that it performs favorably against various representative traditional baselines and DRL-based baselines.},

  abstract     = {The control design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has mostly focused on achieving specific goals for either individually controlled AVs or cooperatively controlled swarms. However, the impact of autonomous driving on human-driven vehicles (HVs) has often been overlooked in AV controller synthesis, potentially resulting in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to traffic flow. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for socially compliant AV control design, leveraging a psychological metric called social value orientation (SVO). This framework allows AVs to consider their impact on following HVs, enabling socially compliant AV behavior that human drivers can understand and appropriately respond to. We define appropriate utilities for the controlled AV and its following HV, to be maximized in a weighted manner determined by the AV’s SVO. This utility maximization can accommodate various design objectives based on the AV’s goals and the benefits to the following HVs from socially compliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated and solved using Pontryagin’s minimum principle to maximize the utility function. The developed approach is applied to synthesize socially compliant eco-driving controls for an AV. Leveraging real-world vehicle trajectory data gathered on Highway 55 in Minnesota, our simulation results from a five-vehicle platoon show that altruistic AV driving can improve the average speed of its following HVs by over 5%. Notably, improvements exceeding 45% are achieved in the vicinity of signalized intersections, albeit with a slight reduction in the AV’s payoff.},

  abstract     = {In crowded waters, multiple vessel encounter situations increase the collision risks (CRs) of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and hence the frequent collision avoidance (COLAV) maneuvers of USVs increase their actual sailing distances. This paper innovatively proposes a risk-prediction-based deep reinforcement learning (RPDRL) approach for the integrated intelligent guidance and motion control of USVs with anticipatory COLAV decision-making. The data sizes of detected vessels’ motion states are different due to the uncertainties in the number of vessels detected by the navigation systems of a USV. To address this problem, these data are, for the first time, converted into the corresponding same-sized raster data as the states in the RPDRL approach. A new CR assessment model of the USV collisions with all the detected vessels is built to calculate the rewards in the RPDRL approach. Furthermore, actor and critic deep convolutional neural networks are created to make the anticipatory COLAV decisions which are the engine command and rudder command. Simulations and simulation comparison results on a USV demonstrate that the USV sails along a shorter path with a lower CR under the anticipatory COLAV decisions from our proposed RPDRL approach compared with a velocity obstacle method and a model predictive control method, and hence the economy and safety of USVs’ autonomous navigation are enhanced.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to generate a fused image with abundant texture details and salient thermal radiation targets, which can not only preserve the necessary scene information for traffic vision tasks, but also highlight the imperceptible targets that are crucial in intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, the existing image fusion methods often lack the information interactions between cross-modal features and among cross-granularity features, and they usually ignore the importance of edge information to the image, which affects the quality of the fused image. To this end, this study proposes an IVF network based on cross-modal multi-granularity information interaction and edge guidance, termed as CEFusion. On the one hand, a triple-branch scene fidelity module is designed to fuse the different modal features extracted by the encoder. This module can adequately mine difference information and infrared salient information of the cross-modal features through cross-modal information interaction. On the other hand, a progressive cross-granularity interaction feature enhancement module is employed to achieve the information interaction among cross-granularity features, which can further enrich the texture and structure information in the fused features. In addition, a novel edge loss function is proposed to guide the network to retain the edge information from source images. Extensive comparative and generalization experiments demonstrate that our CEFusion superior to the state-of-the-art methods in preserving texture details and thermal radiation targets. More importantly, the performance of our method in the high-level vision task suggests that it can provide reliable assistance for the ITS applications.},

Specifically, we give a comprehensive analysis of both the physical structure and deep features of ships, which finds that highlighted areas in feature maps correspond with structurally significant parts of ships. By summarizing the locations of such areas in ships, we define 20 ship landmarks and build the Ship Landmark Dataset (SLAD), the first ship dataset with landmark annotations. We also provide a benchmark for ship landmark detection by evaluating state-of-the-art landmark detection methods on the newly built SLAD. Moreover, we showcased several applications of ship landmarks, including ship recognition, ship image generation, key area detection for ships, and ship detection.

  abstract     = {The integration of drones into shared airspace for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations presents significant challenges but holds transformative potential for sectors like transportation, construction, energy and defence. A prerequisite for this integration is equipping drones with enhanced situational awareness to ensure collision avoidance and safe operations. Current approaches mainly target single object detection or classification, or simpler sensing outputs that offer limited perceptual understanding and lack the rapid end-to-end processing needed to convert sensor data into safety-critical insights. In contrast, our study leverages radar technology for novel end-to-end semantic segmentation of aerial point clouds to simultaneously identify multiple collision hazards. By adapting and optimizing the PointNet architecture and integrating aerial domain insights, our framework distinguishes five distinct classes: mobile targets like drones (DJI M300 and DJI Mini) and airplanes (Ikarus C42), and static returns (ground and infrastructure) which results in enhanced situational awareness for drones. To our knowledge, this is the first approach addressing simultaneous identification of multiple collision threats in an aerial setting, achieving a robust 94% accuracy. This work highlights the potential of radar technology to advance situational awareness in drones, facilitating safe and efficient BVLOS operations.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks (VECoNs) have gained popularity for its enhanced Internet of Vehicles (IoV) capabilities. To satisfy the needs of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive in-vehicle applications, VECoNs need to provide low-latency task offloading services. However, existing offloading frameworks generally overlook the spatially and temporally heterogeneous computation task arrival patterns. The former causes overloading and underloading of RSU computational resources and thus hinders further reduction of offloading latency on the macro-scale, while the latter emphasizes the importance of long-term system performance, especially energy constraints, posing challenges to the design of offloading framework and optimization strategies. This paper introduces a novel distributed two-stage task offloading architecture based on Lyapunov and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). On one hand, it jointly optimizes the initial offloading stage within VEC subsystems and the RSU peer offloading stage to minimize offloading delays for each VEC subsystem. On the other hand, it incorporates RSU energy consumption within long-term constraints to formulate the offloading optimization problem. After decoupling the energy coupling between RSU time slots using the Lyapunov algorithm, a Lyapunov and MADDPG-based distributed task offloading (LAMETO) algorithm is presented to solve the optimal problem in a distributed manner. Simulation results show that the proposed framework and algorithm can reduce the system delay, energy consumption, and energy deficit while stabilizing convergence.},

This article rethinks LiDAR-based SFE and MOS tasks, providing our key insight that jointly addressing them can tackle challenges in both tasks, and their solutions can reinforce one another to improve the performance of both. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel framework that exploits shared geometric constraints by explicitly partitioning the scene into static and moving regions and subsequently estimating flow differently for these regions. A lightweight and interpretable neural network dubbed SFEMOS is proposed. It employs an encoder and two specially designed head modules for each task, achieving MOS without relying on prior poses and online point-wise flow estimation for 360-degree point clouds. Due to the absence of public datasets for concurrently evaluating both tasks, we generate ground truth flow data using MOS labels from SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we establish a new dataset using a rotational LiDAR mounted on our own autonomous vehicle. Evaluation results on both datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed SFEMOS.

  abstract     = {Interacting with the surrounding road users is crucial for autonomous vehicles (AV). However, the inherent multimodality and uncertainties associated with traffic participants (TP) pose challenges in AVs’ prediction and decision-making (PnD). A primary challenge is adapting predictors trained on static offline datasets to the dynamic, diverse data streams encountered in reality. Secondly, utilizing one single forecast trajectory with the highest probability for decision-making contains potential risks as it neglects that even a small probability represents a subset of TP behaviors. Based on the existing prediction backbone, we propose an online learning approach incorporating pseudo-labels inferred from partial feedback as compensation for conventional methodologies, considering both the commonsense and personalization facets of driving. Drawing inspiration from the second law of thermodynamics, we propose to minimize microscopic traffic entropy as an additional objective in decision-making. This objective aims to reduce the chaos of traffic scenes, thus achieving more predictable future interactions and, conversely, making future decisions easier. Through real-time human-in-the-loop experiments, we quantifiably and comparably reveal that adopting one single trajectory without online learning in PnD is risky. However, this reliability is verified to be significantly improved by our proposed techniques, and the efficacy is further analyzed in a subsequent qualitative study. A static experiment transferring the prediction algorithm trained exclusively on Argoverse 2 to datasets including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, and NuScenes is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed correction can effectively mitigate the gap between the datasets and real-world scenarios.},

In view of the problem, this paper proposes a robust leader-follower control method for a tractor-trailer to track a combine harvester in a confined farmland environment for the cooperative harvesting operation. Firstly, considering the model uncertainties, the kinematic and dynamic models of the autonomous tractor-trailer system are established. Subsequently, based on the relative kinematics and nonlinear transformations, a second-order Euler-Lagrange error dynamic model for cooperative harvesting system of a tractor-trailer and a combine harvester is proposed. The effective combination of sliding mode control (SMC) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network compensates for model uncertainties in the control system, and achieves the robust leader-follower control of a tractor-trailer and a combine harvester. Considering the confined operation environment due to irregular farmland boundaries or obstacles, an obstacle avoidance strategy is proposed based on an improved artificial potential field (APF) method to ensure that the tractor-trailer can also pass smoothly even in confined working space. The results demonstrate that the proposed robust leader-follower control method can successfully achieve the cooperative control of a tractor-trailer and a combine harvester in crop harvesting operations. Moreover, in confined farmland environments, the proposed obstacle avoidance strategy can ensure that the tractor-trailer successfully avoids both dynamic and static obstacles while tracking the combine harvester, and the required obstacle avoidance space is smaller.},

This article investigates the development of a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) controller tailored for CAVs operating within mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios that involve time delays. Firstly, the error dynamics in the discrete-time domain for each subplatoon is derived by considering the time-varying delays and leading vehicle states, and then the optimal CAV cruise control problem is formulated.

  abstract     = {The real challenge in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) lies in ensuring the security of health-related sensitive data and diagnostic information, preventing unauthorized access by malicious users. Given that information exchange takes place between the WBAN client and the Application Provider (AP), there is a critical need for thorough attention to mutual authentication and secure key generation. Many of the available research works lack the addressing of essential security features such as strong anonymity, key confidentiality, and key-escrow resilience. The primary focus of this research work is to develop a certificateless anonymous mutual authentication scheme that will be computationally efficient and memory-optimized, while maintaining uncompromising security features. Our scheme excels over other schemes due to its utilization of a hybrid approach, which integrates cryptographic operations related to the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), and bi-linear pairings. This approach maintains strong security features and also enhances the performance of the system. The proposed scheme improves computational cost, storage cost, and communication cost by at least 15%, 41%, and 10%, respectively, compared to the best available schemes. We have also verified our protocol using formal and informal approaches. Formal logic analysis and simulation of our scheme ensure its potential to significantly enhance user privacy and strengthen mutual authentication in Smart healthcare systems.},

  abstract     = {Driver distraction, a major cause of traffic crashes, is reported to reduce driving performance and be detected with vehicle behavioral features. It also induces physiological responses. Time and frequency-domain features of physiological signals have been used to study distraction, but they are susceptible to residual noise and tend to overlook complexity. Moreover, the resampling problem arises while analyzing physiological signals at multiple time scales. This paper proposes a novel framework based on multiscale entropy on absolute time scales (MSaE) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to mine the distraction information in multi-modality physiological signals and detect distraction automatically. Firstly, an entropy-based resampling method is adopted to find the suitable downsampling rates of electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG). Then, calculating entropy with absolute time scales instead of relative time scales in a sliding window is utilized to explore the fluctuations of each signal while distraction. Afterward, ReliefF is selected from conventional feature selectors to identify the optimal feature set for each signal. Finally, BiLSTM with time dependency is designed to detect driver distraction with the selected feature set. The results illustrate significant distinctions in the MSaE of multiple physiological signals between normal and distracted driving. Additionally, MSaE, superior to traditional features, is selected as the most discriminative feature for each signal in distraction mining. Furthermore, the accuracy is further improved by about 8%, incorporating multi-modality features rather than vehicle behavioral features. This study indicates the potential of employing various signals to understand and detect driver distraction effectively.},

  abstract     = {The on-demand ride-pooling service, defined as two or more passengers sharing the same vehicle en-route along a proportion of their travel trajectories, offers many benefits, such as discounted trip fares for customers, higher income for drivers, increased profit for ride-sourcing companies, and reduced fuel consumption for environmental protection. Motivated by the potential of ride-pooling, many ride-sourcing companies launch pooling services based on the non-pooling market. By providing pooling and non-pooling services simultaneously, they compete with public transit for passengers. Of particular interest to service providers is the upfront pricing problem for the pooling service. It allows pooling riders to be informed of service prices even before the trip starts, and consequently makes the pooling service more attractive to passengers. However, it remains a challenging issue to obtain the optimal spatial-temporal upfront pricing strategy for the pooling service, considering the heterogeneity, dynamics, imbalance of demand /supply, and differentiation between pooling and non-pooling services. To address this problem, two reinforcement learning frameworks (i.e., single-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) and multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MMDP)) are implemented to gain the pricing policy with the maximum daily profit of the platform, where the pooling price, as the action, not only directly affects the profit of each pooling request, but also has an influence on the mode splitting among pooling, non-pooling, and public transit service. Two tailored reinforcement learning methods are developed and adopted to solve the MDPs. Through extensive empirical experiments with a well-designed simulator, we show that the proposed multi-agent framework is able to remarkably improve the system performance.},

  abstract     = {The contraflow left-turn (CLT) lane is a successful intersection design that can effectively increase the throughput of the left-turn traffic flow by allowing left-turn vehicles to use the exit lane. However, the noncooperative longitudinal and lane choice behavior of left-turn vehicles may underutilize the CLT lane. Further, left-turn traffic flow throughput changes with respect to the traffic situation and it will not achieve the maximum even if the left-turn traffic flow is split evenly among the lanes. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative longitudinal driving and lane assignment strategy that seeks to control the lane choices and longitudinal driving behavior of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at CLT intersections to minimize the total left-turn traffic delay. This approach establishes a mixed-integer linear model to optimize the longitudinal driving and lane choices for all left-turn vehicles simultaneously. It also takes into account the physical constraints of vehicles and the operational rules of the CLT intersection to ensure traffic safety and efficiency. To apply it in real time, a computationally efficient solution algorithm is developed based on the Lagrange relaxation method. It can solve the mixed-integer optimization problem within 0.02 seconds for vehicles less than 10. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative control method outperforms the noncooperative-based control strategies developed upon the intelligent driver model (IDM) with a 24.66% reduction in average delay and a 20.44% increase in throughput. The proposed control strategy can enhance the left-turn traffic safety and efficiency for intersections with a CLT lane.},

  abstract     = {Although the majority of recent autonomous driving systems concentrate on developing perception methods based on ego-vehicle sensors, there is an overlooked alternative approach that involves leveraging intelligent roadside cameras to help extend the ego-vehicle perception ability beyond the visual range. We discover that most existing monocular 3D object detectors rely on the ego-vehicle prior assumption that the optical axis of the camera is parallel to the ground. However, the roadside camera is installed on a pole with a pitched angle, which makes the existing methods not optimal for roadside scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for Roadside Monocular 3D object detection with ground-aware embeddings, named MonoGAE. Specifically, the ground plane is a stable and strong prior knowledge due to the fixed installation of cameras in roadside scenarios. In order to reduce the domain gap between the ground geometry information and high-dimensional image features, we employ a supervised training paradigm with a ground plane to predict high-dimensional ground-aware embeddings. These embeddings are subsequently integrated with image features through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to improve the detector’s robustness to the divergences in cameras’ installation poses, we replace the ground plane depth map with a novel pixel-level refined ground plane equation map. Our approach demonstrates a substantial performance advantage over all previous monocular 3D object detectors on widely recognized 3D detection benchmarks for roadside cameras. The code and pre-trained models will be released soon.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is one of the challenging research areas revolving around rapid communication services. Nonetheless, these networks are afflicted by congestion, routing, and security issues, particularly in urban areas, which result in delay and computational complexity issues and late message delivery or data congestion. Sensitive data are collected and transmitted over public channels, which presents challenges for security and authentication. Moreover, the security of ITS-smart vehicle communication is impacted by the complexity of discrete logarithm and factoring problems, which could make data transmission and authentication very difficult in the presence of highly scalable quantum computers. Hence, we present a novel, secure and verifiable post-quantum data transmission and authentication protocol for ITS (RAVEN), specifically designed for smart automobiles. The RAVEN scheme incorporates a discrete Gaussian distribution and lattice-based cryptosystem for enhanced performance and security. We use the formal verification method SVO logic and an informal security analysis against passive and active assaults to validate the security of mutual authentication. The use of a well-known automated AVISPA tool allowed for a further evaluation of the scheme’s security soundness. The OMNeT++ simulator is used to evaluate the efficacy of the RAVEN scheme in terms of end-to-end delay, throughput, and energy consumption. The evaluation findings demonstrate that the suggested method achieves reduced costs in terms of computation and communication compared to existing schemes but with comprehensive security that can greatly benefit ITS.},

In particular, we consider the real-world scenario in which a weight-restricted UAV cannot pick up all parcels within a single route; therefore the parcel delivery must be divided into multiple trajectories while avoiding no-fly zones. We formulate this problem mathematically as the minimization of total delivery time, which jointly optimizes the pick-up indicators, the lengths of the time slots, and the horizontal and vertical trajectories. To address the non-convexity of the formulated mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we employ a successive convex approximation to convert the problem into a convex form concerning optimization variables and utilize a penalty convex-concave procedure to preserve the binary characteristics of the pick-up indicators. Subsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a block decent algorithm to efficiently identify the optimal solution by solving the relaxed convex problem. To address the problem of high computational complexity associated with the optimization-based algorithm, we also present an unsupervised deep learning (DL)-based heuristic algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve considerably shorter delivery times than the baseline schemes in various scenarios. Furthermore, the DL-based scheme requires about 10% longer delivery time than the optimization-based scheme, but it can approximate the UAV strategy with substantially reduced computation time.},

Considering ship deballasting delays in DBETs and their influences on channel traffic flow, this paper proposes a channel traffic scheduling (CTS) optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The CTS problem is formulated into a Markov decision process with tailored state and action definitions. Practical constraints, such as tidal windows and dynamic switching traffic mode, are incorporated into action selection processes. In coping with large state-action spaces caused by practical applications, a hierarchical DRL framework is proposed to perform layered decision-making. Relying on the reward signal design, DRL agents can learn optimization policies to produce integrated scheduling plans of channel traffic and ship deballasting operations while minimizing ship mooring, unberthing, and deballasting delays. A proximal policy optimization method is developed for coupling training DRL agents. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can converge faster to better scheduling strategies and efficiently generate high-quality CTS solutions for industrial-scale applications.},

Identifying and transferring these domain-invariant features can significantly boost model accuracy and robustness, providing new insights into dealing with modeling issues like traffic data insufficiency and dataset shift. However, how to acquire transferable network traffic flow patterns from multiple traffic regions and adapt such knowledge to downstream prediction tasks of target regions remains challenging. To realize domain-invariant traffic flow pattern transfer and provide more robust prediction under insufficient data conditions, we propose a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) guided transfer learning method, namely physics-guided multi-source domain adversarial network (PG-MDAN). First, an MFD similarity measure is proposed to determine what traffic flow patterns are transferable and to what extent they can be transferred. PG-MDAN embeds this physics-informed transferability measure in domain adversarial pre-training for better adaptation ability. Numerical experiments based on two real-world urban network traffic datasets show that PG-MDAN can successfully transfer recurrent and non-recurrent network traffic flow patterns from multiple regions to provide more robust and responsive prediction performance. Finally, extensive sensitivity analysis is conducted, and the results validate that applying such physical regularization can effectively avoid negative transfer and provide a flexible tool to initiate traffic flow pattern transfer in practice.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for fast and energy-efficient parcel deliveries driven by the growth of e-commerce has made drones an attractive option for urban freight. However, considering drones’ energy usage throughout the entire delivery process is essential when assessing their suitability. This research introduces an energy consumption model encompassing all flight stages—takeoff, flight, landing, hovering—simulating last-mile energy consumption within drone delivery-based systems. Additionally, it conducts a novel comparison between a system relying only on drones (Drone-only system) and a system combining drones with public transportation (Drone-APT system). The comparison considers factors such as consumer distribution, warehouse locations, and drone battery characteristics. The results, based on the real 3D structure of Barcelona, demonstrate that the Drone-APT system maintains consistent power consumption across different consumer distributions and warehouse locations. Conversely, the Drone-only system ensures consistent delivery times in these same scenarios. Furthermore, the Drone-APT improves energy efficiency, especially when direct drone delivery is limited by battery life. However, this efficiency improvement leads to increased delivery time due to the unpredictable timing of public transport vehicles. Striking a balance between drone energy consumption and delivery time is crucial, warranting further research to identify the most sustainable solution for last-mile delivery. This study offers valuable insights into the advantages and trade-offs associated with integrating drones and public transportation, laying the groundwork for future optimization efforts. Future work could incorporate intelligent technologies like machine learning to effectively address these trade-offs by dynamically optimizing drone paths based on energy efficiency and delivery time.},

  abstract     = {The development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication facilitates the study of cooperative positioning (CP) techniques for vehicular applications. The CP methods can improve the positioning availability and accuracy by inter-vehicle ranging and data exchange between vehicles. However, the inter-vehicle ranging can be easily interrupted due to many factors such as obstacles in-between two cars. Without inter-vehicle ranging, the other cooperative data such as vehicle positions will be wasted, leading to performance degradation of range-based CP methods. To fully utilize the cooperative data and mitigate the impact of inter-vehicle ranging loss, a novel cooperative positioning method aided by plane constraints is proposed in this paper. The positioning results received from cooperative vehicles are used to construct the road plane for each vehicle. The plane parameters are then introduced into CP scheme to impose constraints on positioning solutions. The state-of-art factor graph optimization (FGO) algorithm is employed to integrate the plane constraints with raw data of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as well as inter-vehicle ranging measurements. The proposed CP method has the ability to resist the interruptions of inter-vehicle ranging since the plane constraints are computed by just using position-related data. A vehicle can still benefit from the position data of cooperative vehicles even if the inter-vehicle ranging is unavailable. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed CP method in positioning performance over the existing methods, especially when the inter-ranging interruptions occur.},

  abstract     = {Effective classification of autonomous vehicle (AV) driving behavior emerges as a critical area for diagnosing AV operation faults, enhancing autonomous driving algorithms, and reducing accident rates. This paper presents the Gramian Angular Field Vision Transformer (GAF-ViT) model, specifically designed for analyzing AV driving behavior. The GAF-ViT model is developed upon a novel integration of three key components: GAF Transformation Module, which transforms multivariate driving behavior representative sequences into multi-channel images; Channel Attention Module, which prioritizes relevant behavioral features to enhance classification effectiveness; and Multi-Channel ViT Module, which employs advanced image recognition techniques to accurately classify the resulting multi-channel driving behavior images. This framework not only facilitates detailed analysis of complex multivariate driving behavioral data but also leverages the capabilities of vision-based pattern recognition methods to uncover subtle driving behavior nuances. Experimental evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset of trajectories demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Agent-based model predictive control (AMPC) has recently been proposed as a distributed scheme that collaborates with all agents to achieve optimal holistic performance. However, its optimality highly depends on the prediction accuracy that requires all agents or their contributions to be known, which is too idealistic for actual implementation. This research proposes a novel practical hybrid control scheme - learning agent-based MPC (LAMPC), combining the model-based AMPC approach and data-based learning methods to improve the holistic vehicle performance for multi-agent systems. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) enhanced by an online data management strategy serves as the learning core to predict unknown contributions. A novel multi-step prediction mechanism leverages the GPR learning potential along the horizon. The predicted mean, representing the learned unknown contributions, completes the system model in the MPC for more accurate control. Meanwhile, a stochastic framework is formulated to guarantee control safety and feasibility using soft chance constraints based on the prediction variance. Both simulations and experiments show that, with the learning capability, LAMPC outperforms the traditional AMPC. LAMPC can achieve higher tracking performance in well-learned scenarios and always guarantee constraint satisfaction even in less-learned scenarios. Moreover, the proposed hybrid control scheme is efficient for real-time implementation and is flexible to any control agent topology.},

  abstract     = {Visual odometry (VO) is a critical component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with extensive applications in robot navigation and beyond. However, prevalent VO methods often underperform in intricate environments with dynamic textures, insufficient lighting, and rapid rotational movements, primarily due to constrained feature selection and inadequate image structure comprehension. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel VO framework, termed Multi-Attention Saliency Direct Sparse Odometry (MAS-DSO). Specifically, MAS-DSO significantly bolsters performance and robustness through accurate recognition of visually salient regions and deep understanding of image structures. With regard to the problem of limited feature selection, we propose a Saliency Transformer Generative Adversarial Network (STRGAN) based on a multi-attention mechanism, narrowing the feature selection scope and enhancing its accuracy. Addressing the issue of limited understanding of image structure, we introduce a robust method for gradient computation to accurately determine the gradient values of features. Building on this, we have designed a dynamic gradient weight adjustment strategy that takes into account both the gradient magnitude and local image structure, thereby achieving precise gradient weight distribution. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations on the ICL-NUIM and TUM monoVO datasets reveal that MAS-DSO not only outperforms SalientDSO, DSO, and ORB-SLAM in performance metrics but also significantly surpasses other methods in saliency prediction performance and mapping quality. In conclusion, MAS-DSO not only augments feature selection efficiency but also enhances the processing prowess for diverse images in complex settings.},

  abstract     = {Pose prediction and trajectory forecasting represent pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, crucially enhancing the planning and decision-making capabilities of self-driving vehicles. However, a prevailing challenge is that many existing algorithms for these tasks necessitate supervised training, demanding substantial human effort and computational resources. To alleviate this resource-intensive burden, this paper introduces an innovative method for predicting future object poses and trajectories in a 3D space, obviating the requirement for manual annotations. The enhanced self-supervised 3D point cloud prediction algorithm proposed in this study incorporates an 3D Action Attention module, augmenting TCNet’s proficiency in extracting vital spatiotemporal and motion information from continuous point cloud range images. Additionally, 3D Octave Convolution is harnessed to mitigate the computational overhead introduced by the 3D Action Attention module, consequently accelerating the model’s inference speed. This advanced self-supervised 3D point cloud prediction algorithm is denoted as TSMNet. TSMNet outperforms the baseline TCNet and several SOTA 3D point cloud prediction models when evaluated on the KITTI Odometry dataset. Moreover, it showcases robust generalization capabilities in unfamiliar environments. Notably, TSMNet can predict future point cloud data for five frames in a mere 33 milliseconds, surpassing the frame rate of typical LiDAR sensors, which typically operate at 10Hz. Furthermore, when integrated with a point cloud clustering and tracking algorithm, the improved self-supervised 3D point cloud prediction algorithm facilitates the extraction of object poses and trajectories. The performance metrics of the point cloud clustering and tracking algorithm attain remarkable levels of accuracy, with a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 86.12% and a Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP) of 91.01% on the KITTI dataset.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherently coupled dynamics of vehicle and powertrain levels, this paper proposes an energy management strategy that co-optimizes the power split and operating mode selection for hybrid electric vehicles. A mixed integer nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) problem is formulated to guarantee the sub-optimality and robustness of the strategy. The optimization objectives are to achieve minimal fuel consumption, battery degradation inhibition and state-of-charge maintenance within the system physical constraints. However, the existence of logic events and continuous variables poses a significant challenge to solve the optimal control problem. A Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP)-Dynamic Programming (DP) based solution method is presented, avoiding segmented linear approximation to the powertrain model and relaxation approach to the problem. The PMP calculates the optimal control sequence and cost for each mode, then determines the optimal operating mode based on DP. Moreover, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is developed for vehicle speed prediction to deal with the stochastic uncertainties of driving conditions. Experimental results are demonstrated that the proposed algorithm offers about 2% to 10% cost reduction compared to the conventional MPC, while still keeping relatively close to the result of DP.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has presented an opportunity to enhance user positioning accuracy. However, practical constraints, such as limited receiver channels and power consumption, necessitate judicious satellite selection. Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) serves as a critical indicator for optimizing positioning performance, but determining the subset with the optimal GDOP value involves solving an impractical combinatorial optimization problem. A compromise solution seeks to balance computational complexity while sacrificing some optimality. Consequently, finding an optimal combination of satellites with a low computational burden yet quasi-optimal GDOP value remains a challenge. In response to this challenge, we introduce a pioneering approach in this paper: a super-fast satellite selection algorithm based on power series expansion (SF-PSE). This paper derives a “Xiao-Liang formula” based on power series expansion and the Sherman-Morrison formula. Using this formula, we propose two low-computational-cost rapid iterative algorithms (F-PSE and SF-PSE). Among these algorithms, SF-PSE notably reduces the computational burden through an approximate iterative inverse matrix-guided search method. Experimental results demonstrate that satellite combinations identified by F-PSE and SF-PSE yield nearly the same accuracy while reducing computation time by 70% and 87%, respectively, compared to the SMALLER method.},

Main contributions include developing and analyzing a new DSPEV model, which incorporates distributed electric vehicles and a solar-powered charging station with a battery. In islanding mode, DSPEV converters are modelled as grid-forming (GFM) converters, which enhances MG stability while also charging/discharging distributed electric vehicles. The resiliency-guided physics-informed neural network (named RPiNN) is applied for GFM converters, which considers the dynamics of low-inertia MGs and incorporates the physics laws governing DSPEV and MG behaviors. Furthermore, a novel resiliency-guided control framework that coordinates DSPEVs with GFM converters and the RPiNN is proposed. This framework addresses unexpected islanding scenarios and ensures both grid synchronization and re-synchronization, while maintaining acceptable voltage and frequency profiles for various MG operations. The proposed framework is validated through simulation results in islanding and grid-connected scenarios within a weak MG. Results shown that the proposed RPiNN effectively stabilizes islanding scenarios by reducing voltage and frequency fluctuations, demonstrating resilience and robustness in various operating conditions, and facilitating smooth grid synchronization.},

These modules facilitate the efficient transfer of knowledge from the MGNet teacher to MGNet student, allowing the lightweight network, MGNet-S*, to achieve remarkable performance. Numerous experiments proved that our proposed MGNet-S* outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 88.6% reduction in parameter count and 82.5% reduction in floating-point operations compared to those of the MGNet teacher network.},

Given these personalized application scenarios, the use of traditional privacy protection technology may encounter limitations. To address this problem, we propose a compressive privacy-preserving algorithm that employs a compression matrix to maintain the normal function of applications while ensuring privacy. Specifically, the algorithm utilizes sensors to linearly transform the original vectors of measurements at each time step into a lower-dimensional space. The compressed measurements are then transmitted to a fusion center. Optimization problems are formulated for the current time step as well as two time steps. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using the Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results and comparisons further validate the effectiveness of the compressive privacy algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Introducing the human driver’s intelligence of interpreting and anticipating preceding traffic conditions into automated driving control is crucial for improved driving experience. Existing human-like automated driving systems imitate human driver’s reactive control patterns without reflecting anticipative behaviors. These systems involve either online solving predictive optimization or offline training machine learning techniques, which are computationally expensive and impractical for current production vehicles. Additionally, these systems are less effective in traffic environments with lean vehicular connectivity. This paper proposes a practical human-inspired anticipative cruise control for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) that not only respects human drivers’ reactive driving preferences but exploits their anticipative capabilities to enhance mixed traffic flow. Two major contributions are (i) learning the reactive control objective from a segment of the human driving trajectory based on a recovery matrix; and (ii) data-enabled preceding traffic anticipation leveraging the behavioral theory of linear systems, which provides the estimated motion of immediate preceding vehicle (IPV) at a personalized anticipation horizon, considering the downstream traffic trends from a distant connected human-driven vehicle (CHV). The proposed control strategy is evaluated on a human-in-the-loop (HiL) driving simulator. Results validate its real-time implementation potential in (a) learning human-like reactive driving control; (b) improving traffic flow energy economy by 4.58%; (c) enhancing traffic efficiency by attenuating latent traffic fluctuations. Moreover, result reveals that the capability of mitigating traffic fluctuations is affected by the anticipation horizon, which can be adaptably learned from human driver’s timely guidance by virtue of their intelligence of adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Platooning is a promising cooperative driving application for future intelligent transportation systems. In order to assign vehicles to platoons, some algorithm for platoon formation is required. Such vehicle-to-platoon assignments have to be computed on-demand, e.g., when vehicles join or leave the freeways. In order to get best results from platooning, individual properties of involved vehicles have to be considered during the assignment computation. In this paper, we explore the computation of vehicle-to-platoon assignments as an optimization problem based on similarity between vehicles. We define the similarity and, vice versa, the deviation among vehicles based on the desired driving speed of vehicles and their position on the road. We create three approaches to solve this assignment problem: centralized solver, centralized greedy, and distributed greedy, using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver and greedy heuristics, respectively. Conceptually, the approaches differ in both knowledge about vehicles as well as methodology. We perform a large-scale simulation study using PlaFoSim to compare all approaches. While the distributed greedy approach seems to have disadvantages due to the limited local knowledge, it performs as good as the centralized solver approach across most metrics. Both outperform the centralized greedy approach, which suffers from synchronization and greedy selection effects. The centralized solver approach however assumes global knowledge and requires a complex MIP solver to compute vehicle-to-platoon assignments. Overall, the distributed greedy approach achieves close to optimal results but requires the least assumptions and complexity. Therefore, we consider the distributed greedy approach the best approach among all presented approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of fuzzy adaptive fixed-time formation control is studied for nonholonomic multirobot systems (NMRSs) subject to unknown dead-zones and multiple constraints. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to identify nonlinear NMRSs with uncertain dynamics, and then adaptive technique are utilized to compensate for unknown dead-zones parameters. By combining prescribed performance control (PPC) method, the transient and steady-state performances of the NMRSs are guaranteed, thereby further achieving collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance. On this basis, in order to achieve fixed-time convergence of formation tracking errors and eliminate the effect of unknown dead-zones, a novel adaptive robust fixed-time formation control (FxTFC) strategy is further proposed by introducing fixed-time stability theory and command filter technique. It can avoid the output shafts do not acting for a short time period when the input shafts turn rapidly, ensure the nonlinear NMRSs are fixed-time stable and all signals are bounded, which can be proved by constructing the Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs). In the end, the simulation studies are carried out to show the efficacy of the developed robust FxTFC strategy. The result is that even if there are actuator dead-zones among each robot, formation tracking can also be achieved in fixed-time.},

  abstract     = {Memory-based networks have achieved tremendous success in video object segmentation. However, these methods still suffer from unfaithful segmentation and inferior efficiency under complicated video scenarios. The reasons are mainly threefold: 1) Weak perception of fast-moving targets due to individual frame memory patterns without capturing inter-frame motion; 2) Lack of discrimination to visually similar appearances due to the limited receptive field; 3) Redundant computation caused by matching with all memorized frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporo-Spatial Parallel Sparse Memory network (TSPSM) for efficient video object segmentation. Our TSPSM constructs a temporal memory bank and a spatial memory bank in parallel to memorize complementary discriminative object cues. The temporal bank exploits discriminative temporal motion cues, while the spatial bank mines spatial context cues between adjacent frames with large receptive fields, thereby alleviating the ambiguity caused by similar instances and fast movements. To reduce redundant computation without sacrificing performance during the matching step, we further design a parallel sparse memory reader based on the constructed informative memory banks, which efficiently retrieves relevant temporal and spatial information in a parallel way. Experiments demonstrate that our TSPSM achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time speed on DAVIS, and YouTube-VOS benchmarks. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that the proposed TSPMC module can be applied to existing methods as a generic plugin to significantly improve performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the maneuverability and cost-effectiveness, UAVs are visioned as a versatile assistant for networking in intelligent transportation systems. Per-packet path reconstruction that reveals the multi-hop forwarding path of each packet is a fundamental service for network management and optimization. Unfortunately, most existing reconstruction schemes are designed for static networks with stationary devices which cannot be applied to UAV networks with strong mobility and frequent topology changes. Besides, the limited energy and resources of UAVs make it even more challenging to reconstruct dynamic paths. To achieve accurate and low-cost reconstruction, we propose an incremental path reconstruction (InPrec) for dynamic UAV networks. With InPrec, each UAV only records the changes of its one-hop neighbors in a distributed and change-driven manner. The sink UAV then incrementally recovers the full path information by replaying the recorded changes to the historical paths. In this way, InPrec can adapt to the topology changes and avoid repetitive records of the common sub-paths in dynamic UAV networks. To explore the pros and cons of InPrec, we conduct measurement studies and theoretical analysis from perspective of information entropy. Simulations also demonstrate that InPrec can accurately reconstruct the paths with time-varying topology and reduces much redundancy (by 85% on average) of the state-of-the-art work. As far as we know, this is the first path reconstruction approach applicable to large-scale dynamic UAV networks.},

  abstract     = {Errors are ubiquitous under the influence of multifarious uncertain factors in real traffic, causing information that used to regulate the mobility of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to be inconsistent with true information, which provoke concerns on CAVs platoon performance. To date, due to the lack of appropriate model and analytical methodology, our understanding of influence mechanisms of various information errors on CAVs and the resulting anomalous platoon dynamics remains limited. Therefore, this study develops a comprehensive framework to fill these gaps. First, we expound the possible information errors in CAVs, upon which we categorize them into three types: source error, transmission error, and latency error. Second, we formulate a generic bi-layer architecture model with dynamical information flow topology, incorporating the information with errors from both of vehicular and communication layers, so as to describe the longitudinal dynamics of CAVs with information errors. Third, we derive the closed-loop and pseudo string stability conditions of CAVs platoon in the presence of information errors. Final, we perform extensive numerical simulations to exposit the effects of three types of information errors on CAVs platoon dynamics. The results show that information errors may cause deteriorated platoon stability, oscillations, reduced traffic efficiency, wasted road resources, and even collision accidents, which undoubtedly degrade the platoon performance. Overall, this study uncovers how different types of information errors influence the individual behaviors of CAVs and thus the longitudinal dynamics evolution of platoon, laying foundation to establish corresponding anomaly detection and counteracting control methods.},

Then, guidance kinematic laws are developed using the universal barrier function (UBF) technique to constrain distance and orientation errors and address the fragility problem associated with existing prescribed performance controllers. Subsequently, low-complexity fuzzy approximators and constrained auxiliary signals are employed at the kinetic design level to eliminate the negative effect of unknown hydrodynamic functions and input saturation. Finally, smooth switching signal-based dynamic event-triggered kinetic control laws are developed to minimize the working frequency of actuator and prevent large control transitions. Theoretical analysis confirms that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, and the Zeno behavior can be averted. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Current quadric SLAM methods are based on the assumption of a static environment and can only reconstruct static quadrics in the scene, which limits their applications in complex dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system that is capable of reconstructing dynamic objects as quadrics, with a unified framework for jointly optimizing pose estimation, multi-object tracking (MOT), and quadric parameters. We propose a robust object-centric quadric initialization algorithm for both static and moving objects, which decouples the prior estimation of the object pose from the quadric parameters. The object is initialized with a coarse sphere, and quadric parameters are further refined. We design a novel factor graph that tightly optimizes camera pose, object pose, map points and quadric parameters within the sliding window-based optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a dynamic SLAM that combines quadric representations and MOT in a tightly coupled optimization. We perform qualitative and quantitative experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, and demonstrate the robustness and accuracy in terms of camera localization, dynamic quadric initialization, mapping and tracking. Our system demonstrates the potential application of object perception with quadric representation in complex dynamic scenes.},

In order to manage and enhance traffic data quality, most existing methods recover single traffic variable data independently based on intra-view spatiotemporal correlations, while the inter-view complementarities are ignored. In this paper, we leverage both intra-view and inter-view correlations for multiple traffic variable data simultaneous recovery. To explore the inter-view relationships, a multi-view subspace consistency learning module is developed to bridge connections and activate complementarities among multi-view traffic data. Specifically, the latent subspace features of each data view are extracted and organized as a multi-view subspace tensor with low-rank regularization. The multi-view low-rank tensor captures the consistent subspace structure across multiple data views while reserving unique features within each data view. To characterize the intra-view dependencies, a tensor-based low-rank representation is presented to explore the distinct spatiotemporal patterns within single-view traffic data. For model validation, we additionally design a nonrandom missing pattern to simulate sensor permanent failure cases in practice.

Relevant research tends to measure station coupling strength under normal conditions, but this strength would change due to the variations of network topology, transportation, and travel characteristics under cascading failures. To address the above issues, this study proposes a multimodal coupled map lattice model addressing station coupling strength during failures. This model aims to explore the spread of failures across coupled multimodal transit networks, identifying the paths and intensity of cascading failures between different public transport modes. It also examines the impacts of station coupling asymmetry, resulting from transportation efficiency and operation modes of different transit systems on cascading failures. The proposed model is then applied to the metro-bus coupled networks of Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that cascading failures on metro network would be alleviated when coupled with bus network. However, cascading failures are magnified on bus network when coupled with metro network. On the metro-bus coupled networks, failures of stations/stops with higher station coupling strength would cause more serious cascading failures than those of failures of important stations or stops on single network. In addition, the spread speed of cascading failures on metro-bus coupled networks depends largely on the number of failed metro stations. Findings of this work would offer valuable insights for the planning of robust metro-bus coupled systems and efficient emergency responses to avoid large-scale network failures.},

MVSE-Net can convert point cloud data acquired by LiDAR in real time into global descriptors for retrieval. Processing a point cloud by projecting it onto a 2D image can greatly improve computational efficiency. We projected the point cloud into a range-view (RV) image and a bird’s-eye-view (BEV) image in forward and top view, respectively. The semantic segmentation network is then used to process the RV image, and the feature extraction part of the semantic model is connected to the transformer attention module to further refine the features for the place recognition task. The point cloud containing the semantic segmentation results is then converted into a semantic BEV image, and the multi-channel BEV image is processed using a group convolutional network. Finally, the features of the two branches are fused into a global feature representation by post-fusion.

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for acquiring high-resolution imagery in urban environments. Efficiently detecting cars from these images is vital for various applications, including traffic management, urban planning, and security. However, the abundance of features and the large variability in the appearance of cars within high-resolution UAV images pose significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-task framework designed to enhance car detection by focusing specifically on road regions. The model utilizes a shared encoder and a fully convolutional network decoder, augmented by an attentive binary fusion for road and car segmentation. For car detection, we combine a deep layer aggregation with a CenterNet detection head. During training, UAV images are downsampled, passed through the encoder and both decoders, generating road/car confidence maps and car detection results. In the inference phase, a region extraction module is designed to extract high-resolution road segments according to the road segmentation mask. To enhance detection accuracy, the region extraction module concatenates the input image with the car confidence map. We also introduce a scale-weighted focal loss in response to challenges associated with detecting smaller cars in high-resolution UAV images. Experimental results on the UAVid2020 and VisDrone2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in both inference time and accuracy, meeting the real-time requirements of intelligent traffic systems.},

However, the low coverage of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) detection devices leads to difficulty in estimating OD. As an emerging traffic data, the trajectories of connected vehicles (CVs) can effectively provide information on their origin and destination. To this end, this paper presents a framework of an autoencoder network utilizing feature transfer to estimate urban dynamic OD based on the characteristics of two data sources. Specifically, a generative adversarial network is introduced to learn high-dimensional feature that is domain-invariant in two data domains. In addition, a pre-training fine-tuning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge pretrained from CV data to the limited AVI observation for OD imputation. Finally, the model was subjected to a real-world road network test. The results showed that for all OD flows the relative error was 11.23 vehicles/30 minutes, which outperformed baseline models, including popular neural networks and existing estimation models for multi-source data fusion. Furthermore, the model’s robustness to external factors, such as observation conditions and data quality, was examined. The results demonstrated that the model consistently delivers satisfactory estimation performance across a diverse range of conditions.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR has become one of the primary 3D object detection sensors in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent sparsity of point clouds, certain objects exhibit structure incompleteness in occluded and distant areas, which hampers the accurate perception of objects in 3D space. To tackle this challenge, we propose Semantic and Structure Completion Network (S2CNet) for 3D object detection. Concretely, we design the Semantic Completion (SeC) module to generate semantic features in Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) space, utilizing a teacher-student paradigm. Notably, we adopt a coarse-to-fine guidance strategy to encourage student network to generate semantic features specifically within foreground regions. This ensures that the student network focuses on the generation of foreground object features. Besides, we introduce an attention-based module to adaptively fuse the generated features and raw features. SeC module faces particular limitation when dealing with objects containing only a few points, in such case, the network is prone to generating low quality proposals with inaccurate localization. Complementary to SeC module, we introduce the Structure Completion (StC) module, in which a group of structural proposals are obtained by traversing most structures in a structure-guided manner, and thus at least one proposal with ground truth similar structure can be guaranteed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for the hard setting objects with fewer points.},

  abstract     = {Road administrators require fine-scaled information regarding road surface conditions to ensure efficient operation during winter periods. However, conventional models offer low-resolution information at a scale comparable to meteorological meshes or the spatial configuration of road weather information systems. Additionally, few methods have been proposed for predicting road surface conditions specifically in urban areas, where roads frequently experience shading from surrounding buildings. This study proposes a statistical approach for predicting road surface temperature and conditions in urban road networks. The complicated accumulated distribution of solar radiation along each road is calculated and used as an effective explanatory variable that considers the complex shading effects of nearby structures. The proposed model adopts a Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchical framework for predicting road surface temperature using a solar radiation variable. Furthermore, a spatial machine learning model is implemented to estimate road surface conditions. The model classifies icy road conditions into six distinct types, achieving a sensitivity of 0.7712 and a balanced accuracy of 0.8637. Ultimately, the model provides significant information required for decision-making processes aimed at ensuring efficient winter road management. These results indicate that the applicability of the proposed approach can extend beyond the studied area, demonstrating its potential for broader implementation.},

However, recent studies based on global adaptive graphs, local spatial-temporal graphs, and self-attention mechanisms struggle to effectively capture the dynamic and intricate relations in demand. Moreover, existing dynamic graph generators face challenges in efficiently producing high-quality graphs to learn the diverse interactions among zones along time axis and their shared patterns spanning various time scales. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel Local-Perception-Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Evolving Graph Transformer Network (LPE-STGTN), aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of extracting intricate local dependencies in taxi demand. Specifically, we elaborately design a spatial-temporal evolving graph generator to absorb shared and diversified inter-zone relations across different temporal periodicities and specific interactions among zones within each time step. Furthermore, an attention free transformer with local context (AFT-local) is introduced to effectively learn the correlations between adjacent time steps. Extensive experiments on three taxi datasets of New York and Beijing are carried out to evaluate the superior performance of our model. Compared with the most competitive baseline, our model achieves a balance between effectiveness and efficiency on three datasets, with average training time reduction of 70.66% and average performance improvement of 1.96%.},

  abstract     = {The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that has attracted extensive research efforts in developing exact methods and heuristics. However, the scalability and generalization of learning-based approaches remain significant challenges. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an approach that integrates supervised learning with traditional approaches. In particular, we introduce the concept of “anchors,” which represents nodes that should be connected to their nearest neighbors in the optimal solution. Our approach differs from the previous supervised learning approaches in that, instead of using the whole distance matrix, our neural network leverages local information to make predictions, which enables it to handle arbitrarily large-scale TSP instances without a decline on prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully identifies 87% of the anchors with a precision of over 95% for both generated instances and TSPLIB instances, which were unseen by the model during the training. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by integrating the predicted anchors into existing methods such as the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) model and the insertion algorithms. Our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in solution quality and computational time. By comparing with the graph pointer network, a state-of-the-art learning-based approach, the proposed algorithm achieves a 28% reduction in the average gap and a 59% decrease in computational time for solving TSP instances with 1,000 nodes.},

However, optimizing the deployment of RSUs while considering their deployment at both fixed locations and on mobile vehicles remains a challenging issue. To bridge this gap, we develop two spatio-temporal networks derived from vehicle trajectories. Subsequently, the joint deployment challenge of static and mobile RSUs is articulated as a mixed-integer programming model. After linearization, the model can be directly solved by CPLEX. Additionally, the integrated optimization problem can also be formulated as a route-based model. Due to the exponential growth of route numbers, a branch-and-price (BAP) algorithm is designed to solve the route-based model. Within the framework of the BAP, we develop a heuristic technique for generating effective initial solutions. Based on the characteristics of the spatio-temporal network, a directed acyclic graph shortest path algorithm is utilized to accelerate the solution of column generation pricing problem at each node. Simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the BAP can generate verifiable high-quality solutions and has a significant speed advantage over CPLEX for large-scale problems. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the system’s responses to various influencing factors.},

This paper presents a comprehensive U2G ultra-wideband (UWB) channel model by considering the large-scale fading (LSF), including path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), and airframe shadowing (AS). The effects of carrier frequency, bandwidth, building distribution, and UAV airframe structure on the LSF are fully studied. Different from the traditional bandwidth-independent PL calculation method, an extended closed-form expression for calculating PL is proposed to capture the new characteristics of ultra-wide bandwidth. The SF part is statistically described by a parametric lognormal model, and the built-up scenario-dependent parameters are predicted by a hybrid method with the ray-tracing and virtual scenario technologies. In addition, the AS part with respect to the airframe structure and posture variation is derived. It consists of the direct and reflected path components which are obtained by the deterministic and statistical approaches, respectively. The numerical simulations show that bandwidth, building distribution, and airframe structure have great influence on the LSF characteristics. For example, the fluctuation of received power can reach 30 dB due to the AS. The proposed model also shows its effectiveness and reliability by comparing with the RT and measured data, as well as the good compatibility with standardized models for some typical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The advent of autonomous driving and electrification is enabling the deployment of Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (E-AMoD) systems, whereby electric autonomous vehicles provide on-demand mobility. Crucially, the design of the individual vehicles and the fleet, and the operation of the system are strongly coupled. Hence, to maximize the system-level performance, they must be optimized in a joint fashion. To this end, this paper presents a framework to jointly optimize the fleet design in terms of battery capacity and number of vehicles, and the operational strategies of the E-AMoD system, with the aim of maximizing the operator’s total profit. Specifically, we first formulate this joint optimization problem using directed acyclic graphs as a mixed integer linear program, which can be solved using commercial solvers with optimality guarantees. Second, to solve large instances of the problem, we propose a solution algorithm that solves for randomly sampled sub-problems, providing a more conservative solution of the full problem, and devise a heuristic approach to tackle larger individual sub-problem instances. Finally, we showcase our framework on a real-world case study in Manhattan, where we demonstrate the interdependence between the number of vehicles, their battery size, and operational and fixed costs. Our results indicate that to maximize a mobility operator’s profit, a fleet of small and light vehicles with battery capacity of 20kWh only can strike the best trade-off in terms of battery degradation, fixed costs and operational efficiency.},

By leveraging these shared vectors from both preceding and following vehicles, we propose a novel and effective resilient controller for vehicle platoons against node/communication link attacks. More specifically, each vehicle determines the local state deviation vectors from neighboring vehicles. It then eliminates the vectors that are farthest from the origin, with the number of removed vectors equivalent to the maximum number of attacks. This approach offers a considerable advantage by mitigating the effects of abnormality and manipulation, making it robust against arbitrary information tampering within a pre-defined upper boundary for manipulated broadcast information. Importantly, we establish specific conditions for the proposed resilient design to guarantee the internal stability of the vehicle platoon under attacks.

  abstract     = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising research paradigm to address the demands of vehicular application requests. The dynamic nature of VFC poses challenges in distributing fog computing resources to the vehicular tasks. In VFC task scheduling problems, the optimization of the success rate of tasks and minimization of the energy consumption of vehicles ensure efficient completion of critical operations. Moreover, failing to consider the dependencies among the tasks leads to increased delays. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dependency and mobility-aware intelligent task scheduling (DMITS) mechanism to optimize the success rate of vehicular tasks and energy consumption of vehicles by considering the moving paths of the vehicles, the social relationships among the vehicles and dependencies of tasks. In this study, we model the social relationships among the vehicles based on their communication patterns and social characteristics to improve the success rate of the tasks. We consider the mobility of vehicles using the Markov renewal process (MRP) technique. Initially, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for the proposed problem. Further, we employ a federated deep reinforcement learning mechanism that uses the improved soft actor-critic (iSAC) technique to allocate tasks. We compare our proposed algorithm with existing task scheduling approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently in addressing task scheduling problems, achieving higher task success rates and lower energy consumption for vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Pavement crack detection poses a formidable challenge due to the intricate texture structures of cracks and the complex environmental settings in which they are situated. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning techniques has prompted a surge in the utilization of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods for pavement crack detection. While CNNs have exhibited remarkable results in crack detection tasks, they primarily excel at capturing local details with limited receptive fields, which can be insufficient for grasping global contextual information. Given the intricate nature of crack textures, it becomes imperative to leverage both global and local features for accurate detection. To address this issue, a transformer-based network with feature complementary fusion, refer to TFCF-Net, is introduced, which amalgamates Transformer and CNN architectures. Proposed TFCF-Net model prioritizes the Transformer branch for feature encoding, considering its strength in extracting global features, while the CNN branch is set as auxiliary encoding branch, which plays a complementary role for local feature extraction. Proposed TFCF-Net operates by utilizing global features as a foundation and iteratively refining them using local features, thus facilitating precise crack detection. This design enables proposed network to comprehensively capture both global and local information while judiciously fusing these two types of information based on the distinctive characteristics of cracks. To ensure effective fusion of global and local information, an Information Complementary Fusion (ICF) module is presented, which could efficiently merge the outputs of both encoding branches. To further optimize the fused information, a multi-dimensional attention (MA) module is proposed to embed into the, which enhances the model’s ability to capture long-range dependencies by optimizing information from multiple dimensions. Additionally, to improve the quality of input features on the decoding side, a multi-dimensional attention feature representation (MAFR) module is proposed, which expands the receptive field of the deepest semantic information, enabling the extraction of multi-scale feature representations. This paper rigorously evaluate proposed TFCF-Net against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using three publicly available pavement crack datasets. Experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TFCF-Net.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a generalized car-following (CF) model to depict the dynamics of traffic flow that includes human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected vehicles (CVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Notably, the model integrates human reaction times, information delays, and status data from multiple preceding vehicles endowed with communication capabilities. Then, by utilizing the perturbation method, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as an example is taken in this CF model to determine the stability condition of the mixed traffic based on CAV penetration rate and their spatial distribution. Finally, comprehensive co-simulation using PreScan and MATLAB/Simulink is developed to explore the impact of varying CAV penetration rates across seven distinct spatial distributions on traffic capacity and dynamic performance. The findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed model in analyzing mixed traffic scenarios comprising HDVs, CVs, and CAVs. Increasing CAV penetration rates can lead to improved stability, capacity, and dynamic performance within mixed traffic environments. Notably, at the CAV penetration rate below 60%, the spatial distribution labeled as CAVs-HDVs-CVs (where CAVs lead the traffic flow, followed by HDVs, then CVs) demonstrates superior dynamic performance, whereas the HDVs-CVs-CAVs configuration (with HDVs leading, followed by CVs, then CAVs) performs worst. However, it’s noteworthy that spatial distribution scarcely affects dynamic performance when the CAV penetration rate exceeds 60%.},

  abstract     = {Recent research mainly applies deep learning (DL) methods to short-term traffic forecasting. However, there is a growing interest in long-term forecasting, which allows action optimization at more steps in the future. Motivated by the encouraging success of contrastive representation learning, we propose a powerful and light framework, namely, Traffic Representation Extraction with Contrastive learning frameworK (TRECK), to improve traffic forecasting performance, especially for longer prediction terms. TRECK i) learns disentangled seasonal representations with contrastive learning, ii) enhances the learning of event data with entity embedding and iii) improves generalization and encourages obtaining more effective representations for the forecasting task through multi-task learning. TRECK can be directly applied to typical sequence-to-sequence DL prediction models. We evaluate TRECK when integrated with vanilla base models (RNN and BiLSTM) on large-size and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that TRECK can considerably boost the performance of base models and offer them the capability of handling increasing forecasting horizons. With TRECK, even a naive model like RNN can outperform state-of-the-art Transformer-based and GNN-based methods. Moreover, while avoiding any laborious feature design, the representations extracted by TRECK are more desirable than hand-crafted time features, yielding an 18.69% lower average MAE. Further analysis highlights its efficacy in diverse traffic conditions and in generating prediction intervals.},

Thanks to the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), it is capable of reconfiguring the propagation environment and has good prospects for forthcoming secure transmission in combination with UAV wireless network. In this paper, we facilitate RIS to aid the uplink communication between the ground user and the UAV in the existence of a malevolent jammer and an eavesdropper by maximizing the average secrecy rate (ASR) of the proposed scheme. In order to achieve this goal, we jointly optimize the transmission power of the ground user, the RIS phase shift, and the trajectory of the UAV. Nevertheless, the proposed problem cannot be solved directly because of the coupled optimization variables and the non-convexity. Consequently, we tackle it by decomposing the original problem into three achievable sub-problems, in which formulated problem could be handled by using alternative optimization, the successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation. Finally, we continuously optimize three variables and iterate over three sub-problems until the ASR converges to a stationary value. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively boost the ASR compared with other baselines.},

The proposed technology is based on fingerprinting. The difference between the existing fingerprinting and SC is that the location is estimated using the received signal strength (RSS) vector sequence stored while the vehicle is moving. The distance moved by the vehicle is estimated using long short-term memory, and the direction is calculated using the gyroscope in a smartphone. Using the moving trajectory and accumulated RSS of the vehicle, a user RSS surface (URS) is generated, and the URS is compared with the radio map to find the location with the highest correlation. Additionally, the proposed technology provides a SC coefficient value (SCC), which is a correlation result between URS and radio maps. Through the SCC, the user can know whether the estimated location is reliable. To verify the performance of the proposed system, an experiment is conducted using 11 Bluetooth low-energy beacons in an actual underground parking lot, and an average accuracy of 3.2 m was obtained. It has been shown to outperform other algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbor and particle filters. This technology can provide accurate and robust localization performance using a smartphone in an underground parking lot, and it is expected that seamless navigation would be possible in various indoor spaces. Thus, the proposed technology will be used in the future to develop continuous navigation between vehicles and pedestrians.},

In this paper, we propose a forward-looking vehicle dispatching strategy, which first predicts the expected distance saving that could be brought about by future orders and then solves a bipartite matching problem based on the prediction to match passengers with partially occupied or vacant vehicles or keep passengers waiting for next rounds of matching. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy, a number of simulation experiments and comparisons are conducted based on the real-world road network and open trip data from Haikou, China. Results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline strategies by generating approximately 31% more distance saving and 18% less average passenger detour distance. It indicates the significant benefits of considering future pairing opportunities in dispatching, and highlights the effectiveness of our innovative forward-looking vehicle dispatching strategy in improving system efficiency and user experience for dynamic ride-pooling services.},

  abstract     = {Amidst the global shift towards the electrification of mass transportation, the effective long- and short-term planning of electric buses (e-buses) is gaining precedence due to challenges such as limited driving range, charging infrastructure requirements, charging costs, and battery lifetime. In this work, we propose a three-module modeling and optimization framework for strategic, tactical, and operational planning of multi-depot e-bus shuttle fleets by developing a series of mixed-integer programming models. The vehicle scheduling module determines e-bus deployment and trip assignments, ensuring feasible service while leveling energy consumption and mitigating battery degradation across the fleet. The charger deployment and charging planning module determines the number of chargers to deploy at depots and e-bus charging schedules to minimize life cycle costs. This module integrates an e-bus charging model that accounts for limited charger availability and practical considerations such as minimum charging duration, charger recovery period, and out-of-office hours, along with a neural network-based battery degradation model to minimize degradation costs and enable uniform battery aging. Finally, the online charging scheduling module updates the charging schedules to handle uncertainties in trip energy consumption. Case studies on a university campus shuttle e-bus network demonstrate a life cycle cost reduction of up to 38.2%, including savings on charger procurement, electricity, and battery degradation. Moreover, the proposed framework facilitates up to a 90.2% decrease in degradation costs and up to a 92.2% reduction in aging non-uniformity, maintaining cost optimality under uncertainties with a deviation of less than 1.5% compared to an oracle model in randomly generated scenarios.},

It comprises Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Vehicular-Fogs (VFs), strategically positioned closer to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, reducing propagation latency compared to cloud-based solutions and ensuring satisfactory quality of service (QoS). However, during high-traffic events like concerts or athletic contests, MEC sites may face congestion and become overloaded. Utilizing offloading techniques, we can transfer computationally intensive tasks from resource-constrained devices to those with sufficient capacity, for accelerating tasks and extending device battery life. In this research, we consider offloading within a two-tier MEC and VF architecture, involving offloading from MEC to MEC and from MEC to VF. The primary objective is to minimize the average system cost, considering both latency and energy consumption. To achieve this goal, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing latency and energy while considering given resource constraints. To facilitate decision-making for nearly optimal computational offloading, we design an equivalent reinforcement learning environment that accurately represents the network architecture and the formulated problem. To accomplish this, we propose a Distributed-TD3 (DTD3) approach, which builds on the TD3 algorithm. Extensive simulations, demonstrate that our strategy achieves faster convergence and higher efficiency compared to other benchmark solutions.},

Transporting perishable products is a challenging task as it is difficult to preserve their nutritional value and freshness. To keep the freshness of such products in delivery, efficient transportation is critical. Besides, customers nowadays attach more importance to service flexibility, which contributes to customer satisfaction and is highly valued by suppliers. However, the service flexibility was seldom addressed previously in the delivery of fresh products. In this paper, we study a vehicle routing problem faced by a supplier who delivers perishable products to customers. We consider the service flexibility of the supplier who offers different delivery modes associated with differentiated time windows to customers. The supplier aims to maximize both its profit and customer satisfaction, where the customer satisfaction is measured by the weighted average quality loss of perishable products during delivery. This bi-objective vehicle routing problem with different customer priorities and delivery time windows is structured as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model. To obtain the Pareto frontier of the model, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm based on the $\varepsilon $ -constraint method and a multi-objective ALNS algorithm are developed with several improvement strategies proposed. The computational results conducted on modified Solomon’s instances validate the model and prove the efficiency of the algorithms. Sensitivity analysis of the problem and the algorithms provide some managerial insights.},

This paper develops a multi-scale flooding impact assessment framework and a validation method applied to road transportation in Wuhan, China. Using real-world traffic data in a historical flooding event, the validation results show the capability of the framework in predicting the post-flooding travel time of trips across different scales. The framework is further used to predict travel time delays in flooding at neighborhood, district, and city scales during peak-traffic periods. Results show that while flooding primarily impacts commuting times in central city areas, the integration of traffic accidents in flooding expands the impact to districts and communities farther away from the city center. At the city scale, our analysis indicates that the travel time to workplaces is mostly increased, compared to the increase in travel time to critical facilities. The proposed framework is also adopted to prioritize the treatment of flood-prone sites. These results show the potential of the framework to help flooding response and mitigation.},

  abstract     = {In the era of artificial intelligence, privacy has become a paramount concern, especially within intelligent transportation systems (ITS) where pedestrians are frequently captured by vehicle-mounted cameras for deep learning model training. To address this, we introduce 3PFS, a novel method designed to protect pedestrian privacy via face swapping while preserving the utility of processed images. Our method consists of a pedestrian detector, a face detector, a pre-processing module, a source face selection algorithm, and a face swapping algorithm. After detecting pedestrians and their corresponding faces, the pre-processing module enhances image quality. Our unique source face selection algorithm then chooses an appropriate face from our source face library, which is subsequently swapped with the target face using a face swapping algorithm. Notably, with the combination of a pedestrian tracking algorithm, our 3PFS is well-suited for video anonymization. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy to evaluate the performance of pedestrian anonymization methods. We validate the effectiveness of 3PFS through extensive experiments on a dataset we created based on the publicly available JAAD dataset and on videos captured using our robotic wheelchair.},

Additionally, the developing quantum attack strikes the original NP-hard problems to be solvable in polynomial time complexity. Therefore, it is fatal to build a secure environment for vehicles to communicate in C-V2X. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme utilizing blockchain deployed at the base station for distributed storage and retrieval of vehicles’ public keys. In the network, each vehicle is identified with a public-private key pair, upon which vehicular registration, authenticated key agreement and revocation rely. In particular, the lattice-based cryptography is applied to the distribution of the group key for broadcasting beacon messages and establishing session keys for a secure peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. Keys are updated as vehicles travel from one region to another and are revoked upon misbehavior detection. We analyzed the quantum resistance of our scheme theoretically and its conservation against certain attacks informally. Comparative analysis across computation, communication, storage and energy consumption demonstrates the characteristics of our scheme. Finally, the blockchain simulation demonstrates the scalability of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Background subtraction forms the basis of many safety applications in airport traffic management, such as the visual conflict warning system. However, deep learning methods often mistakenly identify stationary aircraft as foreground, mainly because they prioritize learning appearance over motion features. This means that stationary aircraft with a similar appearance to moving ones are often incorrectly classified as foreground. To address this issue, a Motion-enhanced Background Subtraction Network (MBSNet) is proposed in this paper. MBSNet is designed to focus more on motion information within an encoder-decoder framework. Firstly, a Motion Augmentation Encoder Module (MAEM) is introduced, which generates a clean background frame without foreground from previous frames. This module compares the background frame with the current frame containing moving objects, indirectly enhancing the motion component in the encoded features. Because targets on the airport ground are relatively sparse, MAEM ensures a clean background image. Secondly, a Motion Accumulation Decoder Module (MADM) is designed, which accumulates motion-augmented features from the current frame and past frames based on feature dissimilarity measurement. Since aircraft exhibit consistent motion patterns, such as continuous straight travel with occasional turns, MADM further enhances the motion component in the accumulated feature vector. Finally, MBSNet is evaluated on the AGVS dataset, and our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for airport background subtraction.},

  abstract     = {The development of the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) provides a promising solution to promoting road safety and driving experiences, but it also generates massive data, leading to network configuration and management issues. Fortunately, by integrating software-defined network (SDN) and VANET, a new network paradigm called software-defined vehicular network (SDVN) is proposed to tackle these problems via furnishing centralized control and programmability. With the help of SDN, the centralized controller provides global visibility about network devices and improves the efficiency of various applications. However, the building procedure of global topology also brings new security concerns to the SDVN. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the security of topology management under a standard SDVN scenario. By exploiting the high mobility of VANET and vulnerabilities in topology management inherited from SDN, we unveil five threats of topology poison in SDVN with lower attack bars. Based on such threats, we propose several attacks to poison the global topology of four mainstream controllers in emulated and real-world environments. Additionally, we present empirical studies to illustrate the impact of these attacks on network communication and topology-based applications. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of these attacks under existing state-of-the-art defense systems.},

Applying machine learning-based trust management for CAVs becomes imperative to capture complex features and adapt to dynamic situations. To deal with multiple misbehaviors and real traffic scenarios challenges, a trust management method for CAVs is proposed with data fusion, trust factor computation and two-tier trust prediction. First of all, three types of features on CAVs are analyzed, including spatio-temporal logic features, behavioral features and traffic flow features. Then, data fusion methods that combine beacon messages with map and detector data are proposed to enhance trust-related data. A multi-dimensional trust factor computation approach is then introduced using statistical methods. Finally, per-minute and multi-minute machine learning-based trust prediction methods are performed at the node level using the computed trust labels from each beacon. The results showed the effectiveness and real-time capability of the data fusion process, as well as the completeness of the trust factor computation. The trust prediction results showed both high performance at the per-minute level with models like XGBoost and further improved performance at the multi-minute level with deep learning models.},

  abstract     = {Shared bike prediction has been a crucial task in shared bike management, and many deep learning algorithms have shown promise in improving the precision of bike flow predictions. But the shared bike riding records are highly sensitive to meteorological and built environment factors. Additionally, the number of active stations at different times of the day varies widely, with most stations active during the day and only a few active at night, which needs to focus on local and global bike-sharing system information. Existing methods rarely consider both meteorological and built environment features, and overlook the local and global changes of bike-sharing systems in different time intervals. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive spatial-temporal network to predict the number of rented and returned bikes at the station level. This paper introduces a group multi-head self-attention mechanism (G-MSA) to divide all stations into small patches to capture the local and global spatial information. We also propose two types of adaptive adjacent matrices to reflect the dynamic connections between stations and the impact of external factors on shared bike flows. The proposed model is evaluated on four real-world shared bike datasets with varying time intervals, and the results outperform benchmark models. Moreover, ablation experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of G-MSA and the varying importance of meteorological features and built environment features across BSSs in different cities.},

In this paper, an inertial navigation system (INS) aided GNSS signal tracking architecture with long coherent integration periods is proposed to provide accurate and continuous carrier phase observations in challenging environments. In order to implement efficient long coherent integration, a GNSS real time kinematic (RTK)/INS ultra-tight integration algorithm is designed to compensate for the dynamics induced by the receiver-satellite relative motion, and a multichannel cooperative loop with a specialized discriminator is proposed to eliminate the negative effects due to the receiver oscillator instability. Meanwhile, an accurate open loop tracking strategy is designed to sustain the integer ambiguity during a signal blockage, improving the continuity of the carrier phases. Initial blockage test shows that the open loop strategy can keep the carrier phase error below 90 degrees for over 40 seconds. Moreover, an INS based cumulative cycle slip decision variable (CCSDV) is proposed to detect the carrier phase cycle slips accurately. Finally, field vehicle tests were carried out using a (micro-electro-mechanical system) MEMS IMU. It turns out the proposed architecture significantly improves the accuracy and continuity of the carrier phase observations and it can provide superior positioning performance with a small amount of GNSS single frequency observations and a long RTK baseline.},

Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively cheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward it is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from CVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model which is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space formulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the formulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a linearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation methods used for TSE in the literature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to accuracy and computational tractability with the help of a numerical study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software. The impact of various strategies for querying CV data on the estimation performance is also considered. Several research questions are posed and addressed with a thorough analysis of the results.},

In this paper, in order to minimize the transmit power, we consider the joint active and passive beamforming problem of RIS-assisted vehicle localization system under the constraints of the localization accuracy and the phase shift parameters of the RIS. Specifically, we establish the model of RIS-assisted vehicle localization system and derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as the localization performance metric. Next, for the scenario of single vehicle localization, we derive the optimal RISs’ phases, and obtain the optimal solution for joint active and passive beamforming based on semidefinite programming relaxation of the non-convex beamforming problem and the corresponding equivalent analysis. Lastly, aimming to the scenario of multiple vehicles localization, we transform the nonconvex joint active and passive beamforming problem into semidefinite programming (SDP) and geometric programming (GP) form subproblems through alternating optimization. Simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Driving risk prediction is important for the development of intelligent vehicles (IVs), and the rise of human-like driving requires a driving risk prediction system to match the subjective risk cognitive characteristics of human drivers. In this study, a subjective driving risk prediction model (SDRPM) for IVs is proposed and applied to lane-changing (LC) conditions. We regard the cognitive risk of the human driver as the coupling result of environmental objective risk and driver subjective cognition at the spatial and temporal scales. Then, an objective anisotropic risk field was built to describe risks in traffic environments, and a subjective spatiotemporal cognition field to describe the cognitive characteristics of human drivers. By combining the two fields, the spatiotemporal distribution features of the human driver’s cognitive risk were obtained and used as model inputs, and SDRPM output the predicted subjective driving risk level (SDRL) of the human driver. To quantify the SDRLs, six participants were recruited to watch 1,213 driving videos and report the SDRLs they cognized. Participants were provided with 360-degree driving video around the test vehicle and virtual reality glasses to ensure the reliability of the obtained SDRLs. Verification results showed that SDRPM has good predicted accuracy and long advance predicted time, with 97.53% predicted accuracy, which can reach 95.06% at 2 s before the LC point. Compared with six state-of-the-art models, SDRPM can improve the predicted accuracy while reducing the dimensions of input features. In summary, SDRPM can ensure the driving safety, and improve user acceptance and trust in IVs.},

  abstract     = {Teledriving could serve as a practical solution for handling unforeseen situations in autonomous driving. However, the latency of transmission networks remains a prominent concern. Despite advancements like 5G networks, delays in remote driving scenes cannot be entirely eradicated, potentially leading to unwanted incidents. While a few attempts have been made to address this issue by predicting the future driving scenes, these efforts have been restricted in their ability to accurately foresee clear and relevant driving scenarios. This study presents a method to predict a latency-free future driving scene. Unlike prior approaches, our method incorporates the command signal of a remote driver into the prediction network, as well as the past driving video frames and vehicle status. As a result, we can accurately predict relevant and clear latency-free future driving scenes. A combination of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) was utilized in a deep neural network to predict the future driving scenes based on latency. The dataset was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments, with a maximum vehicle speed of 53 km/h and a driving route length of approximately 1.3 km. The dataset used to train the deep neural network was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments. The proposed method can estimate the future driving scene for up to 0.5 s, surpassing the performance of both baseline video prediction methods and a method that does not utilize the input command of the driver.},

The proposed macroscopic energy equation is derived starting from the road load equation and it is then integrated with the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model. Results are compared against the energy output of microscopic car-following models, namely the Improved Intelligent Driver Model and the Extended Intelligent Driver Model. To enable the comparison between macroscopic and microscopic model variables, kernel density estimation is used. This allows individual vehicle positions, speeds, and energy usage obtained from the ordinary differential equations to be converted to distributed quantities. The proposed macroscopic energy equation is evaluated on three different traffic scenarios: free flow, congested traffic, and mixed traffic. It is shown that the proposed energy model can calculate the energy output within ±4% in free flow traffic, ±11% in congested traffic, and ±8% in mixed traffic.},

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning in advanced driver assistance systems aims to endow models with the capacity to jointly handle multiple related tasks, such as object detection, depth estimation, and more. However, existing multi-task learning models largely rely on the extensive number of labelled data. In practice, the process of annotating data for multi-task training proves to be exceedingly costly, yet not always accurate. This study introduces an innovative setting named online multi-task inference learning that updates the multi-task model during inference. And we propose a Strong-Help-Weak (SHW) framework which aims to enhance weaker (or more challenging) tasks by leveraging guidance from closely related stronger (or easier) tasks. Specifically, we first build two benchmarks based on KITTI and BDD with four tasks (object detection, object depth estimation, lane line segmentation, and driving area segmentation). Then, we propose two novel modules inspired by two priors: 1) Detection-guided Depth Inference Learning (DetDis) module that leverages the inverse relationship between object size and distance to refine the predicted object distance; and 2) Area-guided Lane Line Inference Learning (AreaLane) module that utilises inclusion relationship between driving area and lane line to infer more accurate lane line. Both modules are efficient and can provide more reliable supervision for the corresponding weaker tasks (object distance estimation and lane line segmentation), respectively. Extensive experiments on the two benchmarks show that our SHW can obtain consistent improvements on the weaker tasks during the inference stage with low computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Level-2 (L2) driving automation still has many limitations, and drivers are responsible for L2 automation safety. This study investigates the impact of the criticality of takeover situations caused by longitudinal or lateral control system failures (critical, non-critical), the failure form (silent, alert), and non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) (no task, video tasks) on drivers’ physiological responses, visual behavior, and takeover performance. Sixty-eight participants completed experiments on a motion-based simulator. Results showed that participants were more challenged to recognize faded lane lines than stationary obstacles, resulting in higher accident rates. The failure form had limited effects on participants’ physiological responses and visual behavior, but the takeover request could guide participants to recognize takeover events earlier. Participants engaged in NDRTs were also responsible for monitoring the driving environment for safety. This dual task increased their visual workload and reduced their situation awareness during automation. Additionally, distracted drivers were more difficult to detect takeover events, which worsened takeover performance and increased accident rates. Specifically, 12.5% of distracted participants were in accidents, while 6.6% of those not engaged in NDRT. In addition, this study classified distracted participants into low, medium, and high-risk groups based on their takeover performance and examined the monitoring strategy and maximum eye-off-road time (max EORT). Results suggested that monitoring frequency and max EORT are more suitable for evaluating and classifying driver monitoring behaviors in L2 driving automation. The max EORT for the three groups were 6.2 s, 9.4 s, and 13.2 s, respectively. The findings of the study provide an important reference for engineers to design L2 automation systems and driver monitoring systems to assess distracted driver risk or predict their takeover responses.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive traffic signal control plays a crucial role in enhancing the traffic situation in urban cities. Recently, reinforcement learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in addressing traffic signal control problems. However, the deployment of these methods in real-world environments is limited due to their lack of robustness. When errors occur during traffic data collection, their performance tends to deteriorate significantly. This paper addresses a prevalent issue where certain intersections, referred to as blinded intersections, cannot receive traffic data either due to hardware failures or the absence of traffic detectors. Existing adaptive traffic signal control methods fail to achieve satisfactory results in such scenarios as they are unable to learn effective policies for blinded intersections. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the primary reason behind the poor performance of existing methods as improper reward selection. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel reward function called NOVO, which incorporates Number of Vehicles and Outflow, offering a correct optimization objective with low variance. These advantages significantly enhance the performance of reinforcement learning methods. Additionally, we introduce a new reinforcement learning model called BlindLight, which employs a dual model structure to learn Q-values for different types of intersections independently. This model design enhances the robustness of the system. Experimental results conducted on public datasets demonstrate the consistent performance improvement achieved by the theoretically supported reward function NOVO in existing methods with blinded intersections. Furthermore, BlindLight outperforms all state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods significantly.},

  abstract     = {Detecting driver fatigue is critical to ensuring road safety. Existing fatigue detection methods typically rely on traditional hand-picked features as inputs. However, these hand-picked features can hardly respond accurately to the driver’s fatigue state due to a certain degree of subjectivity and the extraction of these features requires a long time window, which limits the accuracy and real-time performance of the detection. This paper proposes a novel fatigue detection method based on multi-source information fusion, which relies entirely on neural networks for automatic feature extraction. Through simulated driving experiments, we recorded physiological signals and facial videos from 21 participants for model training and testing. The results show that our model outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and real-time performance, achieving a detection accuracy of 93.15% within a 3-second time window (specificity = 94.04%, sensitivity = 91.71%). The visualization results of the model reveal potential relationships between facial regions for the first time, validating the rationality and effectiveness of our method. The practical issues of fatigue detection methods and future research directions are also explored.},

To obtain precise prediction, this work develops an efficient gated-attention spatiotemporal convolutional network (GSTCN) to explore the long-term spatial and temporal dependence of traffic flow. GSTCN is constructed by two main components: a spatial gated attention (SGA) unit and a temporal gated (T-Gated) attention layer. The spatial pattern of traffic flow is unearthed by the well-designed SGA unit, while the temporal correlation between different time steps is captured through the proposed T-Gated attention layer. Then, an energy storage system (ESS) is employed to improve the effective management of charging stations. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of GSTCN in charging station management. GSTCN can produce more accurate prediction data, which leads to a more economical operation of the energy storage system compared with the benchmarks.},

However, as the accuracy of the models improves, they become more complex with a large number of parameters, making it challenging to use them in practical scenarios. Although some lightweight models have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters, maintaining satisfactory performance remains difficult. Therefore, we propose a normalized cyclic loop network (NCLNet) using knowledge distillation (KD), called NCLNet-S*, for rail surface defect detection (RSDD). This model aims to be as lightweight as possible while preserving excellent accuracy. It achieves this by constructing an inter-modal feature cyclic enhancement structure to maximize the use of complementary features between modalities, incorporating a normalized fusion filter module for adaptive weighting of useful knowledge, and transferring knowledge from the teacher network (NCLNet-T) to the student network (NCLNet-S) using our proposed KD framework. Additionally, to enhance the performance and robustness of the NCLNet-S* model, we introduce intermodal cross-layer self-distillation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed NCLNet-S* (NCLNet-S with KD) achieves high accuracy while remaining lightweight compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on the publicly available RGBD-SOD datasets and achieve satisfactory performance, demonstrating the generality of our NCLNet-S*.},

  abstract     = {Platooning connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) provide significant benefits in terms of traffic efficiency and fuel economy. However, most existing platooning systems assume the availability of pre-determined plans, which is not feasible in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue in time-dependent networks by formulating a Markov decision process at each junction, aiming to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. Initially, we analyze coordinated platooning without routing to explore the cooperation among controllers on an identical path. We propose two novel approaches based on approximate dynamic programming, offering suboptimal control in the context of a stochastic finite horizon problem. The results demonstrate the superiority of the approximation in the policy space. Furthermore, we investigate platooning in a network setting, where speed profiles and routes are determined simultaneously. To simplify the problem, we decouple the action space by prioritizing routing decisions based on travel time estimation. We subsequently employ the aforementioned policy approximation to determine speed profiles, considering essential parameters such as travel times. Our simulation results in SUMO indicate that our method yields better performance than conventional approaches, leading to potential travel cost savings of up to 38%. Additionally, we evaluate the resilience of our approach in dynamically changing networks, affirming its ability to maintain efficient platooning operations.},

  abstract     = {Various control strategies and field experiments have been designed for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to stabilize mixed traffic that contains both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). The effect of these stabilizing CAV control strategies on traffic safety is still under investigation. In an effort to prioritize safety over stability, a safety-critical filter via control barrier functions (CBFs) can be designed by modifying the stabilizing nominal control input in a minimal fashion and imparting collision-free driving behaviors for CAVs and HVs. However, such formal safety guarantees can be violated if there are delays in the actuation and communication channels of the CAV. Considering both actuator and sensor delays, and disturbances, we propose a robust safety-critical traffic control (RSTC) design to ensure the “robust safety” of the mixed traffic. While predictor-based CBF has been developed to compensate for the actuator delay, uncertain speed disturbances from the head vehicle cause prediction error and require novel robust CBF design. Besides, safety-critical control with sensor delay also remains an open question. In RSTC, a state predictor with bounded error is designed, and robust CBF constraints are constructed to guarantee safety under actuator delay and disturbances. When there is a sensor delay, a state observer is designed and integrated with a predictor-based CBF to ensure robust safety. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed RSTC avoids rear-end collisions in two unsafe scenarios in the presence of actuator, sensor delays, and disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale real-time crash prediction is critical to traffic operation and management, but very challenging, even for machine learning models because the observation data are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) due to its spatial heterogeneity. Data discontinuity, computational inefficiency, and higher false alarm rates are some other challenges in real-world and real-time crash prediction. To address these issues, we propose a generic framework, which blends spatial ensemble learning and knowledge distillation. Spatial ensemble learning leverages individual segment-level modeling to alleviate the non-IID issue for more accurate crash prediction, while knowledge distillation reduces the model size and improves false alarm rate. We justify the effectiveness of the proposed method using real-world and real-time scenario and comparing the results with the up-to-date benchmark models. Our method successfully improves sensitivity and false alarm rate to 90.35% and 24.21%. With this more accurate prediction model, we analyze the prediction variability across this region. We found that: 1) across segments, false alarm rate exhibits more heterogenous pattern than sensitivity; 2) rear-end crashes are more accurately predicted compared to sideswipe/angle crashes; 3) urban segments show better prediction performance compared to rural segments. 4) developing models with desired accuracy requires special attention in higher traffic fluctuation segments. These observations are very useful to develop more accurate prediction model and traffic safety decision making. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the pioneering studies to integrate spatial ensemble learning and knowledge distillation to predict large-scale real-time crashes and apply it to analyze crash prediction variability.},

  abstract     = {The use of fifth-generation (5G) communication technology by high-speed trains (HSTs) has a lot of potential to satisfy current needs for high data rates. Therefore, accurate modeling of the HST wireless channels is crucial for the design and performance assessment of the 5G systems. This paper proposes a general three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary small-scale fading model for 5G HST millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which captures the wireless channel characteristics in different HST operating scenarios. The proposed channel model has two characteristics. Firstly, it incorporates the distribution of overhead line poles along the railway to characterize the periodic scattering components from the poles. Secondly, it represents complex HST operating scenarios as combinations of five types of scattering clusters, namely hills, trees, lakes, buildings, and concrete. Furthermore, the impact of environmental complexity (EC) on channel statistical properties in the 5G HST massive MIMO scenarios is investigated. Afterwards, based on the birth-death process of scattering clusters, the proposed channel model can characterize the channel non-stationarity in the space-time-frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the channel non-stationarity, the scattering characteristics of overhead line poles, and the impact of different ECs on system performance. The accuracy and practicality of the proposed model are validated through a comparison with measurement results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies synchronized optimization control for the cooperatively connected autonomous vehicle platoon formulation applicable in various driving scenarios and accommodates multiple vehicles dynamically entering or exiting the platoon. More specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of bi-layered synchronized optimization that enables the ultimate optimized control to attain the synchronized convergence property, and also importantly, ensures the satisfaction of safety performance requirements. The first layer of the proposed approach involves formulating the platoon dynamics and ensuring that the platoon operates within safe boundaries while optimizing its overall performance. To achieve this, the prescribed performance control is utilized to ensure that the state-variables remain within a predefined region throughout the synchronized optimization process. In the second layer, the control optimization takes into account the vehicle dynamics and actuators of either heterogeneous or homogeneous individual vehicles, improving performance and coordination within the platoon. In each optimization layer, the optimized backstepping is utilized, and the norm-normalized sign function is appropriately incorporated with the decomposition design to establish the learning framework with the outcome that attains the synchronized properties simultaneously. The adaptive dynamic programming and gradient-constrained method are utilized in the learning design to iteratively optimize system control while keeping the learning parts within the admissible policy region. Importantly, it is rigorously shown that this particular development and methodology attains the noteworthy time-synchronized stability property and outcome that all vehicle agents arrive at the desired relative position at the same time with synchronized convergence. Additionally, it is also shown that the methodology of our specific algorithmic strategy significantly also attains the desired outcomes of “string stability” (jointly with the above-mentioned desired outcomes of “time-synchronized stability”). To evaluate its effectiveness, comparative studies with different methods are carried out to showcase the significantly better desired outcomes attained with this methodology of synchronized optimization. Further evaluations in scenarios involving dynamic entry and exit of multiple vehicles demonstrate the corresponding capability and effectiveness in achieving the desired objectives.},

  abstract     = {Light detection and ranging sensors (LiDARs) have become indispensable for autonomous vehicles because of their high detection accuracy and independence from lighting conditions. At present, although LiDARs with various beams have been developed, their performance is degraded to varying degrees in severe weather such as rain and snowfall. This restricts the reliable operation of autonomous vehicles in all weather and all scenes. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of snow on LiDAR performance, this paper creates and publishes a LiDAR point cloud dataset (MSP dataset) covering different LiDAR models, snowfall intensities, and test scenarios. Through theoretical and data-driven analysis, the influence of snow on the performance parameters of LiDAR, such as point cloud distribution, detection range, and sensing accuracy, is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show that the presence of snow induces a significant amount of noise in LiDAR systems. The level of noise varies with distance and height, following the Gamma and t location-scale distributions, respectively. During heavy snowfall, the recognition of vehicles and pedestrians by LiDARs is reduced by 50% and 20%, respectively. The target detection accuracy is reduced by about 9 percentage points, and the effective detection distance is reduced by 14-17m. The sensing performance of LiDAR will be significantly reduced within the range affected by snowflake noise. The research results of this paper provide important data and a theoretical basis for evaluating the performance of LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems during snowfall conditions and designing corresponding LiDAR sensing and processing methods.},

  abstract     = {The development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) has attracted much attention due to the increasing number of connected cars. IoV refers to the interconnection of vehicles with other devices through the internet to enable information sharing and interaction. The advent of 5G mobile communication technologies has provided high-speed, low-latency, and high-reliability communication services, which have gone a long way in solving the communication problems associated with IoV. Additionally, the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) technology has placed computing resources on edge nodes closer to the users, thus enabling faster, more reliable, and more secure computing services to meet the vehicles’ computing resource requirements. However, task offloading and resource allocation issues of 5G-connected vehicles enabled by Mobile edge computing remain a significant challenge when it comes to computing tasks and data related to IoVs. Our study proposes a Lyapunov Based Profit Maximum (LBPM) task offloading algorithm, which utilizes the Lyapunov optimization theory to maximize the time-averaged profit as the optimization objective. The algorithm uses the drift plus penalty optimization framework to establish the Lyapunov function and transforms the optimization goal into making a reasonable offloading decision at each time slot to optimize the upper bound of the function. We also compare the LBPM algorithm with existing algorithms for simulation experiments and performance analysis. The experimental results indicate that the LBPM algorithm increases the time-averaged profit by over 15%.},

  abstract     = {Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) enable Intelligent Vehicles to capture the in-cabin scene and help determine the driver’s level of attention and ability to take over. The task of driver gaze classification is the most important proxy for determining driver attention for DMS. In recent years, different approaches for driver gaze classification have been proposed. However, results and comparisons are barely valid. Different metrics are presented and datasets are kept private and are often collected under constraints that do not reflect realistic driving behavior. This work aims to provide an in-depth discussion and comparison of existing methods for driver gaze classification based on a dataset that is elaborately collected and constitutes realistic driving from real customers under no supervision. In particular, we evaluate the approaches with means of a nested leave-one-driver-out cross-validation on 20 different drivers. Moreover, we analyze the impact of the number of drivers in the training dataset on the generalization ability for unseen drivers and introduce a new error-based metric that allows us to assess how well a model is trained. Observations are that for end-to-end approaches, misclassifications between regions far apart occur more often and for all drivers, whereas the feature-engineered approach appears better qualified to build gaze estimators with limited data.},

  abstract     = {The performance of license plate detection has greatly improved with the development of deep learning. However, two challenges remain. First, in unconstrained scenarios, such as rotation and uneven lighting, license plate detection still faces significant challenges. Secondly, traditional horizontal bounding boxes are not suitable for representing multi-oriented license plates. And quadrilateral boxes can effectively represent them though, they cannot avoid the confusion caused by sequential label points. To address these challenges, we propose a license plate detection method called SvRetina-LPD. Specifically, we design an inception residual fusion pyramid network, which fuses multiple layers of features thoroughly. Then, by integrating spatial attention and channel attention, the inception residual multi-dimensional attention network is developed to weaken the noise and highlight the features of the license plate. Finally, we introduce a sliding vertex head network that incorporates a sliding vertex branch and regresses four length ratios to represent the relative sliding offsets of the corner points of the quadrilateral to the corresponding sides of the bounding rectangle. This method can accurately detect multi-directional license plate regions and effectively avoids the sequential label points. Extensive experimental tests were conducted on datasets such as CCPD, AOLP, and CLPD. On the CCPD test set, SvRetina-LPD demonstrated a high accuracy of 97.9%, surpassing existing methods. In addition, SvRetina-LPD also demonstrated excellent detection accuracy in other subsets of CCPD, including various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect multi-directional license plates in unconstrained scenarios.},

As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although recent efforts have been made to understand the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of these attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles: direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive analytical conditions that characterize the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering constant or random attacks. The conditions derived provide an effective method for synthesizing strategic candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the attack mechanism, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems. The methodology developed allows for further study of the widespread impact of strategically designed attacks on traffic cybersecurity, inspiring the development of efficient attack detection techniques and advanced vehicle controls.},

Spatial and temporal attention mechanisms are employed to extract the spatial-temporal interaction features of the vehicle.

  abstract     = {The exploitation of radio channels’ inherent randomness for generating secret keys within a vehicular platoon offers a promising approach to securing communications in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The channel-based key generation leverages the fact that the physical characteristics of the radio channel, such as fading, shadowing, and multipath propagation, vary in a complex manner that makes it difficult for external adversaries to predict or replicate. A challenge lies in accurately assessing the channel’s randomness to ensure the generated keys are both secure and consistent across the platooning vehicles, especially in vehicular environments with high mobility and the ever-changing urban landscape. This paper proposes a novel channel-based key generation (DRL-KeyAgree) technique to enhance communication security within vehicular platoons through combinatorial deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL-KeyAgree addresses key disagreement among platooning vehicles by training advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), which integrates policy- and value-based strategies to dynamically select optimal quantization intervals adapting to the random wireless channels. Further incorporation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) allows DRL-KeyAgree to capture the characteristics of partially observable radio channels, significantly enhancing the key agreement rate among vehicles. DRL-KeyAgree is rigorously evaluated using the standard National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we devise three day-to-day (DTD) road pricing schemes from their static counterparts to achieve several traffic management objectives such as regulating the traffic dynamics to the desired equilibrium, traffic restraint control, and balancing the fairness and efficiency of traffic networks, respectively. Qualitative analyses involved in the stability and convergence analysis as well as the DTD evolution of network performance admit challenges ranging from partial state stability, multiple equilibria, non-measurable system states to complex nonlinear network performance functionals. To handle these hurdles, we establish a unified stability analysis framework for qualitative analysis and control synthesis of continuous-time DTD traffic dynamics via the notion of output stability. Under this framework, by devising a proper measurable output function for the DTD dynamics in question, we can perform the relevant qualitative analyses for several continuous-time DTD traffic dynamics under different traffic control measures. For example, we investigate the DTD evolution of network performance indexes such as unfairness and inefficiency (e.g., price of anarchy (PoA)) to show how the proposed flow-dependent link toll scheme can balance the fairness and efficiency of traffic systems. We demonstrate that the proposed output stability framework can offer much more flexibility to perform qualitative analysis for these complex processes by devising suitable output functions. Finally, we show the merits of the road pricing schemes in conjunction with the output stability via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is challenging due to the intricate spatio-temporal correlations in traffic patterns. Previous works captured spatial dependencies based on graph neural networks and used fixed graph construction methods to characterize spatial relationships, which limits the ability of models to capture dynamic and long-range spatial dependencies. Meanwhile, prior studies did not consider the issue of a large number of redundant parameters in traffic prediction models, which not only increases the storage cost of the model but also reduces its generalization ability. To address the above challenges, we propose a Dynamic Spatial Transformer for Traffic Forecasting with Low-Rank Tensor Compression (DSFormer-LRTC). Specifically, we constructed a global spatial Transformer to capture remote spatial dependencies, and a distance-based mask matrix is used in local spatial Transformer to enhance the adjacent spatial influence. To reduce the complexity of the model, the model adopts a design that separates temporal and spatial. Meanwhile, we introduce low-rank tensor decomposition to reconstruct the parameter matrix in Transformer module to compress the proposed model. Experimental results show that DSFormer-LRTC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four real-world datasets. The experimental analysis of attention matrix also proves that the model can learn dynamic and distant spatial features. Finally, the compressed model parameters reduce the original parameter size by two-thirds, while significantly outperforming the baseline model in terms of computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention due to simplicity and low cost. However, object location recovery in the 3D space from a monocular image is challenging since the depth information is lost. How to estimate the instance depth is the core problem to be solved. Intuitively, the ground depth is continuous and global in essence, independent of the objects in the scene. Therefore the ground depth estimation can be more accurate and easier than the object depth estimation. Inspired by this, we propose to map a set of surface points of an object onto the ground plane and decompose the object depth solving problem into the ground depth estimation and surface point heights estimation. During the training stage, dense ground depth labels are provided by the ground truth (GT) surface depths of objects from LiDAR data. In the inference stage, surface depths are recovered through querying the ground depth map. As a result, a set of instance depth candidates are obtained and the final instance depth can be assembled according to their uncertainties. In addition, since most of the mapped ground points are occluded by the object which may mislead the network learning, we devise a depth expansion strategy to extend the ground depth labels. The proposed method MonoSGC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the KITTI and Waymo datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components.

  abstract     = {Data from different modalities, such as infrared and visible images, can offer complementary information, and integrating such information can significantly enhance the capabilities of a system to perceive and recognize its surroundings. Thus, multi-modal object detection has widespread applications, particularly in challenging weather conditions like low-light scenarios. The core of multi-modal fusion lies in developing a reasonable fusion strategy, which can fully exploit the complementary features of different modalities while preventing a significant increase in model complexity. To this end, this paper proposes a novel lightweight cross-fusion module named Channel-Patch Cross Fusion (CPCF), which leverages Channel-wise Cross-Attention (CCA), Patch-wise Cross-Attention (PCA) and Adaptive Gating (AG) to encourage mutual rectification among different modalities. This process simultaneously explores commonalities across modalities while maintaining the uniqueness of each modality. Furthermore, we design a versatile intermediate fusion framework that can leverage CPCF to enhance the performance of multi-modal object detection. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on multiple public multi-modal datasets, namely FLIR, LLVIP, and DroneVehicle. The experiments indicate that our method yields consistent performance gains across various benchmarks and can be extended to different types of detectors, further demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

In most existing work, UGVs are responsible for detection but not handling emergencies like extinguishing fires, capturing intruders, or managing pollution. Hence, existing methods fail to perform both persistent surveillance and emergency handling. This work copes with both and proposes a cooperative dual-task path planning method for multiple UGVs. UGVs first treat all the viewpoints as candidates and compute their rewards to select their targets. Emergencies have a higher reward, allowing UGVs to solve dual tasks and prioritize emergencies. A heuristic protocol is then employed to choose appropriate UGVs for emergencies. Local path planning is finally considered when UGVs plan paths to targets to avoid deadlock and backtracking. Thus, a necessary and appropriate subswarm of UGVs with the nearest distance to emergencies are selected to handle them, while others continue surveilling viewpoints for potential emergencies, avoiding any long delayed handling of emergencies. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in three road networks. The simulation and analysis results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art surveillance methods.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in recent times has opened up new possibilities for effective and secure transportation. However, with the increasing adoption of AVs, guaranteeing the accuracy and security of their sensory systems is becoming paramount. Specifically, the vulnerability of these systems to malware and sensor faults can pose significant risks to the dependable and secure operation of the vehicle. To identify and combat these issues we propose a stream-based Blockchain-powered Malicious Node Detection (BMND) method to analyze and report any malicious activity of the AV operating as a node on the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV) network, wherein the existing solutions are at lower latency. BMND involves the detection of sensor anomalies and defects post-production of the AV. In the case that malware or any other malicious software is detected on the onboard compute unit it is isolated and contained, and the AV will be classified as malicious until appropriate remedial measures are taken to deter any sharing of erroneous or malicious data. When the AV is deemed safe from malware and defects in the system then a block is mined by the AV node and a unique ID is assigned to allow data transfers on the blockchain with other nodes. Only active nodes with assigned IDs and available blocks for transactions on the blockchain influence AV decision-making. BMND would allow modern AVs on the road to effectively communicate with reliable information. Experimental analysis shows that the malware detection in BMND is 4.4% more accurate with an F1-score of ~0.99 as compared to previous and other current state-of-the-art methods, and the communication capabilities of BMND are also better regarding security and latency concerning proposed vanilla blockchain methods.},

  abstract     = {Among the various driving situations, there are challenging road conditions where both the texture and curvature are variables over time (e.g., mountainous area). However, it is found that the characteristics of road texture and curvature have been respectively considered in some of the existing studies to determine the vehicle speed for trajectory planning, but the complementary effect of these two factors is still yet to be incorporated. This could lead to unsafe vehicle behaviour. This limitation has led us to develop a trajectory planning method that gives a systematic consideration of road conditions and leverages the complementary effect of road curvature and adhesion on the vehicle speed. It prioritises the trajectory safety through a preview of road constraints (i.e., waypoints, curvature and adhesion) in a look-ahead distance and the real-time computation of the vehicle speed that satisfies the constraints. In the experiment, our method was compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in a simulated mountainous driving environment, namely Model Predictive Control (MPC), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Hybrid A*. The environment was built with abundant variation in road curvature and adhesion. The results showed that our approach was able to generate safe and comfort trajectories in both sharp turn and ice-covered driving scenarios, in which the vehicle successfully passed through the whole length of the global path without producing large deviations and exceeding lane boundaries. Whereas, the MPC, DRL and Hybrid A* approaches resulted in the vehicle exceeding lanes at some point with completeness levels of 77.72%, 75.31% and 79.53%, respectively.},

The classical LWR model, while useful, falls short of accurately representing real-world traffic flows due to the assumption that traffic speed is solely dependent upon local traffic density. The nonlocal LWR model addresses this limitation by considering the speed as a weighted mean of the downstream traffic densities. In this paper, we propose a novel PIDL framework that incorporates the nonlocal LWR model paired with Greenshields and Underwood fundamental diagrams. We introduce both fixed-length and variable-length look-ahead kernels for nonlocal speed-density relationships and develop the required mathematics. The proposed PIDL framework undergoes a comprehensive evaluation, assessing various convolutional kernels and look-ahead windows using NGSIM and CitySim datasets. The results demonstrate improvements over the baseline PIDL approach using the local LWR model. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of traffic state estimation, enabling more effective traffic management strategies.},

This study proposes a heuristic-based MDRL algorithm (H-QMIX) developed based on a value-based MDRL algorithm, QMIX. This algorithm incorporates a heuristic-based action mask module to guide CAVs efficiently and safely through intersections, composed of a stimulative passing sequence and safety restrictions on CAVs’ action space in the junction area. Compared with other MDRL algorithms (e.g., IPPO, QMIX), the H-QMIX algorithm demonstrates improved training performance in terms of safety and efficiency in two case studies, where the first requires all CAVs to affix their routes, and another allows CAVs to choose random routes. Concerning the model’s generalization ability, the trained models with the maximal episodic return are then transferred to a more practical scenario with a certain vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delay in a zero-shot manner. The simulation results illustrate that H-QMIX is robust to a certain communication delay. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/flammingRaven/heuristic_based_qmix .},

It also stresses cognitive-level ‘prominent hazards’ that impact driving safety and deserve priority attentions and provident strategies, beyond visual saliencies or collision-related risks. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art models on 22 metrics on two datasets revealed that our system exhibited the overall smallest deviation from ground truths, justifying the effectiveness of our proposed cognition imitation in understanding driving scenarios. Our better results than baseline annotations further verified the capability in assisting situation awareness.

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating spatiotemporal traffic states on freeways is a significant challenge due to limited sensor deployment and potential data corruption. In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using low-penetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {The learning from intervention (LfI) approach has been proven effective in improving the performance of RL algorithms; nevertheless, existing methodologies in this domain tend to operate under the assumption that human guidance is invariably devoid of risk, thereby possibly leading to oscillations or even divergence in RL training as a result of improper demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a safety-aware human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (SafeHIL-RL) approach to bridge the abovementioned gap. We first present a safety assessment module based on the artificial potential field (APF) model that incorporates dynamic information of the environment under the Frenet coordinate system, which we call the Frenet-based dynamic potential field (FDPF), for evaluating the real-time safety throughout the intervention process. Subsequently, we propose a curriculum guidance mechanism inspired by the pedagogical principle of whole-to-part patterns in human education. The curriculum guidance facilitates the RL agent’s early acquisition of comprehensive global information through continual guidance while also allowing for fine-tuning local behavior through intermittent human guidance through a human-AI shared control strategy. Consequently, our approach enables a safe, robust, and efficient reinforcement learning process independent of the quality of guidance human participants provide. The proposed method is validated in two highway autonomous driving scenarios under highly dynamic traffic flows ( https://github.com/OscarHuangWind/Safe-Human-in-the-Loop-RL ). The experiments’ results confirm the superiority and generalization capability of our approach when compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, as well as the effectiveness of the curriculum guidance.},

Finally, simulation validation was conducted on a multi-particle model with a large number of perturbations for both methods.

  abstract     = {Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis. Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we presents a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.},

  abstract     = {As automobiles continue to develop in the direction of intelligence and networking, the requirements for in-vehicle network bandwidth and deterministic time delay continue to increase. However, existing in-vehicle network standard protocols such as Controller Area Network (CAN) cannot meet the increasing bandwidth needs of in-vehicle networks, and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) has emerged a research hot-spot for next-generation in-vehicle network standards. The next-generation in-vehicle network is developing towards a domain network architecture with TSN as the backbone and other conventional buses as branches. In this architecture, the TSN-CAN gateway is an important component that handles the data communication between the TSN domain and CAN. Due to the large difference in transmission rates between TSN and CAN, the TSN-CAN heterogeneous gateway suffers from congestion resulting in unguaranteed real-time transmission of messages across the gateway. To address this issue, a high response ratio priority scheduling algorithm (HRRP) for TSN-CAN gateways based on worst-case response time analysis theory is proposed in this paper. The algorithm assigns forwarding priority to CAN messages based on the value of their response ratio, and the experimental demonstrate show that the method can significantly improve the schedulability and reduce latency, improving the real-time performance of the system.},

  abstract     = {The reliability and robustness of 3D object detection play an instrumental role in the practical deployment of autonomous driving systems. Despite previous research indicating that adversarial examples can negatively affect 3D object detection models, leading to misinterpretations of the environment, these models still maintain the capability to detect the majority of objects within adversarially manipulated point clouds. To further probe into the adversarial robustness of these models, we propose an effective adversarial attack method named IoU-S attack in this paper. We meticulously formulate the adversarial loss to adversely affect the decision-making behavior (such as localization, etc.) of 3D object detection, thereby compromising its ability to accurately interpret the environment. Owing to the significant relevance of this adversarial loss to 3D object detection tasks, we have integrated the IoU-S attack into three attack paradigms: point cloud perturbation, detachment, and attachment. Comprehensive experiments on the widely accepted nuScenes dataset illustrate that the IoU-S attack outperforms existing attack methods in both white-box and black-box scenarios ( https://github.com/haichen-ber/IoU-S-Attack ). It reinforces its potential to serve as a valuable method in understanding and enhancing the robustness of 3D object detection models against adversarial attacks.},

The disturbance observer is theoretically integrated into CFC framework to address critical practical issues, including parameter uncertainty, suspension nonlinearity and aerodynamic disturbance. The complex uncertainty decomposition and uncertainty bound function design can be avoided in the control design compared with past adaptive CFC. Lyapunov stability theory is applied to prove the uniform ultimate boundedness of proposed robust CFC, enabling the constraint-following error to converge to a very small range. The simulation results demonstrate that the active suspension system could exactly follow the servo constraints of reference BIS with high constraint-following accuracy regardless of parameter uncertainty and external disturbance. And the active suspension system can effectively suppress the vibration and improve the ride comfort steadily with random structure parameters and strong aerodynamic loads.

However, these control methods adopt a single-system approach for the entire train, referred to as the typical method in this paper. Yet, a malfunction in one car can impact the control laws and controller design of other cars. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a large-scale system control, which decouples the control laws and controller design for each car. The control law of an individual car is based solely on its own position and velocity, with separate processes for solving the controllers for each car. Additionally, the speed cruise control for high-speed trains considers both ${\mathcal {H}}_{2}$ and ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty } $ performance in the presence of uncertain parameters. This study validates the feasibility of such decoupled methods in this domain through simulation-based comparative analysis. This study aims to verify the effectiveness of large-scale system control methods in normal train operations and to lay the foundation for more complex fault-tolerant and model-switching challenges. In these areas, large-scale system control has greater potential for application and offers significant advantages.},

  abstract     = {Crack detection has attracted extensive attention in an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Despite the substantial progress of deep learning technology on crack recognition tasks, due to the various limitations in traffic, equipment, and time, it is hard to collect copious samples for training deep models. Considering this, implicitly semantic data augmentation (ISDA) tries to augment the training set in the feature space. However, when applying it to crack recognition tasks, our empirical studies reveal that those poor-classified augmented samples have little semantic relevance to the crack class, resulting in a non-negligible negative effect on training deep models. Since the augmented features follow the multivariate normal distribution, it is computationally inefficient to explicitly sample those features and filter out the hard-classified augmented features. To this end, we propose the implicit gradient-modulated semantic data augmentation (IGMSDA) for addressing the above problems. Concretely, this paper first proposes gradient-modulated (GM) loss to dynamically modulate the gradient of those poor-classified augmented samples by reshaping the standard cross-entropy loss. And then, in the feature space, we derive an upper bound of the expected GM loss on the augmented training set to avoid the costly explicit sampling process. Experiments show that IGMSDA improves the generalization performance of the existing deep models on crack recognition datasets.},

In the modelling part, CPS has two components, cyber component and physical component, so the system may be subject to (possibly fast) time-varying cyber interference and (possibly fast) time-varying physical uncertainty. A dynamic model encompassing these two phases of the CPS is established. In the control part, a novel control design is proposed based on the dynamic model. The problem of constraint-following for CPS operating under cyber interference and physical uncertainty is considered. In the design part, the choice of control parameters is investigated. This procedure consists of two stages. The first stage is to design a control scheme based on feasible control design parameters, so that it can guarantee the performance in the case of both cyber interference and physical uncertainty. The second stage is to seek the optimal design among the feasible control design parameters, which is resolved by an intelligent multi-agent game-theoretic approach. We invoke both Nash game and Stackelberg strategy to choose the optimal parameters. Interestingly, the optimal parameters obtained from different game settings are the same. This shows the conception of optimality we established spans in a broader context. The robustness and superiority of the system performance are demonstrated in the intelligent transportation system.},

When sensors fail (or even deviate from their presumed characterization), such algorithms also fail or degrade. In this work, we propose to characterize the “health” of individual sensors using a probabilistic health monitor (previously proposed for general cyber-physical systems), as well as the health of the collection of sensors providing observations, and use this characterization to appropriately weight the different sensors when performing sensor fusion. The resultant “Sensor-Health-Aware Resilient Fusion” (SHARF) provides unbiased, consistent, and optimal state estimates. SHARF is applied to the “Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy” (IEA) problem, where sensors mounted on the road-side are used to localize the vehicles on the road. The localization is performed using SHARF on the edge. The proposed SHARF is implemented and evaluated in field experiments with cameras and a RADAR on the infrastructure and with two vehicles on the road driving in real-world scenarios. We demonstrate that SHARF can detect faulty sensory data and incorporate the health status of sensors leading to successful tracking of the target vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Due to the universal existence of human subgroups in reality, an increasing number of studies have incorporated them into the modeling process of crowd evacuation. However, such models seldom explain subgroup behaviors from the aspect of what individuals see and how they respond to visual input. Here, we propose a vision-driven model based on cognitive heuristics, in which the mechanisms of avoidance with the environment and attraction to other members within the field of view are explicitly clarified. Numerical simulations demonstrate that various spatial characteristics of subgroup members can be effectively represented by this model, and both the intensity and heterogeneity of spatial cohesion have significant impacts on subgroup evacuation. By comparing with an empirical study, the reproducibility of our model has been validated in terms of the temporal and spatial dimensions. This model produces more natural and realistic subgroup behaviors in multiple interaction contexts than existing models, and also quantitatively exhibits the superiority in reproduction effects. Overall, this work provides an interpretable mathematical framework for modeling subgroups from the perspective of visual perception.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for powerful visual image analysis are gaining popularity in artificial intelligence. The main difference in CNNs compared to other artificial neural networks is that many convolutional layers are added, which improve the performance of visual image analysis by extracting the feature maps required for image classification. However, algorithm optimization is required to run applications that require low-latency in edge compute modules with limited processing resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm optimization method for fast CNNs by using continuous differential images. The main idea is to reduce computation variably by using the differential value of the input in each convolutional layer. Also, the proposed method is compatible with all types of CNNs, and the performance is better when the pixel value difference of continuous images is low. We use the DarkNet framework to evaluate our algorithm using fast convolution and half convolution approaches on a clustered system. As a result, when the input frame rate is 10 fps, FLOPs are reduced by about 4.92 times compared to the original YOLOv7-tiny. By reducing the FLOPs of the convolutional layer, the inference speed increases to about 4.86 FPS, performing 1.57 times faster than the original YOLOv7-tiny. In the case of parallel processing that used two edge compute modules for using half convolution approach, FLOPs reduced more, and the response speed improved. In addition, faster Object detection implementation is possible by additionally expanding up to 7 compute modules in a scalable clustered embedded system as much as the user wants.},

  abstract     = {It is important to achieve the real-time and reliable vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for the safety and efficiency of the autonomous intersection management (AIM) system. However, there are challenges in establishing the low-delay and robustness VANETs topology in a horizon due to the high mobility, intersection shelters and malicious attacks. This paper investigates the long-horizon VANETs networking problem with the objective of producing the robust topology in the process of routing paths planning. To achieve this goal, a centralized periodic intervention networking (CPIN) approach is proposed, which consists of three main modules: long-horizon information mapping, full-path routing modeling and proactive optimization mechanism. The first module aims to provide a spatio-temporal delay tensor, considering the mobility and the quality of service (QoS). The second module converts routing path planning into a combinatorial optimization problem to achieve long-horizon full-path routing. The third module introduces a proactive optimization mechanism based on node degree centrality to evolve the VANETs networking process toward high robustness. To find the optimal solution efficiently, we propose an improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm based on the operational characteristics of the AIM system. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of CPIN. The results show that the CPIN outperforms the benchmark method in terms of time delay, wireless hops, and network robustness. Specifically, the CPIN reduces the average time delay by at most 44.4%-48.3% while ensuring relative high robustness.},

The environmental conditions that ADS face are highly complex and may result in the disruption of autonomous vehicles. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages causal inference theory to analyze the impact of causal factors on automated driving visual modules. Our method uncovers the root key factors that affect visual perception performance. We further establish a Challenging Index to quantitatively characterize the causal effects of the key factors on perception failures. This quantitative index is subsequently utilized to generate risky scenarios. Through extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art automated driving visual algorithms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the challenge index in evaluating the level of hazard in the deployment environment. Additionally, the proposed “challenge index guided search” method improves test efficiency by up to 8.95 times compared to the baselines while maintaining a balance between coverage diversity and the hazardous level of test scenarios. Our research offers a new perspective for analyzing and evaluating the impact of key factors on visual perception. This contributes to the reduction of test space and efficiency of the generation of high-value test scenarios, ultimately advancing the deployment of safer automated vehicles.},

However, the extensive information-sharing framework inherent in CAVs amplifies the risk associated with sensor anomalies, posing challenges to the reliability and security of the system. Responding to this timely research challenge, this study proposes a novel anomaly detection method, namely Dual-channel Self-attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (DSA-CNN) for multivariate time series data. Through the introduction of the Dual-channel Self-attention Mechanism, DSA-CNN can progressively and autonomously extract spatiotemporal features from multivariate time series data. The proposed method was tested under a variety of common threatening sensor anomaly patterns of CAVs summarised in the literature, and evaluated under multiple different performance metrics. The results demonstrate its advantages in detecting minor anomalies and enhancing sensitivity, outperforming previously reported methods in the literature. Across all experimental scenarios, an average sensitivity improvement of 2.53% was observed, complemented by an average F1 score increase of 1.47%. In CAV settings, maintaining high sensitivity to ensure fewer undetected anomalies, alongside the ability to detect small anomalies, can be more important for the robustness and safety measures of CAV systems.},

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in achieving MTSC. However, existing MARL-based MTSC algorithms have primarily focused on capturing the spatial relationship between multi-intersection traffic signals but have overlooking the importance of the temporally stable traffic pattern. This pattern refers to the fixed positions and relatively stable traffic flow between intersections over short periods in real-world MTSC scenarios, which indicates that the learned spatial relationships between traffic signals should co-evolve over time. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called Coevo lutionary M ulti- A gent R einforcement L earning (CoevoMARL). CoevoMARL employs a graph neural network to capture the complex spatial interaction network among traffic signals. Furthermore, we propose a relationship-driven progressive LSTM (RDP-LSTM) that dynamically evolves the learned spatial interaction network over time by leveraging insights from the temporally stable traffic pattern. To accelerate convergence, we also propose the mutual information reward optimization (MIRO) technique, which strengthens the correlation between policy learning and high-performance samples by using a mutual information-based intrinsic reward. Experimental results on both synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoevoMARL over existing MTSC algorithms, providing valuable insights into incorporating the temporally stable traffic pattern.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation plays a critical role in autonomous driving by providing vehicles with a detailed and accurate understanding of their surroundings. Transformers have recently shown encouraging results in image segmentation. However, transformer-based models are challenging to strike a better balance between performance and efficiency. The computational complexity of the transformer-based models is quadratic with the number of inputs, which severely hinders their application in dense prediction tasks. In this paper, we present the semantic-aware dimension-pooling transformer (SDPT) to mitigate the conflict between accuracy and efficiency. The proposed model comprises an efficient transformer encoder for generating hierarchical features and a semantic-balanced decoder for predicting semantic masks. In the encoder, a dimension-pooling mechanism is used in the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to reduce the computational cost, and a parallel depth-wise convolution is used to capture local semantics. Simultaneously, we further apply this dimension-pooling attention (DPA) to the decoder as a refinement module to integrate multi-level features. With such a simple yet powerful encoder-decoder framework, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed SDPT achieves excellent performance and efficiency on various popular benchmarks, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO-Stuff. For example, our SDPT achieves 48.6% mIOU on the ADE20K dataset, which outperforms the current methods with fewer computational costs.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel LiDAR-Camera Alignment (LCA) method using homogeneous local-global spatial aware representation is proposed. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., LCCNet), our proposition holds 2 main superiorities. First, homogeneous multi-modality representation learned with a uniform CNN model is applied along the iterative prediction stages, instead of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous counterparts extracted from the separated modality-wise CNN models within each stage. In this way, the model size can be significantly decreased (e.g., 12.39M (ours) vs. 333.75M (LCCNet)). Meanwhile, within our proposition the interaction between LiDAR and camera data is built during feature learning to better exploit the descriptive clues, which has not been well concerned by the existing approaches. Secondly, we propose to equip the learned LCA representation with local-global spatial aware capacity via encoding CNN’s local convolutional features with Transformer’s non-local self-attention manner. Accordingly, the local fine details and global spatial context can be jointly captured by the encoded local features. And, they will be jointly used for LCA. On the other hand, the existing methods generally choose to reveal the global spatial property via intuitively concatenating the local features. Additionally at the initial LCA stage, LiDAR is roughly aligned with camera by our pre-alignment method, according to the point distribution characteristics of its 2D projection version with the initial extrinsic parameters. Although its structure is simple, it can essentially alleviate LCA’s difficulty for the consequent stages. To better optimize LCA, a novel loss function that builds the correlation between translation and rotation loss items is also proposed. The experiments on KITTI data verifies the superiority of our proposition both on effectiveness and efficiency. The source code will be released at https://github.com/Zaf233/Light-weight-LCA upon acceptance.},

The problems arising from unknown/time-varying control directions are tackled through the period sliding mode technique. Unlike most previous unknown control direction-related studies, the control coefficient is allowed to cross 0 in a continuous way. In addition, to improve the payload swing suppression and elimination performance, nonlinear terms involving payload swing information are elaborately injected into the control design. As far as we know, the designed periodic sliding mode control scheme provides the first control method for crane systems to successfully guarantee positioning as well as anti-swing performance in spite of unmatched disturbances and unknown control directions.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an approach to distributed multi-object tracking for connected vehicles, aiming to overcome the inherent challenges of label inconsistency and double counting prevalent in distributed information fusion methods, particularly in the context of situational awareness for connected vehicles. Our proposed method expands the label space by incorporating sensor identity into the object’s label. Furthermore, we present an intuitive merging algorithm designed to effectively eliminate instances of double counting. The approach is formulated, and an algorithm is developed for implementation within a labeled multi-Bernoulli filter, executed locally on each node of a distributed network responsible for information fusion. To assess the efficacy of our solution, we evaluate its performance in a highly demanding scenario specifically designed for intelligent transport systems and compare its performance against alternative approaches.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing number of electric vehicles and limited charging stations, charging service providers need to consider the minimum range of electric vehicles and the congestion level of charging stations to formulate pricing strategies and guide charging vehicles. However, this service faces the challenges of privacy protection and utility coupling between CSs and EVs. Besides, the minimum driving range is also affected by the time-varying data characteristics of vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes an FL-assisted stable charging matching strategy considering congestion factors and range constraints. Specifically, we employ a federated learning scheme to predict the congestion factor of each charging station by learning the complex hidden characteristics of vehicles under the condition of privacy protection. Then, the pricing strategy and utility function are updated based on the congestion factor. Furthermore, under the driving range constraint, we transform the impact of the congestion factor on the expected utility into a regret value and use the Gale-Shapley algorithm based on regret minimization to achieve stable matching between vehicles and charging stations. Experimental results demonstrate the scheme’s effectiveness and that the charging success rate is improved by up to 11.7% compared with mainstream methods.},

  abstract     = {Urban rail transit systems in many cities are experiencing crowding during peak periods due to rapid population growth. Incentive-based demand management strategies aim to better utilize the available capacity by shifting peak travel to off-peak periods. Various deployments have demonstrated the crowding-reduction potential of incentives in reducing crowding but they have also shown that such strategies are inefficient with many passengers receiving the incentives but relatively few contributing to crowding reduction. This paper proposes a reverse auction-based, individualized incentive strategy to encourage individual passengers to switch travel from peak to off-peak periods. The proposed approach is individualized, participatory, and explicitly accounts for individual characteristics and the potential contribution of their behavior changes to the system. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the approach using AFC data from Hong Kong’s urban rail network. The results indicate that auction-based individualized incentives can enhance the system efficiency by strategically selecting passengers as winners whose behavioral changes contribute to the system performance. It also highlights the importance of correcting the information bias of perceived travel behavior between bidders and the population when operators select bid winners.},

The built model is a mixed-integer bilevel programming problem, which is difficult to solve due to its inherent hierarchical structure and discrete variables. By means of some mathematical techniques, we transform the bilevel model equivalently into a single-level mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Based on the numerical examples and results analysis, we bring some interesting managerial insights into the pricing of ride-hailing platforms, one of which is that booking fees of Express, unit time and distance fees of Express, compensations for Express riders and Express drivers are the core pricing factors to affect travel mode choices of riders.},

  abstract     = {Robust imaging under challenging conditions, such as starlit nights, has broadened the adoption of thermal infrared (TIR) cameras for nighttime driving scenes. Given that TIR images are monochromatic, which makes them difficult to interpret by humans and limits the applicability of RGB-based algorithms, it is reasonable to perform colorization of nighttime TIR (NTIR) images by converting them into corresponding daytime color images (NTIR2DC). Despite the impressive results achieved by previous NTIR2DC methods, how to improve the colorization performance of small-sample categories without semantic annotation is under-explored. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning framework called Memory-guided cOllaboRative atteNtion Generative Adversarial Network (MornGAN), which is inspired by the analogical reasoning mechanisms of humans. Specifically, we first propose an online semantic distillation module to mine and refine the semantic cues of NTIR images. Then, a memory-guided sample selection strategy and adaptive collaborative attention loss are devised to enhance the semantic preservation of small-sample categories. Further, a new conditional gradient repair loss is introduced for reducing edge distortion during translation. Extensive experiments on the NTIR2DC task show that the proposed MornGAN significantly outperforms other image-to-image translation methods in terms of semantic preservation and edge consistency, which helps improve the object detection accuracy remarkably.},

Our approach introduces a hybrid control mechanism that integrates data-driven performance optimization with a robust safety-centric control policy. By leveraging expert demonstrations and employing Jump-Start RL framework in Frenet coordinates, we greatly improve the learning efficiency of performance optimization. Further, an integrated safety control policy is designed to mitigate hazards through predictive trajectory planning, thus significantly reducing the risk of accidents in unforeseen situations. Meanwhile, the hybrid control mechanism employs adaptive weighting between performance and safety considerations, allowing for fusion control based on real-time environmental assessments. Through simulation experiments and initial real-vehicle testing, we validate the effectiveness of our adaptive hybrid controller.

  abstract     = {Under numerous computation requirements in intelligent traffic, platoons comprised of several connected vehicles are expected to centralize vehicular computation resources, which can provide computing services for surrounding mobile users and thus facilitate the deployment of vehicular edge computing (VEC). Nevertheless, the computing resources in multi-platoon are distributed unevenly, making platoons’ resource allocation highly selective, especially for randomly distributed mobile users. Moreover, existing works mainly focus on single-platoon-assisted VEC, which lacks resource coordination among platoons and may result in resource imbalance. Thus, through coordinating computing resource allocation in platoons and base stations (BSs), a coordinated computing resource allocation scheme is proposed in this paper to maximize the utilities of mobile users. However, the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard. To address this issue, the efficiency-maximized optimal computing resources allocated from platoons to users are derived in a semi-closed form. Then, to decouple the variables in allocation coordination, the efficiency maximization problem is proven to be equivalent to a low-complexity resource allocation problem oriented for single users. Based on the above results, two algorithms are proposed to convert the NP-hard problem into convex ones, 1) through efficiency-maximized task offloading and backtracking iteratively, a profit efficiency backtracking algorithm is proposed to coordinate computing resource allocation among platoons, and 2) heterogeneous profit efficiency algorithm is proposed to solve the primal problem, where a partition ratio-based efficiency maximization computing resource allocation problem is optimized in heterogeneous edges. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme can improve resource allocation efficiency, task success rates, and service continuity over benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Surface fractures are a significant problem in engineering structures like buildings and roads. Therefore, detecting such cracks is essential for assessing damage and maintaining these structures. The emergence of deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced the capability to detect surface cracks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are predominantly used for this task, but recently introduced transformer architectures could offer improvements. In this research, we developed software that integrates nine advanced models and various activation functions to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting pavement cracks. The evaluation is based on the models’ accuracy, complexity, and stability. We generated 711 images, each $224\times 224$ pixels, with crack labels, selected the most effective loss function, and compared the performance metrics of both validation and test datasets. We also examined the data details and evaluated the segmentation results for each model. Our results show that transformer-based models are more likely to converge during training and achieve higher accuracy, albeit with increased memory usage and reduced processing speed. Considering both accuracy and efficiency, SwinUNet outperforms the other two transformers and emerges as the superior choice among the nine evaluated models. We further confirm our conclusions with two public crack datasets. These findings shed light on the capabilities of various deep-learning models for surface crack detection and offer guidance for future applications in the field.},

  abstract     = {The content-centric data sharing in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) becomes increasingly imperative to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In order to protect the privacy of vehicle users, data is generally encrypted prior to being shared, whereas it hinders data searching and utilization. Proxy re-encryption with equivalence test (PREET) has been proposed to test the equivalence between encrypted messages, and to delegate the decryption right of searched data to the specified user. However, existing PREET schemes primarily focus on the equivalence test between two ciphertexts, which aren&#39;t suitable for the most practical scenarios that more than two ciphertexts need to be verified, due to the exposure of users&#39; extra information and the redundant computation. In this paper, to tackle these problems, we present a lightweight certificateless proxy re-encryption with multi-ciphertext equivalence test (CL-PREMET) for shared data to address the data search and authorized utilization over encrypted data in ITS. In our design, the users are allowed to efficiently and accurately search over massive encrypted data based on flexible multi-ciphertext analysis and to utilize their own keys rather than data owner&#39;s key to decrypt the searched data after being authorized, without revealing any private and sensitive information. The CL-PREMET achieves the IND-CCA security and the OW-CCA security. Furthermore, the simulation experiment displays that the CL-PREMET is feasible. Compared with existing PREET schemes, in addition to being suitable for multi-ciphertext equivalence analysis, our scheme leverages the certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) to avoid certificate management and key escrow problems.},

  abstract     = {Instance segmentation of traffic participants using vision-based techniques serves as a cornerstone for numerous intelligent transportation systems. Although existing deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements in this field, these algorithms still present considerable challenges with regard to generalizability for commercial deployment. Specifically, the mean average perception (mAP) of these algorithms degrades rapidly when dealing with intersections that are not included in the training set. To address this limitation, a novel instance segmentation approach named Si-GAIS is proposed, which incorporates a siamese structure for the first time with the proposed Generalizable-Attention Encoder (GA). Through the proposed Foreground-Background Fusion Unit (FBF) within GA, efficient feature-level fusion for the foreground and background images is achieved. Additionally, the Interpretable Attention Neck (IA) in GA enables the feature encoder to focus exclusively on the foreground traffic participants while ignoring various backgrounds. To utilize Si-GAIS, an unsupervised method named P-DBSCAN is proposed to obtain high-quality background image for each intersection with slow-moving traffic and camera jitters. Finally, the first multi-intersection multi-category instance segmentation datasets named RopeIns is proposed for validation. Si-GAIS achieves a 7.7% mAP (All APs used in this paper are abbreviations of AP $_{\textit {50}}$ the same with PASCAL VOC.) accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while using fewer parameters, with only a 6.4% decline in AP for car segmentation in unseen intersections and weather conditions, whereas all other SOTA methods decline more than 10%. The proposed dataset and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/441599828/SiGAIS and we hope Si-GAIS will be a new baseline for IPS instance segmentation research.},

In this work, the pick-up and drop-off demands are treated as two modalities, and an architecture is designed to explicitly model the interactions between the pick-up and drop-off demands both spatially and temporally. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism is adopted to automatically discover spatio-temporal patterns without manual designation for each demand. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is utilized to let the two demands attend to each other, resulting in information exchange between the two demands. The self-attention and cross-attention are combined to capture spatio-temporal correlations simultaneously. Finally, experiments are carried out on three real-world datasets, NYC Citi Bike, NYC Taxi, and BJ Subway, and the results show that this newly proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

As a result, combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with RIS (RIS-UAV) plays a crucial role in various wireless networks due to their high mobility. To maximize the communication rate between base station (BS) and mobile vehicle, we propose a position prediction strategy for vehicles that facilitates real-time adjustment of UAV trajectories and RIS phase shifts, enhancing communication in dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is utilized to solve the above question, which achieves a good effect on convergence in continuous action space. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmark schemes, the algorithm we suggested has significant performance gains, that is to maximize the communication rate under system constraints and guarantee the reliability of the communication.},

  abstract     = {High fidelity flight simulators use motion platforms to reproduce the feeling of motion from a real flight. While most of the published works for both aircraft and vehicle simulators are related to parallel motion platforms, this work approaches the problem of designing the motion cueing algorithm of a flight simulator based on a serial manipulator. The simulator presents a large cockpit with an embedded visual system and dimensions that resemble those of an aircraft flight deck. Motion cueing in this context should be able to minimize false cues while ensuring safe operation, coping not only with the dynamic and kinematic constraints of the robot but also avoiding crash events that might happen between the cockpit and the serial arm. While there have been several contributions regarding classical filtering, tuning optimization, and model-based predictive control approaches to cope with constraints of parallel platforms, they result in the inefficient utilization of the robot workspace or even the inability to handle collisions of the cockpit with the robot. This work presents a novel motion cueing algorithm for a serial robotic flight simulator, which focuses on ensuring safety regarding the physical boundaries of the cockpit while enhancing motion fidelity. The approach is based on a hybrid model-based predictor that uses a neural network to infer workspace collisions in real-time (including crash events of the cockpit with the robotic arm), releasing a non-linear deterministic control action that acts as a feedforward reference governor. Simulation and experimental results evince improved workspace usage while ensuring safe operation.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application. In CACC, a vehicle coordinates its longitudinal movements to safely and efficiently follow the vehicle in front. The follower vehicle relies on a combination of sensory and communication inputs to identify the position, velocity, and acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Malicious subversion of these inputs can cause catastrophic accidents, string instability, and disruption in the transportation infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a security system, ReCAP, to provide real-time resiliency in CACC against adversarial subversion of both sensory and communication inputs. ReCAP makes use of a combination of techniques based on kinematics and machine learning to detect anomalous inputs, narrow down the source of subversion, and perform mitigation. We provide extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of ReCAP against a diverse spectrum of attacks under complex, multi-channel adversaries.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting counts data in transportation areas can enrich passenger information for public transport passengers, who may thus better plan their trips. Moreover, forecasting with uncertainty is particularly important in the transportation domain, where the risk of poorly managed high demand is to be avoided. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic prediction model well-suited for multivariate, overdispersed, and possibly correlated count data. This model combines the strength of the deep learning framework with the modeling of counts data allowed by “sums and shares” distributions. Indeed, deep learning models can handle uncertainty by relying on an abstraction of contextual data and by assuming output distributions. Our model learns a latent representation of the input data with the help of a recurrent neural network and then translates it into multivariate count predictions with a “sums and shares” distribution, well suited to tackle multivariate overdispersed and correlated count data. An extensive benchmark of the proposed model is carried out. We compare this model with seven others from the state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models using five open-source data (bikes, taxis, railways, traffic, wikipedia) and a specific use case on pedestrian counts within a multimodal transport hub in the Paris Region. Our model outperforms other models in situations where the data present temporal regularities. The results also highlight the potential of our model in the specific use case. Moreover, this forecasting represents an interesting way to predict short-term pedestrian counts in response to different events, such as concerts or transport disruptions.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have emerged as powerful infrastructures for the next-generation Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) as the rapid technological advancements of communication networks and vehicular intelligence. While prospective platoon-based techniques in CAVs, the heterogeneous traffic condition poses a challenge for platoon control in the self-organized traffic bottleneck, thus making an urgent need for a practical sustainable transportation architecture. To address this problem, we propose a software defined architecture that leverages multi-agent techniques to mobile-edge computing networks for multi-vehicle adaptive platoon, which is called SD-M3ASP. The architecture supports centralized and decentralized management of vehicular edge communication resources between mobile vehicles and edge devices, and underpins sustainable vehicular platooning capabilities. Then, we propose cluster-based kinematic models by grouping vehicles into multi-vehicle clusters (MVCs) to facilitate efficient platoon control with collision avoidance. Furthermore, we propose three-stage platoon control algorithms to adaptively balance the size of MVCs and form stable platoons in heterogeneous traffic flows. The intra-platoon and inter-platoon convergence are analyzed by using the Routh stability criterion and Lyapunov technique. A CAV simulation software is developed for demonstration purposes which is available online at https://qgailab.com/cav-sim . Extensive numerical simulation results have shown the superiority of the proposed method, which can greatly eliminate the self-organized congestion caused by heterogeneous traffic flow.},

This paper focuses on one aspect that has received increasing attentions in recent years, namely a path control scheme. This study contributes to the ongoing research by extending the path control scheme to a within-day dynamic context, with both system efficiency and environmental objectives taken into consideration. Moreover, it also contributes to the domain of operations research by developing a unified optimization framework to determine the best control strategy. Specifically, we assume that AVs on the roads originally follow the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) principle and can be controlled as either dynamic system optimum (DSO) users to minimize the total system travel time, or dynamic eco-system optimum (DESO) users to minimize the total emission by the central agent when they depart from origins. We formulate the optimal time-dependent control problem as a single-level optimization program, with the dynamic equilibrium conditions integrated as a gap function-based constraint. A method for evaluating the path marginals is also presented, based on which a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. A robust optimization technique is also developed to tackle the non-unique equilibrium flow patterns of the multiclass dynamic traffic assignment problem. Based on the numerical results, it is found that some O-D pairs enjoy higher control priority than others, and theoretically a satisfactory system performance can be achieved by controlling a small fraction of the traffic.},

  abstract     = {Harsh sea conditions, uneven illumination, and the variable spatial positions of ships result in ship images captured by imaging systems that contain not only the ship targets but also complex environmental information. This environmental complexity, intertwined with the ship targets, significantly undermines the accuracy of ship target recognition. However, existing methods for recognizing ships are mainly designed to identify large targets in clear weather with uniform illumination. They rarely account for the aforementioned complex environmental information, leading to the loss of critical detailed features in the ship’s target area, particularly in adverse weather and uneven illumination scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for recognizing ship targets in complex environments: the Feature Representation Enhancement and Graph Convolutional Combiner Network (FREGNet). We introduce a Feature Representation Enhancement (FRE) module to the backbone of the feature extraction network to enhance the capture of detailed features in the ship’s target area, particularly under illumination noise and cloud-covered conditions. Furthermore, we design a GCN Combiner module based on a Graph Convolutional Network to dynamically combine global feature key points and local detailed feature key points output by the FRE, thereby increasing the quantity of detailed feature information in the ship’s target area. This approach facilitates the accurate classification of ship categories. Experiments were conducted using the CIB-ships, MAR-ships, and Game-of-ships datasets. Compared to suboptimal transformer-based ship target recognition methods, FREGNet improves ship target recognition accuracy by 2.8%, 0.99%, and 1.38%, respectively. The FREGNet method achieves high recognition accuracy at a faster rate.},

Recent work formalizes the assessment procedure in terms of carefully selected risk factors that are also known as road-safety attributes. In current practice, these attributes are manually annotated in geo-referenced monocular video for each road segment. We propose to reduce dependency on tedious human labor by automating attribute collection through a two-stage deep learning approach. The first stage recognizes more than forty road-safety attributes by observing a local spatio-temporal context. Our design leverages an efficient convolutional pipeline, which benefits from pre-training on semantic segmentation of street scenes. The second stage enhances predictions through sequential integration across a larger temporal window. Our design leverages per-attribute instances of a lightweight recurrent architecture. Both stages alleviate extreme class imbalance by incorporating a multi-task variant of recall-based dynamic loss weighting. We perform experiments on the novel iRAP-BH dataset, which involves fully labeled geo-referenced video along 2,300 km of public roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, we evaluate our approach against the related work on three road-scene classification datasets from the literature: Honda Scenes, FM3m, and BDD100k. Experimental evaluation confirms the value of our contributions on all three datasets.},

  abstract     = {Short-term OD flow (i.e. the number of passenger traveling between stations) prediction is crucial to traffic management in metro systems. The delayed effect in latest complete OD flow collection and complex spatiotemporal correlations of OD flows in high dimension make it challengeable to predict short-term OD flow. Existing methods need to be improved due to not fully utilizing the real-time passenger mobility data and not sufficiently modeling the implicit correlation of the mobility patterns between stations. In this paper, we propose a Completion based Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Convolution Spatiotemporal Predictor. The novelty is mainly reflected in two aspects. The first is to model real-time mobility evolution by establishing the implicit correlation between observed OD flows and the prediction target OD flows in high dimension based on a key data-driven insight: the destination distributions of the passengers departing from a station are correlated with other stations sharing similar attributes (e.g. geographical location, region function). The second is to complete the latest incomplete OD flows by estimating the destination distribution of unfinished trips through considering the real-time mobility evolution and the time cost between stations, which is the base of time series prediction and can improve the model’s dynamic adaptability. Extensive experiments on two real world metro datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over other competitors with the biggest model performance improvement being nearly 4%. In addition, the data complete framework we propose can be integrated into other models to improve their performance up to 2.1%.},

Traditional methods, such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Cellular Automaton, rely on actual traffic data for load generation and evolution. However, they often overlook in-lane transverse movements, which are vital for precise bridge component assessment. This paper presents a TLS framework that incorporates in-lane transverse movements for long-span bridges. We select eight parameters as input features for a Transformer-based deep learning model, designed to predict both longitudinal and transverse vehicle speeds. The TLS process begins with spatial-temporal traffic load monitoring on the target bridge. Monte-Carlo sampling generates vehicle data, and the trained Transformer model simulates traffic evolution. A case study on a 1490-meter main-span suspension bridge illustrates the proposed method. Traffic trajectories were captured using a multi-vision system and reconstructed to minimize errors. The Transformer model was trained with optimized hyperparameters, enabling the completion of TLS on the entire bridge deck. We also compare the performance of other deep learning models, evaluate the accuracy of transverse distribution in TLS, and discuss its potential applications in future bridge assessments. The proposed TLS method enhances current practices by accurately simulating transverse vehicle positions on bridge decks, thereby improving the fidelity of microscopic traffic simulations and enabling more precise fatigue damage assessments of bridge components.},

  abstract     = {For cyclists, being overtaken represents a safety risk of possibly being side-swiped or cut in by overtaking drivers. For drivers, such maneuvers are challenging–not only do they need to decide when to initiate the maneuver, but they also need to time their return well to complete the maneuver. In the presence of oncoming traffic, the problem of completing an overtaking maneuver extends to balancing head-on with side-swipe collision risks. Active safety systems such as blind-spot or forward-collision warning systems, or, more recently, automated driving features, may assist drivers in avoiding such collisions and completing the maneuver successfully. However, such systems must interact carefully with the driver and prevent false-positive alerts that reduce the driver’s trust in the system. In this study, we developed a driver-behavior model of the drivers’ return onset in cyclist-overtaking maneuvers that could improve such a safety system. To provide cumulative evidence about driver behavior, we used data from two different sources: test track and naturalistic driving. We developed Bayesian survival models for the two datasets that can predict the probability of a driver returning, given time-varying inputs about the current situation. We evaluated the models in an in-sample and out-of-sample evaluation. Both models showed that drivers use the displacement of the cyclist to time their return decision, which is accelerated if an oncoming vehicle is present and close. We discuss how the models could be integrated into an active-safety system to improve driver acceptance.},

Moreover, the inherent characteristic of the black box predictive model makes it difficult to interpret the reliability and effectiveness of the deep learning model. To address these issues, a novel self-explanatory spatial-temporal deep learning model–Attention Spatial-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network (ASTMGCN) is proposed for traffic accident prediction. The original recorded rare accident data is formulated as a multivariate irregularly interval-aligned dataset, and the temporal discretization method is used to transfer into regularly sampled time series. Multiple graphs are defined to construct edge features and represent spatial relationships when node-related information is missing. Multi-graph convolutional operators and attention mechanisms are integrated into a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) framework to effectively capture dynamic spatial and temporal features and correlations in multi-step prediction. Comparative experiments and interpretability analysis are conducted on a real-world data set, and results indicate that our model can not only yield superior prediction performance but also has the advantage of interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Transportation mode classification, the process of predicting the class labels of moving objects’ transportation modes, has been widely applied to a variety of real-world applications, such as traffic management, urban computing, and behavior study. However, existing studies of transportation mode classification typically extract the explicit features of trajectory data but fail to capture the implicit features that affect the classification performance. In addition, most of the existing studies also prefer to apply RNN-based models to embed trajectories, which is only suitable for classifying small-scale data. To tackle the above challenges, we propose an effective and scalable framework for transportation mode classification over GPS trajectories, abbreviated Estimator. Estimator is established on a developed CNN-TCN architecture, which is capable of leveraging the spatial and temporal hidden features of trajectories to achieve high effectiveness and efficiency. Estimator partitions the entire traffic space into disjointed spatial regions according to traffic conditions, which enhances the scalability significantly and thus enables parallel transportation classification. Extensive experiments using eight public real-life datasets offer evidence that Estimator i) achieves superior model effectiveness (i.e., 99% Accuracy and 0.98 F1-score), which outperforms state-of-the-arts substantially; ii) exhibits prominent model efficiency, and obtains 7–40x speedups up over state-of-the-arts learning-based methods; and iii) shows high model scalability and robustness that enables large-scale classification analytics.},

  abstract     = {In-vehicle infotainment system (IVIS) plays an increasingly important role in vehicle intelligence. New energy vehicles have sufficient power, and their IVIS is developing in the direction of large size and multiple functions. By using online comments, thirteen attributes of IVIS were extracted through data clustering. Then, the attribute types and their corresponding contributions to the improvement of satisfaction and the reduction of dissatisfaction were determined by structured data transformation, correlation analysis, dual satisfaction analysis, and fine-grained satisfaction analysis using Kano model. Then, satisfaction and dissatisfaction influence indexes (IFIs) were calculated by combining attention, correlation coefficient and sentimental intensity. An improved cumulative prospect theory was then adopted to calculate the overall IFIs of different attributes. Sensitivity analyses of risk aversion and attention tendency were then conducted, and specific satisfaction optimization suggestions were then discussed. The results of the study have a guiding role in the optimization design of IVIS and the effectiveness of marketing promotion. The research methods contribute theoretically to improving the identification accuracy of online comments, coordinating the influence of sentimental tendency, integrating the analysis of attention’s influence and testing the effect of risk attitudes.},

  abstract     = {In most studies on modeling driving behavior at uncontrolled intersections, multi-vehicle interaction scenarios are usually categorized and modeled separately as moving-across behavior and merging behavior. However, it is inappropriate to use a single-behavior model to accurately represent general driving behavior in uncontrolled intersections. In this case, we constructed a general driving behavior model for multi-vehicle interaction at uncontrolled intersections. Initially, the IMM model is employed to anticipate the movement of the vehicle within the driver’s visual field. The risk field theory is applied to assess potential hazards that the vehicle might confront, drawing from the risk homeostasis theory and preview-follower theory, which aids in determining a trajectory that aligns with the drivers’ real-life actions while also meeting the risk constraints. Drivers’ heterogeneity is reflected by risk threshold. This model can simulate driver behavior in traffic congestion at uncontrolled intersections by adjusting risk thresholds when the vehicles are caught in a deadlock situation. Results show that our model can accurately reproduce the priority and trajectory of vehicles crossing the intersection and resolve multi-vehicle conflicts within a reasonable time. This model can be used for traffic simulation at uncontrolled intersections and to provide test validation for automated driving systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle technology is rapidly becoming the driving force in the automobile industry. As such, the interest in high-resolution radio detection and ranging (radar) for autonomous vehicle applications is increasing due to its affordability and high angular resolution. However, for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), the challenge of azimuth ambiguity caused by a large physical distance between radar antennas is prevalent. This causes false measurements in a direction different from the target’s true angle due to grating lobes. This challenge increases when extended targets are considered. This paper proposes a Pseudo-3D Assignment (P3DA) method based on a Pseudo Measurement Set (PMS) to resolve azimuth ambiguity in multiple extended target tracking. The proposed method can resolve mono (single) and split (duplicated) azimuth ambiguities common in extended target tracking. The proposed solution uses Lagrangian Relaxation based on a Flexible Search (LR-FS) algorithm to solve the P3DA-PMS problem efficiently. The performance of the proposed algorithm in a typical traffic scenario simulated in Unreal Engine 4, with an ego vehicle mounted with both 2D (unambiguous) and 3D (ambiguous) radars, is evaluated. Simulation and experiment results suggest that the proposed P3DA-PMS-based tracking algorithm can perform better than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of intelligent transportation, various mobile value-added services can be provided by the service provider (SP) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). To guarantee the dependability of services, it is essential to implement a mutual authentication protocol between the vehicles and the SP. Existing mutual authentication protocols to secure the communication between the SP and the vehicle raise challenges such as providing fine-grained forward security for the SP and achieving backward security for the vehicle. To handle these challenges, this paper proposes a conditional privacy-preserving mutual authentication protocol featured with fine-grained forward security and backward security for IoV, which can be implemented via two building blocks we have constructed. Specifically, we present a new puncturable signature (PS) scheme without false-positive probability and the update of the public key as well as the first proxy re-signature scheme with parallel key-insulation (PKI-PRS). What’s more, both the proposed PKI-PRS and PS still have interest beyond this protocol. Then, an anonymous mutual authentication protocol with resistance to key leakage is constructed by incorporating the above signature schemes. The proposed protocol not only provides fine-grained forward security for the SP, but also ensures forward security as well as backward security for the vehicles. Besides, the approach to achieving anonymous authentication can efficiently provide conditional privacy-preserving for the vehicles. With the support of the random oracle model and experimental simulations, the formal security proof and the superiority of the proposed protocol is explicitly given.},

To effectively address these challenges, all design tasks in automotive projects need to be well-coordinated and prioritize vehicle security. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a comprehensive approach that allows multiple engineering disciplines to work concurrently. In this study, we propose the integration of well-established security solutions, such as Security Patterns, into safety-critical automotive systems using the MBSE approach. Our work presents a procedural flow for incorporating Security Patterns into the system model, emphasizing the inclusion of cybersecurity (CySe) and functional safety (FS) actions. To meet the regulatory requirements, we selected the IDS (Intrusion Detection System) pattern as a key component of our proposed CyberSafety Design Framework. In a real-world case study of an Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS), we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework by integrating the IDS pattern with TARA and HARA assessments. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of merging design processes within an MBSE framework, reducing design effort and aligning with the security by design principle. Future research should explore the application of different Security Patterns in conjunction with SOTIF systems, and industry efforts should be directed towards standardizing the collaboration between cybersecurity and safety.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the battery charging time of an electric vehicle (EV) is one of the key factors to boost the widespread adoption of EVs. The commercial, off-board high power, dc fast charging station need high initial investment and maintenance cost. On the other hand, the standard on-board type-1 and type-2 ac chargers with $3.3~kW$ to $19~kW$ need long time to charge. This paper proposes a combinatory ac and dc charging approach to increase the charging rate of EV batteries. The proposed combinatory charging approach provides a technique to charge EV battery from the on-board type-2 ac charger and drivetrain integrated dc charger. For drivetrain integrated dc charging, a dc input port $(N (+),O(-))$ is formed using the neutral of the EV motor winding $(N)$ and negative rail of the drivetrain inverter $(O)$ . Through this dc input port, power from the renewable energy source-based dc microgrids, solar rooftops and other EV battery can be accepted for charging. The EV drivetrain inverter is controlled as an integrated interleaved dc-dc converter (IDC) to receive power from dc sources with EV motor windings reutilized as filter inductors. The control scheme for regulating the voltage across common dc-link accepting power from type-2 ac charger and integrated interleaved dc charger is presented. The performance analysis of EV motor and drivetrain integrated DC charger is validated through Finiet Element methods (FEM) co-simulation using Ansys Maxwell and Simplorer. A scaled experimental prototype is developed to validate the proposed combined ac and dc charging approach.},

The success of deep learning based object detectors relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, which is time-consuming and expensive to compile, especially for 3D bounding box annotation. In this work, we investigate diversity-based active learning (AL) as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. Given limited annotation budget, only the most informative frames and objects are automatically selected for human to annotate. Technically, we take the advantage of the multimodal information provided in an AV dataset, and propose a novel acquisition function that enforces spatial and temporal diversity in the selected samples. We benchmark the proposed method against other AL strategies under realistic annotation cost measurements, where the realistic costs for annotating a frame and a 3D bounding box are both taken into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset and show that it outperforms existing AL strategies significantly.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of cloud infrastructure and its extensive range of Internet-accessible resources holds significant potential for advancing intelligent transportation and robotics. Over the past two decades, interest in cloud-edge collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has grown markedly. Consequently, a comprehensive review of current trends in this field is crucial for both novice and experienced researchers. This paper examines robots and automation systems that rely on network-based data or code, particularly in the context of SLAM development. Applying SLAM to mobile robots with limited computing power is essential for achieving autonomous navigation, and cloud-edge collaborative SLAM has emerged as an efficient solution. The review is structured around four key benefits of cloud-edge collaborative SLAM: Assisted Cloud Computing, which provides access to cloud computation and reduces the burden on edge devices; Total Cloud Computing, where the majority of computation is offloaded to the cloud, while edge devices primarily handle sensing and low-cost pre-processing; Data Storage, enabling access to large datasets, such as high-resolution environment maps and extensive training datasets, enhancing overall performance; and Data Transmission, involving cloud-edge communication for efficient data transfer and data association. Additionally, we address the challenges in existing work and the development of asynchronous collaboration and implicit representation transmission, which could mitigate transmission latency in communication-constrained environments. We believe that this review will bridge the gap between SLAM systems and deployed robotic systems, promoting the advancement of cloud-edge collaborative SLAM.},

Importantly, the integration of UAVs and cutting-edge deep learning (DL) techniques is fostering an exciting synergy, equipping UAVs with unparalleled intelligence and autonomy, particularly, for the perception layer of UAVs. Despite these enhancements, their usefulness for detection and traffic extraction tasks remains largely unexplored. The contributions of this paper are divided into two main aspects: (1) UAVs in different ITS application scenarios that are empowered by ML technologies are reviewed. (2) A thorough survey aiming to explore a quantitative understanding of widely used DL models via a series of experiments and comparisons is presented. Four DL models, namely Convolution Neural Network (CNN), regions with CNN (R-CNN), Faster R-CNN, and You Only Look Once (YOLO)), in combination with different backbones, are designed and employed on five aerial datasets.

Furthermore, we identify the limitations and gaps in the existing studies related to RSMRs, and provide recommendations for future research initiatives: 1) focusing on common interactive driving events in real-world traffic such as lane changing, merging, cut-in, and overtaking, 2) extending the experiment duration and distance, 3) increasing the randomness in experimental design, 4) exploring the transferability of autonomous driving algorithms from RSMRs to real vehicles, 5) researching on the mixed fleet consisting of manually controlled RSMRs and self-driving RSMRs.},

  abstract     = {A system with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera (named as LiDAR-camera system) plays the essential role in intelligent vehicle (IV), for it provides 3D spatial and 2D texture features for 3D scene understanding. To leverage LiDAR point cloud and image, extrinsic calibration is a crucial technique, for it can align 2D pixel and 3D point in the pixel-level accuracy. With the rapid development of IV, calibration demand is shifted from offline to online, from the specific scenes to the open scenes. It brings new challenge to the calibration task. Although numbers of approaches have been proposed in the last decade, there lacks an in-depth summary about this topic. Thus, we conduct a survey of extrinsic calibration. Theoretically, the key of calibration is to build correspondence from LiDAR point cloud and optical image. From the viewpoint of correspondence, we attempt to divide the mainstream approaches into explicit and implicit correspondence based methods. After that, we summarize both the strength and weakness of the current works, provide the methods comparison, and list the open-source implementations. Finally, we analyze the tendency of calibration approach, discuss the remained problems in this field. We believe that this survey benefits to the community of autonomous driving.},

The advent of 5G networks can not only revolutionize cellular localization performance but also provide adept capacity to handle massive sensor data and dependable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) transmission at impressive speeds with minimal latency. These advancements stir expectations to promote cooperative AV localization from lane-level accuracy to centimeter-level. The purpose of this survey is to elaborate on the predominance of applying 5G networks for cooperative AV localization, which overviews 5G new radio features, 5G localization techniques, and the pivotal algorithms supporting 5G AV localization, including filtering-based and machine learning algorithms. Three applications of 5G cooperative AV localization are highlighted, respectively the integrations of 5G networks with satellite systems, simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, and vehicular networks.

In this study, 831 papers published over two decades (2003–2024) are retrieved from the Web of Science database. This work aims to build extensive knowledge maps of LBO algorithms for routing problems by using a scientometric review of new developments and global trends. Prolific journals, conferences, authors, and institutions are discussed in the statistical analysis. The overall trend of LBO algorithms for routing problems is growing, and it is dominated by China and the USA.

Different emphases on the research field in operations research and computer science communities are identified respectively. Studies on LBO algorithms are reviewed from the perspectives of supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), and reinforcement learning (RL). The major characteristics and limitations of LBO algorithms in each category are discussed. Dependence on sample labels and cluster numbers restricts the practical application of SL and UL to routing problems. Meanwhile, RL approaches, such as the deep Q-network, which exhibit fast convergence and computational efficiency, have elicited widespread attention in recent years.

  abstract     = {Road intersections will soon be congested with countless connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to meet a variety of transportation needs. In such an environment, CAVs will need to work together and coordinate with one another. Smart infrastructure should also be in place to enable CAVs to efficiently utilize shared intersection resources and carry out their mobility duties. The interaction among CAVs and between CAVs and infrastructure for efficient intersection management is facilitated by a key technology of intelligent transportation system (ITS), known as cooperative vehicle-intersection system (CVIS). Towards developing a better insight into this fast-developing technology, this study presents a thorough review of the state of the art in CVIS research in the context of three hierarchal layers of shared perception, intersection control, and vehicle control. To describe the workflow of cooperative perception systems, a systematic architecture of infrastructure-based perception supported by edge computing and multi-node multi-sensor fusion techniques is explored. Different shared perception methodologies, aiming at the perceptual fusion of CAVs and infrastructure to achieve comprehensive environmental perception are critically analyzed to identify the landscape of cooperative detection and tracking. With an emphasis on essential interaction between CAVs and infrastructure, various cooperative control strategies are then investigated for the co-design of crossing scheduling and motion control of multiple CAVs at intersections. The applications of CVIS in cooperative driving automation in terms of efficiency, safety, and sustainability are qualitatively analyzed. This paper concludes by identifying gaps and challenges in vehicle-intersection cooperation along with recommendations on future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Designing an Emergency Vehicle Management (EVM) system that can provide competent services with the shortest possible delay is challenging. This is primarily due to the highly complex environments in which they are deployed and the diverse scenarios a vehicle could face after deployment. Compared to other types of vehicles, emergency vehicles operate under time-critical circumstances, move at much higher speeds, and require much greater alertness from the driver. Traditionally, emergency vehicles have not relied on dedicated smart/intelligent systems for increased safety and effectiveness. While much research has been carried out to improve the services of commercial and non-commercial vehicles in general, road emergency vehicles have not received the same research attention. The role of emergency vehicles in new environments (e.g., smart cities) will become increasingly important. To address this issue, we review state-of-the-art research results reported to date, focusing on the deployment and use of EVM. We discuss different dimensions of EVM which include route planning, patient information retrieval, accident detection, driver inattention detection, and several assisting tools and technologies. We identify key advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems that can be leveraged for safe and effective EVM. We identify challenges inhibiting the usage and deployment of such advancements in EVM, and finally we identify future research directions for a more effective EVM that current developments in ITS have not yet addressed. We hope this work will serve as an accurate and updated source of information for the ever-evolving field of smart cities and ITS.},

  abstract     = {Drowsiness is characterized by reduced attentiveness, commonly experienced during the transition from wakefulness to sleepiness. It can decrease an individual’s alertness, thereby increasing the risk of accidents during activities such as driving, crane operation, working in mining areas, and industrial machinery operation. The detection of drowsiness plays an important role in preventing such accidents. Numerous methods exist for drowsiness detection, including Subjective, Vehicle, Behavioral, and Physiological approaches. Among these, Physiological methods, particularly those utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) data combined with artificial intelligence, have proven effective in detecting drowsiness. These methods excel in capturing physiological changes in the body during drowsiness and the potential for gathering information from the human brain during this state. EEG data-based Brain-Computer interface (BCI) systems have been popular for detecting drowsiness. Single-channel EEG signal analysis BCIs have been highly preferred for their ease and convenient usage in real-time applications. While some progress has been made in the single-channel EEG BCI, substantial progress is still needed. This paper provides a state-of-the-art analysis of recent developments in the single-channel EEG-based drowsiness detection methods. Ultimately, this review study explores potential avenues for the future development of single-channel EEG-based drowsiness detection.},

In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and wireless power transfer (ISWPT) system is investigated, where the transmitter in transportation infrastructure networks sends signals to sense multiple targets and simultaneously to multiple energy harvesting devices (EHDs) to power them. Recognizing the inherent tradeoff between energy harvesting and sensing performance, we propose to jointly optimize the system performance via optimizing the beamforming and IRS phase shift. However, the coupling of optimization variables makes the formulated problem non-convex. Thus, an alternative optimization approach is introduced and based on which two algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the first algorithm involves the semi-positive definite programming techniques, and the second algorithm is based on the successive convex approximations and majorization minimization to design the closed form solutions of the optimization variables, which can effectively reduce the computational complexity. Our simulation results validate the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the advantages of using IRS to assist wireless power transfer in ISWPT systems. This research contributes to the integration of wireless sensing and wireless energy in intelligent transportation systems and underscores the optimization of system performance through the introduction of IRS.},

However, traditional methods for pavement defect detection face challenges such as inefficiency and high equipment costs. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a pavement defect detection and statistical system based on street view videos. Initially, we introduce an enhanced algorithm named SN-YOLO (Slim-neck YOLO) designed to address the issue of low model detection accuracy in complex background environments meanwhile achieve model lightweighting. Specifically, the GSConv lightweight convolution module is employed to minimize the model size, while the VoVGSCSP and VoVGSCSP-cheap modules are incorporated to augment the original C2f module, thereby refining the model’s recognition capabilities in intricate backgrounds. Moreover, by incorporating Soft-NMS for post-processing optimization, the model’s robustness in detecting multi-scale defects is enhanced. Experimental results on the open-source dataset RDD2022 and a proprietary dataset demonstrate that the improved SN-YOLO algorithm surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging the SN-YOLO algorithm and the Deep oc-sort tracking algorithm, we develop a deployable pavement distress detection and statistic system. In the application to real-world road street view video analysis, the system exhibits unparalleled accuracy and efficiency in defect detection and data compilation, presenting a robust solution for expedited, large-scale assessment of pavement conditions.},

  abstract     = {Many multi-view camera-based 3D object detection models transform the image features into Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) via the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) mechanism, which “lifts” 2D camera-view features to the 3D voxel space based on the predicted depth distribution and then “splats” 3D features into a BEV plane for subsequent 3D object detection. However, the BEV feature in such a one-stage view transformation scheme heavily relies on the quality of the predicted depth distribution and 2D camera-view features, which further determines the final detection performance. In this paper, we propose a BEVRefiner model which performs dual refinement for both depth prediction and 2D camera-view features. On the one hand, we perform light-weight depth refinement in the depth distribution frustum space by incorporating 3D context and depth distribution prior. On the other hand, we reproject the BEV feature back to each camera view to enhance 2D image features. In this way, the original camera-view features can be enhanced by implicitly incorporating 3D contexts and multi-view contexts, which cannot be achieved in the original 2D camera view. We also propose to use dominant depth bins only for the reprojection to save computational burden. Finally, we generate the refined BEV feature using the refined depth distribution and camera-view features for more accurate 3D object detection. Our BEVRefiner can be plugged into LSS-based BEV detectors and we perform extensive experiments on the representative model BEVDet, which strongly verified the efficiency of our proposed approach under several settings.},

  abstract     = {Timely and accurate pavement crack detection plays a crucial role in urban transportation and pavement management. Recently, deep learning-based pavement crack detection approaches have witnessed significant advancements. However, high-performance networks heavily rely on complex network structures and massive model parameters, making their application in practical scenarios challenging. To achieve efficient yet accurate pavement crack detection, this paper presents a novel Lightweight Pavement Crack Detection based on Multi-Scale Semantic Map Distillation (LPCD-MSMD). Specifically, we improve the U-Net by designing a novel Cascaded U-Net (C-UNet) structure and incorporating additional branches to capture more subtle features. The proposed C-UNet is optimized by reducing the number of convolutional layers and compressing the channel dimensions, benefiting to a more lightweight model while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, we utilize the original C-UNet as the teacher network and the simplified network as the student network for a lightweight pavement crack detection. Through the proposed multi-scale semantic map distillation strategy, the student network can acquire multi-scale output knowledge from the cascaded output of the teacher network, benefiting significantly improved performance of the CU-Net(s). Thorough experimental results demonstrate that the elaborately designed student network possesses a remarkably small parameter size of only 0.54 MB. Moreover, the performance evaluated on the Crack500 dataset and the GAPS384 dataset indicate the superiority of proposed method over several typical deep learning-based approaches including SegNet, FCN, BiSeNet, and U-Net. In particular, our method outperforms the second-best method by 0.09 and 0.124 in terms of F1 score evaluated on the Crack500 dataset and the GAPS384 dataset, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) utilize advanced technologies to enhance traffic safety and efficiency, contributing significantly to modern transportation. The integration of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) further elevates road safety and fosters the progress of ITS through enabling direct vehicle communication and interaction with infrastructure. However, the penetration rate of V2X vehicles is advancing gradually. Consequently, there will be mixed scenarios on the road, involving both on-board units (OBUs)-equipped and non-equipped vehicles. This results in disparities in communication capabilities, highlighting the need to ensure the efficient and safe operation of vehicles in such mixed scenarios. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a feasibility analysis and prediction method for lane-changing overtaking maneuvers in mixed scenarios, specifically for vehicles equipped with OBUs. This method assists vehicles in completing overtaking maneuvers by offering a non-binary lane-changing overtaking feasibility index along with corresponding speed guidance. First, vehicle sensors are used to sense the state of surrounding vehicles, addressing any missing sensor data due to occlusions. Moreover, the future driving behavior of the vehicle is taken into account to more accurately predict the future state of the vehicle. Then, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is deployed to process the hybrid action space to train a lane-changing overtaking model, which also takes into account the influence of the flow of each lane in front of the vehicle, and finally predicts the feasibility of the vehicle performing lane-changing overtaking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the vehicle’s future state and effectively assist the vehicle in completing lane-changing overtaking maneuvers. This research provides strong support for the integration of ITS and V2X technologies.},

  abstract     = {In complex and variable traffic environments, efficient multi-objective urban traffic light scheduling is imperative. However, the carbon emission problem accompanying traffic delays is often neglected in most existing literature. This study focuses on multi-objective urban traffic light scheduling problems (MOUTLSP), concerning traffic delays and carbon emissions simultaneously. First, a multi-objective mathematical model is firstly developed to describe MOUTLSP to minimize vehicle delays, pedestrian delays, and carbon emissions. Second, three well-known meta-heuristics, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), are improved to solve MOUTLSP. Six problem-feature-based local search operators (LSO) are designed based on the solution structure and incorporated into the iterative process of meta-heuristics. Third, the problem nature is utilized to design two novel Q-learning-based strategies for algorithm and LSO selection, respectively. The Q-learning-based algorithm selection (QAS) strategy guides non-dominated solutions to obtain a good trade-off among three objectives and generates high-quality solutions by selecting suitable algorithms. The Q-learning-based local search selection (QLSS) strategies are employed to seek premium neighborhood solutions throughout the iterative process for improving the convergence speed. The effectiveness of the improvement strategies is verified by solving 11 instances with different scales. The proposed algorithms with Q-learning-based strategies are compared with two classical multi-objective algorithms and some state-of-the-art algorithms for solving urban traffic light scheduling problems. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed GA+QLSS, a variant of GA, is the most competitive one. This research proposes new ideas for urban traffic light scheduling with three objectives by Q-learning assisted evolutionary algorithms firstly. It provides strong support for achieving more efficient and environmentally friendly urban traffic management.},

In this paper, math-data integrated defogging (MDD) mechanism is created within a ship detection network, termed MDD-ShipNet. Main contributions are as follows: 1) The MDD enhancement module (MDD-EM) is implemented by devising 5 filters, i.e., defog, exposure, tone, contrast and sharpen, as well as a CNN-based parameter learner, such that defogging enhancement can progressively be conducted in a transparent manner; 2) The detector is innovated by employing polarized self-attention (PSA) and weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network (WBiFPN), so as to preserve long-range dependencies and high-resolution channel-spatial features, simultaneously, thereby sufficiently fusing shallow and semantics information associated with contributions to detection; and 3) The entire MDD-ShipNet framework is ultimately established in a weakly supervised manner by integrating MDD-EM and PSA-WBiFPN-based detector, and is fertilized by hybrid dataset that is diversely contributed by real-world and synthesized sea-foggy images. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons eventually validate that the MDD-ShipNet framework outperforms typical approaches deriving from the detection after image enhancement, multi-task learning and domain adaption in terms of mAP@.5, mAP@[.5:.95] and FPS.},

  abstract     = {Crack detection, as one of the structural health monitoring tasks, plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of transportation infrastructure. And the convenience of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has led to their widespread utilization as carriers for crack detection task. However, the motion and vibration of the carrier inevitably lead to image blurring, consequently degrading the performance of subsequent crack detection. While existing image deblurring methods exhibit commendable performance in feature-rich real-world scenarios, their efficacy tends to diminish in feature-limited environments, such as the surfaces of concrete structures and pavements. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel deblurring network, named Motion and Event-guided Cross-modal Fusion Network (MECFNet), by incorporating motion information and event information as constraints to guide the image reconstruction process. For one thing, we devise two novel representation methods: motion field and accumulated event to characterize these two types of information. For another, we introduce a cross-modal transformer module to incorporate these two new modalities of information into the image features. Comparison experiments and ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed network and its constituent components. Furthermore, the performance of crack detection achieves a significant enhancement after the reconstruction of blurry images.},

The vehicular digital network is emerging as the industrial revolution, where each real-mobile entity (i.e., vehicle) is connected in the virtual environment through their digital replica, known as a digital twin. The real-time data synchronization in the digital twin-centric approach is achieved via an open communication channel. Unfortunately, leveraging the virtual-reality synthesized security perils in the network which consequently obligates rigorous privacy and security countermeasures such as authentication, encryption and signature techniques.

The security of the protocol is investigated under the real or random oracle model (ROR) and is confirmed secure with non-mathematical security analysis.

  abstract     = {The combination of the Metaverse and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) holds significant developmental promise, especially for visual perception tasks. However, the acquisition of high-quality scene data poses a challenging and expensive endeavor. Meanwhile, the visual disparity between the Metaverse and the physical world poses an impact on the practical applicability of the visual perception tasks. In this paper, a Metaverse Intelligent Traffic Visual Framework, MITVF, is developed to guide the implementation of visual perception tasks in the physical world. Firstly, a two-stage metadata optimization strategy is proposed that can efficiently provide diverse and high-quality scene data for traffic perception models. Specifically, an element reconfigurability strategy is proposed to flexibly combine dynamic and static traffic elements to enrich the data with a low cost. A diffusion model-based metadata optimization acceleration strategy is proposed to achieve efficient improvement of image resolution. Secondly, a Meta-Physical adaptive learning method is proposed, and further applied to visual perception tasks to compensate for the visual disparity between the Metaverse and the physical world. Experimental results show that MITVF achieves a $10\times $ acceleration in optimization speed, ensuring the image quality and reconstructing diverse. Further, MITVF is applied to the traffic object detection task to verify the effectiveness and validity. The performance of the model trained with 5k real data exceeded that of the model trained with 200k real data, with AP50 reaching 67.7%.},

  abstract     = {Prediction is a vital component of motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs). By reasoning about the possible behavior of other target agents, the ego vehicle (EV) can navigate safely, efficiently, and politely. However, most of the existing work overlooks the interdependencies of the prediction and planning module, only connecting them in a sequential pipeline or underexploring the prediction results in the planning module. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates the prediction and planning module with three highlights. First, we propose an ego-conditioned model for causal prediction, with the introduced edge-featured graph transformer model, the impact the ego future maneuver poses to the target vehicles is demonstrated. Second, we develop a motion planner based on ‘dynamic voxels’ in the spatio-temporal domain, enabling the time-to-collision criterion evaluation and the optimal trajectory generation in continuous space. Third, the prediction and planning modules are coupled in a closed-loop and efficient form. Specifically, taking each maneuver as a cluster, representative trajectory primitives are generated for conditional prediction, and conversely, prediction results are used to score the primitives as guidance, which alleviates the duplicated callback of the prediction module. The simulations are conducted in overtaking, merging, unprotected left turns, and also scenarios with imperfect social behaviors. The comparison studies demonstrate the better safety assurance and efficiency of the proposed model, and the ablation experiments further reveal the effectiveness of the new ideas.},

However, the acquisition, transmission and sharing of digital images inevitably raise concerns about privacy disclosure. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight image encryption scheme based on data hiding and compressive sensing (CS). Specifically, during the CS sampling and compression stages, we employ data-hiding techniques to embed information from the confusion matrix and coordinates of sensitive regions into CS ciphertext, ensuring the secure transmission of encryption keys for sensitive regions. Additionally, our solution can provide personalized access control mechanisms based on the permission levels of different authorized users and offer customized image recovery quality according to their specific requirements. This effectively addresses the potential privacy leakage risks associated with cross-departmental image sharing, ensuring the security of data transmission and sharing processes. Under consistent experimental conditions, our proposed solution demonstrates a minimum 1.5% improvement in reconstruction quality compared to existing methods. In the security analysis, we further demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides differential reconstruction quality and high-security strength for staff members with different permissions.

Here, we report a sky recognition algorithm based on a region prior approach to reduce the influence of the reflected light. Furthermore, to solve the sun fuzzy problem, a morphometric template matching in transform domain (MTMTD) strategy is proposed based on the angle of polarization (AOP). The application scope and practicability of the method are improved effectively by using all the effective pixels as a navigation unit. In addition, this method turns these pixels into curves, which means that even when only one pixel is observed, the sun fuzzy problem can be solved exactly. Our results efficiently verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy, which may provide an interesting solution for heading measurement of intelligent vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation (UDASS) methods aim to learn domain-invariant information for alleviating the distribution shift problem between the source and target domains. However, ignoring the learning of domain-specific information that is label-related may limit the class discriminability on the target domain. We argue that a good representation for the UDASS task not only contains domain-invariant information but also preserves label-related domain-specific information. In this paper, a novel frequency spectrum domain adaptation approach via meta-learning (ML-FSDA) is proposed to achieve this goal for improving the class discriminability and generalization ability. ML-FSDA contains a frequency-spectrum meta-learning framework (FMF) and a class-aware domain-specific memory bank (CDMB). Specifically, first, inspired by the observation that the high-frequency component is consistent across different domains while the low-frequency component is much more domain-specific, the FMF aims to respectively learn label-related domain-specific and domain-invariant information from low-frequency and high-frequency images in a unified framework via the meta-learning strategy. Second, the CDMB is designed to preserve the label-related domain-specific information of each class in an external memory bank while the CDMB is updated in every iteration of the meta-training stage. Finally, the CDMB is utilized to embed the label-related domain-specific information into domain-invariant information at the class level during the meta-testing stage to enhance the class discriminability on the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ML-FSDA on two challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks. Notably, for the GTA5 to Cityscapes task and the SYNTHIA to Cityscapes task, the proposed ML-FSDA achieves superior performance with 77.3% mIoU and 68.8% mIoU, respectively.

  abstract     = {The explainability of complex machine-learning models is becoming increasingly significant in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this context, counterfactual explanation (CE), as an effective explainability method in explainable artificial intelligence, plays an important role. It aims to identify minimal alterations to input that can change the model’s output, thereby revealing key factors influencing model decisions. However, generating counterfactual samples might involve manually selecting input features, potentially leading to suboptimal and biased explanations. This study introduces a feature contribution guided CE generation framework to address this issue. Our method utilizes feature contributions based on Shapley values to guide the model’s focus on the most influential features. This enables end-users to quickly pinpoint the search direction in generating CEs (e.g., prioritizing the most critical features) and producing representative CEs. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we conducted experimental validation on two representative machine learning models: autonomous driving decision-making using Deep Q-Network and lane-changing prediction using deep learning. In addition, we conducted a user-centered study to evaluate the practical applicability of the SVCE in autonomous driving scenarios, which serves as a crucial validation of the presented SVCE. The results show that SVCE can help users understand and diagnose the model.},

  abstract     = {Lane-level positioning is a critical technology for supporting assisted driving and autonomous driving applica- tions. However, the Global Navigation Satellite System often falls short in providing reliable positioning (GNSS) due to signal attenuation, obstructions, and multipath in urban areas. Fortunately, typical challenging urban environments, such as tunnels and viaducts, create rich magnetic field features due to abundant ferromagnetic structures, offering an opportunity for magnetic field matching methods to achieve high-precision positioning. This paper presents a novel magnetic field matching/GNSS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) fusion algorithm designed for continuous lane-level positioning in complex environments using cost-effective sensors and computation-saving algorithm. Based on the traditional GNSS/INS tight integration algorithm, this research ensures the performance of the positioning system by enhancing the magnetic field matching and fusion positioning algorithms. First, a coarse-fine magnetic profile matching method is proposed to address the accuracy degradation resulting from the travel distance error of INS-derived trajectory. Second, the magnetic field matching position updates are performed in the vehicle frame, which enables more precise position error modeling. The proposed solution is evaluated through five field tests, covering over 200 kilometers of challenging urban roads. The results demonstrate mean CDF95 position errors of 2.09 m, 1.09 m, and 0.87 m in the forward, lateral, and vertical directions, respectively, and 94.67% accuracy on lane-determination.},

  abstract     = {Existing studies on Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) primarily focus on regular vehicles (e.g., cars), while ignoring bus priority demands. This paper aims to optimize the bus operations at autonomous intersection with trajectory planning and priority control. First, an intersection trajectory planning approach is proposed for turning movements within the intersection considering significant passenger volume and large size of buses. A two-stage trajectory planning method is adopted that employs a combination of transition and circular curves to ensure the smooth turning movements for vehicles within the intersection. Next, a bus priority control model for autonomous intersection (AIM-BP) is developed to minimize weighted combinations of total bus delay and car delay. In particular, the model incorporates the introduction of the dynamic bus lane designed to clear the vehicles in front of buses, thereby creating a relatively exclusive space for the buses. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes the lane choice on the road section, the route choice within the intersection and the time to enter the intersection for each vehicle, while determining whether to deploy the dynamic bus lane and which lane serves as the dynamic bus lane in the approach. The model is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, compiled in AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) and solved by CPLEX. Results demonstrate significant reductions in average bus delay and passenger delay under the proposed model, and sensitivity analysis further examines its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Traffic sign boards are vital in facilitating smart transportation systems. More than 90% of accidents happen due to drivers’ inattentiveness over these boards. Hence, relaying traffic sign board information automatically to drivers becomes crucial to avoid such accidents. While numerous traffic sign detection and classification systems exist, it is important to note that these automated systems have not been adequately assessed within the context of Indian settings. The task of traffic sign detection and classification presents unique challenges in the Indian context due to the presence of multiple variations of signboards for a single action (e.g., left turn and right turn). This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture for detecting and classifying traffic signboards simultaneously. In the proposed architecture, several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks such as AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet v2 are used as a backbone to solve the task of bounding box regression and sign classification. Along with the proposed method, we collected the Indian traffic signs and information boards dataset. The collected dataset consists of 4257 raw images without any augmentation. We comprehensively evaluated the proposed algorithm on the collected dataset, resulting in the detection and classification accuracies of 85.5% and 98.5%, respectively. The proposed algorithm has also been evaluated on the existing traffic sign recognition dataset, and a comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms is done for both traffic sign detection and classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multi-task network.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel framework for traffic parameters estimation at signalized intersections with partial vehicle trajectory data, namely the Iterative Partial Backpropagation Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IPB-MLE) framework. The framework utilizes analytical approximations of the Poisson distribution, which enables the joint likelihood of the observed trajectories to be continuous and differentiable, hence providing better convergence results. The traffic parameters, including the Poisson parameter for the number of incoming vehicles, the free pace mean and variance, and the residual queue length, are optimized by maximizing the joint likelihood using a gradient-based algorithm with the Adam optimizer. The Iterative Backpropagation (IB) approach utilized in this framework allows for flexibility in the problem formulation. As shown in the experiments, the IPB-MLE framework yields good accuracies and robustness in satisfactory computational times. Empirical experiments further show that at least two trajectories are needed for guaranteed convergence, which implies that data volume is also a critical criterion (apart from penetration rate) for accuracy. Estimations take on average 10 to 20 seconds, respectively, for unsaturated and saturated cycles at a 20% penetration rate, and the framework has a linear computational complexity with respect to the number of variables and data points, making it suitable for online or real-time estimation. Moreover, the IPB-MLE framework can be easily extended to more complex situations by incorporating simulation models or neural networks to approximate the travel time distributions. These features of the IPB-MLE framework offer it great potential for more complex and realistic situations.},

To maximize the short-time output efficiency of PPLs in emergency situations, the aperiodic scheduling method is studied, aiming at optimizing the coordination of multiple PPLs and energy storage. The proposed aperiodic scheduling model aims to maximize the total utility of PPLs in the given period. The model fully considers constraints related to energy storage, system power balance, aperiodic charging and discharging process, time sequence, and charging power. To solve this complex non-linear model, a bi-layer dynamic programming algorithm is proposed. Simulation tests of SIPS performance are carried out to validate the advantage of the proposed method.

To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with tabu search for solving the above DPDPs. First, our algorithm leverages multiobjectivization and reformulates the DPDP as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), which is further decomposed into multiple subproblems. Then, these subproblems are approached simultaneously and collaboratively by using a crossover process to enhance the diversity of the solutions, followed by using an efficient tabu search to speed up the convergence. In this way, our algorithm can better balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation for solving this MOP, and then one promising solution can be selected from the population to complete some pickup and delivery tasks in an interval of the DPDP. Simulation results on 64 test problems from a practical scenario of Huawei demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms for tackling DPDPs. Additionally, more experiments are conducted on 20 large-scale distribution problems within JD Logistics to validate the generalization capability of our algorithm.},

To economize the communication resources, the dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is designed in the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels respectively. By adopting the approximation of fuzzy systems in the form of one-parameter integrated learning, the uncertainties consisted of the unmoulded structure and unknown sea loads are compressed together to be compensated online, which ensures a lower computational cost. To solve the multiple obstacles, the modified artificial potential field approach is employed, and the derived repulsive potential field can ensure that the multi-AUV formation can avoid obstacles smoothly regardless of static or moving obstacles. It is showed by the Lyapunov stability theorem that the tracking errors are guaranteed to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, three simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), edge caching has gradually emerged as a critical technology to reduce transmission delay and optimize network load. However, the limited storage capacity and service scope of individual cache servers significantly degrade the performance of edge caching. To address this issue, we propose a social-aware assisted edge collaborative caching algorithm based on Dueling Double Deep Q-Network and Digital Twin Network (SACTD-D3). The algorithm can dynamically adjust the caching decision based on the similarity of user semantic information and the availability of edge services to fully utilize the caching capacity of edge servers. Firstly, vehicle clusters are formed based on users’ semantic similarity, and an on-board cloud is constructed to reduce user request delay by sinking edge services. Secondly, based on the establishment of the three-layer structure of macro base station, roadside units and on-board cloud, the content heat-based caching decision policy is utilized to effectively improve the content cache hit rate. Moreover, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the overall utility of the system subject to transmission delay and system cost, and thus the optimal solution is obtained using the proposed $\varepsilon $ -greedy SACTD-D3 algorithm. Furthermore, due to the dynamic complexity of the network topology, digital twin is used to simplify and map the network topology into digital twin networks for analysis and processing to improve network efficiency. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the system performance. Compared with Double DQN, Dueling DQN and DQN, the proposed SACTD-D3 algorithm reduces the request delay by 2.62%, 3.06% and 3.95%, and reduces the energy cost by 26.07%, 47.05% and 49.90%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The presence of multiple generator units (GUs) in the hybrid electric propulsion system (HEPS) of flying cars poses higher requirements for the design of energy management strategy (EMS) since the decision made by one GU impacts the state and decisions of others due to the coupling electrical dynamics of the system. In this paper, a data-driven cooperative differential game (CDG) based EMS is proposed to improve the performance of the fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of those GUs as well as the stability of the state of charge (SOC) of the battery through coordination and cooperation. The energy management problem is first formulated as a general two-player differential game. To improve the computational efficiency as well as the control performance, a novel neural network-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is proposed to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) and Pareto solution (PS) of the non-cooperative differential game (NCDG) and CDG During real-time application, and a comparison mechanism is designed so that the solution with a smaller cost is applied to the system to further improve performance. The simulation results indicate that the proposed CDG-based EMS can not only reduce the equivalent fuel consumption by 2.67% and 6.22% compared with that of NCDG and rule-based EMS, but also obtain a better overall and individual performance of the two GUs simultaneously, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the fuel consumption, EGT as well as maintaining the state of charge (SOC) of the battery.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the adverse effect of high-frequency output power fluctuation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) on its operational performance, this work proposes a virtual inertia-based control (VIC) method for the hybrid powertrain of HEVs with the PEMFC and battery, which is derived from the dynamic behavior of synchronous generators. The VIC is employed as the primary layer to control the PEMFC output power, and a VIC-based power management strategy (VIC-PMS) is also proposed as the upper layer to distribute the power flow of the hybrid powertrain. The VIC can restrain the high-frequency fluctuation of the output power of the PEMFC so that it only has to afford low-frequency power, while the battery is passively subjected to high-frequency power. Furthermore, the output or input impedance model of each unit is developed, and then the stability analysis of the system by utilizing the impedance stability criterion is implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed VIC and VIC-PMS is verified by the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform. The results are that the VIC can restrain the PEMFC high-frequency power fluctuation successfully, and the VIC-PMS can manage the power distribution of the hybrid powertrain effectively.},

However, the utilization of such data raises privacy concerns, enabling potential attackers to gain insights into users’ real-time activities and personal information. Furthermore, existing privacy preservation methods have multiple limitations, particularly in low-traffic density environments. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach for generating realistic trajectories that evade tracking. Existing trajectory generation mechanisms are coarse-grained and cannot adequately preserve the quality of location-based services while safeguarding individual privacy. To overcome this limitation, we first use differential privacy to determine a location near the actual destination and employ a path search algorithm to extract relevant road information. Subsequently, by leveraging our hybrid reinforcement learning model, we generate trajectories leading to this fictitious point. The comparison conducted on real-world maps with other trajectory generation methods reveals its superior ability to preserve spatio-temporal features. Finally, we propose two approaches that use the generated trajectories to protect privacy, ensuring both individual privacy protection and the utility of data.},

The road damage objects in the front-view images have the characteristics of complex background, multi-scale and large aspect ratio, which greatly increase the difficulty of detection. We propose an anchor-free road damage detection model YOLOX-RDD for front-view images. YOLOX is used as the basic network and three optimization strategies are implemented according to the characteristics of road damage objects. The refined switchable atrous convolution (RSAC) is used to adaptively adjust the receptive field according to the size of the object, which can satisfy the requirements of the detection of the damages of multi-scale and large aspect ratio. For unobvious road damage detection in complex background, four feature enhancement attention (FEA) modules are added to the network to extract more salient information and enhance the fusion effect. Two-level adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) is performed by fusing dark2 with the three output feature maps of neck respectively, and the optimal fusion weights are learned through training to further improve the detection capability of multi-scale objects. The experiments on CNRDD, RDD2020 and USRDD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization of our method. Compared with the baseline model, the mAP @0.5 can be improved by up to 2.78%, and ${F}1$ -Score can be improved by up to 2.55%.

To overcome these challenges and to produce realistic images, we implemented a new approach called the Evolutionary Perceptual Quality Assessment Generative Adversarial Network (EPQ-GAN). The EPQ-GAN comprises a novel Evolutionary Generator and Discriminator. The Evolutionary training of the Generator can improve generative performance; hence, to train the Evolutionary Generator, the proposed method adopted the Differential evolution (DE) algorithm and the entire GAN network is trained with Perceptual loss from the discriminator, quality assessment loss (PSNR Loss) and adversarial loss.

Optical camera communications (OCC) via modulated taillights of the leading vehicle and a front-facing camera of the follower is utilized to transmit a verification key. In the footage of the receiving camera, both the transmitted verification key and the transmitting vehicle are visible and can be associated. If the car in front is able to transmit a valid verification key, the platoon can be built. In this article, a comprehensive evaluation of vehicular OCC is presented. The system is tested in different configurations on public roads with various environmental conditions. This platoon verification mechanism takes less than 10 seconds, even in challenging conditions, e.g., in rain, darkness, or low sun. The experiments demonstrate that modern vehicles are equipped with all hardware components required to implement this OCC system by using the built-in front camera of a Tesla Model 3 as receiver without any modifications.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) semantic segmentation aims to assign a predetermined semantic label to every single pixel of the unannotated target data by exploiting a model that is trained on the labeled source data. Numerous current methods only display concern for grouping similar features together but ignore dispersing those features across various classes, so that some feature representations can not be well-separated. Therefore, we propose to employ contrastive learning (CL) method to increase the similarity of pixel features, propelling similar features closer and dispelling different ones far away. Furthermore, due to the domain shift, the UDA model frequently has poor generalization on the target domain. Accordingly, we design an optimal transport (OT) module to enhance UDA by comparing and aligning sample distributions to minimize transport loss between them. By taking advantage of this, the domain shift can be efficaciously mitigated by bringing the target probability distribution closer to that of the source. Specially, due to its simplicity, our OT module can be integrated into various UDA methods. In light of the aforementioned viewpoints, we put forth an ingenious approach, named OTCLDA, which successfully combines OT and CL while enhancing the performance of the UDA model. Multitudinous experiments demonstrate the importance of our method involving OT and CL. It significantly gains mIoU of 75.1% on benchmark GTA $\rightarrow $ Cityscapes, and 66.9% on SYNTHIA $\rightarrow $ Cityscapes respectively, displaying a competitive performance compared with previous works.

  abstract     = {Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) has undergone gradual development and found widespread application. However, existing VSLAM systems predominantly rely on static environment assumptions, leading to diminished robustness and localization accuracy in the presence of dynamic elements. Previous research has primarily employed geometric and semantic constraints to address dynamic regions of the scene. Nevertheless, their efficacy is limited in complex dynamic scenarios involving non-rigid objects, non-predefined motion targets, and low dynamic motion targets. Furthermore, the majority of dynamic SLAM methods are predominantly designed for indoor RGBD environments, resulting in a lack of generalizability. In this paper, a dynamic SLAM method that combines instance segmentation and optical flow called RSO-SLAM is proposed. RSO-SLAM is designed to operate effectively in diverse complex motion scenarios, both indoors and outdoors, and supports various visual sensor modes, including monocular, stereo, and RGBD setups. The proposed approach amalgamates semantic information and optical flow data by employing a “KMC:k-means + connectivity” based algorithm for motion region detection within the scene. Furthermore, it integrates an optical flow attenuation propagation strategy to facilitate meticulous motion probability computations and inter-frame propagation within each identified region. Our methodology’s superiority over existing dynamic SLAM approaches is firmly established through comprehensive evaluations across a diverse range of intricate dynamic scenarios. These evaluations encompass various conditions of high and low dynamism in both indoor and outdoor environments, accompanied by rigorous ablation experiments and real-world assessments. RSO-SLAM exhibits enhanced robustness and higher localization accuracy, rendering it well-suited for nearly all dynamic environments.},

For this reason, this paper investigates the tracking control problem for the train under coupler displacement constraints. Firstly, by considering the security constraints and multiple disturbances, a multiple point-mass model of the train containing coupler displacements is established. Then, a disturbance observer is introduced to eliminate the adverse effects of complex disturbances on train operation, thereby improving the train’s anti-disturbance capability. With the help of Lyapunov stability analysis, a new upper bound of observer estimation error is developed. Next, an input compensation signal is designed to address the issues of the coupler constraints and the low control accuracy based on disturbance observer. The state deviations of the train system caused by the disturbances can be almost completely compensated by the input compensation controller. Finally, a sufficient condition is provided to ensure that the coupler constraints are not violated throughout the entire train operation. Even if the couplers are stretched or compressed under the initial condition, the compensation signal could still ensure that the couplers work safely. Simulation experiments confirm that the designed compound controller can ensure the coupler always satisfies the constraint condition and effectively suppresses external disturbances, achieving safe and high-precision tracking control of the train.},

Due to the presence of low-light conditions, vehicles are typically indistinguishable from the background, and interference from light sources often arises in this complex environment. Existing widely used deep learning-based object detection models are designed for daytime scenarios and they have seldom considered these problems. Based on an investigation of current detection techniques and an analysis of the specific challenges of night-time vehicle detection, we propose a hierarchical contextual information (HCI) framework that can be used as a plug-and-play component to improve existing deep learning-based detection models under night-time conditions. Our HCI consists of three parts, an estimation branch, a segmentation branch and a detection branch, and can be applied to excavate hierarchical contextual clues and fuse them for the detection of vehicles in night-time environments. In each module, the context and predictions are extracted at the image-level, the pixel-level, and the object-level, respectively, and the results from each are complementary and beneficial to each other. Comprehensive experiments on two scenes from the Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset are presented to demonstrate the flexibility and generalization ability of our HCI. The significant improvements offered by HCI over main-stream detectors such as YOLOX, Faster RCNN, SSD, and EfficientDet also highlight the effectiveness of our approach for night-time vehicle detection.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been increasingly adopted for travel demand forecasting. The AI-based travel demand forecasting models, though generate accurate predictions, may produce prediction biases and raise fairness issues. Using such biased models for decision-making may lead to transportation policies that exacerbate social inequalities. However, limited studies have been focused on addressing the fairness issues of these models. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel methodology to develop fairness-aware, highly-accurate travel demand forecasting models. Particularly, the proposed methodology can enhance the fairness of AI models for multiple protected attributes (such as race and income) simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a new fairness regularization term, which is explicitly designed to measure the correlation between prediction accuracy and multiple protected attributes, into the loss function of the travel demand forecasting model. We conduct two case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using real-world ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago, IL and Austin, TX, respectively. Results highlight that our proposed methodology can effectively enhance fairness for multiple protected attributes while preserving prediction accuracy. Additionally, we have compared our methodology with three state-of-the-art methods that adopt the regularization term approach, and the results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them in both preserving prediction accuracy and enhancing fairness. This study can provide transportation professionals with a new tool to achieve fair and accurate travel demand forecasting.},

  abstract     = {While recent advancements in deep-learning point cloud upsampling methods have improved the input to intelligent transportation systems, they still suffer from issues of domain dependency between synthetic and real-scanned point clouds. This paper addresses the above issues by proposing a new ray-based upsampling approach with an arbitrary rate, where a depth prediction is made for each query ray and its corresponding patch. Our novel method simulates the sphere-tracing ray marching algorithm on the neural implicit surface defined with an unsigned distance function (UDF) to achieve more precise and stable ray-depth predictions by training a point-transformer-based network. The rule-based mid-point query sampling method generates more evenly distributed points without requiring an end-to-end model trained using a nearest-neighbor-based reconstruction loss function, which may bias towards the training dataset. Self-supervised learning becomes possible with accurate ground truths within the input point cloud. The results demonstrate the method’s versatility across domains and training scenarios with limited computational resources and training data. Comprehensive analyses of synthetic and real-scanned applications provide empirical evidence for the significance of the upsampling task across the computer vision and graphics domains to real-world applications of ITS.},

  abstract     = {An integrated container scheduling problem (ICSP) is a significant challenge to improve the overall efficiency of (un)loading, transshipment, and reduce energy consumption in container terminals. In this study, we address a ICSP with two transshipment routes (ICSP_TR) for sea-road containers. First, a multi-objective optimization mathematical model is formulated for the ICSP_TR. The objectives are to minimize the maximum completion time, the total load waiting time of automatic guided vehicles (AGVs), and the total energy consumption of quay cranes (QCs) and yard cranes (YCs). Second, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (INSGAII) is proposed to solve the ICSP_TR. The order crossover and two-point mutation are employed for container sequence. A following rule is designed for transshipment routes and external trucks. The early complete time rule is adopted in equipment allocation to configure QCs, AGVs, and YCs. Third, an external archive technology and a variable neighborhood local search strategy are developed to improve the exploitation ability. Finally, 80 instances based on ICSP_TR and the single route ICSP are solved, respectively. Two storage situations of containers are compared between ICSP_TR and the single route ICSP. The results based on ICSP_TR show higher feasibility and effectiveness for hybrid transshipment. Furthermore, the results of the algorithm analysis show that INSGAII outperforms the original NSGAII and two other prominent multi-objective algorithms in convergence, diversity, and distribution for the ICSP_TR. Moreover, experimental results verify that INSGAII is capable of generating higher-quality scheduling schemes, offering container terminal managers a broader array of superior options.},

Firstly, the structure of system composed of cloud servers, eavesdroppers, and the vehicular platoon with unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbance is established. Secondly, to restrain the uncertainty and nonlinearity, a policy iteration algorithm integrating quantized control inputs is proposed to stabilize vehicles without knowing their dynamics. The optimality and convergence of the iteration are proved rigorously. Then, the algorithm is utilized by the actor-critic framework with quantized states and control inputs. Due to the reason that conventional distributed control approaches for platoon will inevitably leak privacy, by introducing leveled fully homomorphic encryption, the actor-critic framework is modified to work in a privacy- preserving manner, and the privacy of each vehicle is protected from unauthorized entities. Finally, the comparison results demonstrate that with proposed scheme, the average instant cost of each vehicle is improved (at least 56.52% under experiment condition) and the stability, efficiency and security of system with proposed method are verified by simulations.},

This paper introduces a novel cross-domain batch authentication scheme for VANETs, denominated as CD-BASA, leveraging blockchain technology in conjunction with accumulator. The CD-BASA scheme is built upon blockchain with accumulator and interplanetary file systems for streamlined storage and batch computation. Subsequently, a proficient cross-domain batch authentication protocol for CD-BASA is devised, encompassing the establishment of domain-specific and global parameters, which greatly reduces the identity verification cost for multiple vehicles. To further minimize the overhead associated with batch validity proofing, a novel multi-accumulator batch proof algorithm is designed to greatly reduce the proof cost of multiple vehicle identities. Experimental evaluations and theoretical security analysis show that CD-BASA has better performance than other existing schemes, in terms of cross-domain batch authentication overhead (improving at least 18.2%) and accumulator proof overhead (reducing at least 69.9%).},

  abstract     = {Recognizing driver speed intention such as acceleration and deceleration is of great significance for intelligent assisted driving systems, drive energy management, and gear decision of automatic transmissions, among other applications. However, existing studies have mainly focused on recognizing only a few typical speed intentions. They have not adequately considered the effects of various factors of the driving environment, including road slopes, curves, as well as other critical factors like lane changes and vehicle gears, on intention recognition. To address this gap, this study comprehensively categorizes speed intentions and establishes a speed intention recognition model that considers the influence of these factors. First, naturalistic driving data is collected to ensure the robustness and practicality of the model. To integrate the effects of the driving environment into speed intention recognition, the road slope and turning/lane-changing operations of the driver are extracted from driving data. Furthermore, the speed intention is comprehensively categorized. The effects of road slope, vehicle gear, and turning/lane changing on the intention recognition are analyzed separately, and the Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering algorithm is used to label the driving data while considering these effects. Finally, a supervised feature selection algorithm is used to select intention recognition features, and a deep-learning-based hierarchical recognition model is established for speed intentions. Validation results indicate that the constructed intention recognition model exhibits excellent recognition performance and satisfies the requirements for real-time recognition.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) need to obtain real-time traffic data from nearby ICVs or remote content providers to ensure safe driving. However, providers are hesitant to share their data due to privacy and benefits concerns. To ensure privacy while improving efficiency of obtaining data, we proposed smart contract-based data sharing among ICVs, and content delivery between ICVs and remote content provider. To solve low willingness to vehicles due to untrustworthy third-party platforms, we use smart contracts to implement access control during data upload and transaction. Then, we propose a one-to-many sharing model based on Stackelberg game to model the interaction between consumers and owners. Consumers adjust their reward strategies with the owners’ optimal strategies to maximize its utility, thus obtaining the nash equilibrium solution. To provide reliable quality of service (QoS) and security guarantee for content delivery, smart contracts regulate the delivery process, facilitating automatic execution under specific conditions. Transaction records audited and stored on blockchain enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Utilizing a delivery utility model that considers benefits, costs, and mining profits, proposed quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. We built an EdgeChain testbed, and used BDD-100K dataset to evaluate the performance in utility, access delay, etc. Compared to CTM and MFPA, proposed data sharing algorithm achieves maximum consumer utility. Compared to LRU, PCCM and MARL, when content is 400, proposed content delivery algorithm reduces average access delay by 30.88%, 18.92% and 4.86%, and reduce backhaul load by 50.04%, 47.23% and 3.16%.},

  abstract     = {The end-to-end driving models (E2EDMs) convert environmental information into driving actions using a complex transformation which makes E2EDMs have high prediction accuracy. Due to the black-box nature of transformation, the E2EDMs have low explainability. To solve this problem, explanation methods are used to generate explanations for observation. Based on current explanation methods, previous studies tried to further improve the explainability of E2EDMs by integrating an object detection module, however, these methods have many problems: Firstly, due to the requirement of the object detection module, they lack flexibility. Secondly, they neglect an essential property, i.e., simplicity, to improve explainability. In this paper, since humans prefer object-level and simple explanations in driving tasks, we argue that explainability is decided by two properties which are the objectification degree (the extent to which driving related-object features are utilized) and simplification degree (the simplicity of the explanation), thus we propose Simplified Objectification Branches (SOB) to improve the explainability of E2EDMs. Firstly, this structure could be integrated into any existing E2EDMs and thus have high flexibility. Secondly, the SOB explicitly improves the simplification degree without sacrificing the objectification degree of the explanations. By designing several indicators, i.e., heatmap satisfaction, driving action reproduction score, deception level, etc., we proved that SOB could help E2EDMs generate better explanations. Notably, the SOB could also further enhance E2EDMs’ prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in IoV, which has been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection methods mostly rely on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive data obtained by edge devices needs to be uploaded to the server, which raises latency and privacy issues. To tackle these issues, we propose to accomplish object detection through sparse federated training with dynamic model aggregation, namely FedWeg, to reduce the communication cost and privacy leakage induced by data transmission. Specifically, FedWeg performs sparse training in edge devices and uploads the lightweight models to the server. To reduce the unnecessary transmission overhead, we propose a dynamic sparsity adjustment scheme that gradually increases the sparsity ratios. Then, we propose to utilize the inverse ratio of sparsity ratios from different edge devices to calculate aggregate weights to diminish the negative impact of sparse training on learning performance. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the convergence rate of FedWeg, which reveals that the impact of network sparsity on model performance, and higher average sparsity rates result in greater errors. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-life datasets using YOLOv3 and VGG-16. The results show that our FedWeg algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of communication costs and test accuracy.},

This study infers the trip purpose of public transportation users using a novel method. This method considers both discrete and continuous trip attributes to create a multi-dimensional signal of daily trips for each individual. This signal is an invertible function of independent attributes. In this study, each trip attribute is converted into a dimension of the trip signal. Signals are then clustered to the separated groups using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Time Warping methods. After the clustering, each new passenger is allocated to the closest cluster to predict the purpose of his/her daily trips. Also, a probabilistic approach, which can estimate the percentage of trip purposes for all passengers in a specific area, is used to discover the proportion of each trip purpose among all transportation users in an area. This probabilistic method is shown to increase the total accuracy of purpose inference. This study is implemented on the Household Travel Survey and the smart card data of South East Queensland, Australia. Evaluation outcomes indicated that the proposed method significantly improved the trip purpose inference accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fast LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) that is robust to aggressive motion. To achieve robust tracking in aggressive motion scenes, we exploit the continuous scanning property of LiDAR to adaptively divide the full scan into multiple partial scans (named sub-frames) according to the motion intensity. And to avoid the degradation of sub-frames resulting from insufficient constraints, we propose a robust state estimation method based on a tightly-coupled iterated error state Kalman smoother (ESKS) framework. Furthermore, we propose a robocentric voxel map (RC-Vox) to improve the system’s efficiency. The RC-Vox allows efficient maintenance of map points and k nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries by mapping local map points into a fixed-size, two-layer 3D array structure. Extensive experiments are conducted on 27 sequences from 4 public datasets, our own dataset and real-world scenes. The results show that our system can achieve stable tracking in aggressive motion scenes (angular velocity up to 21.8 rad/s) that cannot be handled by other state-of-the-art methods, while our system can achieve competitive performance with these methods in general scenes. Furthermore, thanks to the RC-Vox, our system is much faster than the most efficient LIO system currently published.},

Next, a braking force distribution strategy is proposed and applied to ensure the vehicle braking performance. Then, considering vehicle endurance mileage, braking stability, and braking safety, a new hierarchical control structure is designed, which includes upper-level controller and lower-level controller. In the upper-level controller, a direct yaw torque control method is proposed to improve vehicle stability. In the lower-level controller, an electrical braking force adjustment strategy based on multi-objective optimization is proposed considering regenerative braking energy, vehicle yaw rate, and braking distance, and the adjustment coefficients of electrical braking force are optimized via genetic algorithm. The weight factors of the proposed strategy are defined by analytic hierarchy process.

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) with abundant spectrum resources can realize high-rate communications in vehicular networks. However, the mobility of vehicles and the blocking effect of mmWave propagation bring new challenges to communication security. Cooperative communication is envisioned as a promising physical layer security (PLS) approach to enhance the secrecy performance, but it will induce extra energy consumption of vehicles. This paper proposes a deep recurrent reinforcement learning (DRRL)-based energy-efficient cooperative secure transmission scheme in mmWave vehicular networks, where eavesdropping vehicles attempt to intercept the multi-user downlink communications. We jointly design the mmWave beam allocation, the cooperative nodes selection, and the transmit power of vehicles. Specifically, the mmWave base station selects idle vehicles as relays to overcome the severe blocking attenuation of legitimate transmissions and controls the transmit power to reduce energy consumption. Moreover, to ensure secure transmission, a cooperative vehicle is selected to transmit jamming signals to the eavesdropping vehicles while the legitimate users are not disturbed. We conduct comprehensive interference analysis for both direct transmission and relay-aided transmission, and derive the theoretical expressions for the secrecy capacity. We then design the Dueling Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (D3RQN) learning algorithm to maximize the total secrecy capacity subject to the energy consumption constraint. We set the energy consumption punishment mechanism to avoid relay vehicles consuming too much power for forwarding signals. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can rapidly adapt to the highly dynamic vehicular networks and effectively improve secrecy performance while reducing the energy consumption of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimation of the State of Charge (SoC) of Li-Ion batteries is crucial for secure and efficient energy consumption in electric vehicles (EVs). Traditional SoC estimation methods often require expert knowledge of battery chemistry and suffer from limited accuracy due to complex non-linear battery behaviour. Owing to the model-free nature and enhanced ability of non-linear regression in deep learning (DL), this paper proposes a hybrid DL model trained by a novel metaheuristic technique, namely the Hybrid Sine Cosine Firehawk Algorithm (HSCFHA). The proposed method utilises the Transductive Transfer Learning (TTL) technique to leverage the intrinsic relationship between different real-world datasets to estimate the SoC of batteries accurately. The evaluation analysis includes three diverse datasets of EV charging drive cycles: the Highway Fuel Economy Test Cycle (HWFET), Highway Driving Schedule (US06) and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), at various temperatures of 0°C, 10°C, and 25°C. The considered evaluation metrics, i.e., Normal Mean Squared Error (NMSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and $R^{2}$ , achieve values of 0.091%, 0.087%, and 99.51%, respectively. The TTL-HSCFHA-DNN effectively produces higher accuracy with a time-efficient convergence rate, compared to existing methods. The approach enables EV systems to operate more efficiently with improved battery life.},

  abstract     = {UAVs can collect vehicle data in high-altitude scenes, playing a significant role in intelligent urban management due to their wide of view. Nevertheless, the current datasets for UAV-based vehicle detection are acquired at altitude below 150 meters. This contrasts with the data perspective obtained from high-altitude scenes, potentially leading to incongruities in data distribution. Consequently, it is challenging to apply these datasets effectively in high-altitude scenes, and there is an ongoing obstacle. To resolve this challenge, we developed a comprehensive vehicle dataset named LH-UAV-Vehicle, specifically collected at flight altitudes ranging from 250 to 400 meters. Collecting data at higher flight altitudes offers a broader perspective, but it concurrently introduces complexity and diversity in the background, which consequently impacts vehicle localization and recognition accuracy. In response, we proposed the pyramid dual pooling attention path aggregation network (PDPA-PAN), an innovative framework that improves detection performance in high-altitude scenes by combining spatial and semantic information. Object attention integration in both spatial and channel dimensions is aimed by the pyramid dual pooling attention module (PDPAM), which is achieved through the parallel integration of two distinct attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we have individually developed the pyramid pooling attention module (PPAM) and the dual pooling attention module (DPAM). The PPAM emphasizes channel attention, while the DPAM prioritizes spatial attention. This design aims to enhance vehicle information and suppress background interference more effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the LH-UAV-Vehicle conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed vehicle detection method.

  abstract     = {In intercity high-speed railways (HSR) with high speeds and dense traffic, fast decision-making in timetable rescheduling is critical to minimize delays and maintain regular services during disruptions. Different from traditional mathematical programming methods, which are often too computation-intensive for real-time implementation, this paper develops a state-space dynamic model of train traffic with the extension to accommodate multiple trains in the sections between stations. Variations of the state space model are established for scenarios of mild delays and severe delays, respectively. Two automatic rescheduling state feedback controllers are designed to achieve two objectives, to restore the nominal timetable in case of mild delays and to retain regular departure intervals in case of severe delays, respectively. Stability analysis theoretically proves the stability and convergence of the proposed feedback controller and real-time rescheduling algorithm. The proposed rescheduling method indeed is a real-time state feedback controller, and the simulation results of the Beijing-Tianjin intercity HSR show that the proposed method features negligible computation times in the order of microseconds, in contrast to the 56s and 65s required by conventional Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) for nominal timetable recovery and regular departure interval problems, respectively. The proposed state-space feedback control rescheduling method is quasi-optimal compared to MIP with the added advantage of greater computational efficiency and fast decision-making.},

The Reinforcement Learning paradigm has been successfully employed in the longitudinal spacing control of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control systems, but ensuring disturbance rejection remains a challenge. Characteristics such as uncertain parameters in the formation and external interference may imposed constant errors, preventing the agents from reaching the desired formation when traveling at cruising speed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new training model for platooning, such that the acceleration command of each agent provides a stable formation, according to the nonlinear control formalism. The design methodology is general enough to be applied across multiple topologies. Also, the outputs of the controllers design by ML have a term with integral action capabilities, enabling corrective actions to withstand uncertainties that are constant. The effectiveness of our proposal has been illustrated with experiments using different network topologies, uncertain parameters, and external forces. Comparative analyses were conducted against the state-of-the-art, whose findings offer new insights concerning the generalization and robustness of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the control of autonomous platoons.},

However, traditional sensing methods, such as inductive loop sensors, roadside cameras, and crowdsourcing data from massive urban travelers (e.g., Google Maps), are often hindered by high costs, limited coverage, and low reliability. This study explores the potential of drive-by sensing, an innovative approach that employs large-scale ridesourcing vehicles (RVs) for urban road network monitoring. We first evaluate RV sensing performance by coverage and reliability through historical road segment visits. Next, we propose an optimal trip-based RV rerouting model to maximize the sensing coverage and reliability while preserving the same level of service for the RVs’ mobility service. Furthermore, a scalable column generation-based heuristic is designed to guide the cruising trajectory of RVs, assuming trip independence. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through experiments and sensitivity analyses using real-world RV trajectory data of over 20,000 vehicles in New York City. The optimized rerouting strategy has yielded significantly improved results, elevating explicit sensing coverage of the road network by 15.0% to 17.3% (varies by time of day) and achieving an impressive enhancement in sensing reliability by at least 24.6% compared to historical records. Expanding the path-searching space further improved sensing coverage of up to 4.5% and reliability of over 4.2%. Moreover, considering incentives for RV drivers, the enhanced sensing performance comes at a remarkably low cost of ${\$}$ 0.10 per RV driver, highlighting its cost-effectiveness.},

Combining the two types is challenging as they exhibit significant differences such as very different sampling rates. This paper focuses on the TMR task and proposes an approach for combining the two types of signals in an effective and robust classifier. Our network includes two sub-networks for processing acceleration and location signals separately, using different window sizes for each signal. The two sub-networks are designed to also embed the two types of signals into the same space so that we can then apply an attention-based multiple-instance learning classifier to recognize TM.

A parallel genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search (PGA-VNS) is developed, which includes a parallelized evolution process of multiple sub-populations for ensuring the fast convergency to a high-quality solution, and a multi-operator variable searching process to promote the convergency to a nearly optimal solution. By comparing the computational results for various-scale instances, the PGA-VNS is demonstrated to be more effective than the baseline algorithms (i.e., Gurobi, GA, PSO, ALNS, VNS, GA-ALNS, and GA-VNS).

  abstract     = {Collision warning systems (CWSs) have been recognized as effective tools in preventing vehicle collisions. Existing systems mainly provide safety warnings based on single-directional approaches, such as rear-end, lateral, and forward collision warnings. Such systems cannot provide omni-directorial enhancements on driver’s perception. Meanwhile, due to the unclear and overlapped activation areas of above single-directional CWSs, multiple kinds of warnings may be triggered mistakenly for a collision. The multi-triggering may confuse drivers about the position of dangerous targets. To this end, this paper develops a spatial-state-based omni-directional collision warning system (S-OCWS), aiming to help drivers identify the specific danger by providing the unique warning. First, the operational domains of rear-end, lateral, and forward collisions are theoretically distinguished. This distinction is attained by a geometric approach with a rigorous mathematical derivation, based on the spatial states and the relative motion states of itself and the target vehicle in real time. Then, a theoretical omni-directional collision warning model is established using time-to-collision (TTC) to clarify activation conditions for different collision warnings. Finally, the effectiveness of the S-OCWS is validated in field tests. Results indicate that the S-OCWS can help drivers quickly and properly respond to the warnings without compromising their control over lateral offsets. In particular, the probability of drivers giving proper responses to FCW doubles when the S-OCWS is on, compared to when the system is off. In addition, the S-OCWS shortens the responses time of nonprofessional drivers, and therefore enhances their safety in driving.},

However, it encounters challenges in vehicular scenarios, as the restricted motion of a ground vehicle could lead to degraded observability, and a lack of stable features might occur in dynamic road environments. In this paper, we propose Ground-VIO, which utilizes ground features and the specific camera-ground geometry to enhance monocular VIO performance in realistic road environments. In the method, the camera-ground geometry is modeled with vehicle-centered parameters and integrated into an optimization-based VIO framework. These parameters could be calibrated online and simultaneously improve the odometry accuracy by providing stable scale-awareness. Besides, a specially designed visual front-end is developed to stably extract and track ground features via the inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique. Both real-world experiments and tests on public datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our implementation could dramatically improve monocular VIO accuracy in vehicular scenarios, achieving comparable performance to state-of-art stereo VIO solutions and showing good robustness in challenging conditions. The system can also be used for the auto-calibration of IPM which is widely used in vehicle perception. A toolkit for ground feature processing, together with the experimental datasets, has been made open-source.},

Extensive experiments on large-scale GTFS datasets of Switzerland, Netherlands, and Sweden, showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. Empirically, HypTBTR outperforms TBTR by 23–37%, the One-To-Many variant shows a speed-up of 90–95%, and multilevel partitioning reduces preprocessing calculations by up to 53%.

Within this framework, an adaptive TSC method based on reinforcement learning is designed for isolated intersections. Furthermore, paired intersections are jointly controlled using a modified max-plus algorithm. The coordination graph is solved considering factors such as traffic demand and intersection spacing, employing a decomposition method named “snake game solver”. Experimental results show that the individual learning scheme resulted in robust control and quick adaptability to traffic fluctuations. However, the coordination learning scheme only led to improvements when the inter-demand between intersections was sufficiently high and the spacing was short. The numerical study suggests that this control framework could enhance network efficiency compared to other MARL-TSC methods.},

  abstract     = {Along with the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), optimizing the use of EV charging space can significantly alleviate the growing load on intelligent transportation systems. As the foundation to achieve such an optimization, a spatiotemporal method for EV charging demand prediction in urban areas is required. Although several solutions have been proposed by using data-driven deep learning methods, it can be that these performance-oriented approaches may struggle to correctly understand the underlying factors influencing charging demand, particularly charging prices. A representative case that highlights the challenge faced by existing methods is their potential misinterpretation of high prices during peak times, leading to an incorrect assumption that higher prices correspond to increased demand. To address the challenges associated with training an accurate and reliable prediction model for EV charging demand, this paper proposes a novel approach called PAG, which leverages the integration of graph and temporal attention mechanisms for effective feature extraction and introduces physics-informed meta-learning in the pre-training step to facilitate prior knowledge learning. Evaluation results on a dataset of 18,061 EV charging piles in Shenzhen, China, show that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art forecasting performance and the ability to understand the adaptive changes in charging demands caused by price fluctuations.},

This means that the vehicle has to reliably know its position and orientation with an accuracy of a few centimeters and degrees, respectively. This paper presents a radar-based approach to self-localization, which exploits fully polarimetric scattering information for robust landmark detection. The proposed method requires no input from sensors other than radar during localization for a given map. By association of landmark observations with map landmarks, the vehicle’s position is inferred. Abstract point- and line-shaped landmarks allow for compact map sizes and, in combination with the factor graph formulation used, for an efficient implementation. Evaluation of extensive real-world experiments in diverse environments shows a promising overall localization performance of 0.12m RMS absolute trajectory and 0.43° RMS heading error by leveraging the polarimetric information. A comparison of the performance of different levels of polarimetric information proves the advantage in challenging scenarios.},

Under the proposed constraint on NFZs, we aim to optimize the scheduling, transmit power, length of the time slot, and trajectory of the UAV to maximize the minimum throughput among ground nodes without violating NFZs. To find the optimal UAV strategy from the non-convex optimization problem formulated here, we use various optimization techniques, such as quadratic transform, successive convex approximation, and the block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed constraint prevents NFZs from being violated over the entire trajectory in any scenario. Furthermore, the proposed scheme shows significantly higher throughput than the baseline scheme using the traditional NFZ constraint by achieving a zero outage probability due to NFZ violations.},

However, as more vehicles become connected, the peril of cyberattacks increases, necessitating safeguarding traffic safety-related data provided by individual vehicles and public transportation to avoid perilous situations and infringement of confidentiality. In this regard, a recent work (10.1109/TITS.2021.3099488) suggested an anonymous batch data authentication and key exchange protocol. This paper shows that the work lacks true anonymity during authentication, employs a session-independent key, and is prone to session key disclosure and replay attacks. Apart from cryptanalysis, we present a novel privacy-enhancing mutual authentication and key agreement protocol supporting batch authentication resisting comprehensive security attacks in the vehicular system, including traffic data replay, vehicle impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The suggested scheme achieves security correctness under formal BAN logic analysis and is safer against the STRIDE effect. The empirical performance estimation reveals that the novel approach under adequate security assumptions outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving about 20% higher security traits while lowering 15% authentication delay, consuming 15% less bandwidth, and increasing 44% storage efficiency. Thus, our protocol is more suitable for lightweight vehicular communications.},

Our work specifically addresses practical challenges encountered during trajectory planning, namely: 1) the mobility of MNs, causing changes in their locations over time; 2) the positioning error of UAV, leading to deviations from its planned trajectory; and 3) the presence of no-fly zones (NFZs), which must be avoided during UAV flight. Taking these practical aspects into account, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates a deep neural network (DNN) structure with an unsupervised learning-based training methodology. The former enables efficient modeling of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, while the latter allows effective training of DNNs without labeled data. Through performance evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed DL-based scheme outperforms the comparative baseline schemes in terms of the minimum average SE by optimizing trajectory and resource allocation with low computation time.

While there exists many work on finding high-quality alternative paths, the existing techniques are computationally expensive and are unable to accommodate the high volume of queries required by modern navigation systems. To address this, in this paper, we propose an efficient approach to compute high-quality alternative paths. Our approach employs hub-labeling to efficiently identify candidate alternative paths. The candidate paths are then ranked considering multiple quality metrics and the top-k alternative paths are returned. We propose several non-trivial optimizations to significantly improve the computation time. In our experimental study, we conduct experiments on three diverse real-world road networks and compare our proposed algorithm against six state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that our algorithm is not only up to 3 orders of magnitude faster compared to most algorithms but also consistently generates alternative paths that are comparable or even superior in terms of quality across various metrics.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in decision-making. However, it still faces challenges when it is applied to autonomous driving, especially in complex multi-task scenarios. This paper introduces an unsupervised reinforcement learning(URL), called an improved Contrastive Intrinsic Control (CIC), to address this problem. CIC generates skills as transferable factors between different tasks to enable multi-task expansion. By comparing skills as potential state transfers with real state transfers, the mutual information between the two serves as the curiosity that drives the agents to explore the environment and gather experience in advance. This helps the collection of valuable experiences and the acquisition of effective skills. In the multi-task expansion phase, the unified training skills are used as a prior to enabling rapid convergence in various environments. Unified training is performed without rewards, followed by repeated training on multiple downstream tasks. Experiments are conducted in a highway environment, where three different driving modes are differentiated as separate RL tasks through reward functions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses the ability of multi-task learning. Compared to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) baseline, it achieves a 30% to 50% improvement in convergence speed at the single-task level and a 20% to 40% improvement in the final learning performance. Furthermore, even in complex tasks, where other RL methods struggle to learn effectively, it still achieves an obvious learning ability. This approach realizes an effective combination of curiosity mechanism, and RL decision making in the multitasking domain.},

This study proposes a novel traffic signal controller based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), integrating a multi-discrete action space and a combined state space, to enhance robustness in mixed traffic environments where CVs and non-connected vehicles coexist. Evaluations through simulation experiments on a real-world-based intersection testbed demonstrate superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and robustness compared to some popular controllers, including the deep Q-network (DQN) based controller, pretimed controller, and actuated controller. The results indicate that the proposed controller significantly reduces the average delay. Furthermore, its performance remains reliable even in environments with a CV market penetration rate as low as 20%. The findings highlight that the utilization of PPO with multi-discrete actions and combined state space effectively addresses the challenges posed by mixed traffic environments, making it a promising solution for real-world traffic signal control.},

  abstract     = {Resolving predicted conflicts is vital for safe and efficient autonomous vehicles (AV). In practice, vehicular motion prediction faces inherent uncertainty due to heterogeneous driving behaviours and environments. This spatial uncertainty increases non-linearly with prediction time horizons, leading AVs to perceive more road space occupied by conflicting vehicles. Reacting early to resolve predicted conflicts can ensure safety but may adversely affect traffic efficiency. Therefore, determining how far ahead AVs should start resolving predicted conflicts based on safety and traffic efficiency constraints is crucial. To answer this question, this study proposes a novel approach to explore the trade-off between safety and traffic efficiency considering prediction uncertainty. Firstly, a continuous-time motion prediction framework is proposed for estimating the spatial probability distribution of a vehicle’s future position at any moment within the maximum time horizon. Subsequently, average driver space and the corresponding traffic flow are derived from the safety settings of AV and prediction uncertainty. As such, the safety-efficiency trade-off can be quantified. Experiments show that mandatory decision points, high speeds, and traffic state transitions usually cause fast-increasing prediction uncertainty. A case study of Intelligent Driver Models (IDM) shows that traffic efficiency drops rapidly when AVs resolve predicted conflicts longer than 1.5 seconds ahead. AVs can act earlier on motorways for efficiency concerns but must be myopic at urban intersections. Prediction uncertainty fundamentally constrains the safety-efficiency performance of AVs. These findings are instructive for designing traffic-compatible AVs.},

  abstract     = {A radio simultaneous localization and mapping (radio SLAM) framework enabling aircraft navigation with terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) is presented and experimentally validated. The framework does not assume availability of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. Instead, it assumes the aircraft to have an initial estimate of its own states, after which it navigates by exploiting pseudorange measurements extracted from terrestrial SOPs, while estimating the states of the aircraft simultaneously with the SOPs’ states. Two radio SLAM frameworks are presented: (i) tightly-coupled SOP-aided inertial navigation system (INS) and (ii) utilizing a Wiener process acceleration (WPA) dynamical model for the aircraft’s dynamics instead of the INS. Results from four flight runs on a US Air Force C-12 aircraft, equipped with an altimeter and an industrial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU), are presented. The flight runs took place over semi-urban (SU), urban (U), and rural (R) regions in California, USA; while exercising different aircraft maneuvers: holding (H), descending (D), and grid (G). Different a priori conditions of the SOPs’ positions were studied: from all unknown, to some known, to all known. In all cases, the SOPs’ clock error states (bias and drift) were unknown and estimated alongside the aircraft’s states. The results consistently demonstrated the promise of real-world aircraft navigation via radio SLAM, yielding bounded errors along trajectories of tens of kilometers. The three-dimensional (3–D) position root-mean squared errors (RMSEs) are summarized next, where N denotes the number of SOPs exploited along the trajectory: (1) SU, H, INS-SOP, $N=6$ , 56.7 km in 8.5 minutes, maximum altitude of 5,577 ft: 43.27 m with all unknown and 10.14 m with all known; (2) U, H, INS-SOP, $N=6$ , 72.7 km in 12.9 minutes, maximum altitude of 5,906 ft: 89.82 m with all unknown and 16.97 m with all known; (3) SU, D, WPA-SOP, $N=18$ , 111.9 km in 20.0 minutes, maximum altitude of 6,234 ft: 36.42 m with all unknown and 18.62 m with all known; and (4) R, G, WPA-SOP, $N=32$ , 78.4 km in 13.8 minutes, maximum altitude of 7,546 ft: 67.01 m with all unknown and 25.65 m with all known.},

Heterogeneous travel time measurements provided by different types of monitoring technologies (e.g. Floating Car and Bluetooth Antennas) have been first used to derive current and historical information on traffic states based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and then fused according to a Bayesian approach. Accuracy of the resulting estimate has been then evaluated by comparison with ground truth. The proposed methodology has been implemented in a full laboratory test relative to the real size network of a district in Rome: starting from traffic counts collected by fixed detectors in a period of 40 days, the 960 hourly Origin – Destination traffic demand matrices, split in 20 minutes time slices, have been estimated. The ground-truth information has been assumed as vehicles trajectories for any considered time slice obtained by a Dynameq microscopic simulation based on within-day user equilibrium principles. Measurements from different sensors have been simulated adopting different values of technologies penetration rates, errors bias (mean value) and dispersion (variance and distribution). Then, identification of the traffic state of simulated current measurements according to the historical GMM has allowed fusing different heterogeneous data.

  abstract     = {This paper considers an optical reconfigurable intelligent surface (ORIS)-assisted free space optical (FSO) communication network to provide internet connectivity to the high speed train (HST). To maintain reliable FSO communication and compensate for severe pointing losses caused due to misalignment, we utilize a multi-aperture HST receiver that performs selection combining while achieving spatial diversity. In particular, we analyze the second-order statistics (SOS) at the HST receiver in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, foggy conditions, and misalignment error. We specifically develop the closed-form analytical expressions for the level crossing rate (LCR) and the average fade duration (AFD) of the system using the signal-to-noise ratio stochastic process under non-isotropic scattering environment. The effect of various system and channel parameters, including number of ORIS elements, number of receiving apertures, speed of the HST, misalignment error and fog parameters, mean angle-of-arrival, and degree of non-isotropic scattering, has been demonstrated on the LCR and AFD performances of the considered network. Further, by using finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model, we derive packet error rate (PER) using the derived LCR expression. In order to analytically evaluate the optimum packet length for the FSMC model, we employ stop-and-wait automatic repeat request (SW-ARQ) protocol and maximize the system throughput. Additionally, it is shown numerically how different system settings affect the PER and throughput performances of the FSO-based HST communication network.},

  abstract     = {By 2050, global sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are predicted to account for approximately 70% of all vehicle sales. However, whilst transitioning from combustion engine vehicles to EVs would result in reduced carbon dioxide emissions, it would place significant strain on energy generation, and grid infrastructure. Many EV studies investigated routing or charge station management, while research on predicting energy demand at a specific location was lacking. To address this, our study focused on predicting EV’s next charge location. We developed a localised onboard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieved accuracies up to 95%. Our proposal used community area Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS) to train EV models during charge transactions, while predictions were made onboard each EV. To address the lack of EV mobility charge data, we created a hybrid dataset using empirical Chicago city taxi mobility data adding synthetic EV charging event states. We conducted multiple experiments over various battery charge levels to understand how far ahead in time next charge location could be predicted, achieving reliable predictions up to 3 days before requiring next charge. Finally, this study laid a foundation for future EV mobility research by providing a novel EV mobility charge dataset.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents caused by driver distractions have seriously endangered public safety, with driver distractions typically stemming from behaviors beyond safe driving. Recently, vision-based driver behavior recognition has attracted much attention, achieving great success with deep learning-based schemes. However, the generalization ability of these models in real-world scenarios remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the underlying causes of this unsatisfactory generalization and conclude that the behavior features extracted by convolutional neural networks are intertwined with driver identity features. Based on this discovery, we propose a feature decomposition (FD) framework to disentangle these two types of features. The separated behavior features, referred to as driver-irrelevant behavior features, are subsequently leveraged for behavior recognition. Moreover, we introduce a co-training strategy to optimize the FD framework. This strategy enables behavior features and identity features to provide mutual auxiliary signals and encourages each other to drop the information that do not belong to them, so that the learned behavior features can be driver-irrelevant. Rigorous experiments are conducted on two widely-studied datasets, yielding results that demonstrate the superior performance of our framework and its improved generalization capabilities. Importantly, our framework’s fast inference capabilities make it highly suitable for real-world scenarios.

The train-to-train rescue procedure is formulated into two sub-models according to the depot position and the operating direction of the faulty train. The train timetable rescheduling and the rolling stock rescheduling problems are simultaneously considered in this paper by leveraging advanced rescheduling strategies such as the flexible short-turning and adding backup trains.

  abstract     = {Time synchronization is the key technology of real-time integrated navigation, and its error decides the precision of integrated navigation. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial navigation system (INS) real-time integrated navigation requires the fusion of GNSS and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data at 1PPS. However, due to data computation and circuit delay, it is impossible to receive two data simultaneously at 1PPS, resulting in the inability to achieve high-precision data fusion. In response to this issue, this paper proposes a novel time synchronization strategy, which first saves IMU data, waits for GNSS data to be received, and then fuses the two. The key to this approach is to ensure that the saved IMU data is processed within a sampling interval. This article adopts a one-step predictive Kalman filter algorithm to place the state prediction covariance matrix in the traditional algorithm into the measurement update process for execution so that only INS mechanization algorithms are executed during the state prediction process, which can significantly reduce the code runtime and ensure that the saved IMU data can be processed promptly. The correctness of the proposed algorithm was verified through real-time vehicle experiments in the real world. The test results show that data time synchronization can be achieved accurately to the order of microseconds with the proposed synchronization approach. The integrated navigation system with this strategy achieves performance with comparable real-time positioning and post-processing positioning accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is a challenging research topic due to the complex spatial and temporal dependencies among different roads. Though great efforts have been made on traffic forecasting, existing works still have the following shortcomings: i) Most methods only directly perform on the original road network topology which cannot accommodate the diverse traffic patterns and multi-granularity traffic forecasting requirements driven by the natural multi-level urban structure and layout, ii) The existing studies based on the spatio-temporal multi-granularity perspective ignore the interactions between the fine-grained information and coarse-grained information, resulting in the spatio-temporal correlation under multi-granularity inaccurately modeled. To solve the problems, we propose an Adaptive and Interactive Multi-level Spatio-Temporal network (AIMST) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first devise a learnable adaptive hierarchical clustering method to automatically generate more coarse-grained graphs from the initial road networks and the traffic data. Then, the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks are executed on the constructed hierarchical traffic graph of each level correspondingly to capture the spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore, a multi-level bidirectional interaction module is designed to emphasize the multi-grained interaction patterns among different levels. Extensive experiments on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our framework is superior to several state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) is a new architectural paradigm that combines Named Data Networking (NDN) with Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). VNDN enables vehicles to request and receive named content in vehicle network environment. However, VNDN faces a major challenge of robust data forwarding due to the high mobility of vehicles, which causes frequent network disruptions and packet losses. To overcome this challenge, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking and mobility prediction scheme based on the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) estimation technique. The RLS model uses multiple parameters, such as received signal strength (RSS), GPS coordinates, and speed, to dynamically estimate the locations of vehicles in real-time. Roadside Units (RSU) use tracking information to predict the moving vehicle and forward data packets toward the target RSU based on its trajectories. Additionally, we employ a hop-by-hop feedback Congestion Control (CC) mechanism for VNDN environments to improve data forwarding efficiency in congested networks. We conduct extensive simulations to compare the performance of our proposed multi-parameter RLS-based scheme with existing schemes. The results show that our scheme improves the data delivery ratio by 20-35%, reduces the average content retrieval latency and control overhead by over 40%, and enhances the reliability of content delivery in highly dynamic VNDN environments. Our proposed scheme demonstrates the potential of RLS-based tracking for vehicular mobility prediction to enable robust data dissemination architectures and protocols for next generation vehicle networks.},

Subsequently, the processing results of the UAVs are transmitted to a control center that makes a centralized transportation management decision based on the fusion of all processing results.

To reduce the energy consumption and improve the fusion performance, the control center schedules the UAVs to perform the tasks in an energy-efficient manner while synchronizing the completion time of the UAVs. As a result, the control center studies a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP), in which two objectives, i.e., the total energy consumption of the UAVs and total completion time difference among the UAVs, are simultaneously considered. To tackle the CMOP, we develop an improved constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Particularly, we design an improved genetic operator and repairing constraint-handling technique to improve the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in seeking Pareto optimal solutions for the CMOP. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm has great advantages in finding better solutions with the enhanced diversity and convergence for the CMOP.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving safety based on LiDAR perception is increasingly becoming a hot spot. Specifically, 3D adversarial examples always make the prediction results of deep neural network models unpredictable, which poses a major security risk to autonomous driving systems. However, the vulnerability of 3D neural network models to adversarial examples is less explored. At present, existing adversarial attack methods often obtain 3D adversarial examples by perturbing the entire point cloud, which requires a large number of perturbed points, i.e. requires a large perturbation budget. In this paper, we propose a Salient Region Adversarial attack method (SR-Adv) to generate adversarial point clouds, by perturbing fewer regions and fewer points. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose region-based attacks for 3D point clouds. First, the proposed SR-Adv employs game theory to extract salient regions of point clouds. This mechanism assigns a value to each region to measure its importance to the 3D neural network model prediction results and realizes the vulnerability analysis of the 3D model. Second, we propose a novel optimization-based gradient attack algorithm to achieve adversarial attacks on salient regions. We evaluate the proposed SR-Adv attack method on the synthetic datasets ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart as well as the real-world dataset KITTI and NuScenes. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Adv achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate and better imperceptibility by perturbing fewer points on 3D point clouds.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based anomaly inspection plays a crucial role in the efficient maintenance of millions of kilometers of railway, with rail segmentation, a key step in such anomaly detection for providing localization prior. However multi-type rails, those involved in crossings and connections, have highly variable patterns, greatly restricting the performance of standard (straight) rail segmentation methods. Semantic segmentation helps to deal with complex railway scenes and variable patterns, however the noise sensitivity, intra-class differences, and inter-class similarities still challenge the segmentation. Superpixel segmentation can aggregate local similar pixels with precise boundaries, which can offer a weak prior for semantic segmentation for boundary information modeling, intra-class aggregation, and inter-class differentiation, however how to integrate superpixel-level guidance to advance rail segmentation is still challenging. This paper proposes a two-stage transformer-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation framework. The first stage, Attention-Based Superpixel Segmentation Sub-Network via Boundary Calibration (BCASN), generates railway superpixels by the learning of intra-superpixel consistency and boundary calibration to effectively fit rail boundaries and guide the second-stage rail segmentation. The second stage, Superpixel-Guided Multi-Type Rail Segmentation Sub-Network via Contextual Information Aggregation (CIASSN), captures railway semantics via global and cross-scale context construction, aggregates rail features via directional guidance and structured prior, and makes comprehensive segmentation decisions at superpixel and pixel scales with the learning of superpixel-level context and classification. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves 98.71% overall accuracy, 98.44% mIoU, and 87.33% boundary recall in multi-type rail segmentation, significantly extends applicable scenarios, and outperforms all related state-of-the-art methods in rail and road segmentation.},

A ground velocity estimator is additionally designed to overcome the difficulties of unmeasurable ground velocity, and the Lyapunov stability of curved path following is analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field tests on a real small fixed-wing UAV are carried out to evaluate the algorithm performance in the presence of time-varying and unknown wind disturbances. Verification results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms other widely used path following algorithms and can effectively follow arbitrary curved paths.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed a conflict-free routing strategy combined with scheduling for Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) multi-aircraft to guarantee a safe separation. By incorporating Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) as route constraints, a mixed-logic model is designed to maximize the runway throughput while ensuring minimum separation between aircraft and avoiding overtaking on each STARs segment. Control techniques such as speed recommendation and holding operations are employed to the model to address potential conflicts. Three different algorithms are developed to solve the model: branch and bound with mixed-integer linear programming, multi-agent pathfinding with constraint programming, and meta-heuristics with evolutionary neighborhood search. These algorithms are tested on multiple cases of varying scales. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed three algorithms by simulating realistic scenarios and comparing the results with Singapore ADS-B (Automatic dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) historical dataset. In one hour testing, results show that our method could reduce the last aircraft landing time nearly 10 minutes and save more than 80 minutes for total flight travel times for all aircraft, as well as non-vectoring flight trajectories, which indicates its potential to be used as an auxiliary decision-making tool for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs).},

The data-driven platoon model involving longitudinal-lateral dynamics is established with subspace identification to alleviate the adverse effects of uncertain dynamics. Then, a subspace predictor-based distributed data-driven model predictive controller is developed for vehicular platoon. To overcome the cutting-corner phenomenon on curved roads, the reference point is shifted from the preceding vehicle to an optimal corridor point behind it. In this way, a driver-centric driving policy is designed with a flexible spacing and soft control constraints to balance driving safety and driving comfort in terms of different driving styles.

However, recent methods suffer from limited feature representations as they depend on coarse semantic masks to handle dynamic objects, resulting in diminished accuracy in dynamic environments. In contrast to these coarse-grained methods, we present Fine-MVO, a novel self-supervised monocular visual odometry that aims to address dynamic objects using implicit fine-grained feature representations, thus achieving excellent accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments. First, Fine-MVO provides an efficient cross-feature augmentation module and a novel loss weight balance strategy to effectively leverage fine-grained features with implicit semantic information, leading to a great improvement in the depth estimation accuracy, especially on object boundaries in the scenes. Secondly, we design a novel pose-feature enhancement module and an effective two-stage training policy to empower the pose network to focus on robust static regions and temporal information, thereby enhancing the pose estimation performance in dynamic and long-term environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the excellent accuracy and generalization of Fine-MVO. Specifically, Fine-MVO achieves a remarkable 36.80% improvement in pose accuracy over the state-of-the-art method on the KITTI dataset, which even breaks through the performance of loop closure within geometry-based visual odometry methods. Furthermore, Fine-MVO exhibits satisfactory generalization on the outdoor dataset AirDOS-Shibuya, attaining a notable improvement of 28.22% over current advanced method. Excitingly, Fine-MVO also reveals outstanding generalization on the indoor dataset TUM-RGBD.},

Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed.

Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms.

  abstract     = {The connected vehicles (CVs) technology mainly relies on the traffic cyber physical systems (T-CPS) to realize the interconnection between CVs. However, the vulnerability of open CVs environment gives illegal attackers an opportunity. Obviously, CVs are susceptible to unlawful cyber-attacks (CAs) from infiltrating malicious messages. Accordingly, underlying cybersecurity threats can cause information exchange errors and communication failures between CVs. For example, attackers can spread false messages that interfere with normal communication between CVs, which results in CVs receiving incorrect traffic information to affect their decisions and actions. In addition, attackers can also apply denial of service (DoS) attack to overload the communication network, causing communication failures and network congestion between CVs. Therefore, a new coupled map car-following model is established by integrating the safety control against CAs on the global information (called for CAGI-CM model) under CVs platoon environment. In terms of cybernetics, the necessary conditions are obtained for the smooth operation of the CVs platoon with CAs, and the value of compensating coefficient corresponding to different attacks intensity are observed according to the Bode diagrams. Moreover, the traffic dynamics are investigated for different types of CAs including the decreased or magnified headway and velocity information, replay or delay acceleration and deceleration through numerical simulation. The simulation results reveal that the control term incorporating the effect of delayed headway and safety distance can successfully alleviate the negative influences of CAs on CVs platoon operations to guarantee traffic security and stability.},

  abstract     = {Connectivity technologies in intelligent transportation systems offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance mobility, fuel economy, and safety for automotive systems. However, the uncertain driving behavior of surrounding vehicles in real-world traffic scenarios can significantly undermine these benefits. To tackle this challenge, this article develops a stochastic predictive-adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system that effectively addresses uncertainties and automatically adapts to various driving scenarios. The proposed system employs a Gaussian process (GP)-based velocity predictor as its foundation, accurately capturing the driving dynamics of the preceding vehicle while accounting for prediction uncertainty using variances. The real-time feasibility is assessed in a dSPACE rapid prototyping system. In addition, the developed stochastic-model predictive control (S-MPC) approach incorporates the predicted velocity variance into the probabilistic chance constraints, conservatively narrowing the optimization space of the velocity planning domain, thereby enabling more reliable control. To further enhance the system’s performance in adapting to different driving conditions, a scenario-based parameter self-learning (PSL) technique is introduced in the S-MPC controller, utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO). Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is comprehensively evaluated by leveraging a high-fidelity simulator and on-board actual vehicle testing data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved a boost in tracking performance and driving comfort while maintaining fuel-saving benefits.},

Due to the wide variety of traffic light classes and the inherent conflict between location determination and intra-class classification of traffic lights, existing deep learning-based methods cannot obtain satisfactory results, making them still unreliable as traffic light recognizers. To address this issue, we propose an effective Coarse-to-fine framework for traffic light recognition, which is consisted of an enhanced super class detector and a fine-grained classifier. The main contributions lie in three aspects. Firstly, we determine the optimal number of super class by adopting a clustering algorithm. It can alleviate the effect caused by similar classes of traffic light. Secondly, we enhance the super class detector by introducing an additional prediction layer, which enable utilizing the shadow features and improving the detection performance of traffic light super class. Lastly, we propose a fine-grained classifier based on depth-wise separable convolution and expansion layer for super class candidate classification. It can achieve superior recognition performance of different traffic lights especially for similar classes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on WPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) traffic light dataset. With an input size of $416\,\,{\times }\,\,416$ pixels, the proposed method can achieve a precision of 99.04% and a recall of 97.40% with a speed of 9.9ms.

The object-level network performs vehicle detection and coarse point detection, while the point-level network utilizes local features to refine the point positions.

  abstract     = {Owing to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the detection of defects on rail surfaces has significantly improved. Although existing methods achieve good results, they incur huge computational and parameter costs associated with CNNs. The usual approach to this problem is to design lightweight models that meet the needs of real-world applications; however, the performance is often compromised. To address the aforementioned problems, we designed a dual semantic approximation network via knowledge distillation (DSANet-KD, a student model with knowledge distillation) for rail surface defect detection; it focuses on both foreground and background knowledge and obtains more accurate prediction results. This model comprises an adaptive 3D spatial integration module, feature-optimization decoding module, and dual semantic approximation knowledge-distillation framework. Specifically, we employed a thoroughly trained teacher defect detection network equipped with dual semantic approximation information as an experienced teacher to guide the training of a student defect detection network. Experimental results showed that the proposed DSANet-KD achieved better accuracy with a smaller number of parameters than the state-of-the-art methods. To demonstrate the generalizability of DSANet-KD, experiments were conducted on a publicly available RGBD-SOD dataset, whose source code is available at: https://github.com/hjklearn/DSANet-KD .},

In this paper, a new convolutional neural network architecture, OUR-Net, is designed to more efficiently treat both high- and low-frequency visual image features. An Ocatve Convolution is incorporated into the proposed network as an enhancement to conventional convolution. In particular, an Octave Convolution Residual Block (OCRB) is embedded in the encoder to replace the convolutional layer of the classical encoder. Moerover, we propose Octave Max Unpooling (OMU) as the upsampling operation of the decoder, enabling the neural network to learn how to decode multi-spatial frequency features. Compared with models using traditional convolution, OUR-Net has better capability of processing multi-scale information, thus simultaneously improving model performance while saving computational costs by reducing spatial redundancy. We evaluate the superiority of the proposed method by comparing it to state-of-the-art crack segmentation methods on four public datasets (CrackLS315, CFD, Crack200, DeepCrack), which encompass cracks of various widths. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs excellently, which achieves F1-score and mIoU of 0.9112, 0.9271, 0.8106, 0.9318, and 0.8369, 0.8644, 0.6815, 0.8723, respectively, on the four datasets. A lightweight version of the proposed network is constructed using depthwise separable convolution that achieves excellent performance with only 0.88M parameters.},

Although bridge pavements pose distinctive challenges owing to their unique characteristics and varied defect types, previous studies have primarily focused on the detection of slender cracks. To fill this research gap, we developed a novel end-to-end hybrid method that dynamically combines the vision transformer (ViT) and level set theory to handle the complex geometry of bridge pavement defects. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the configuration of two parallel decoders. These decoders, operating under a unified objective function, share weights and perform simultaneous optimization, thereby facilitating a holistic end-to-end training process. Furthermore, we compiled two new bridge pavement defect datasets, namely BdridgeDefX and BdridgeDef20, which offer broader applicability for practical defect detection. The results of a rigorous experimental validation on four datasets demonstrated the proposed method’s capability of generating accurate defect boundaries and delivering state-of-the-art performance.},

This paper proposes an efficient motion planning method based on convolution in the spatiotemporal dimension, which takes into account the uncertainty of localization and obstacle intention. Firstly, a three-dimensional probability occupancy grid map with uncertainty is constructed based on prediction results. Secondly, convolution kernels are generated considering the contour, heading angle and localization uncertainty of the ego vehicle. Thirdly, single-channel multi-output convolutions are performed between the probability occupancy grid map and the kernels to generate the four-dimensional feature map. Finally, a collision avoidance algorithm based on the feature map is proposed to obtain the optimal trajectory, which uses the hybrid A* algorithm. The chance constraint and the vehicle kinematics are taken into account in the motion planning. In simulation experiments, the safety performance, computational efficiency and rationality of the motion planning are compared and analyzed, and the proposed method performs superiorly.

For truck platooning evaluation, simulation platforms play a crucial role. However, there has not been a simulation platform to meet the evaluation needs of various stakeholders, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Freight Operators (FOs) and Transportation Management Administrations (TMAs). To fill the research gap, this paper proposes a next-generation simulation platform. It integrates a traffic simulator, platoon management system, and truck control module to satisfy all the evaluation needs. The proposed platform bears the following features: i) Compatibility with various platooning decision makers, planners, controllers, vehicle types and platoon management strategies; ii) Capability of evaluating platoon performance on the lateral dimension; iii) Prototype platoon management system provided for FOs; iv) Capability of evaluating truck platoon management performance in terms of sustainability and economy; v) Capability of evaluating the impact of interactive background traffic on platoon performance. vi) Capability of evaluating the impact of truck platoon management on traffic mobility. The proposed platform is validated by comparison against an actual field test. Its credibility is confirmed in terms of truck platoon performance and interactive traffic simulation. Additional tests are conducted to evaluate truck platoon performance and the impact of truck platoons on mixed traffic. The results reveal that existing platoon lane-change technologies should be upgraded to be compatible with high-traffic-demand scenarios. It is also revealed that a localized and up-to-date assessment is required before allowing truck platooning.},

Limited processing power leads to a trade-off between real-time capability and maneuver efficiency, especially for trajectory planning in highly dynamic traffic environments like urban intersections. Addressing this problem, we propose a novel two-layer model predictive control (MPC) architecture utilizing a differentially flat representation of the kinematic single-track vehicle model for optimal control. While a real-time capable quadratic programming-based MPC ensures local obstacle avoidance at every time step, its problem formulation is asynchronously updated by the globally optimal solution of a computationally more expensive mixed-integer MPC formulation. Both optimization problems are computed in parallel and incorporate position predictions of surrounding traffic participants available via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Collision-free and efficient obstacle avoidance in real time under realistic model errors is validated via high-fidelity co-simulations of typical urban intersection and highway scenarios with the traffic simulator CARLA.},

  abstract     = {The dedicated lanes management policy is a possible solution to the issues arising from the coexistence of human-driving vehicles (HDVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in traffic. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the network deployment problem of CAV-dedicated lanes, the safety implications of CAV and its dedicated lanes are ignored. This study proposes a mathematical approach to optimize the deployment of CAV-dedicated lanes incorporating efficiency and safety concerns. An integrated framework is developed based on headway distributions to systematically evaluate the efficiency and safety performance of the road network. The platoon intensity index is utilized to model the platooning effect of CAVs on traffic safety and efficiency. A safety performance estimation method is proposed to account for the potential collision risk of mixed traffic flow and heterogeneity in car-following behavior. A bi-level programming model is adopted to solve the optimal deployment problem. The upper-level model is formulated as a bi-objective model to minimize the total travel time and the safety risk. The lower-level model describes the multi-class user equilibrium state of the CAV-HDV mixed traffic flow on the network. A genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the bi-level programming model and obtain the Pareto-optimal solution set. Two numerical studies are conducted to validate the proposed model and algorithm. The results revealed that the optimal deployment plan can significantly improve the road network’s safety and efficiency performance, whereas higher platoon intensities have a negative impact on traffic safety and efficiency for certain headway settings. Moreover, the results highlighted a trade-off between efficiency and safety in the optimal deployment problem, which may help decision-makers choose the optimal deployment plan based on the road network design needs.},

In this paper, the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology is applied in a vehicular edge computing network, in which vehicular users (VUs) can offload partial computation tasks to MEC servers over wireless channels for remote execution. In this network, an optimization problem for the long-term energy consumption of the system is presented and aims to minimize it by jointly optimizing the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) ordering of NOMA, the VUs’ transmit power for computation offloading, and computation resource allocation of the MEC server. To deal with the intractable long-term optimization problem, we first transform it into an equivalent instantaneous form based on the Lyapunov optimization theory. Since the transformed problem is still highly non-convex, we further decompose it into the interactive resource allocation and SIC ordering sub-problems. For the resource allocation sub-problem, we exploit its convexity through the transformation and reparameterization, and derive the optimal solution in accordance with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the gradient descent algorithm. After that, we propose a low-complexity algorithm by leveraging the Tabu search to obtain the sub-optimal SIC ordering.

  abstract     = {Depth estimation is extremely important in the world of driverless vehicles, which can provide key distance information for 3D scene perception and local path planning. Using convolutional neural network (CNN) to completely recover depth information from monocular images becomes a hot research trend. Supervised monocular depth estimation needs large numbers of per-pixel ground-truth depth data collected from LiDAR to train the model. This leads to high resource consumption and poor generalization ability. For the above reasons, the self-supervised learning method seems to be a promising alternative to monocular depth estimation. However, the up-sampling operations in existing encoder-decoder based architecture may lose some critical image information, which leads to boundary blurring and depth artifact in depth maps. In this paper, the Laplace-Attention module based self-supervised monocular depth estimation network (LAM-Depth) is designed to resolve this problem. Specifically, multi-scale Laplacian features are introduced into the corresponding streams in the decoder to fuse the low-level and skip-connection features. The concatenated features are then re-calibrated with a channel-wise attention unit for emphasizing the Laplacian features. Based on the above operations, the image information is preserved to the greatest extent in feature processing. The experiment results show that the proposed model LAM-Depth achieves a high ranking among the existing unsupervised methods and outperforms several supervised models trained with LiDAR data. Furthermore, we conduct experiments in real scenes to evaluate the generalization ability of LAM-Depth and obtain high-quality depth maps.},

Finally, with these two modules and a CVAE network, the OSQF-Net can generate a latent space with complete motion patterns, which guides future trajectory prediction.

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of traffic conditions is essential for effective and efficient traffic management and control. The dynamic and complex nature of traffic data, characterized by intricate temporal and spatial features, presents significant challenges to accurate traffic forecasting. While previous studies have developed various models with advanced algorithms, they often fail to fully capture the holistic spatio-temporal features and the dynamically evolving correlations within traffic networks. Additionally, these studies often overlook the potential of adjacency matrices learned from real-time traffic data to more accurately represent the interconnectivity of nodes within road network. To address these gaps, this study introduces the Generalized Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GDSTGCN), a novel prediction model tailored for traffic data. First, this model builds a learning-based generalized dynamic graph structure, which incorporates both spatial and temporal connections and evolves with real-time traffic data. Then, a generalized dynamic graph convolution, integrated with graph diffusion, is crafted to operate on the designed generalized dynamic graph structure. This plays a critical role in holistically capturing local and global spatio-temporal traffic dependencies. Moreover, the generalized dynamic graph convolution is incorporated with Temporal convolution and other essential components, forming a cohesive framework that enables effective and efficient traffic flow predictions. To validate the performance of the GDSTGCN model, we conducted extensive experiments using four real-world road network datasets.

  abstract     = {Road damage presents a significant risk to traffic safety, including pavement distress and disaster-induced damage. Thanks to their high efficiency, computer vision-based methods for pavement distress detection have been widely developed. In disaster scenarios, the automatic extraction of road damage information from extensive social media images plays a critical role in rescue efforts. However, few existing studies have focused on detecting object-level disaster-induced road damage. To fill the gap, this paper presents a Social media image dataset of Object detection for Disaster-induced Road damage (SODR), including 1,552 images and two categories (i.e., collapses and blockages). Additionally, this paper proposes an ensemble learning approach with attention mechanisms based on YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) network. Initially, attention modules are employed to create two distinct detectors for ensemble learning. Subsequently, one standard YOLOv5 and two variant networks are trained with consistent settings, and test time augmentation is applied during the inference phase. The proposed method has been implemented across five scales of YOLOv5, offering alternatives for balancing accuracy and computational cost. To demonstrate the validity, comprehensive experiments were conducted on two datasets. Compared with some mainstream detectors and ensemble learning methods, our approach achieved competitive results with a fewer number of parameters and a simpler training and testing process. The SODR dataset and source code are available at ( https://github.com/nonondayo/yolov5_SODRv1 ).},

  abstract     = {Safety is one of the critical challenges in the autonomous driving task. Recent works address the safety by implementing a safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) mechanism. However, most approaches make conservative decisions without knowing the confidence of the actions, which ultimately causes traffic congestion and low travel efficiency. This paper proposes an uncertainty-augmented Lagrangian safe reinforcement algorithm (Lag-U) to improve exploration and safety performance for autonomous driving. First, epistemic uncertainty is introduced into safe RL by using deep ensemble. We use the estimated epistemic uncertainty to encourage exploration and to learn a risk-sensitive policy by adaptively modifying safety constraints. Second, we facilitate an intervention assurance to choose safer actions based on the quantified epistemic uncertainty during deployment. Experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms other safe RL baselines. The trained vehicle can make a decent trade-off between high efficiency and avoiding risks, thus preventing ultra-conservative policy.},

Different from most studies, the proposed framework offers a generalized statistical foundation for making full use of multiple traffic data sources to estimate the vehicular journey time variability. Feeding data collected from multiple data sources are classified based on the associated traffic conditions, and the corresponding estimation biases of the individual data sources are determined by arbitrary distributions. The proposed framework is implemented and tested on a Hong Kong corridor with actual data collected from the field. Different statistical distributions of prior and likelihood knowledge are applied and compared. The findings of the case study show significant improvement in the journey time estimations of the proposed method compared with the individual measurements. The results also highlight the benefit of incorporating a traffic state classifier and prior knowledge in the fusion framework.

However, its performance is still very constrained as most existing studies did not well capture data-specific characteristics of LiDAR point clouds. Inspired by the observation that the domain discrepancy of LiDAR point clouds is highly correlated with point density, we design a density-aware self-training (DAST) technique that introduces point density into the self-training framework for domain adaptive point cloud segmentation. DAST consists of two novel and complementary designs. The first is density-aware pseudo labelling that introduces point density for accurate pseudo labelling of target data and effective self-supervised network retraining. The second is density-aware consistency regularization that encourages to learn density-invariant representations by enforcing target predictions to be consistent across points of different densities. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale public datasets show that DAST achieves superior domain adaptation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by rapid urbanization and increasing natural hazards, this study aims to develop a data-driven method for detecting urban traffic anomalies during extreme events. Past experiences have shown that abnormal traffic patterns caused by extreme events can disrupt traffic in a large portion of the road network. Timely and reliable traffic monitoring for detection of such anomalies is crucial for congestion mitigation and successful emergency operation plans. An effective traffic monitoring system should detect disruptions at both network and local levels. However, the existing methods are not capable of addressing this need. This study proposes a temporal self-expressive network monitoring method to achieve this purpose. The proposed method first utilizes a temporal self-expressive model to uncover the dynamic interdependencies between local zones of the traffic network. Next, a statistical monitoring method detects network-wide anomalies based on regular traffic interdependencies. Finally, the method identifies the zones most affected by the anomalous event. We applied the proposed method to the road network of Manhattan in New York City to evaluate its performance during Hurricane Sandy. The outcomes confirmed that the temporal self-expressive model, augmented with statistical monitoring tools, could accurately detect anomalous traffic at both network and zone levels.},

Incapable or inaccurate modeling of nonlinearities, coupled with enormous cost of nonlinear controls, severely limit stability and performance enhancements in these scenarios. This paper proposes a novel modeling and robust control framework to address these issues. First, a novel hybrid modeling approach for trajectory tracking of AVs, combining a prior nominal model and a data-driven uncertain model based on Koopman theory, is proposed to enhance model predictive ability effectively. The finite approximation of Koopman operators captures the intrinsic characteristics of the nonlinear AV system via linear evolution in lifted observable space. Second, a Koopman-based Tube Robust MPC (K-TRMPC) is developed based on the hybrid model and zonotopic set theory. Koopman modeling error raised by the finite operators is considered a disturbance of the perturbed system. Tube-based design for constraint-tightening is developed for the nominal and lifted systems to guarantee closed-loop robustness. A reachability analysis on the future evolution of the perturbed system proves its convergence. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on real-time experiments and simulations, confirming the improved tracking performance on various surface conditions and vehicle stability in combined-slip scenarios.},

To this end, a position enhancement module is created by virtue of residual connections and coordinate attentions such that high-level semantics and spatial feature dependencies can be efficiently exploited, respectively, thereby accurately locating bounding boxes. Moreover, a multi-scale feature semantics correlation block is devised by combining spatial pyramid pooling and swin transformer-based self-attention encoder in order that the classification ability can be fertilized in both global and local sense. Experiments and comparisons show that the proposed AodeMar outperforms typical approaches including Faster R-CNN, SSD and YOLO series in terms of detection accuracy and robustness.},

This paper presents a novel HTS pinning maglev system employing a homopolar linear synchronous motor (H-LSM), which shows great potential for engineering. First, conceptual structure of the novel HTS pinning maglev system employing H-LSM is described. The H-LSM was designed to drive a 19-ton HTS pinning maglev engineering prototype using analytical and finite element methods.

Finally, in order to fully analyze the potential and electro-mechanical coupling of the system, a lateral dynamic response analysis is introduced. The result shows that the novel HTS pinning maglev system employing a H-LSM has a good propulsion-levitation-guidance (PLG) performance. The H-LSM can meet the propulsion requirements of HTS high-speed maglev vehicles with lower cost.

  abstract     = {To ensure the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), thorough testing across virtual simulation environments, closed facilities, and public roads is essential. Scenario-based testing stands out as a crucial method for evaluating AVs, with a key focus on constructing appropriate testing scenarios. Given the vulnerability of Powered Two-Wheelers (PTWs) riders, it is essential to investigate typical and representative car-to-PTWs crash scenarios and validate AV system safety performance in such situations. This study introduces a new method for generating high-risk scenarios by extracting typical testing scenarios from real-world crashes, thereby enhancing the realism of testing conditions. To evaluate the safety performance of AV systems, a crash-based testing approach is proposed. First, 222 car-to-PTWs crashes were extracted from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database and the pre-crash trajectories of crash-involved parties were accurately obtained by reconstructing the crashes case-by-case. Second, utilizing the k-medoids algorithm based on the Hausdorff distance to cluster these trajectories, six typical pre-crash trajectory clusters were extracted. Third, six sets of high-risk scenarios were generated using parameter discretization and combination testing based on the cluster centers. Finally, we conducted safety testing on the black-box automated driving system, Baidu Apollo, using the SVL Simulator virtual simulation platform. We evaluated its performance by subjecting it to the six sets of high-risk scenarios generated in this study. The experimental results demonstrate that Apollo can operate safely in most high-risk scenarios, indicating that automated driving systems can handle crashes that some human drivers cannot avoid, thereby improve traffic safety.},

Firstly, we employ the Weibull model to estimate bike life to quantify use load. Moreover, we design a clustering algorithm to partition station regions. We also design a demand prediction model named ST-SAGCN to capture dynamic spatial correlations and spatio-temporal correlations simultaneously. We also propose a scheduling method that meets station demand as much as possible to balance station use and bike-life distribution. We conduct experiments on two public bike datasets covering different time spans in New York and Washington, and compare the bike-life distribution after scheduling with that of real-world actual conditions.

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is increasingly used as a medium to propagate critical information via establishing connections between entities such as vehicles and infrastructures. During message transmission, privacy-preserving authentication is considered the first line of defence against attackers and malicious information. To achieve a more secure and stable communication environment, ever-increasing numbers of blockchain-based authentication schemes are proposed. At first glance, existing approaches provide robust architectures and achieve transparent authentication. However, in these schemes, verifiers need to conduct real-time operations in the blockchain (e.g., querying certificates). To remedy this limit, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based authentication protocol with global-updated commitment (PBAG). In PBAG, based on the issued certificates, a public global commitment is computed, and a unique evaluation proof is generated for each authorized vehicle. Instead of querying the blockchain in real-time, verifiers can independently authenticate vehicles using the global commitment that is pre-updated with the assistance of the blockchain. Moreover, our scheme proposes a dynamic update mechanism to ensure the freshness of the global commitment and evaluation proofs. Benefiting from the update mechanism, there will be an authentication failure for vehicles holding invalid certificates when using the latest global commitment, thus avoiding the time-consuming of checking the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). In terms of privacy protection, our scheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. It allows anonymous authentication based on evaluation proofs and achieves traceability of identity in the event of a dispute. The simulation demonstrates that the average computation cost of verifying per message is 0.36ms under the batch-enabled mechanism, reducing by more than 63.7% compared with existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Traditional road structural detection and evaluation is inefficient, imprecise, and destructive. To address these issues, a feature-enhanced multiscale vision transformer (FeMViT) for road distress classification from ground penetrating radar (GPR) images was proposed. FeMViT model used the feature-enhanced feature pyramid network (FPN) and feature enrichment module (FEM) to extract the distress better features on GPR images. The pooling attention was also modified using the residual pooling connection to reduce computational complexity and memory usage. Experimental results showed that this model further realized the comprehensive improvement of classification indexes for road distresses. The accuracy and $\boldsymbol { F}_{1}$ score of the overall classification result was 91.9% and 90.8%, improved by 10.4% and 7.1% compared to the original Transformer, respectively. Misattribution and visualization analysis provided ideas for improvement directions. The internal distress rate ( $\boldsymbol {IDR}$ ) and internal pavement structural integrity score ( $\boldsymbol {IPSI}$ ) indexes of structural integrity were determined based on GPR images. Field tests suggested a good correlation between the structural strength and integrity indexes of asphalt pavement. This illustrates that the proposed method is reliable and could provide a more comprehensive approach to the structural condition assessment of asphalt pavement.},

For such a setup with three different protocols, including time switching (TS), energy splitting, and mode switching (MS), we present the outage probability (OP) analysis for the network. Moreover, the probability of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain and the delayed outage probability are further investigated. Compared with the traditional relaying scheme, the obtained results show that the STARRIS-assisted system achieves better delay performance. Furthermore, for the STARRIS-assisted system, the TS protocol achieves the best performance, while the MS protocol has the worst performance. In addition, considering the base station with multiple antennas, the expression for the OP is derived and error floors at high SNRs due to imperfect channel state information constraints exist. Finally, one can readily observe that increasing the number of STARRIS elements and antennas of the source can improve the outage performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach for implementing constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage (CV) battery charges for electric vehicles using a reconfigurable resonant converter with a low component count. In the proposed approach, the CC and CV charging methods are implemented using the inherent characteristic of an LCC converter as a current source and an LC converter as a voltage source, when operating at the resonant frequency without any need for wide frequency variation. The proposed simple battery charging structure is based on a dual resonant network and the transition from CC to CV charge occurs by reconfiguring from LCC to LC resonant network. Moreover, the resonant inductance is reduced so that the transformer leakage inductance can be utilized. The proposed battery charger operates at a fixed resonant frequency and zero voltage switching (ZVS) for input switches while zero current switching (ZCS) for output diodes is provided in the entire operation range. The proposed topology is analyzed comprehensively and a 180 W laboratory prototype is implemented to justify the converter performance, which converts 340 V input voltage to 50–90 V output voltage and 0.2–2 A output current is realized. The maximum efficiency of 97.9% is achieved in the experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer a promising solution to mitigate human errors and, consequently, reduce the number of road traffic fatalities. While AVs may significantly reduce the number of collisions in the future, they will not be able to completely eliminate it, as certain accidents cannot be avoided due to the physical limitations of the vehicle, and the boundary conditions imposed by the environment. This paper presents an initial investigation into a novel methodology that aims to mitigate the consequences of unavoidable accidents by determining the vehicle trajectory that minimizes injuries to the occupants of the AV in real-time. This result is achieved using a multibody (MBD) crash simulation software to simulate all the possible impacts and determine the one with the lower severity. The approach used is hybrid: the AV can run simulations in real-time as well as access a database where pre-simulated crash results are stored. The maximum computational time required by the software to perform an impact simulation was 80 milliseconds, comfortably within the total time allowable for the AV to detect the unavoidable accident and implement corrective actions, determined to be 0.3 seconds for the scenarios considered. The results of the multibody code were compared with a finite element code, and among the severity indices considered, the Theoretical Head Impact Velocity index has the highest correlation coefficient between the two software. Overall, the proposed methodology demonstrated potentiality both in terms of results and feasibility and could have significant implications for the development of safer self-driving cars.},

  abstract     = {Effective road marking classification and segmentation play a pivotal role in advancing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications and refining road inventory databases. However, the irregular data formats and unordered permutation modes of 3D point clouds, along with the limited availability of large-scale datasets with point-level annotations, remain significant obstacles to designing deep learning-based networks with superior performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-level feature optimization network structure, named MFPNet, and introduces two point cloud benchmarks, RdmkNet and Toronto-Rdmk, for road marking classification and segmentation in intricate urban environments. MFPNet is composed of three integral modules. First, the M-transformer module, consisting of three transformers obtained from different channels, fully captures rich point cloud background information and long-distance dependencies between objects. Then, the feature pooling aggregation module uses parallel structured pooling attention mechanisms to aggregate features captured by the M-transformer module, while the prediction refinement module further enhances the acquisition of semantic features. Comparative studies indicate that MFPNet can be embedded into general deep learning networks without changing their original network structures, significantly improving the accuracy of multiple baseline networks. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that the two newly-developed point cloud datasets are meaningful for road marking classification and segmentation tasks, contributing to the development of autonomous driving.},

However, the V2V communication could be unreliable as some factors such as hardware damage, packet loss, and cyber-attack, may lead to communication delay or failure. Considering that the communication topology of the platoon can vary dynamically due to these factors, it may result in instability and collision risk on the platoon. To mitigate the impact of communication delay or failure, the study introduces a dynamic weights optimization-based CAV following model (DWOC). It adopts the multi-predecessor following (MPF) mode with which vehicles can obtain the dynamic information of three predecessors and the corresponding information weights can be adjusted adaptively. The study formulates the string stability conditions of the model and validates the stability and safety impact on the platoon through a series of numerical experiments. The results indicate that DWOC can effectively improve the stability and safety performance under different communication delays. The findings suggest that the CAV manufacturers should account for the possible changes of the communication topology of the platoon. The proposed DWOC can serve as a reference in designing the CAV controller to ensure stability and improve safety of the platoon in reality under different communication delays.},

  abstract     = {Automotive radar sensors provide valuable information for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Radars can reliably estimate the distance to an object and the relative velocity, regardless of weather and light conditions. However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g, multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal information. However, these methods are often non-causal and unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to detect objects. Our experiments show such a method’s relevance for detecting objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while being less computationally expensive.},

  abstract     = {An accurate and robust localization system is crucial for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to enable safe driving in urban scenes. While existing global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are effective at locating vehicles in open-sky regions, achieving high-accuracy positioning in urban canyons such as lower layers of multi-layer bridges, streets beside tall buildings, tunnels, etc., remains a challenge. In this paper, we investigate the potential of cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless communications in improving the localization performance of AVs under GNSS-denied environments. Specifically, we propose the first roadside unit (RSU)-based cooperative localization framework, namely CV2X-LOCA, that only uses C-V2X channel state information to achieve lane-level positioning accuracy. CV2X-LOCA consists of four key parts: data processing module, coarse positioning module, environment parameter correcting module, and vehicle trajectory filtering module. These modules jointly handle challenges present in dynamic C-V2X networks. Extensive simulation and field experiments show that CV2X-LOCA achieves state-of-the-art performance for vehicle localization even under noisy conditions with high-speed movement and sparse RSU coverage environments. While focusing on AV localization, CV2X-LOCA also can extend to other C-V2X-equipped road users. The study results also provide insights into future investment decisions for transportation agencies regarding deploying RSUs cost-effectively.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications can facilitate traffic congestion control, reduce crashes, and enhance general safety. These goals can be reached only if vehicles communicate securely and anonymously. To this end, numerous key sharing protocols have been devised and proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, delving into the current vehicular protocols demonstrates that they have several drawbacks. First and the foremost, near all of them are improper for multi-domain internet of vehicle (IoV) environments and second, most of them failed to reach a proper tradeoff between security and effectiveness. Besides, the existing multi-domain protocols, which have been suggested for other applications, cannot still meet the desired requirements. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a resource-efficient privacy-preserving key sharing protocol for anonymous V2V communications in the IoV environments. In the proposed protocol, we utilize the blockchain and an inventive dual-signature approach. The former eases cross-domain authentication and the latter reduces the communication rounds. Security and efficiency analyses, respectively, indicate the protocol can withstand attacks and execute quite fast. Additionally, comparisons with top-related protocols show the suitable stage and precedence of the proposed multi-domain protocol.},

In this research, we demonstrate the efficient monitoring of usage levels in outdoor public parking lots using drones. We deployed a number of drones flying during the peak periods for two days over four major outdoor parking lots in Pully, Switzerland, while monitoring on-street parking in their proximity. Our proposed pipeline involves identifying parking areas through geo-referencing and an image feature matching approach, followed by vehicle detection using an innovative boosted pseudo-labeling method. Central to our pipeline is an innovative boosted pseudo-labeling technique that enhances detection accuracy by generating pseudo labels from stationary vehicles observed in multiple frames, thereby reducing the need for manual data annotations. From the video collected from our drone experiment, we automate the monitoring of the outdoor parking areas over time and days. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the occupancy rate of each parking area, encompassing both off-street and on-street parking lots, as well as dynamic interactions between different locations, and also examined the turnover rate of individual parking spots. This research represents a significant innovation in the use of drones for parking studies, providing an effective, versatile, and insightful approach for studying urban mobility and traffic management.},

However, existing arterial signal coordination studies typically assume high-penetration-rate trajectories, which are difficult to achieve in reality. Utilizing low-penetration-rate vehicle trajectories for arterial signal timing with cyclic stochastic traffic demand remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, this study developed a nonlinear optimization model for arterial signal coordination that is applicable to low-penetration-rate vehicle trajectories. Offsets and green splits were optimized to minimize the average delay of probe vehicles on both major and minor roads. Probe vehicle trajectories across cycles were aggregated into one cycle to compensate for the low penetration rate of the trajectory data. The concepts and estimation of the sampled arrival pattern, sampled departure pattern, and transition period were proposed to capture the spatiotemporal progression of probe vehicles along the arterial with varying signal timings. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution algorithm was designed to solve the proposed model. Simulation studies validated the advantages of the proposed model over the models in Synchro Studio, MULTIBAND, and the simplified model without considering the transition period. The sensitivity analysis showed that: 1) number of sampled trajectories matters instead of the penetration rate; 2) required number of sampled trajectories increases approximately linearly with the number of intersections and the demand factor; and 3) proposed model is robust to the sampling interval that is no longer than 7 s.},

Establishing a high-quality pavement crack dataset with various scenarios could help improve the robustness and generality of detection models. Therefore, this study presented the crack translator structure to achieve image style transfer, which can generate pavement crack images with different backgrounds for data augmentation. To get a better translation performance, we proposed two crack translators for comparison. The crack translator v2 was designed with attention blocks whereas crack translator v1 did not. The proposed crack translator v1 and v2 served as the weakly supervised method that was used to achieve pixel-level pavement crack detection and image transfer. Additionally, the crack translators were used to establish the dataset with various crack images and corresponding labels. Moreover, U-Net, SegNet, and W-segnet were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation by using crack translators. Two open-source datasets were used to demonstrate the generalization of the proposed models. Results demonstrate that the proposed crack translator v2 outperforms crack translator v1 and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of evaluation metrics for image translation from normal background to shadow, wet, night, and grooved backgrounds. Crack translator (v2)-based augmentation contributes to a greater improvement than conventional augmentation for crack segmentation where F1 has increased by 5% for U-Net, SegNet, and 7% for W-segnet. The crack translator v2 yields equivalent results compared with U-Net on holdout EdmCrack600 and CRKWH100 datasets. Therefore, the proposed crack translator v2 can be effectively used to augment pavement crack images and it shows great potential for pixel-level pavement crack detection. Proposed crack translator v2 provides an integrated model for both data augmentation and pixel-level segmentation.},

  abstract     = {As a novel paradigm, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) can effectively support computation-intensive or delay-sensitive applications in the Internet of Vehicles era. Computation offloading and resource management strategies are key technologies that directly determine the system cost in VEC networks. However, due to vehicle mobility and stochastic arrival computation tasks, designing an optimal offloading and resource allocation policy is extremely challenging. To solve this issue, a deep reinforcement learning-based intelligent offloading and power allocation scheme is proposed for minimizing the total delay cost and energy consumption in dynamic heterogeneous VEC networks. Specifically, we first construct an end-edge-cloud offloading model in a bidirectional road scenario, taking into account stochastic task arrival, time-varying channel conditions, and vehicle mobility. With the objective of minimizing the long-term total cost composed of the energy consumption and task delay, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) can be employed to solve such optimization problems. Moreover, considering the high-dimensional continuity of the action space and the dynamics of task generation, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based adaptive computation offloading and power allocation (DDPG-ACOPA) algorithm to solve the formulated MDP problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPG-ACOPA algorithm performs better in the dynamic heterogeneous VEC environment, significantly outperforming the other four baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {Public transit systems are the backbone of urban mobility systems in the era of urbanization. The design of transit schedules is important for the efficient and sustainable operation of public transit. However, limited studies have considered demand uncertainties when designing transit schedules. To better address demand uncertainty issues inherent in public transit systems, this paper utilizes the robust optimization (RO) framework to generate robust transit schedules against demand uncertainty. A nominal (non-robust) optimization model for the transit frequency setting problem (TFSP) under a single transit line setting is first proposed. The model is then extended to the RO-based formulation to incorporate demand uncertainty, which has not been considered in the literature. The large-scale origin-destination (OD) matrices for real-world transit problems bring computational challenges in solving the optimization problem. To efficiently generate robust transit schedules, a Transit Downsizing (TD) approach is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The proposed models are tested with real-world transit lines and data from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). Meanwhile, a stochastic programming (SP) framework is used to construct a benchmark stochastic TFSP model. Compared to the current transit schedule implemented by the CTA, the nominal TFSP model without considering demand uncertainty reduces passengers’ wait times while increasing in-vehicle travel times. After incorporating demand uncertainty, both stochastic and robust TFSP models reduce passengers’ wait times and in-vehicle travel times simultaneously. The robust transit schedules outperform the benchmark stochastic transit schedules by reducing both wait and in-vehicle travel times when demand is significantly uncertain.},

Based on this, the paper proposes an autonomous route management system to enhance the efficiency of route management in stations. As a safety critical system, the functional safety and performance analysis of the system must be evaluated before it is implemented in practical application. Hence, Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) are used to formalize and evaluate the system. Afterward, based on the proposed CPNs models, functional safety is carried out by dynamic attribute analysis and computational tree logic. Moreover, considering the impact of communication delays and processing delays on the route resource allocation, a performance analysis of the autonomous route process for trains at the station is implemented through practical parameterizations. The results indicated that the proposed autonomous route management strategy can reduce the train operating time and train arrival interval in stations by 15.63 s and 24.9 s, respectively.},

Although existing models achieve promising accuracy using complex models and video image data, they are constrained for real-time practical use given the high model complexity, time-consuming data preprocessing, and low-quality image data in the wild. To address these, the paper proposes a Spatial-Temporal Attention Graph Convolution Network model for fast pedestrian crossing intention prediction (PedAST-GCN). It uses a lightweight GCN model as the backbone network with simple but robust graph representations of pedestrian crossing intention modality features, including pedestrian pose, bounding box, and vehicle speeds. The model is validated by comparing it with state-of-the-art models on two large-scale public datasets (JAAD and PIE). The results highlight the better performance of the PedAST-GCN model for pedestrian crossing intention prediction in terms of accuracy and computation times. The ablation analysis confirms the value of the backbone layer and graph design, the designed modality features, the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies (spatial-temporal attention) and fusing heterogeneous features (modality attention), and the robust performance across various observation lengths and in the presence of noisy data.},

Most of the existing methods pay little attention to the rapidly changing trajectory information, but how to effectively solve this problem is crucial to ensure pedestrian safety. The Gabor transform has inherent advantages for capturing instantaneously changing information. Therefore, for the first time, we introduce the Gabor transformation idea into pedestrian trajectory prediction and propose the Multi-scale Learnable Gabor Transform Network (MlgtNet), which establishes global and local contextual relationships from multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspectives. The network first uses the Multi-scale Feature Dimension Enhancement Module (MFDEM) ascending dimension trajectory sequence, and uses the Multi-scale Gabor Convolution Module (MGCM) to guide the model to establish the dependence of different distances from different dimensions to model the interrelationship between global/local features at different scales and different step sizes. Finally, the Feature Fusion Module (FFM) processes the multimodal information and fuses it with the multi-scale trajectory features to obtain the trajectory prediction representation in different visual fields. The representation results are then used for secondary fusion to obtain the global prediction results. Experimental results show that MlgtNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with its lightweight model size on the vast majority of widely used trajectory prediction datasets from different perspectives.},

  abstract     = {As a critical task in autonomous driving, lane detection has caught increasing attention. Due to the inherently thin and long structure of lanes and complex external environments, current lane detection methods may not perform well, particularly in challenging driving scenarios, where lanes might be hardly visible because of extreme illumination, occlusion, absence of lane marks, and so on. To tackle the lane detection problem, we propose a novel hyper-anchor, which can take flexible shapes and provide coarse estimates of lane points. Based on hyper-anchors, multi-level lane-aware feature aggregations are proposed to integrate local lane details with global context. Specifically, lane descriptors of an adaptive receptive field are initially constructed by extracting local lane features from neighboring rows and columns. Intra-lane aggregation establishes an information flow across rows and columns within each lane descriptor. By aggregating local lane features, accurate offsets between hyper-anchors and lane points can be obtained to fine-tune the lane locations. Additionally, inter-lane feature aggregation is conducted to capture the global structural relationship of lanes. Subsequently, lane confidence is predicted to measure the overall reliability of a lane prediction and reduce false positive predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our hyper-anchor based method outperforms some state-of-the-art lane detection methods, especially in challenging driving scenarios. Meanwhile, our method also achieves desirable speed due to its efficient hyper-anchor generation and lane-aware feature aggregations.},

A promising alternative is the transformer-based model which inherently captures long-range context dependencies. Recent related studies have made impressive progress, yet the following issues remain: (1) The size of the heads in the image is large near and small far away. The existing models fail to cope well with these variations. (2) There is an imbalance in the distribution of samples across different densities in the dataset, which leads to poor network performance on density distributions with a small number of samples. To address these issues, we propose to aggregate multi-scale views through Compare and Focus strategies. In terms of the first strategy, we mine differential hints from multi-scale view features to capture heads of varying sizes. This can effectively reduce the influence of redundant information while perceiving the subtleties of various view inputs, making it simpler to establish discriminative representations. As for the second strategy, we introduce a new activation function to formulate the Region of Interest (ROI) extraction module that enables the network to focus on relevant regions effectively. It can alleviate the extreme distribution imbalance of samples with different densities. Finally, several experiments show that our method achieves SOTA performance on four challenging datasets.},

The primary smartphone activities of pedestrian are identified through a survey of 1,000 Seoul citizens, resulting in 12 categories with 81 smartphone applications. To depict pedestrian accidents based on the collected data, this research employs deep learning models and compares their performance with conventional multiple regression models. The analysis results indicate that deep learning models utilizing smartphone data achieve better performance, particularly in estimating the rate of pedestrian accidents, which is derived without the dominant factor of the living population. Using the developed model, this research estimates pedestrian accidents under scenarios of increased smartphone usage. The estimation results suggest that accidents will likely increase with the rise of popular smartphone activities such as watching videos, riding electric scooters, or using delivery services.

  abstract     = {The first exposure most people will have to fully automated vehicles will be Low-speed Automated Vehicles (LSAVs) on select corridors. LSAVs may disrupt traffic due to their slower speeds and experience increased risky overtaking by nearby drivers which could decrease safety for their occupants and surrounding road users. A field observational study compared driver behavior near an LSAV and a human-driven research vehicle across 94 passes of a 1.3-mile urban downtown route (4 straight and 4 right-turn sections). GEE analyses indicated a higher likelihood of other drivers queuing behind the LSAV when stopped, overtaking the LSAV while turning at signalized intersections, and overtaking the LSAV along straight road segments. To test whether the low speed of the LSAV was the key factor for this difference, 85 participants in a second study watched videos from the perspective of a driver following a simulated LSAV and a simulated passenger vehicle traveling at either low speeds (16 km/h) or high speeds (40 km/h). Once the simulated vehicle stopped midblock at a marked crosswalk, the participants responded whether they would, as a driver, attempt to pass the stopped vehicle. GEE analyses indicated participants were more willing to pass the vehicle if it had been portrayed as driving at a slower speed, irrespective of vehicle type. These results indicate a disruptive effect of LSAVs in mixed traffic and a need to investigate alternative communication signal designs for LSAVs, along with policy changes to mitigate these risks such as regulations on LSAV speeds and traffic separation.},

The spatio-temporal corridor is constructed based on the prediction results of surrounding vehicles. For lane change decision making, the target lane change space is determined by investigating the feasibility and space sufficiency using the spatio-temporal corridor. The set of lane crossing time which enables the safe lane change is calculated in the feasibility investigation process. The feasibility investigation secures the consistency of the decision making and motion planning. The lane change motion planning algorithm incorporates decoupled lateral and longitudinal dynamics. The lateral motion is planned based on a sampling method which refers to the lane crossing time set. Subsequently, the longitudinal motion is planned using Model Predictive Control (MPC), taking into account the results of the lateral motion planning. Simulation studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed lane change algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in our test vehicle and validated via autonomous driving tests. The vehicle test results show that the proposed algorithm plans the lane change motion safely with proper ride quality.},

  abstract     = {As one representative of last-mile logistics in intelligent transportation systems, the on-demand food delivery (OFD) service has gained rapid market growth but also faces multiple challenges. One of the critical issues is the order dispatching problem (ODP) with an NP-hard nature, which refers to dispatching a large number of orders to riders reasonably in real time with very limited decision time. To address the ODP, this paper proposes an optimization algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN) by combining the advantages of machine learning (ML) techniques and operational research (OR) methods: 1) The ML component learns to reduce the solution space by filtering out inappropriate riders for each order, handling the large-scale complexity of ODP. Specifically, we present a rider modeling approach by using GNN to better characterize rider information; besides, two attention mechanisms are designed to adaptively learn the matching relationship between riders and orders. 2) The OR component ensures the solution quality with a greedy and regret value-based dispatching heuristic. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with other existing models and algorithms. The results show that the design of our ML model is effective in yielding better prediction results, and the proposed GNN-based optimization algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the ODP by improving delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.},

Despite the abundance of trajectory datasets, few offer a comprehensive and diverse range of driving scenes, capturing multiple viewpoints of various highway layouts, merging lanes, and configurations. This limits their ability to capture the nuanced interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the roadway infrastructure. We introduce the Carolinas Highway Dataset (CHD) (CHD available at: https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Carolinas_Dataset ), a vehicle trajectory, detection, and tracking dataset. CHD is a collection of 1.6 million frames captured in highway-based videos from eye-level and high-angle POVs at eight locations across Carolinas with 338,000 vehicle trajectories. The locations, timing of recordings, and camera angles were carefully selected to capture various road geometries, traffic patterns, lighting conditions, and driving behaviors. We also present PishguVe (PishguVe code available at: https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/PishguVe ), a novel vehicle trajectory prediction architecture that uses attention-based graph isomorphism and convolutional neural networks. The results demonstrate that PishguVe outperforms existing algorithms with better ADE and FDE in eye-level, and high-angle POV trajectory datasets. Compared to best-performing models on CHD, PishguVe achieves lower ADE and FDE on eye-level data by 14.58% and 27.38%, respectively, and improves ADE and FDE on high-angle data by 8.3% and 6.9%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Signalized intersections play a pivotal role in urban traffic networks and are simultaneously impacted by congestion and pollution. The rapid advancement of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and associated technologies offers a promising solution to these efficiency and ecological challenges. Within the Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS), Level 4 CAVs enable real-time information exchange and autonomous driving at intersections. The heterogeneous traffic flow of CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) is expected to persist in the foreseeable future, increasing the complexity of traffic flow. This study introduces an adaptive speed optimization control model using the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, which predicts traffic conditions and offers optimal speed recommendations for CAVs through a multi-objective function. Additionally, this model incorporates local decision and fault tolerance mechanisms to mitigate the impact of potential network delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized CAVs smoothly and swiftly guide the entire heterogeneous traffic flow through intersections, and significantly reducing average delays and carbon emissions. Moreover, upstream intersections consideration has little impact on optimization outcomes. The model shows noticeable optimization effects as CAV penetration rates reach 30%, and becomes even more pronounced at 50% penetration rate, with optimization trends intensifying with increased flow rate. Compared to HVs, CAVs at a flow rate of 1000 veh/h witness a reduction in average delay and waiting time by 56.31 and 15.89 s, respectively, and a total decrease in CO2 emissions by 18.5%.},

However, emergency scenarios are complex and unknown, regarding UAVs to reschedule to effectively adapt to the changing environment, and existing literature addressing this challenge is limited. To address this open problem, we consider a task rescheduling problem with uncertainties such as task insertion, edge computing node (ECN) destruction, and parameter fluctuation in UAV-assisted emergency networks. The goal is to minimize the fine-grained makespan, defined as the ratio of makespan to ECNs idle time, that simultaneously characterizes the optimization of rescheduling efficiency and ECNs utilization. To address the problem, we propose an asynchronous shuffled frog-leaping with feasible Jaya (ASFJ) algorithm. In ASFJ, an asynchronous shuffled frog-leaping method independently evolves memeplexes, thereby avoiding forced information coverage. Two feasible local search operators promote the search capability and feasibility of the algorithm. Finally, we verify the advantages of the ASFJ in terms of makespan, effectiveness, and fine-grained makespan. ASFJ can save 3.83ms makespan and outperform 11.2% fine-grain makespan in insertion rescheduling. The effectiveness of destruction rescheduling is improved by at least 16%.},

The integration of GNSS and INS that can deliver continuous navigation states is widely used for intelligent vehicle systems. In this paper, we propose a tightly coupled GNSS/INS positioning framework with carrier-phase ambiguity resolution based on factor graph optimization (FGO). In this approach, a sliding window optimizer is employed to fuse the multi-GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase observations with inertial measurements. The same ambiguity within the window is considered as a state node, and the constraint on the ambiguity is continuously preserved by marginalization. To further improve the accuracy and reliability of precise positioning, the carrier-phase ambiguity resolution is introduced to the FGO-based GNSS/INS framework. When the vehicle is detected to be stationary, a zero-velocity constraint and an attitude invariant constraint will be imposed. Several experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accomplish the centimeter-level position estimation performance with beyond 90% positioning availability (horizontal&lt; 10 cm and vertical&lt; 10 cm) and outperforms the current state-of-the-art filter-based tightly coupled method.},

Meanwhile, the training data distribution is usually unbalanced, and the learned policy is challenging to cope with the corner cases during the driving process. To solve the above challenges, we present a SEMantic Masked recurrent world model (SEM2), which introduces a semantic filter to extract key driving-relevant features and make decisions via the filtered features, and is trained with a multi-source data sampler, which aggregates common data and multiple corner case data in a single batch, to balance the data distribution.

  abstract     = {Urban events, such as hurricanes, floods, and epidemic outbreaks, usually have a significant impact on crowd behaviors that may dramatically change people’s mobility patterns, interaction manners, and etc. Accurately foreseeing the abnormal crowd behaviors triggered by urban events can help authorities to dynamically schedule urban resources and services, such as providing shuttle buses, temporal shelters, and psychological first aid. However, traditional crowd behavior prediction models tend to learn regular trends and patterns of crowd traffic, and usually fail to predict the abnormal traffic fluctuations triggered by urban events. In this work, we propose a context-aware framework to accurately predict event-triggered abnormal crowd traffic by explicitly modeling event contexts and their impact. We start by training a state-of-the-art spatiotemporal multi-graph model (MG) leveraging a multi-graph convolutional network (MGCN) to model city-wide venues and their connections, as well as gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture the crowd traffic patterns within venues. In order to model the time-occasional impact of sudden influential event context (e.g., weather conditions), we propose a multi-task fusion diagram to co-train the MG model by learning a temporal impact embedding with an attention mechanism and recurrent neural network to obtain the MG-MT model. In order to model the hyper-space impact of irregularly distributed event context (e.g., epicenters and trajectories), we propose a multi-view fusion diagram to fine-tune the above-mentioned model by learning a spatial impact graph with a stimulus-response mechanism to obtain the spatiotemporal crowd traffic model (STORM). Experiments using real-world urban data collected from Xiamen, China show that our approach improves over the state-of-the-art baseline by more than 6% in predicting crowd traffic and by more than 40% in the abnormal crowd traffic part.},

  abstract     = {Object Re-identification (Re-ID), which includes person Re-ID and vehicle Re-ID, is one of the core technologies of the intelligent transportation system. Existing supervised Re-ID studies mainly focus on discriminative feature learning (e.g., attention-based methods) or metric learning (e.g., triplet-loss-based methods) to obtain more accurate matches between the probe object and the positive gallery. However, they both pay less attention to global structure information (GSI) buried in the overall datasets. In this paper, we go beyond the traditional methods that are either unaware of or locally perceiving to GSI, and consider exploring the structural relationships among all the object instances of a dataset via a graph. Specifically, we construct a graph across the entire dataset, where each object instance is treated as a node and edges are assigned with the help of a classic algorithm like KNN. Seeing that a binary edge label can be used to predict whether its associated nodes belong to the same identity, we naturally formulate the problem of Re-ID as a new link prediction problem. Inspired by the superior capacity of capturing structure information of graph convolutional networks (GCN), a GCN-based global structure embedded network (GSE-Net) is proposed to take the graph as input and output a set of linkage likelihoods. During testing, we perform the evaluation according to the node features or estimated linkage likelihood via a graph where nodes include query and gallery images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both person and vehicle Re-ID benchmarks.},

To mitigate communication burden and tackle with the problem of privacy leakage aroused by centralized forecasting methods, Federated Learning (FL) has been applied to TFF. However, existing FL-based approaches employ batch learning manner, which makes the pre-trained models inapplicable to subsequent traffic data, thus exhibiting subpar prediction performance. In this paper, we perform the first study of forecasting traffic flow adopting online learning manner in FL framework and then propose a novel prediction method named Online Spatio-Temporal Correlation-based Federated Learning (FedOSTC), aiming to guarantee performance gains regardless of traffic fluctuation. Specifically, clients employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based encoders to obtain the internal temporal patterns inside traffic data sequences. Then, the central server evaluates spatial correlation among clients via Graph Attention Network (GAT), catering to the dynamic changes of spatial closeness caused by traffic fluctuation. Furthermore, to improve the generalization of the global model for upcoming traffic data, a period-aware aggregation mechanism is proposed to aggregate the local models which are optimized using Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm at clients. We perform comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method and the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of FedOSTC.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal traffic data is vitally important in intelligent transportation systems, but traffic data values are inevitably missing due to malfunctions in sensing devices or transmission networks. This will cause trouble for the subsequent traffic flow prediction work. Low-rank tensor imputation methods have recently received increasing attention to traffic data imputation due to their ability to capture the spatial-temporal information in the way of multi-dimension. However, traffic data often encounters challenging multimodal missing scenarios, including random missing, fiber missing, and slice missing. Thus, only accounting for the global low-rankness of traffic data is less sufficient to recover missing data. Motivated by the local smoothness of traffic data, we introduce the hybrid total variation into spatiotemporal traffic data imputation framework. The proposed model consists of the tensor nuclear norm, the first-order and the second-order total variation, which presents the global low-rankness and local smoothness prior, respectively. We utilize the ADMM to effectively solve the proposed model and establish the theoretical guarantee. Numerous experiments on two real-world datasets under three multimodal missing scenarios indicate that we proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art traffic data imputation methods, especially for fiber missing and slice missing.},

  abstract     = {With the pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices, mobile users can directly visit the best travel routes matching their interests and obtain a better user experience via location-based travel recommendation services. As the number of queries grows, the travel agency for location-based travel recommendations tends to outsource its recommendation services to the cloud server. Since the travel agency’s popular travel routes and raw trajectory data from mobile users contain sensitive information, privacy protection should be guaranteed. Although some schemes have been proposed to solve the privacy problems, no previous works related to the location-based recommendation are proposed over mobile users’ raw trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving travel recommendation scheme based on stay points over the raw encrypted trajectory data. Specifically, we first propose an adapted longest common subsequence computation algorithm to measure the similarity of two trajectories. Second, to support some computations under ciphertext, we design several secure two-party computation (S2PC) primitives (e.g., secure division, secure mean coordinate, and secure comparison) based on the Paillier cryptosystem. Third, we implement secure stay points extraction and adapted longest common subsequence computation protocols via these secure computation primitives. Finally, we analyze the security of our proposed scheme in the semi-honest model and show that the privacy of mobile users’ trajectories, query results, and the travel agency’s popular travel routes are well protected. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of each secure computation primitive and conduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, and the experimental results show that our scheme is practical in the real applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a modified car-following model for the heterogeneous traffic flow with connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which considers different car-following modes and heterogeneous reaction time delays of vehicles. The proposed model uses the vehicle’s own state and the front vehicle’s acceleration to adjust the vehicle’s motion. Based on the modified model and the control theory, the string stability condition of the heterogeneous traffic flow is given. Then, a robust control scheme is designed for the heterogeneous traffic system with different car-following modes and multiple delays, and its stabilizing effect is analyzed by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Next, considering the external disturbance in the actual driving environment, this paper performs robust $H_{\infty }$ control synthesis for the heterogeneous traffic flow with the proposed controller. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by simulation experiments. Numerical results show that introducing the adjustment term with a certain parameter range and increasing the CAV penetration rate can strengthen the stability of the heterogeneous traffic flow, while increasing reaction time delays reduces the stability of the heterogeneous traffic. In addition, compared with the existing control method, the proposed control scheme can make vehicles in the platoon run more smoothly under disturbance, thus improving the performance of the traffic system. Furthermore, the impact of the proposed car-following model and $H_{\infty }$ controller on the macroscopic performance of the heterogeneous traffic system is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a point cloud background filtering method and explores applications that integrate LiDAR technology into roadside sensor networks, addressing challenges in handling large volumes of sparse and unstructured 3D data. Traditional methods, which classify background points based on descriptive statistics over many frames, are computationally inefficient for roadside LiDAR surveillance. This study introduces a novel approach using hash-based transformation combined with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) techniques, enhancing the efficiency of high-dimensional multivariate modeling of LiDAR data. This Hash-based Gaussian Mixture Modeling (HGMM) optimizes feature selection and Gaussian components using AIC and BIC scores, mitigating computational burdens and parameter sensitivity. Unlike Cartesian coordinate-based techniques, HGMM processes LiDAR data in Spherical coordinates, preserving meaningful patterns and structures. For infrastructure LiDAR, object detection only pertains to a small amount of data in a fixed environment, allowing background reduction modeling to significantly enhance data chain efficiency by transitioning only a tiny portion of the foreground LiDAR point clouds. The method was tested on diverse LiDAR datasets, including the New Brunswick DataCity Testbed dataset, Transportation Forecasting Competition (TRANSFOR 24) Dataset, DAIR-V2X, and A9-Dataset, demonstrating its adaptability and efficiency across different scenarios. This approach enhances LiDAR sensors’ utility in supporting AI-enhanced decision-making processes and enriching the knowledge base of incorporating LiDAR sensors into current and prospective traffic management strategies.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become an excellent solution for alleviating the burden of the traffic system and improving safety. However, the large-scale application of AVs is significantly restrained by the high-power cost of their numerous sensors and processors, which can reach hundreds of watts and occupy most of the vehicular power consumption. To meet such tremendous computation requirements, most AVs rely on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication with mobile edge computing (MEC) techniques to relocate their tasks to external computing. In this paper, the problem of optimizing the task and path assignment process in the V2X-MEC system is tackled for further reducing vehicular power consumption with the constraint of transmission latency. We incorporate the Nash Equilibrium (NE) concept for generating the optimal assignment of tasks and paths, and the attractor selection model (ASM) is introduced to flexibly allocate tasks with consideration of different energy-saving requirements. With comprehensive simulation experiments, we show that the proposed method can save approximately 85% energy compared with the method without task assignment, and it is over 9% and 16% better than the shortest path assignment method and the minimum average delay method, respectively. Besides, the power consumption in AVs with low remaining electricity can be further reduced by over 43%.},

However, mathematical optimization application to expansive subway systems is uncertain due to challenges in coordinating multiple lines, the necessity for integration with passenger demand, and multi-modal coordination. This study comprehensively reviews three main sub-stages of timetabling research areas: nominal, robust, and rescheduling problems. We synthesized the relevant studies considering the mathematical modeling of designed strategies, the incorporated stakeholders’ views, the characteristics of solution methods, and the extent of their practical use. Recent efforts to enhance subway system resiliency have had a limited focus on applying artificial intelligence methodologies to subway train timetabling, particularly emphasizing rescheduling problems. In the future, the research community is expected to broaden the application of artificial intelligence to encompass various aspects of subway train timetabling, incorporating four suggested considerations. These include coordination between multiple traffic modes, risk control, deep learning and mathematical optimization, and carbon peaking and neutrality goals to achieve standardized net-zero carbon emission objectives. These considerations represent a strategic pathway towards the next generation of subway train control systems. To conclude, the study aims to introduce theoretical aspects and research gaps in subway timetabling for the dedicated subway network and to provide future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Video-based person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a hot research topic in intelligent transportation systems, which aims to retrieve video sequences of the same person under non-overlapping surveillance cameras. Compared with static images, video sequences contain more visual information from multiple views, such as spatial and temporal views. However, previous Re-ID methods usually focus on single limited views, lacking diverse observations from different views. To capture richer perceptions and extract more comprehensive representations, we propose a novel learning framework named Trigeminal Transformers (TMT) to tackle video-based person Re-ID. More specifically, we first design a View-wise Projector (VP) to jointly transform raw videos from spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal views. In addition, inspired by the great success of Vision Transformers (ViT), we introduce the Transformer structure for information enhancement and aggregation. In our work, three Self-view Transformers (ST) are proposed to exploit the relationships of local features for information enhancement in spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal. Moreover, a Cross-view Transformer (CT) is proposed to aggregate the multi-view features for comprehensive representations. Experimental results indicate that our approach can obtain better performance than some other state-of-the-art approaches on four public Re-ID benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The convenience behind modern intelligent vehicles is simply that a group of intelligent electronic control units (ECUs) connected to controller area network (CAN) work in concert. However, quite a lot of studies have shown their security concerns about CAN. In this era of rampant cyberattacks, due to the broadcast mechanism of CAN and the lack of necessary security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication, ECUs are easily disturbed by various cyberattacks, thus leading to vehicle failures. To solve this problem, we propose a novel security authentication protocol based on the core concept of moving target defense, namely MTDCAP, which utilizes MaskedID and hash chains to maintain anonymity externally and ensure the authentication of the sender internally. Unlike general hash chain-based authentication, our protocol creatively incorporates a self-renewal mechanism into the hash chain, which effectively reduces the time overhead and security risk of negotiating the update of the hash chain between both communicating parties. In addition, AES serves to encrypt CAN message payload so as to prevent adversaries from eavesdropping. The theoretical analysis for the security against four kinds of attacks (i.e., eavesdropping, impersonation, replay, and bus-off attacks) in MTDCAP is detailed. Afterwards, a series of protocol evaluations are conducted on two kinds of typical hardware platforms, including T-Box from real vehicle supported by XPeng, and the results reveal that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms the existing protocols in the robustness, bus load, and time overhead. In particular, the authentication overhead on T-Box is only 0.18 ms for MTDCAP.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads, developing robust control strategies to navigate the uncertainty of human-driven vehicles (HVs) is crucial. This paper introduces an advanced method for modeling HV behavior, combining a first-principles model with Gaussian process (GP) learning to enhance velocity prediction accuracy and provide a measurable uncertainty. We validated this innovative HV model using real-world data from field experiments and applied it to develop a GP-enhanced model predictive control (GP-MPC) strategy. This strategy aims to improve safety in mixed vehicle platoons by integrating uncertainty assessment into distance constraints. Comparative simulation studies with a conventional model predictive control (MPC) approach demonstrated that our GP-MPC strategy ensures more reliable safe distancing and fosters efficient vehicular dynamics, achieving notably higher speeds within the platoon. By incorporating a sparse GP technique in HV modeling and adopting a dynamic GP prediction within the MPC framework, we significantly reduced the computation time of GP-MPC, marking it only 4.6% higher than that of the conventional MPC. This represents a substantial improvement, making the process about 100 times faster than our preliminary work without these approximations. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of learning-based HV modeling in enhancing both safety and operational efficiency in mixed-traffic environments, paving the way for more harmonious AV-HV interactions.},

First, a system model is developed that incorporates system internal uncertainties, external disturbances, input saturation, and actuator faults. Then, to address the full-state constraint problem, the original constrained system is transformed into an equivalent unconstrained one by using a new state-dependent transformation function. In addition, to solve asymmetric time-varying constraints on the control input, another new transformation function is also designed. In the end, based on the transformed system, a novel adaptive control scheme is proposed utilizing the backstepping recursive method and first-order filters. It is demonstrated that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately bounded, and the output variables accurately track the reference signals while satisfying both full-state constraints and input saturation.

  abstract     = {Automatic roads detection is an essential task for traffic safety and intelligent transportation systems. Recently the long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarization imaging-based road detection technique has obtained significant progresses. However, the joint analysis among multiple polarization characteristics, sparse inter-channel information (along the z-axis), and dense intra-channel information (inside the x-y plane), have not been considered effectively, hindering the effective detection of many road areas. Additionally, most of the existing methods often encounter a challenging trade-off between achieving high precision and maintaining a lightweight design. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel L ightweight M ulti- P athway C ollaborative 2D / 3D C onvolutional Net works (LMPC2D3DCNet) with a small number of parameters for full-time road detection. Our LMPC2D3DCNet is the first attempt to incorporate 2D and 3D convolutional networks to balance extraction for sparse inter-channel polarization information and dense intra-channel polarization information, in which a new Cross 2D-3D Non-Local Attention (C2D3DNLA) network is proposed to derive respective latent features by exploiting both local and global polarization correlations. Meanwhile, it also follows the design of a multipath network structure that elegantly fuses plenty of low-frequency, high-frequency, and multiscale polarization information, thus obtaining more accurate modeling for road regions. Extensive experiments on one public infrared polarization dataset of road scenes demonstrate that our proposed LMPC2D3DCNet (The code will release soon on https://github.com/XueqiangF ) achieves PRE of 96.96%, REC of 96.71%, OA of 99.45%, F1 of 96.72, BER of 1.80% and IoU of 93.85%, and outperforms significantly state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The predictive energy management (PEM) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is a challenging problem of trajectory optimization involving future information. Most previous studies have presented intuitive methods for selecting parameters that represent future information. However, such intuitive methods lack theoretical analysis and do not guarantee global optimality. This study adopts the novel perspective that the PEM problem can be analytically solved so as to ensure near-optimal efficiency. The key idea is to reformulate the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratic programming (QP) problem based on optimal control principles. The equivalence between the original and QP problems is theoretically derived. The proposed PEM strategy is then implemented by solving the QP problem at every sampling time to obtain the optimal control input. Whereas the original problem requires information on the entire future trajectory, which is difficult to predict accurately, the QP problem requires only lumped parameters, specifically, the energy demands and time durations of each segment of the future path. These lumped future driving parameters can potentially be predicted using information obtained through vehicle connectivity. Simulation results obtained under a real-world driving scenario show that the proposed PEM strategy provides a control result in real time (within 2 ms) that is very close to the globally optimal solution both qualitatively and quantitatively, with a loss of optimality of only 0.14%.},

The occurrence of actuator saturation may lead to tracking errors beyond the given performance boundary, which may further cause the performance degradation or even instability. To this end, two modified fixed-time performance functions (MFxTPFs) are designed, based on which a PPC method is proposed to make the performance boundary can be autonomously adjusted when saturation occurs, while reducing the overshoot of the tracking error, and ensuring that the tracking errors converge to the prescribed region in a predefined time. An adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control (FxTSMC) scheme, wherein a fixed-time auxiliary system is introduced to compensate the saturation approximate error, is given based on the PPC method, guaranteeing both fixed-time individual vehicle stability and fixed-time string stability. In such a way, the restriction that convergence time depends on initial conditions is eliminated. Also, the phenomenon of singularity is avoided and a faster convergence rate is obtained. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with the Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning (MVTP) problem in unstructured conflict areas. Compared with MVTP on structured roads, the more complex intersection and the more conflicting motions of vehicles, set higher requirements for the real-time of the planner. To address the issue, this work proposes a centralized decision-making distributed planning framework, to generate trajectories for multiple vehicles navigating conflict areas on unstructured roads. In the multi-vehicle collaboration process, vehicles are assigned a priority upon entering the control area, with higher-priority vehicles treated as dynamic obstacles to be avoided. The distributed planning is divided into three stages: 1) trajectory search utilizing Velocity-Hybrid A* (V-Hybrid A*), 2) path optimization with respect to both dynamic and static obstacles, and 3) speed optimization leveraging the convex space created by the initial solution. In the trajectory search of individual vehicles, each expansion node of V-Hybrid A* is given an acceleration to get a coarse trajectory with discrete velocity. Moreover, a box constraint is established to optimize the path of the coarse trajectory. Then, according to the homotopy class provided by the coarse trajectory, speed optimization is carried out to obtain the final single vehicle trajectory. In our simulation experiments, we randomized the generation of numerous vehicles assigned with varied tasks to evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness. Ultimately, real-vehicle experiments substantiated the algorithm’s practical feasibility. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the traffic efficiency in conflict areas and has practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, the demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging has increased, leading to an irregular fluctuation in EV inflow at the Charging Stations (CS). The policy-makers, therefore, need to have an infrastructure planning mechanism that addresses this fluctuation by estimating the ideal location and capacity of these CSs. This problem is known as the Charging Station Siting and Sizing Problem (CSSSP). Due to the uncertainty in EV inflow, the possible non-availability of charging ports, and the resulting unpredictability in the queueing time, a limited number of EVs can get charged. To minimize this dissatisfaction with charging, we model the uncertainty in the EV demand in terms of a statistical distribution varying over time. We propose a queueing mechanism that accounts for the demand distribution over time but restricts the waiting time by a given threshold. With this mechanism, we propose an iterative heuristic algorithm where an initial allocation of ports is obtained using a policy. Then a statistical approximation approach is proposed to estimate the total unsatisfied EVs within a CS for the given port allocation as a derived random variable. Finally, an approach is proposed to intelligently rearrange the charging ports across the CSs, resulting in a fresh allocation. We repeat the steps until there is no further reduction in the unsatisfied demands. We validate the performance of the proposed method against the Monte Carlo simulation and provide a comparative analysis.},

In recent years, safeguarding vehicle location privacy in IoV has been a topic of concern. However, the independent location privacy protection mechanisms cannot consistently meet the rigorous security requirements of various IoV scenarios, which will pose a significant threat to the location privacy of IoV users. In contrast, risk sensing as a preventive security strategy needs lower computing costs and is more suitable for the intricacies of complex city environments. Unfortunately, the existing works lack that combination of risk assessment with trust assessment to conduct a comprehensive study on location privacy risk sensing. Therefore, considering the city vehicles’ spatial clustering phenomenon and the strong regularity of traffic flow, we propose a risk-sensing approach to vehicle location privacy based on the continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment strategy. This approach employs the Ripley method to analyze space clustering characteristics and combines the traffic flow prediction model to establish the risk assessment scheme. Furthermore, to enable our risk-sensing approach to have historical memory that can identify and continuously track malicious users, we incorporate a penalty factor into the trust assessment scheme that updates in a time iterative format. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the adaptability and reliability of our proposed risk-sensing approach to vehicle location privacy.},

Existing cooperative control methods struggle to explicitly represent dynamic interaction, which can lead to dangerous behavior, severe congestion, and even accidents. In this paper, we propose a cooperative control methodology that aims to improve safety and efficiency in the merging zone by deeply representing dynamic interaction among multiple CAVs. Our proposed methodology, named GMA-DRL, utilizes a spatial graph convolutional encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism to explicitly represent dynamic interaction among vehicles. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning based on Actor-Critic with temporal relation regularization is utilized to ensure the consistency of dynamic interaction and generate cooperative driving actions for multiple CAVs. The GMA-DRL is tested in a series of typical merging scenarios with dynamic interaction. Extensive experimental results show that the GMA-DRL outperforms the existing cooperative control models in term of headway, average speed and acceleration. It demonstrates that the GMA-DRL with explicitly represent dynamic interaction can improve safety and efficiency of multiple CAVs in the merging zone.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive safety distance that is adjusted along the uncertain braking duration of the object vehicle resulting in an improvement of driving comfort. In the real world, the object vehicle decelerates for uncertain duration, while the conventional strategies assume that the object vehicle decelerates until full stop. By imposing a constraint on the ego vehicle to stop simultaneously with the object vehicle, the driving comfort is enhanced by activating full braking (FB) only when it is necessary. To accomplish these, two concepts are proposed; effective collision avoidance (ECA) condition and full braking activation parameter (FBAP). ECA refers to a strategy in which the ego vehicle stops simultaneously with the object vehicle to account for its uncertain deceleration duration. FBAP is suggested to determine when to activate FB by adjusting the duration of partial braking (PB). Virtual experiments are conducted strictly with various scenarios to validate the performance of the proposed FBAP-based safety distance. The test results demonstrate that the suggested FBAP-based safety distance is applicable to a wide range of driving speeds, improving driving comfort and performing collision avoidance compared to conventional methods.},

However, existing methods struggle to fulfill the requirements of prescribed enclosing performance and collision avoidance in a constrained environment. To address aforementioned issues, this paper aims to propose a performance-designated reinforcement learning-based enclosing control (PDRLEC) scheme for UAVs to achieve target circle approximation with specified manners while ensuring collision avoidance. Particularly, an adaptive variable performance function is designed to effectively address the singularity problem existing in the prescribed performance control (PPC). Additionally, by converting radial deviation and distance between UAVs and obstacles into two skilled barrier functions, the reinforcement learning (RL) module is endowed with the ability to handle performance constraints and achieve obstacle bypassing. The proposed PDRLEC, which consists of a robust enclosing item and a RL-related module, can achieve optimal enclosing with enhanced sample efficiency and elevated reward values while striking a balance between collision avoidance and target enclosure. Finally, abundant simulations are provided to corroborate the feasibility and superiority of developed PDRLEC.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the trajectory of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) through cooperation with signal controllers can smoothen the traffic flow and reduce energy consumption. However, most existing research efforts in this domain do not consider the effect of stochastic disturbances generated by exogenous systems. Ignoring these stochasticities may cause a mismatch between the estimated and real vehicle dynamics, which may result in a deviation among implemented and optimized trajectories, inefficient operational performance, and even collisions in the worst-case condition. This paper introduces a two-stage optimization model for CAVs trajectory and signal timing control that considers and responds to uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. The signal controller receives the speed, acceleration, and position of incoming CAVs within the communication range and identifies incoming platoons based on vehicle headways. At the upper stage, a mixed-integer linear program within the signal controller optimizes the trajectories of the platoon leaders and signal timing parameters. At the lower stage, platoon leaders optimize the trajectories of all other vehicles within the platoon based on a chance-constrained concept to consider uncertainties involved in implementing optimized trajectories. We utilize a sample-based approximation of the collision probabilities to formulate constraints to control vehicle trajectory. The resulting formulation ensures that the probability of satisfying inter-vehicle safety distance is above a certain threshold and reduces the probability of longitudinal crashes between vehicles. The proposed framework shows a 48%-67% reduction in travel delays in comparison with optimized fixed-time signal timing plans in a simulated signalized intersection under different levels of uncertainty in vehicle dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The rise of smart cities is directly connected to the increasing use of vehicles. The growing vehicle utilization has driven the emergence of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), facilitating instant information exchange among vehicles. The system provides essential information regarding road conditions, traffic patterns, and more relevant data. VANETs encompass two fundamental categories of communication exchanges, namely Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I). V2I technology facilitates the integration of cars and transportation infrastructure, enabling effective communication between vehicles and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the potential of V2I communication has various security concerns arising from prevalent security threats. Current authentication techniques encounter challenges regarding complexity, security, and privacy considerations. We designed a hash-based lightweight and anonymous authentication scheme to address the aforementioned restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of authentication in V2I architecture. This scheme effectively combines identity, password, and bio-metric to enhance resistance against impersonation, denial of service, and privileged insider attacks. The devised scheme distinguishes itself by a comparative analysis and security proofs, highlighting its superior capability in guaranteeing secure authentication in V2I communication. The comprehensive security analysis conducted formally and informally showcases the robustness of the proposed solution against several threats. The performance evaluation results show that our scheme demonstrates a decrease in the computational cost of 51.40% approximately and a reduction in communication overhead of around 22.57%. These results establish the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme as a viable solution for V2I architecture.},

  abstract     = {Express pickup and delivery systems play crucial roles in contemporary urban areas. Couriers within these systems retrieve packages from designated Areas of Interest (AOI) that the express company assigns to them during specific time intervals. The express company traditionally employs historical pickup request data for executing AOI assignments (or pickup request assignments) for couriers, and these assignments are conventionally static and do not evolve over time However, future pickup requests display significant temporal variations. Employing historical data for future assignments is, therefore, somewhat impractical. Furthermore, even if we were to predict future pickup requests beforehand and subsequently employ these predictions for assignments, this two-stage approach proves to be both impractical and trivial, potentially harboring drawbacks. For example, the better prediction results may not necessarily guarantee better clustering outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce an intelligent end-to-end predict-then-optimize clustering method that simultaneously forecasts future pickup requests for AOIs and dynamically allocates AOIs to couriers through clustering. Initially, we propose a deep learning-based prediction model for predicting order quantities within AOIs. Subsequently, we present a differential constrained K-means clustering method for AOI clustering based on the prediction results. Finally, we introduce a one-stage end-to-end predict-then-optimize clustering approach for the rational, dynamic, and intelligent allocation of AOIs to couriers. Our results demonstrate that this one-stage predict-then-optimize method significantly enhances optimization outcomes, namely the quality of clustering results. This study offers valuable insights that are relevant to predict-then-optimize-related tasks, particularly when addressing stochastic assignment problems within all types of express systems.},

  abstract     = {As vehicle automation advances, motion planning algorithms face escalating challenges in achieving safe and efficient navigation. Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) primarily focus on basic tasks, leaving unexpected scenarios for human intervention, which can be error-prone. Motion planning approaches for higher levels of automation in the state-of-the-art are primarily oriented toward the use of risk- or anti-collision constraints, using over-approximates of the shapes and sizes of other road users to prevent collisions. These methods however suffer from conservative behavior and the risk of infeasibility in high-risk initial conditions. In contrast, our work introduces a novel multi-objective trajectory generation approach. We propose an innovative method for constructing risk fields that accommodates diverse entity shapes and sizes, which allows us to also account for the presence of potentially occluded objects. This methodology is integrated into an occlusion-aware trajectory generator, enabling dynamic and safe maneuvering through intricate environments while anticipating (possible hidden) road users and traveling along the infrastructure toward a specific goal. Through theoretical underpinnings and simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our approach. This paper bridges crucial gaps in motion planning for automated vehicles, offering a pathway toward safer and more adaptable autonomous navigation in complex urban contexts.},

  abstract     = {Accurate velocity estimation of surrounding moving objects and their trajectories are critical elements of perception systems in Automated/Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with a direct impact on their safety. These are non-trivial problems due to the diverse types and sizes of such objects and their dynamic and random behaviour. Recent point cloud based solutions often use Iterative Closest Point (ICP) techniques, which are known to have certain limitations. For example, their computational costs are high due to their iterative nature, and their estimation error often deteriorates as the relative velocities of the target objects increase (&gt;2 m/sec). Motivated by such shortcomings, this paper first proposes a novel Detection and Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) for AVs based on an optical flow technique, which is proven to be computationally efficient and highly accurate for such problems. This is achieved by representing the driving scenario as a vector field and applying vector calculus theories to ensure spatiotemporal continuity. We also report the results of a comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed DATMO technique, carried out in this study using synthetic and real-world data. The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique, compared to the DATMO techniques in the literature, in terms of estimation accuracy and processing time in a wide range of relative velocities of moving objects. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the sensitivity of the estimation error of the proposed DATMO technique to various system and environmental parameters, as well as the relative velocities of the moving objects.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and resilient traffic management relies on accurate prediction of air traffic states. However, the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of air traffic networks make this task challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning framework, named Physics-Informed Graph Attention Transformer (PIGAT), which leverages real-world data and knowledge to predict essential air traffic state parameters. Our approach utilizes fine-grained traffic state detection to extract critical features from aviation databases. The model employs GAT-based spatial learning blocks with temporal Transformers to capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of data. A dynamic graph generator layer is also utilized to update the airport network’s topological structure adaptively, strengthening the model prediction’s effectiveness. Furthermore, the fluid queuing-theoretic PDEs are incorporated into the loss function, enhancing the model’s interpretability and reliability. Our framework is evaluated on real-world air traffic datasets from 36 major airport hubs within the US. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework efficiently makes accurate predictions and outperforms eight baselines. In conclusion, our proposed framework has the potential to be applied in real-time decision-making systems for air traffic management and provides promising directions for future research.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of whether pedestrians will cross the street is prevalently recognized as an indispensable function of autonomous driving systems, especially in urban environments. How to utilize the complementary information present in different types of data (or modalities) is one of the major challenges. This paper makes the first attempt to develop a cross-modal transformer-based crossing intention prediction model merely using bounding boxes and ego-vehicle speed as input features. The cross-modal transformer can leverage self-attention and cross-modal attention to mine the modality-specific and complementary correlation. A bottleneck feature fusion is presented to obtain the compressed feature representation. To facilitate the network training, we further put forward a novel uncertainty-aware multi-task learning method that jointly predicts the future bounding box as well as crossing action such that the commonalities and differences across two tasks can be exploited. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies are performed on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that by only using the bounding box and ego-vehicle speed as input features, our model is on a par with other state-of-the-art approaches that rely on more inputs, and even achieves superior performance in most cases.

Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) has emerged as a novel paradigm with a substantial increase in data exchange within Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). VCC integrates cloud computing, vehicular networking, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. It enables Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle-to-Device (V2D) communication. VCC optimizes vehicle, cloud infrastructure, and IoT resources while addressing significant communication security and vehicle-user privacy challenges. To address these issues, we developed an RFID-based authentication protocol for VCC based on a Henon map using a hash function. In addition, we also incorporated a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to resist physical tampering attacks. We validate the protocol’s security formally and informally. The formal security analysis is conducted through a widely used RoR model. We use the Scyther simulation tool to verify the proposed protocol’s security against various attacks. Moreover, we compare the performance of our protocol with similar existing protocols across important performance parameters such as communication and computation overheads and security attributes. The proposed protocol yields substantial improvements, demonstrating a 40.74% reduction in computation overhead and a 13.03% decrease in communication overhead as compared to related protocols, delivering both enhanced performance and resource efficiency. The analysis demonstrates its capacity to support secure communication in the VCC environment and satisfy desirable security attributes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a large-scale multi-objective gate assignment model is constructed by considering the flight international and domestic attributes, task type, airline affiliation, and aircraft type. Then a multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition mechanism, namely MOQEA/D is developed to solve the constructed model effectively. Specifically, a new decomposition mechanism is designed to decompose the multi-objective GAP into several single-objective sub-GAPs. Each quantum bit string solves a single-objective sub-GAP independently. And a new optimal crossover strategy is proposed to limit the randomness of observation operations and maximize the preservation of excellent genes to further improve the optimization performance. Finally, the multi-objective knapsack problem and the multi-objective GAP are selected to verify the effectiveness of the MOQEA/D. The experiment results demonstrate that the MOQEA/D can effectively solve large-scale multi-objective knapsack problem and obtain ideal gate assignment results. It takes on very significance and application value in solving complex optimization problems.},

However, the accuracy of the pothole detection is still far from satisfactory and has the potential to be increased. One of the challenges is the diversity of the training samples. Another challenge is the extension of mature computer vision models. Therefore, in this paper, we created a pothole dataset with multiple road conditions and environments via samples of previous studies and developed an extended mask R-CNN model. Based on the created dataset, we compared the proposed model with the traditional model using the ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 networks. The experimental results show a $mAP_{0.5}$ of 92.1% on the test dataset, surpassing the traditional backbone networks ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 by 3.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Furthermore, we compared the details of the different models. The experimental results show that the total area prediction error is only 3.19% on the test dataset.

  abstract     = {Evaluation of crack severity in flexible pavements predominantly centers around the analysis of cracks’ surface characteristics. However, this study highlights the critical importance of 3D crack parameters, including volume and depth, for comprehensive assessment. The objective here is to develop an autonomous crack severity assessment, by predicting the vertical parameters of cracks exclusively from their surface properties. To achieve this, a dataset of 3D parameters comprising 200 cracks from eight flexible pavements was acquired, and both linear and nonlinear correlations were conducted among these 3D parameters. Subsequently, five single-output and one multi-output machine learning models were developed to explore the potential of utilizing surface parameters to predict the vertical parameters of cracks. The outcomes validated the effectiveness of two specific methods, namely, Artificial Neural Network and Extreme Gradient Boosting models, in predicting crack volume based on surface parameters, with R2 scores of 0.832 and 0.748, respectively. Additionally, the multi-output machine learning model we developed achieved classification prediction of the crack damage penetration depth using surface parameters, yielding optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.790, 0.779, and 0.761, respectively. This study has introduced a crack damage evaluation index, based on a 3D assessment, that relates crack depth classification to severity. We provide suggestions that could pave the way for informed decision-making on maintenance strategies that could be adopted to extend asset life cycle.},

However, it is a challenging task in inland river because of the complicated and changeable environment as well as high-density ships in narrow waterway. As one of the primary technologies, obstacle trajectory locating and tracking has been widely explored in recent years. Current approaches strictly rely on lidar as only depth awareness sensor and the limited measurement range severely restricts them for distant object identification. On this account, we creatively propose a point cloud-light field fusion perception framework in this paper for the first time. Specifically, in detection stage, the former undertakes precise close object perception and the latter completes distant object locating through light field stereo matching. In tracking stage, a novel four-phase data association that combines multiple attributes from position, point cloud and image domains is utilized for accurate object matching across frames. To validate the effectiveness of our multimodal perception strategy, we implement an acquisition system consisting of two lidars and four sets of simplified light field cameras on a ship to conduct actual testing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves superior 3D object locating and tracking performance, far surpassing the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and real-time.},

In contrast, video data can describe the visual appearance of nearshore objects without prior information, such as identity, location, or movement. In this study, we introduce a cross-modality pipeline to address the four major challenges of NMOT. First, we propose introducing a cross-modality bi-attention transformer (CBT) manage the information interaction between RGB and thermal infrared videos effectively. This decoupling and guidance mechanism laid the foundation for our subsequent processes. Next, we integrate the outputs of the backbone with historical frames to extract crucial temporal features. Subsequently, we refine small object detection performance by employing multi-scale feature alignment (MFA). Observations are generated by the transformer decoder. To tackle challenges arising from extensive occlusion and interactions induced by waves in NMOT, we propose guiding modulation (GM), supplemented by low-confidence boxes and multi-point corner momentum (MCM) to facilitate association. Our approach is simple, online, and real-time, showcasing outstanding performance in benchmark evaluations.

We create intent messages using commercially available V2X radios, and demonstrate experimentally the benefits of sharing intent in cooperative maneuvering. Experiments are performed on a test track where intent-based on-board decision assistance is provided to human drivers in merge scenarios. The experimental results reveal significant benefits of intent sharing in enhancing vehicle safety and time efficiency.

In this paper, an adaptive optimal control method with prescribed performance is proposed to solve this problem, which contains two contributions: 1) by introducing a prescribed performance function (PPF) into adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), the controller can constrain the tracking error of the system within a specified performance boundary while optimizing the control cost; 2) the critic-only ADP is used for the controller design, which simplifies the commonly used actor-critic ADP scheme, and the convergence of the estimation error is guaranteed under FE conditions. On this basis, the neural network identification technique is introduced to deal with the unknown dynamic parameters of the vehicle system. The control scheme is able to strictly guarantee user-defined vehicle performance specifications with approximately optimal control performance. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously demonstrated by the Lyapunov method. In addition, the controller also embeds a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) compensator to approximate the nonlinear external disturbances of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the efficiency of the controller to achieve autonomous vehicle path tracking is verified by CarSim-Simulink simulation.},

  abstract     = {With the large-scale commercial use of 5G technology, the era of Mobile Edge Computing with the Internet of Everything as the core is opening. Various computing resources are deployed to the edge of the network near the mobile smart terminal, forming a mobile edge environment for numerous application scenarios. Under this environment, the mobile edge network needs to use the path selection method to obtain one or more service data transmission paths and seamlessly migrates the service data to the most appropriate edge server, to ensure the continuity of edge services and reduce the resource occupation of the mobile edge network. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of Cost-awareServiceMigration Path Selection based on DeepReinforcement Learning (SMART), aiming to jointly optimize communication costs and communication delays under the premise of meeting service requirements. This method transforms the service migration path selection problem in the mobile edge environment into a bi-objective optimization problem under dual constraints, i.e., to find low-latency, low-cost and high-quality service migration paths while satisfying the constraints of computing power resources and transmission time of mobile smart terminals. Then, a DQN is used to construct the corresponding Markov chain decision model according to the problem scenario to find the optimal path for edge service migration. The proposed method learns to select the optimal edge service migration path through the interaction with the environment without obtaining a large amount of historical edge service migration path information in advance. The experimental results onShanghai (Beijing) Telecom mobile communication base station dataset and Shanghai (Beijing) taxi trajectory dataset show that the proposed method can efficiently select low-latency, low-cost, high-quality edge service migration paths in mobile edge environment when vehicles move continuously.It outperforms six typical edge service migration path selection methods, i.e.,Q-learning, A-Star, PLP, PLP/F, PLP/P, and Dijkstra, by at least 15% in all evaluation metrics except computational time.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular digital twin networks (VDTNs) offer great opportunities for driver safety enhancements. By leveraging digital twin (DT) technology, VDTNs can collect and analyze traffic data to optimize driving routes, and allow the out-of-field vehicles to share traffic data via their DTs. However, the real-time data sharing process over a public channel raises concerns about security and privacy. Existing data sharing schemes cannot be directly adopted for VDTNs because they rarely consider dual (data and identity) privacy, synchronization, and flexibility, while also imposing a significant cost on resource-limited entities. To address these challenges, we propose a secure and flexible data sharing scheme with dual privacy protection for VDTNs. In the proposed scheme, a signature of knowledge protocol is developed for protecting the vehicle’s real identity and ensuring authentication, smart contract algorithms are designed to assist in realizing accountability, and a verification control mechanism is devised for allowing the vehicle to flexibly share the traffic data. Additionally, DT with consistent states is capable of removing sensitive information from the shared data, which guarantees synchronization and data privacy. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is resilient against potential security threats in VDTNs. Furthermore, the performance evaluation indicates that the proposed scheme not only outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes but also achieves feasible blockchain consumption and data authentication delay.},

By inventing DWS-based floating feet, wave-induced forces can be independently absorbed by dampers, thereby significantly attenuating vibrations of the main hull. By dynamics optimization, key parameters of damper springs are numerically determined. Furthermore, the reliable safety of suspension mechanism under various conditions is ensured by finite element analysis on the strength validation. Virtual prototype results show that suspension-damping objective of the main hull can be further promoted by 52.3% after fine optimization on damper springs, while key connecting parts of the suspension mechanism are fully able to afford sufficient stress under diversified conditions.

  abstract     = {In the realm of road surveillance systems, Automatic Incident Detection (AID) methods have shown promise in swiftly and precisely detecting traffic anomalies. Nevertheless, the paucity of frame-level precisely annotated training data poses substantial challenges. To navigate this issue, we introduce TA-NET, a novel framework designed to highly efficient traffic anomaly detection. TA-NET utilizes a generic dataset pre-training model to facilitate weakly supervised learning. It comprises two main modules: the Adaptive Hierarchical Feature Reconstruction Block (AHFRB) and the Multi-Head Local Self-Attention (MHLSA) mechanism. AHFRB refines the feature extractor by reconstructing the features drawn from the pre-trained model. Concurrently, MHLSA scrutinizes the contextual relationships between contiguous video segments and bolsters anomaly detection accuracy. Our approach was validated using the TAD testing dataset, with the results highlighting the efficacy of TA-NET. Remarkably, it accomplishes an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.47% for the overall dataset and 70.78% for the anomaly subset. These scores surpass the previous state-of-the-art method by 1.54% and 4.96%, respectively, attesting to TA-NET’s superior performance. Consequently, our study offers a fresh perspective and sets a new standard for future video-based traffic incident detection research.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of traffic safety and road maintenance, precise detection of road damage is crucial for ensuring safe driving and prolonging road durability. However, current methods often fall short due to limited data. Prior attempts have used Generative Adversarial Networks to generate damage with diverse shapes and manually integrate it into appropriate positions. However, the problem has not been well explored and is faced with two challenges. First, they only enrich the location and shape of damage while neglect the diversity of severity levels, and the realism still needs further improvement. Second, they require a significant amount of manual effort. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach. In addition to using GAN to generate damage with various shapes, we further employ texture synthesis techniques to extract road textures. These two elements are then mixed with different weights, allowing us to control the severity of the synthesized damage, which are then embedded back into the original images via Poisson blending. Our method ensures both richness of damage severity and a better alignment with the background. To save labor costs, we leverage structural similarity for automated sample selection during embedding. Each augmented data of an original image contains versions with varying severity levels. We implement a straightforward screening strategy to mitigate distribution drift. Experiments are conducted on a public road damage dataset. The proposed method not only eliminates the need for manual labor but also achieves remarkable enhancements, improving the mAP by 4.1% and the F1-score by 4.5%.},

For attack detection, a novel scheme that utilizes control outcomes to train detection actions is proposed.

  abstract     = {The predictive energy management strategy (PEMS) offers potential advantages in enhancing the driving economy of electrified vehicles using vehicle speed prediction. However, realizing accurate predictions in practical contexts remains a challenge. Departing from conventional PEMS that rely on historical speed or static traffic data, we introduce a real-time traffic-aware PEMS for improved performance. To better understand the interplay between the host vehicle and its surrounding traffic, we use a Transformer network as the predictor that employs the speeds and relative distances of the surrounding six vehicles to forecast future speed sequences for the host vehicle. To augment this data-driven approach, we develop a dual-predictor strategy based on the deep ensemble technique. This strategy measures the Transformer’s output uncertainty to gauge prediction reliability and introduce an automated threshold mechanism. Based on this threshold and real-time uncertainties, the strategy chooses between the Transformer and an exponential predictor to achieve improved prediction outcomes. A reinforcement learning method is integrated as the PEMS optimizer. For validation, we generate training data with traffic information based on the next generation simulation (NGSIM) dataset and create a test scenario in the SUMO simulator. The results confirm that speed predictions based on real-time traffic data surpass traditional PEMS, either directly inputting traffic data or excluding it. The Transformer predictor significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art predictor. Importantly, our dual-predictor design amplifies prediction accuracy by 27.2% against the standard single-network predictor under non-training conditions. Overall, our PEMS enhances driving economy by 11.1% relative to traffic-unaware models and 8.0% over non-Transformer schemes.},

  abstract     = {The proper management of mixed traffic is crucial for unleashing the benefits of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Generally, the benefits of CAVs can be categorized into one-dimensional benefits in car-following performance and two-dimensional benefits in efficiently addressing right-of-way conflicts. Currently, the most effective approach to achieve this is by establishing a dedicated right-of-way for CAVs. However, existing strategies are limited to dedicated lane strategy, which can only unleash the one-dimensional benefits of CAVs while the two-dimensional benefits remain untapped. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel management approach for mixed traffic called the dedicated link strategy. The dedicated link refers to the road link that only allows CAVs to use. This strategy can unleash both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional benefits of CAVs via: (i) dedicated link deployment at the road network level and (ii) a novel intersection management approach. Specifically, at the macroscopic road network level, we introduce a bi-level dedicated link deployment model and design an artificial bee colony based algorithm to solve the optimal dedicated link deployment. At the microscopic intersection level, we develop a novel intersection management approach that integrates traditional traffic signal strategy with the emerging signal-free cooperative driving method, thereby boosting the efficiency of intersections. The macroscopic and microscopic methods will complement each other to achieve efficient management of network-wide mixed traffic systems. Finally, we verify the performance of the dedicated link strategy through comprehensive experiments. In essence, the proposed dedicated link strategy unifies the existing dedicated lane strategy and dedicated intersection strategy, providing a general solution for mixed traffic management.},

While traditional knowledge-driven models have their merits, data-driven crowd simulation models promise to bring a new dimension of realism to these simulations. However, most of the existing data-driven models are designed for specific geometries, leading to poor adaptability and applicability. A promising strategy for enhancing the adaptability and realism of data-driven crowd simulation models is to incorporate visual information, including the scenario geometry and pedestrian locomotion. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel visual-information-driven (VID) crowd simulation model. The VID model predicts the pedestrian velocity at the next time step based on the prior social-visual information and motion data of an individual. A radar-geometry-locomotion method is established to extract the visual information of pedestrians. Moreover, a temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based deep learning model, named social-visual TCN, is developed for velocity prediction. The VID model is tested on three public pedestrian motion datasets with distinct geometries, i.e., corridor, corner and T-junction. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the VID model, and the results highlight the improved adaptability of the model across all three geometric scenarios. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing the adaptability of data-driven crowd models.},

Most existing methods mainly model the historical interactions between agents and the environment, and predict multi-modal trajectories in a feedforward process, ignoring potential trajectory changes caused by future interactions between agents. In this paper, we propose a novel Future Feedback Interaction Network (FFINet) to aggregate the current, observations and potential future interaction features for trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ different spatial-temporal encoders to embed the decomposed position vectors and the current position of each scene, providing rich features for the subsequent cross-temporal aggregation. Secondly, the relative interaction and cross-temporal aggregation strategies are sequentially adopted to integrate features in the current fusion module, observation interaction module, future feedback module and global fusion module, in which the future feedback module can enable the understanding of pre-action by feeding the influence of preview information to feedforward prediction. Thirdly, the comprehensive interaction features are further fed into final predictor to generate the joint predicted trajectories of multiple agents. Extensive experimental results show that our FFINet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 motion forecasting benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {There may exist long-term mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HDV) and autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). Hence, a formidable challenge arises: the effective decision-making process among these heterogeneous vehicle types. The disparity in the level of decision-making among heterogeneous vehicles is significant. Human driving behaviors and volition, performed in HDV, are speculative and uncertain, while ADV’s behavior is unitary and conservative. To address this issue, a human-like decision-making framework for ADV considering social skills is designed, by introducing social value orientation (SVO) which is used to measure the degree of altruism of human drivers, and a sociality-aware Stackelberg game model and a social potential field model are proposed. Firstly, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm is applied to construct a structural cost function about human-driven interactive trajectories in order to estimate the SVO of HDV and endow ADV with the ability to respond to SVO. Secondly, the sociality-aware Stackelberg game approach is designed to capture the social interaction between heterogeneous vehicles, considering personal and public interests. Furthermore, a social potential field model is proposed, and then combined with receding horizon optimization (RHO) to plan socially-skilled trajectories. Finally, three traffic scenarios are used to verify that the developed decision-making algorithm can make safe and socially-skilled decisions in mixed traffic scenarios, in which several cases in terms of HDV with various SVO values are tested to prove the validity of human-like decision making process of an ADV.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are integral to the evolution of intelligent transportation systems, offering substantial benefits in managing traffic flow, issuing warnings for potential accidents, and delivering information services to drivers. To ensure the authenticity and integrity of data exchanged within VANETs, numerous authentication schemes based on certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) have been developed. However, state-of-the-art solutions often fail to be applicable in real-world VANETs due to security weaknesses and operational inefficiencies. Recently, Zhu et al. proposed an efficient CLAS-based authentication scheme with conditional privacy preservation (CPP) for VANETs (IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, DOI: 10.1109/TITS.2023.3275077). Unfortunately, our analysis reveals that Zhu et al.’s scheme is incapable of withstanding coalition attacks from malicious RSUs and vehicles as well as public-key replacement attacks from dishonest vehicles. To facilitate secure communication in VANETs, we present a security-enhanced, pairing-free and energy-efficient CLAS-based authentication scheme with CPP for VANETs. This scheme has been rigorously proven to be secure against Type I, Type II and Type III attackers. Distinguished from other comparable schemes, our construction significantly reduces communication overhead and energy consumption while simultaneously fortifying security.},

It utilizes Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) systems for collecting bridge-specific traffic load data, develops a probabilistic Risk Prediction Model for estimating the frequency and severity of overloading events drawing on current Structural Design Codes (SDCs), and simulates an ITS-based architecture for implementing management actions. The framework was tested on 2.5M+ WIM raw data records gathered from the ring road of Brescia, Italy. Results showed that bridge design loads were overcome more frequently than SDCs prescriptions, and violations of the Traffic Code mass limit significantly affected risk predictions.

This paper addresses a novel two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem with sharing satellite resources (2E-CVRPSSR), which arises with the development of e-commerce and the Sharing economy in city logistics. In this problem, goods are delivered within a two-echelon routing network, where satellites are used to consolidate and transfer goods between first- and second-echelon routing. Moreover, the second-echelon vehicles can depart from and return to different satellites. A mixed integer linear programming model is first presented, and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm with several new search operators and strategies is proposed to solve this problem. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the 2E-CVRPSSR. Moreover, an average transportation cost savings of 6.29% can be obtained by sharing satellite resources. In addition, geographic analysis indicates that the layout of the depot, satellites, and customers largely impacts the economic advantages of sharing satellite resources. Specifically, the highest economic benefits are achieved when the satellites are distributed from nearest to farthest from the depot, with customers located between nearby and distant satellites and with satellites of large enough capacity close to the depot.},

Firstly, we analyze the characteristics of driver reaction delay during the car-following process and design an attention mechanism to learn the probability distribution of driver reaction delay. This allows the model to consider more environmental information at the moment when the driver actually makes a decision, rather than just the current environmental information, during the prediction process. By utilizing the seq2seq architecture to model car-following behavior, the model focuses more on reducing the impact of accumulated errors during the training process. Additionally, we propose a temporal consistency constraint loss to improve the robustness and stability of the car-following model’s training method and enhance the prediction results. Finally, we use Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and the sequence-to-sequence model (seq2seq) as baselines, and simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves more accurate car-following behavior prediction.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a Feasibility-assured Mothership System (FAMS) model for truck-drone hybrid delivery. As a mothership system variant, it is considered to be able to bring benefits by using drones for low-cost short distance transportation. Besides, it depicts a scenario aligning closely with the current features of urban delivery services and adopts methods to increase drone utilization. Most importantly, the model addresses potential infeasibility resulting from assumptions in existing relevant literature. In this study, the FAMS is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) model and micro-evolutionary algorithm (MEA), a population-based algorithm that captures the structural characteristics of individuals in order to find high-quality solutions more efficiently, is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The performance of the two proposed crossover operators is analyzed as well. Furthermore, the cost efficiency of the FAMS under numerous situations including different truck-drone unit travel cost ratios and various combinations of drone technical features is confirmed.},

The graphical representation is created by the grid-based method combined with the single differenced technique, which is called the single differenced residual map (SDRes Map). With the graphical properties of the SDRes Map, four main focuses of the NLOS/multipath problems, including positioning, signal status prediction, satellite weighting calculation, and NLOS/multipath error calculation, are able to be tackled simultaneously and demonstrated to have superior performance against the conventional or even state-of-the-art method methods.},

  abstract     = {Occlusion is a major challenge for LiDAR-based object detection methods as it renders regions of interest unobservable to the ego vehicle. A proposed solution to this problem comes from collaborative perception via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which leverages a diverse perspective thanks to the presence of connected agents (vehicles and intelligent roadside units) at multiple locations to form a complete scene representation. The major challenge of V2X collaboration is the performance-bandwidth tradeoff which presents two questions 1) which information should be exchanged over the V2X network and 2) how the exchanged information is fused. The current state-of-the-art resolves to the mid-collaboration approach where Birds-Eye View (BEV) images of point clouds are communicated to enable a deep interaction among connected agents while reducing bandwidth consumption. While achieving strong performance, the real-world deployment of most mid-collaboration approaches are hindered by their overly complicated architectures and unrealistic assumptions about inter-agent synchronization. In this work, we devise a simple yet effective collaboration method based on exchanging the outputs from each agent that achieves a better bandwidth-performance tradeoff while minimising the required changes to the single-vehicle detection models. Moreover, we relax the assumptions used in existing state-of-the-art approaches about inter-agent synchronization to only require a common time reference among connected agents, which can be achieved in practice using GPS time. Experiments on the V2X-Sim dataset show that our collaboration method reaches 76.72 mean average precision which is 99% the performance of the early collaboration method while consuming as much bandwidth as the late collaboration (0.01 MB on average). The code will be released in https://github.com/quan-dao/practical-collab-perception .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a two-level visual servo strategy is elaborately devised for an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) equipped with a pan-tilt camera, so as to exactly track the desired trajectory around a visual target without direct position measurements. In the lower level, a barrier function-based adaptive pseudo-inverse (BFAP) controller is specially designed for the camera to keep the target in sight. Together with a finite-time position observer (FPO) and a finite-time extended state observer (FESO), a model-free finite-time trajectory-tracking control (MFTC) scheme is naturally synthesized for the USV on the higher level. Prominent advantages are presented as follows: 1) The BFAP controller can not only circumvent the singularity issue in a simpler manner, but also solve the field-of-view problem thoroughly in spite of unknown image depth; 2) The FPO provides a new vision-based method to locate the USV by rapidly calibrating a constant extrinsic parameter of the camera online, achieving higher positioning accuracy; and 3) The MFTC scheme allows all model information of the USV to be unknown, which is more favorable to practical implementations. Stability analyses are strictly made by the Lyapunov theory, and simulation studies conducted on the prototype CyberShip II comprehensively demonstrate remarkable performance of the proposed BFAP controller and MFTC scheme.},

  abstract     = {In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicle-to-grid networks offer a promising solution to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by enabling bidirectional power flow between the grid and EV batteries. However, the degradation of EV batteries over time poses challenges in assessing their reliability and minimizing system downtime. Traditional methods, such as complete charge and discharge cycles, could be more practical in dynamic operating conditions. This study, which looks at how virtual and real worlds can work together in ITS, solves this issue by showing a new way to measure how battery performance drops using a digital twin (DT) and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. To calculate the deterioration of battery performance and state of health (SoH), the DT records the complex interactions among state-of-charge (SoC), cell voltage, and health indicators (HI). The suggested method virtually drains the DT to estimate the actual battery capacity by using HI as a temporal measurement and the DDPG technique to train the DT model. This allows for an in-depth evaluation of performance degradation and SoH. The DT also calculates fuel consumption, offering essential battery efficiency information. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of the DT in conjunction with the DDPG algorithm for assessing EV battery performance deterioration, SoH, and fuel consumption, experimental and simulation results also highlight the method’s potential in dynamic operating environments. Concerning practical EV applications, this comprehensive method helps to guarantee the safety, dependability, and efficiency of batteries within the framework of virtual-real integration in the ITS.},

However, it has also become a breeding ground for conflicts. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a formidable chanllenge when directed at organizations and governments, exposing the entire network to substantial security risks. Employing network fornesics for attributing cyber-attacks and acquiring timely, credible forensic results is a fundamental challenge in maintaining cyber security. This paper introduces a Deep Learning-based network forensics framework for digitally identifying and tracking network attacks, providing a comprehensive overview of the network forensics process. Specifically, we extract network traffic and employ encryption to ensure the integrity and security of data. Subsequently, we apply feature filtering techniques to retain essential traceability information, and Deep Learning model parameters are automatically optimized using hyperparameter optimization techniques. Lastly, we develop a Multi-Layer Perceptual Deep Neural Network (MLP DNN) model with perceptual capabilities for detecting anomalous events within the network. We evaluated the framework’s effectiveness using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is applicable to APT attack forensics scenarios. In comparison to other AI methods, our framework excels in discovering and tracking network attack events with high performance.},

Key features from multiple driving datasets are extracted to construct a classifier based on ensemble learning and decision tree, which can effectively identify road patterns. Then, a fuzzy Q-learning method is proposed for online power allocation. Different action spaces of Q-learning are designed to cater to different road patterns, enabling more effective adaptation to diverse roadway environments. In addition, the reward function is designed to account for hydrogen costs and degradation expenses. Through a series of simulation and hardware tests, the proposed method has been demonstrated to effectively achieve online energy management of fuel cell/battery system under varying road conditions. And a quantitative comparison validates that the proposed method outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in reducing both fuel consumption and system degradation rates.},

  abstract     = {As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become the critical part of Intelligent Vehicular Transportation Systems (IVTS), massive IoV entities (e.g., RSU, OBU, pedestrians’ mobile devices, etc.) get involved into IVTS. At present, one of the biggest challenges with IoV/IVTS is how to maintain a balance between security and privacy. The receivers need to be sure that they are receiving reliable messages from the origin and could trace or link the attacker’s identity, but the tracing or linking may work against the sender’s need for identity privacy. To solve the security and privacy problem, most of current works have proposed authentication solutions to provide anonymous, traceable and unlinkable schemes, which are still vulnerable to either Sybil attacks or quantum attacks. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based post-quantum anonymous, traceable and linkable authentication scheme by utilizing NIST winner post-quantum algorithms and related post-quantum linkable ring signature. Grounded on the authentication scheme, we also develop key exchange mechanism, which help IoV entities perform efficient message authentication encryption/decryption during P2P communication and broadcast. The security analysis shows that our proposal is resistant to Sybil attack and provides other essential security characteristics including man-in-the-middle-proof and anti-replay. Finally, we perform detailed performance evaluation including each on-chain API execution time, the off-chain communication time and the on-board/on-chain storage requirements. To further evaluate the feasibility of our scheme in the IoV/IVTS environment, we also show the effectiveness of our proposal in a blockchain-based simulation study.},

This prediction traditionally relies on object tracking modules containing several sensors to gauge vehicle positions and velocities. However, existing physical or maneuver-based model approaches overlook important aspects of vehicle interactions that significantly affect actual vehicle movement. Ignoring these interactions can lead to inadequate ego vehicle’s motion planning. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel approach: the Collision Probability Field (CPF)-based interaction-aware longitudinal motion prediction. Our methodology uniquely integrates the CPF, derived from the uncertainty of sensing information, to account for the probabilistic state of vehicle positions and velocities. This allows the prediction algorithm to consider not just the static data, but also the dynamic interactions between vehicles such as collision. Our approach was tested in various scenarios, including lane changes with an approaching vehicle from behind and different driver behavior models in real-world conditions. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy for the motion planning of ego vehicle, highlighting the importance of interaction-aware predictions in autonomous driving systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of reliability, throughput, and latency. With the emergence of diverse services for autonomous driving, the resource contention in vehicle-to-vehicle communication can cause unavoidable packet loss and, therefore, must be handled for safety. Moreover, different levels of QoS should be defined for each service and task; however, existing solutions can neither provide a resource allocation scheme for any level of QoS requirement nor serve new stringent services without configuration or modification. We propose a distributed hierarchical deep Q-network (DH-DQN) to handle resource contention specifically. Thus, an intelligence resource management (I-RM) scheme is designed to serve on-demand QoSs. We first formulate the problem to address multiple QoS requirements, which extends the coverage of resource management tasks for on-demand stringent services. From the perspective of transmission pattern, we designed a hierarchical DQN structure that deals with resource block contention in a fully distributed manner and a state-action framework that enables a numerically defined service demand. In addition, a target $\epsilon $ -greedy is proposed to accelerate convergence, and a modified transfer learning algorithm is used to enhance learning performance for various levels of service. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed DH-DQN can learn successful transmission patterns to meet different levels of multiple QoS requirements.},

  abstract     = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and solutions into passenger vehicles has transformed cars into a complex system with intelligence and a platform for extending information technology possibilities. These devices communicate through in-vehicle networks that use the controller area network (CAN) as a de facto standard for the safety-critical functionality of the vehicles. One creative exploit against CAN is the bus-off attack, which uses the fault tolerance capabilities of the CAN bus to coerce a victim electronic control unit (ECU) into the bus-off state from which it is not allowed to access the bus. As a result, the victim ECU is unable to send or receive messages. The WeepingCAN attack is a stealthy variation of the bus-off attack that reduces its observability and therefore the effectiveness of detection-based mitigation. In this paper, we introduce three software-based improvements that greatly increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the WeepingCAN attack. First, we introduce a novel zero-phase approach for synchronizing the attack. Second, we discover an alternative approach to disable retransmissions, which is a key capability of WeepingCAN, that allows the attack to be conducted from more ECUs than before. Third, we identify a transitive attack strategy that enables an attacker to target many more ECUs than originally possible. We evaluate our improvements experimentally using a CAN benchmark and find that the zero-phase synchronization improves the attack success rate from 75% to over 90% and the transitive attack strategy enables all the ECUs in the benchmark to be attacked.},

  abstract     = {Truck stop behavior plays a critical role in supporting powertrain electrification, which is key to reducing emissions in road freight. However, it is still unclear whether these stops meet the charging needs for electric trucks during intercity trips. This study aims to address this issue by analyzing intercity truck travel behavior based on trajectory data to inform battery electric truck (BET) technology design and charging infrastructure planning. The study proposes a data-driven truck trip identification framework based on GPS data to obtain truck stops and truck trip ends. Empirical analysis based on gasoline-enabled truck drivers’ travel behaviors in China shows that a 400 km battery range will meet almost 90% of the continuous driving needs of intercity truck trips. It is recommended that en-route charging stations be designed with a charging power of more than 564 kW, in line with the parking time characteristics of 80% of truck stops. The study also identifies potential power supply shortages on the intercity road power grid between 11:00-13:00, 18:00-19:00, and 21:00-1:00. By quantifying the number of facilities needed to provide BET drivers an energy-viable path to complete intercity trips without excessive detour costs, the study found that the travel behavior-based optimization model can reduce the level of truck charging detour to 5% by selecting just a small subset of alternative charging facility locations (55/302). Our study demonstrates that analyzing intercity truck travel behavior can provide critical insights for designing BET technology and charging infrastructure to support the transition to low-emission road freight.},

We develop a lightweight multibranch cross-sparse convolution network (LMCCN) that is designed to preserve the feature granularity of the original point cloud while achieving enhanced extraction efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a compact fine-grained self-attention augmented bird’s eye view (BEV) feature extraction module (CFSAM). This module aims to further refine BEV features, enabling the acquisition of both locally and globally enhanced features and thereby augmentingthe perceptual capabilities of the constructed model. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method attains excellent performance on many autonomous driving benchmarks, with detection accuracies of up to 81.67% on KITTI, 72.74% on ONCE, and 84.00% on nuScenes. Moreover, it reaches a peak detection speed of 46.08 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy with speed.},

  abstract     = {Excessive speed has been blamed as a primary contributory and aggravating factor of single-vehicle crashes (SVCs), especially for vehicles under adverse driving environments (e.g., slippery road surface and strong wind). Rational advisory speed limits (SLs) that can adapt to time-varying environments become critical to ameliorating SVC risks while maintaining optimal traffic mobility. Existing SVC modeling as well as associated SL strategy are either over-simplified with questionable accuracy or too complicated and computationally expensive to accommodate timely risk prediction and potential mitigation. In this regard, a novel risk-informed SL strategy against SVCs is developed. Rather than performing reliability-based optimization for SL with traditionally repeated reliability analyses, an augmented reliability problem (ARP) is formulated. The accuracy is guaranteed by exploiting the ARP through the efficient non-parametric stochastic subset optimization with a high-fidelity SVC model, and a low-fidelity SVC model is incorporated to further improve efficiency. Demonstrations are conducted based on several examples designed with AASHTO Green Book. The results indicate that, in degraded driving environments, the original SL can induce increasing SVC risks, and the optimal SL with acceptable SVC risks decreases significantly. The proposed method can facilitate a reliable SL modulation that can quickly adapt to the changing driving environment with only a small number of high-fidelity simulations. It bears great potential to build an intelligent and proactive traffic management system against SVCs with well-informed and consistent risk levels in response to forthcoming hazardous weather events.},

  abstract     = {Visual detection of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) has received increasing research attention in recent years due to its importance in many applications. However, the existing approaches based on either appearance or motion features of MAVs still face challenges when the background is complex, the MAV target is small, or the computation resource is limited. In this paper, we propose a global-local MAV detector that can fuse both motion and appearance features for MAV detection under challenging conditions. This detector first searches MAV targets using a global detector and then switches to a local detector which works in an adaptive search region to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, a detector switcher is applied to coordinate the global and local detectors. A new dataset is created to train and verify the effectiveness of the proposed detector. This dataset contains more challenging scenarios that can occur in practice. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that the proposed detector outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, this detector can run with near real-time frame rate on NVIDIA Jetson NX Xavier, which demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for real-world applications.

  abstract     = {Train autonomous circumambulate systems (TACS) are a new-generation train control systems. They are characterized by autonomous travel path planning, autonomous protection, and autonomous train operation adjustment. One crucial problem in TACS is real-time communication and computation of autonomous train control systems. Trains need to obtain the real-time state of all the other trains and derive real-time intelligent control commands in TACS. With high capacity and reliable 5G technologies, edge intelligence (EI) can perform complex computing tasks offloaded from trains with little delay. In this paper, we develop a collaborative train and edge computing framework for TACS to provide real-time communication and computation service for train control. To reduce the tracking deviations and ensure the train operation punctuality, ride comfort, and energy-saving ability, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the autonomous train control process. To cope with the limited onboard computing power, we propose a meta reinforcement learning (MRL) based collaborative computing method to solve the computation offloading problem. Compared with the existing RL-based offloading policy that requires sufficient data samples for training, MRL can rapidly adapt to different computation offloading environments, which is exceptionally suited for the urban rail transit system where different rail lines have different operating environments, and we do not have enough data to finish a regular reinforcement learning and training task. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed framework can provide TACS with reliable and real-time computing services. The train operational efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed collaborative computing train control algorithm.},

The necessary information to maintain both applications working is expected to be transmitted among vehicles through small and periodic messages called beacons. However, beacons have been addressed independently for each application. It occurs due to differences in time interval requirements, which primarily impact the network performance in high-traffic density conditions. In this work, we propose a traffic-aware beacon scheme that simultaneously considers cooperative driving with a multi-anticipative car-following model and network routing with a position-based routing protocol GPSR. The proposed scheme continuously adapts the beacon interval time according to three traffic conditions evaluated through extensive computer simulations. The results show a smooth speed profile, close tracking of preceding vehicles, and a reduced impact of beacons on the communication network performance in an urban scenario.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, specifically designed to mitigate the risks posed by spoofing attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The research begins by assessing the safety implications of attacks and developing an adaptive safety model that is grounded in the fundamental assessment of state and decision data. This model incorporates the establishment of a posterior probability distribution for decision data, rooted in the pre-existing prior distribution but adjusted to account for the influence of spoofing attacks. The adjustment is achieved through Bayesian maximum posterior estimation, thereby refining the model to better adapt to potential threats. The adaptive safety model is then optimized dynamically, taking into consideration a set of indices—safety, comfort, and efficiency—that are critical to trajectory planning. In the subsequent phase, we introduce a composite trajectory planning algorithm that integrates a lateral trajectory selection sampling method with a longitudinal trajectory optimization approach. The adaptive safety model is seamlessly integrated into the trajectory planning process, influencing target position selection, the setting of constraints, and the formulation of the optimization objective function. The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively limits the average standard deviation of lateral displacement to 0.5851 and achieves a significant increase in longitudinal speed growth rate, by up to 7.30%, surpassing the performance of benchmark algorithms. The proposed solution consistently delivers optimal safety and efficiency across various scenarios and under different parameter conditions.},

  abstract     = {The GNSS/INS integrated navigation system is widely used in intelligent vehicles. Due to the vulnerability of GNSS and the low accuracy of low-cost inertial devices, the performance of dead reckoning during GNSS outages is of great concern. The non-holonomic constraint (NHC) is a widely used method to improve dead reckoning performance, but it ignores the sideslip effect caused by tire deformation, which leads to performance degradation. The conventional vehicle dynamics model can achieve higher accuracy by modeling tire sideslip effects; however, its parameters are often complex and challenging to obtain. This work proposes a novel wheel velocity predictor (WVP) based on the vehicle dynamics model, which models tire sideslip effects while having concise and easy-to-estimate parameters. Based on this model, an integrated navigation system is proposed, which can adaptively estimate WVP parameters when GNSS is available and use the additional information from trained WVP to improve navigation performance during GNSS outages. Notably, the proposed system utilizes a more accurate model than conventional NHC while avoiding requiring additional sensors or complex prior vehicle dynamics model parameters. Field experiments have shown that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate the tire sideslip angle in real-time and significantly improve dead reckoning performance compared with the NHC-based method. Furthermore, as part of the WVP parameters, the inertial measurement unit mounting angles can be estimated even with a non-straight driving trajectory. Compared with the NHC-based method, which requires a straight driving trajectory to converge, the application limitation is significantly relaxed.},

In this paper, a Pro babilistic framework for ${M}$ echanical fault diagn ${o}$ sis (ProMo) is proposed to integrate misidentification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for high-speed train bogie. ProMo uses variational parameters to capture uncertainties at both the feature and prediction levels, in this way the misclassified and OOD samples with high predictive uncertainty are differentiated. To begin, a Bayesian deep neural network with a hierarchical classifier is built, offering diverse predictions and enabling ensemble uncertainty estimate. Then, a probabilistic null space analysis technique for post hoc OOD detection is presented, in which the magnitude of feature projections indicates the OOD-ness. Additionally, a novel metric assessing classification correctness and prediction reliability simultaneously is proposed. Extensive experiments revealed that ProMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves reliable fault diagnosis, even in the presence of covariate shift in monitoring data.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) enables vehicles to perform computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks through task offloading. Previous works either focused on task offloading based on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mode or assumed the existence of sufficient spectrum resources. However, given the exponential increase in the number of vehicles, it is essential to explore the influence of both spectrum scarcity and inter-vehicle cooperation on VEC network performance. In this paper, we investigate a joint spectrum sharing and task offloading scheme to minimize the total completion delay of tasks. Differing from previous works, our scheme incorporates task offloading based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I modes while enabling V2V links to share the uplink spectrum of V2I links. To solve the formulated non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we propose a distributed and iterative algorithm based on the coalition formation game (CFG). Specifically, we formulate spectrum sharing and task offloading problems as many-to-one matching games with externalities and obtain the sub-channel allocation and server selection policies using the CFG approach, whose stability and convergence are analyzed. On this basis, power control and offloading ratio policies are derived using dual decomposition and quadratically constrained quadratic programming, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme reduces the total completion delay by an average of 65.31%, 51.22%, and 29.97%, respectively, compared to three baseline schemes under varying numbers of task vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Ice floes and icebergs pose serious risks to ship navigation in the Arctic. It is important to identify the sea ice distribution around ships, and subsequently generate a sea ice map and optimize an efficient and safe navigation route. Existing sea ice classification methods that use the shipboard camera images have low accuracy for the distal ice field. This study establishes a multi-task sea ice classification method with dynamic segmentation, which can extract unique features of different regions and intra-region feature correlation to improve the overall classification accuracy. First, a segmentation network based on U-Net is established to divide the image into two parts: an upper part containing the sky and the distal ice field, and a lower part containing the proximal ice field. Second, a ResU-Net is utilized in each part to learn local features, and a multi-task network for sea ice classification is built to improve the feature extraction quality, especially in the distal region. Meanwhile, the spatial attention and channel attention modules are introduced to eliminate the least significant features and enhance the learning efficiency in the feature aggregation regions. Last, the case analysis and performance comparison are carried out using actual data collected by the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong. The results show that the classification accuracy, weighted mean dice coefficient, F1-score and mean intersection over union of the proposed model are 94.7%, 0.937, 0.947 and 0.904, respectively, which outperform the frequently-used models such as PSPNet and Deeplab v3+ while using a significantly lower number of parameters.},

  abstract     = {With the explosive growth of mobile data traffic, roadside-unit (RSU) caching is considered an effective way to offload download traffic in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Many existing works investigate the content placement of RSU caching. However, few of them consider the download deadline constraint when caching the content in the RSUs. In this paper, the main objective is to maximize the hit rate of downloading the requested content from the RSUs before the deadline expires. We propose a Markov-based mobility model and a Markov clustering-based content placement algorithm to group the RSUs into clusters and allocate the content to the cache of the RSUs in the cluster. We also investigate the impact on the cache hit rate under different simulation parameters, such as the total number of RSUs, the cache size, and the number of RSUs visited by vehicles during the download period. According to the simulations conducted, when the region of interest (RoI) is small, the MVP method increases the cache hit rate by at least 21.40% compared to the existing methods. When the RoI is large, our approach outperforms other existing methods by at least 26.16% and at most 337.77%, which significantly increases the efficiency of the download session in VANET.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are gradually entering the transportation system. The traffic will become more heterogeneous since both autonomous and human-driven vehicles will share the roads. Cooperative driving, by promoting synchronized actions and shared situational awareness among vehicles, can significantly enhance driving safety. On the other hand, understanding human drivers is a pivotal step for cooperative driving in such mixed traffic environments, which facilitates effective interaction between human drivers and their vehicles. This paper presents a testbed that can be used to conduct research in intelligent and cooperative driving. The testbed consists of driving simulators, custom-designed copilots with an Artificial Intelligence engine, an optimization server, and a cloud database. The copilot is capable of sensing and understanding the human driver, the vehicle and the traffic. It can assist the driver by providing timely alerts on potential risks. Most importantly, it can communicate with other nearby vehicles for cooperative driving. Two case studies are presented to validate and evaluate the testbed. The first case study demonstrates the performance of the copilot in human distraction detection and driving assistance. The second case study focuses on cooperative driving between one human-driven vehicle and two connected autonomous vehicles in a lane-changing scenario. We expect this research testbed to be used in various research projects that involve human-driven vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, floods have caused significant casualties and property damage worldwide. To investigate the evacuation dynamics of pedestrian in subway stations under flood invasion conditions, an evacuation model for pedestrian under flood situations is established by incorporating a cellular automata model and a hydrodynamic model. The effects of water depth, flow speed and flow direction on pedestrian movement and behavioral characteristics in subway stations are quantified. Crowd evacuation with the flood spreading process under various scenarios is simulated, and the egress time and pedestrian distribution are analyzed. It is found that the existence of flood reduces the evacuation speed and delays the evacuation process. With the increase of water depth and intake flow, it becomes more challenging for passengers to evacuate successfully. Under this circumstance, adding the number of safety exits and widening the exit width can significantly reduce the evacuation time. Besides, the pre-evacuation behavior hinders the movement process, and the rapid evacuation becomes more difficult due to the flood spreading during this period. The evacuation efficiency can be improved if the pre-evacuation time reduces. The study is useful to design evacuation plans and improve the emergency management level of subway stations under sudden flood disasters.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is a critical task in intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, lots of methods have been proposed and achieved significant progress in modeling highly nonlinear and complex spatiotemporal pattern for traffic forecasting. However, most methods neglect the specific internal and external factors of the traffic system, such as the road connections, buildings surrounding each place, transfer stations, etc. The main challenges of utilizing the diverse knowledge from internal and external factors are to represent and fuse the impact of various factors. Few works use distance-based adjacency matrices to represent factors and the element-wise multiplication to fuse them, which may lead to even worse performances. In this paper, we propose to utilize knowledge graph to represent traffic system factors and design a novel neural network to exploit them for traffic foresting. First, we model the relations between factors and traffic conditions from the perspective of the knowledge graph and express them as unified triplets. Then, we generate multi-hop path features with embeddings learned from the knowledge representation model and multi-hop paths searched from the graph structure. Next, we present a knowledge-based multi-hop network (KMHNet) that uses an attention-based module to learn the correlation from multi-hop path features. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we build two real-world datasets both containing a traffic condition sub-dataset and a traffic knowledge graph. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed KMHNet outperforms eight well-known methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/2448845600/KMHNet .},

Employing this strategy results in a cooperative controller that: (i) relaxes the constraints on cable configuration; and (ii) requires only up to the third time derivative of the reference trajectory. The proposed control scheme ensures almost asymptotic stability of the overall closed-loop error system under unknown constant disturbances affecting both quadrotors and payload.

The proposed framework introduces a stable intensity LiDAR odometry based on scan-to-scan optimization. By extracting features pairwise from intensity information of consecutive frames, this method tackles the instability issue of LiDAR intensity. To ensure the odometry’s robustness, a training-free residual-based dynamic objects filter module is further integrated into the scan-to-scan registration process. The obtained intensity LiDAR odometry solution is incorporated into the factor graph with other multi-sensors relative and absolute measurements, obtaining global optimization estimation. Experiments in indoor and outdoor urban environments show that the proposed framework achieves superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of passenger demand is essential for the efficient operation and management of metro systems. In practical scenarios, strategies to enhance metro service quality often require passenger demand information on multiple fronts, such as inflow to a station, outflow from a station, as well as transition flow between entry/exit stations. While predictions for a single type of passenger demand have been extensively studied, limited attention was paid to jointly predicting multiple demands. This problem is challenging due to the complex relationships among multiple demands (e.g., inflow is only correlated with historical inflow, while the outflow is not only correlated with outflow but also determined by the inflow) and the imbalanced training issue of multiple prediction tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep multi-task learning (MTL) model called MTLMetro to co-predict multiple demands in metro systems. More specifically, we deploy the message-passing schemes in graph neural networks (GNNs) as the knowledge-sharing mechanisms in the MTL model to capture the inherent relationships among multiple demands. To balance the training of multiple tasks, we introduce a novel weighting scheme named dynamic weight average (DWA), which can dynamically adapt relative weight for each task. In addition, the partial observability problem of transition flow is also considered in MTLMetro in an end-to-end manner. Empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates MTLMetro’s superior performance across the different demand prediction tasks when compared to several benchmarks. Further ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the weighting method.},

However, traditional feature-based VSLAM systems are prone to be degraded or fail when either the environment or the motion of robots is too challenging. To handle these problems, we proposed BASL-AD SLAM. Firstly, we leveraged the robustness of deep learning and designed a binary deep learning-based descriptor to enhance the accuracy of feature detection and matching for SLAM systems in challenging environments. Meanwhile, the real-time performance of the SLAM system can be also guaranteed. Furthermore, we proposed an adaptive motion model to supply more accurate initial poses, which facilitated subsequent feature tracking and pose optimization in SLAM. The performance was validated on public datasets. Results verified that our BASL-AD SLAM can carry out robust feature matching and tracking in real-time under challenging environments, meanwhile, pose estimation accuracy was significantly improved and the proposed SLAM system showed competing robustness and accuracy compared with ORB-SLAM3.},

Though many efforts have been devoted to this task, most of the previous research has focused on extracting useful features of the routes to improve the estimation accuracy. In our opinion, the key issue of TTE is how to handle the rich spatiotemporal information underlying a route and how to model the multi-faceted factors that affect travel time. Along this line, we propose a multi-faceted route representation learning framework that divides a route into three sequences: a trajectory sequence consists of GPS coordinates to describe spatial information, an attribute sequence to encode the features of each road segment, and a semantic sequence consists of the IDs of road segments to capture the context information of routes. Then, we design a sequential learning module and transformer encoder to get the representations of three sequences for each route respectively. Finally, we fuse the multi-faceted route representations together, and provide a self-supervised learning module to improve the generalization of final representation. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method could provide more accurate travel time estimation than baselines, and all the multi-faceted route representations contribute to the improvement of estimation accuracy.},

This work aims to understand the under-reported relationship between simulation inputs and the variance in output metrics commonly used for signal control optimization. Specifically, the impact that fleet composition, intelligent driver model, lane-changing model, and the corresponding inter-driver distribution of those parameters have on delay, fuel consumption, and travel time were ranked using Sobol global sensitivity analysis. The results are presented from 98,304 total simulation evaluations of a volume-calibrated three-intersection SUMO model. Acceleration, deceleration, and headway parameters in the intelligent driver model were shown to be important for fuel consumption, delay and travel time, in addition to the adherence of the drivers to the speed limit, the variance in preferred speed between drivers, and impatience. The results also unsurprisingly show the overwhelming importance of fleet composition for fuel consumption. Additionally, the work presents car-following and lane-change model parameter bounds that result in realistic simulation. The results from this study point to the critical factors that must be determined for any individual region of study and can be used to guide for real-world data collection to support additional calibration efforts. In the future, after calibration of key parameters, the overall uncertainty in network-wide performance metrics can be reduced and provide increased confidence to conclusions drawn from microsimulation studies.},

In this study, a Transformer-based neural network is proposed to estimate the drivability of various off-road surfaces, aiming to discern whether the terrain is safe to drive or potentially dangerous. The network only utilizes Controller Area Network (CAN)-bus signals from the vehicle, which makes it easy to implement on a readily available vehicle. To train the network, driving data was collected from a diverse range of off-road environments, from areas where novice drivers can drive safely to hazardous areas where expert drivers get stuck. We also propose a post-processing algorithm to filter out false estimations and limit frequent changes in estimation, as these can have detrimental effects on real-world systems. The performance of our algorithm was evaluated in real-time on various off-road surfaces showing high level of accuracy.},

To deal with this problem, a control scheme with a fixed-time observer is proposed by considering the inter-vehicle spacing policy. A fixed-time unknown observer is embedded to reconstruct the composite unknown terms in a fixed-time. Based on the Lyapunov concept, a distributed sliding mode control law, which is independent of the type of topologies, is introduced to ensure the fulfillment of platoon control objectives in a fixed-time interval regardless of the initial states.

However, low detection rates often pose challenges and result in failed trajectory construction. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a trajectory concatenation method that combines NS Transformer prediction and Siamese-VGG16 similarity confirmation, specifically designed to address low detection rates. The employed transformer model can withstand missing values, efficiently extracting internal associations among multiple traffic parameters in conditions of sparse data. Furthermore, a lightweight image feature similarity verification step is integrated after trajectory prediction to find the most similar target to the image in the predicted spatiotemporal domain. Additionally, a lightweight image feature similarity verification step is integrated after trajectory prediction to identify the most similar targets within the predicted spatiotemporal domain. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, successfully connecting over 80% of fragmented tracks and yielding significant maintenance of MOTA above 0.74 under low detection accuracy.},

This paper puts forward rail fault diagnosis from two perspectives: quantifying the level of complexity and chaos of different profiles, and measuring the level of correlation between different profiles, which correspond to the newly proposed refined dispersion entropy (RDE) method and the correlation plane method, respectively. The RDE uses weighted-dispersion patterns to extract accurate time domain features from rail profile data, and the correlation plane can characterize nonlinear and non-monotonic relationships between analyzing subjects, which are the main contributions of this study.

A lane-level variable speed limit (LVSL) control method is proposed for the mixed traffic flow based on a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Then, a lane-level short-term traffic prediction (LSTP) model based on hybrid deep learning is built to forecast the traffic state in a next control horizon. Finally, a lane selection method using a dynamic programming algorithm is established for the connected automated vehicle (CAV) to look for the optimal lane-level route by considering the estimated traffic speeds and limit speeds from LSTP and LVSL respectively. Comprehensive simulation-based evaluation experiments were conducted in various scenarios e.g., with different traffic demands, penetration rates of CAVs, length of control horizons, and the number of lanes. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed LSTP model outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction models in terms of accuracy and stability. In addition, the proposed ILC method is capable of improving the traffic operation of the bottleneck efficiently by synthetically taking the advantage of the LVSL method and lane selection method. Compared with the no-control strategies, the ILC method can reduce total travel time by more than 30% in various traffic scenarios.},

Considering the numerous vehicle types and diverse driving conditions, modeling each vehicle individually is not possible. A generalized carbon emission module (GCEM) is proposed to realize fast model transfer across both light-duty gasoline and heavy-duty diesel vehicles. It has five main components: normalized torque function, category-specified fuel consumption rate function, denormalized function, emission-standard correction, and fuel-specified conversion. GCEM estimates carbon emissions based on the engine bench results of a reference vehicle, avoiding time-consuming and costly experiments. By normalizing engine torque, the significant power disparities within the same vehicle category can be effectively addressed. Integrating GCEM within the parallel transportation system is a feasible solution for monitoring complex traffic emissions. Through comprehensive comparisons, GCEM demonstrates a superior generalized ability in this data-limited scenario than three baseline models, both for various test vehicles and diverse driving conditions. As real-world traffic is a typical data-limited scenario, GCEM is a promising and practical transfer method for estimating vehicle carbon emissions.},

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperate with each other to form a formation group, which can give full play to the advantages that a single UAV does not have, and more capable of working in multi-task scenarios. Based on the Sierpinski fractal structure, this paper proposes a hybrid formation control architecture. To address the aggregation problem of UAV swarms, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method is used for aggregation control. To improve the efficiency, accuracy, effectiveness and scalability of MADRL in environments with a large number of UAVs, a multi-intelligent deep deterministic policy gradient method based on attention mechanism and adaptive accuracy (3A-MADDPG) is proposed. The method enables each agent to selectively focus on the information of other agents, with adaptive learning rate to dynamically learn its own critic network. The algorithm has a large learning rate in the early stage and converges quickly. The later stage of the algorithm has small learning rate and high accuracy, and combined with the fixed variable hybrid reward function designed in the paper, so the UAV can fly to the center of the expected region more accurately, making the whole cluster more accurate. Experiments show that the 3A algorithm proposed in the paper converges faster and achieves higher accuracy than the benchmark algorithm, whether it is the cluster aggregation formation or the separation and aggregation of sub-formations.},

However, the number of available sensors (e.g., cameras) is typically small compared to the to-be-monitored targets, and their Field of View (FOV) and range are often limited. This makes improving the situational awareness of maritime transports challenging. To this end, we propose a method that not only distributes multiple sensors but also plans paths for them to observe multiple targets, while minimizing the time needed to achieve situational awareness. In particular, we provide a formulation of this sensor allocation and path planning problem which considers the partial awareness of the targets’ state, as well as the unawareness of the targets’ trajectories. To solve the problem we present two algorithms: 1) a greedy algorithm for assigning sensors to targets, and 2) a distributed multi-agent path planning algorithm based on regret-matching learning. Because a quick convergence is a requirement for algorithms developed for high mobility environments, we employ a forgetting factor to quickly converge to correlated equilibrium solutions. Experimental results show that our combined approach achieves situational awareness more quickly than related work.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing, leading to higher demand for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). It is crucial to select an appropriate charging station based on user preferences; however, current selection solutions are limited and primarily focus on proximity or price. Such an approach neglects other significant factors of interest to EV users, namely charging time, waiting time, charging cost, and available facilities near the EVCS. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel recommendation scheme, the User-Preferences based Charging Station Recommendation Scheme (UPCSRS), which integrates user preferences with Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) theory to suggest the best available charging stations for EV users. UPCSRS consists of two parts: adopting Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) for weighting the importance of each selection criterion and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking available charging stations. A mathematical model of the proposed scheme was developed, and then the effectiveness and accuracy were evaluated using MATLAB and a real dataset from the US Department of Energy website. Results showed that this proposed scheme provides more precise and personalized recommendations for users compared to current solutions that only consider the nearest or cheapest option. By enhancing the overall user experience through a more customized and efficient charging station selection process, this proposed scheme has the potential to contribute to more EVs adoption.},

Conventional computer vision techniques are typically data-intensive and require a large volume of annotated training data to detect and classify various distracted driving behaviors, thereby limiting their generalization ability, efficiency and scalability. We aim to develop a generalized framework that showcases robust performance with access to limited or no annotated training data. Recently, vision-language models have offered large-scale visual-textual pretraining that can be adapted to task-specific learning like distracted driving activity recognition. Vision-language pretraining models like CLIP have shown significant promise in learning natural language-guided visual representations. This paper proposes a CLIP-based driver activity recognition approach that identifies driver distraction from naturalistic driving images and videos. CLIP’s vision embedding offers zero-shot transfer and task-based finetuning, which can classify distracted activities from naturalistic driving video. Our results show that this framework offers state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot transfer, finetuning and video-based models for predicting the driver’s state on four public datasets. We propose frame-based and video-based frameworks developed on top of the CLIP’s visual representation for distracted driving detection and classification tasks and report the results.

First, we incorporate the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) into the cell transmission model (CTM) in a mathematically convenient way, reformulating the model as a piecewise affine (PWA) system. Using a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) approach, the control problem at each time stage is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solved by well-established solvers. We conduct numerical experiments on an 8-km WCL for two sample scenarios and another with real traffic demand. We demonstrate both the efficacy and the limitation of ramp metering control on WCLs in terms of maximizing charging efficiency. We also reveal the inherent conflict between traffic efficiency and charging efficiency on a fully covered WCL. The proposed method and experiment results provide a novel tool and valuable insights for traffic authorities and policymakers regarding the management and operations of WCLs.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic data (i.e., source domain) have been widely adopted to improve the semantic segmentation performance for real-world images (i.e., target domain), since obtaining pixel-level annotations is fairly easy in the synthetic environment. Traditional domain adaptation methods normally focus on learning in the RGB modality only. We notice that the synthetic environment can generate depth information of semantic objects at almost no cost, while it is nontrivial to collect such information in the real-world scenario. In this case, we employ the depth information of synthetic data in this work to further boost the segmentation performance, and then transform the uni-modal problem into a multi-modal one. In this work, we focus on urban scene understanding and make a pioneer attempt on learning uni-modal feature representations for real-world images by mining from multi-modal knowledge of synthetic images with additional depth information. To this end, we propose a novel method called Multi-modal Domain Knowledge Transfer (MDKT), which transfers the multi-modal knowledge of the source domain to the uni-modal target domain through domain adaptation. In MDKT, we first employ the Cross-Modal Correlation (CMC) module to enhance the source features by fusing the RGB and depth information. Then, the uni-modal target domain feature and multi-modal source domain feature are aligned through the Modal-Imbalanced Adversarial Training (MIAT) strategy, which transfers the multi-modal knowledge to the uni-modal network in the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark settings for urban scene understanding. The promising results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed MDKT approach.},

To improve traffic efficiency, an Auxiliary Network Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (AHGRL) method is proposed for vehicle repositioning. Firstly, a hierarchical graph reinforcement learning (HGRL) framework is designed. The complex vehicle repositioning problem in real road networks is divided into many sub-tasks and multiple reinforcement learning algorithms are designed to solve decision problems of different levels. Traffic congestion is also considered and road nodes are clustered dynamically. And then an auxiliary graph reinforcement learning (AGRL) algorithm is designed for the actuator. It contains the prediction branch and the repositioning branch. States and rewards of agents could be designed accurately with the support of the prediction branch. The two branches cooperate in an auxiliary way to achieve excellent forecasting and repositioning effects. Finally, to enable efficient multi-vehicle coordination, a discrete Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is adopted in the repositioning branch, which learns multiple optimal actions for vehicles in the same area. Comparative experiments with real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. And ablation experiments verify the effectiveness and universality of the HGRL framework and the AGRL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles must be capable of driving safely and having some level of social compliance with human drivers. Acting egoistically can make other drivers to take undesirable actions, such as performing hard brakes to avoid collisions. Designing a proper behavior involves dealing with antagonistic objectives, such as increasing speed and avoiding rear-end collisions. However, weighting those objectives in a reward or cost function is an error-prone and time-consuming task, and can become very hard as more features are added to the problem. In this regard, the main objective of this paper is to use learning from demonstration to compute trajectories that mimic human expert behavior without the need of manually tuning a reward function. On this subject, we present a variation of the well-known Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithm in order to deal with continuous state spaces: instead of exactly computing the gradients, they are estimated by sampling trajectories in regions with higher rewards using a Monte Carlo Tree Search based sampler. The sampler is applied to solve an interaction-aware Markov Decision Problem capable of dealing with the inherent interaction and uncertainty present in surrounding vehicles motion. Experiments are performed in a merging scenario considering real data, showing that the proposed method can generate trajectories similar to the ones executed by human drivers. Additionally, favorable results are achieved when compared to traditional baseline methods and also to a variant of Inverse Reinforcement Learning that uses a polynomial-curve trajectory sampler.},

  abstract     = {Internet of vehicles (IoVs) is an important information exchange platform for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) to provide traffic services. However, the appearance of malicious vehicles in IoVs can damage the security and stability of ITSs, which may provide false traffic data to cause serious traffic accidents. Also, many existing cryptography-based malicious vehicle detection scheme can only be used to resist some external attacks, while some internal malicious vehicles are easy to use their legal identities to provide false traffic data for other honest vehicles. In this paper, we propose a malicious vehicle detection scheme based on spatio-temporal features of traffic flow under cloud-fog computing-based IoVs. In our scheme, a traffic subarea division method based on spatial correlation degrees of road intersections is proposed to divide the urban road network into multiple traffic subareas. Based on the divided traffic subareas, an improved subarea-based graph attention model is proposed to extract the spatial features of traffic flow by the fog server. Then a gated recurrent unit method with attention mechanism is constructed to extract the temporal features of traffic flow by the cloud server, and a short-term traffic flow prediction model is built on the extracted spatio-temporal features of traffic flow. Further, a reputation calculation mechanism is established to score each vehicle by the fog server according to the verification of the traffic data uploaded by the vehicle and the traffic data predicted by our constructed prediction model, which is used to judge whether the vehicle is malicious according to its reputation score. Related experimental results show our scheme is effective and efficient to detect malicious vehicles under cloud-fog computing-based IoVs.},

  abstract     = {The trajectory tracking control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) generally faces challenges from complex uncertain hydrodynamics and system constraints. In this paper, we leverage the capability of the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in approximating arbitrary nonlinear dynamics, and propose a hybrid physics-learning model based predictive control (PL-MPC) method, Neural-sailing, for USVs. The first feature of PL-MPC is robust in that it handles the modeling errors caused by either the USV uncertain hydrodynamics or the environmental disturbances. Particularly, the hybrid physics-learning model combines a conventional mass-Coriolis-damping USV maneuvering model and a DNN model. The DNN model is trained with comprehensive USV motion data. The hybrid model enables efficient model-based control design with easily pre-obtained simple models. Moreover, the stability of the PL-MPC is guaranteed following the quasi-infinite nonlinear predictive control scheme. The second feature of PL-MPC is being computationally efficient. We propose a successive linearization approach to deal with the complexity of the prediction model caused by the introduction of DNN. The optimal control sequence computed from the previous step is utilized to obtain a linearization trajectory in the current step. This is the first time that a hybrid physics-learning model is successively linearized and used for predictive control. Simulation results reveal that PL-MPC has higher tracking precision than the conventional predictive control. The PL-MPC with successive linearizations has comparable tracking control performance with that of PL-MPC. However, with successive linearizations, the controller is much more computationally efficient, and achieves the trade-off between the control performance and computational burden.},

There are still many challenges to solve the urban emergency route planning problem. In this paper, we have employed a double layer search structure, where we have empowered the traditional A* model with a neural network, to construct a region-level dynamic path planning model known as “Double Layer A*”. The model divides the road network into two layers, and implements the outer layer and inner layer search. In the outer layer search, we use the historical cab travel data for training to achieve the general direction planning; in the inner layer search, we update the original planning according to the changes of the road condition characteristics of the regional nodes, and perform the re-planning in real time. We conducted experimental evaluations using the road network data of Beijing, and the results showed that compared to a single-layer search structure path planning model, our Double layer A* model planned paths with higher similarity in land characteristics, connectivity, and average connectivity between adjacent nodes, which demonstrates the effectiveness and reasonableness of the Double layer A* model in emergency path planning.},

  abstract     = {Currently electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are equipped with chargers having fixed charging rates where the users do not have control over their charging schedule, except to decide whether they require a full recharge or partial recharge. In addition, no matter what kind of charging technique is adopted, EV charging takes much time compared to refueling conventional vehicles. This lengthy time at a charging station is the reason why people are hesitant to switch to EVs from internal combustion engine vehicles. The long waiting time may lead to congestion at the charging stations. This has motivated us to develop an efficient multi-level charging system (MlCS) that allows EV customers to specify their charging needs and provide them with charging at the best charging rate possible. The proposed MlCS put forward here features multiple charging levels on a single charger and each level corresponds to a distinct charging rate. Taking the interest of customers into account, the selection of charging rate for the customer is based on his priority for battery lifetime and recharging time. Further, the MlCS is integrated into the station planning problem to analyze the effect of MlCS on station capacity estimation and their impact on the power grid. Finally, the numerical results illustrate that MlCS is better for improving the customer quality of service. The contribution of the proposed model allows decision-makers and operators to develop charging stations with multi-level chargers and provide a better service for customers with different charging options.},

  abstract     = {Compared with the traditional time division multiple access - multiple input multiple output (TDMA-MIMO) radar, Doppler division multiple access - multiple input multiple output (DDMA-MIMO) radar enables the design of orthogonal waveform in Doppler domain instead of in time domain. Thus DDMA-MIMO radar performs well in long range radar application. However, it suffers from Doppler ambiguous and energy defocus of the target spectrum in DDMA-MIMO radar, and as a result the target detection performance degrades. To tackle these problems, a target detection algorithm based on multiple subbands coherent-accumulation (MSCA) is proposed in this paper. First, the empty-band is inserted into the Doppler domain by modifying the phase modulation of the transmitting antennas. Based on the periodic extension of Doppler in DDMA-MIMO system, a coherent accumulation and Doppler ambiguity mitigation method based on subband correlation is proposed. By exploiting the low energy characteristic of the empty subband, this method compares the energy of accumulated subband after MSCA to extract the real velocity of target. It also solves the problem of Doppler ambiguity caused by the period extension of target velocity. Besides, the proposed method can improve the detection performance, avoiding the target being drowned by noise. Simulation and real data results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the Doppler ambiguity, improve the target detection performance under low signal-to-noise scenarios.},

However, it remains unclear how one individual’s driving style shares certain common grounds with other drivers. Our insight is that driving behavior is a sequence of responses to the weighted mixture of latent driving styles that are shareable within and between individuals. To this end, this paper develops a hierarchical latent model to learn the relationship between driving behavior and driving styles. We first propose a fragment-based approach to represent complex sequential driving behavior in a low-dimension feature space. Then, we provide an analytical formulation for the interaction of driving behavior and shareable driving styles through a hierarchical latent model. This model successfully extracts latent driving styles from extensive driving behavior data without the need for manual labeling, offering an interpretable statistical structure. Through real-world testing involving 100 drivers, our developed model is validated, demonstrating a subjective-objective consistency exceeding 90%, outperforming the benchmark method. Experimental results reveal that individuals share driving styles within and between them. We also found that individuals inclined towards aggressiveness only exhibit a higher proportion of such behavior rather than persisting consistently to be aggressive.},

In this study, we propose various instances of the stratified single allocation hub location problems, ranging from simple p-hub median / stratified hub location to extensions concerning direct links as well as node capacities. Moreover, four generalized problems, considering service level requirements, capacitated direct links, multi-modal hub networks, and incomplete network structures are derived from the basic problems. Given that the stratified models become intractable to solve for even medium-sized instances, we also develop a novel neighborhood-search based algorithm. Extensive experiments are performed on representative data sets, confirming the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution techniques.

  abstract     = {City-wide short-term parking vacancy (PV) prediction is essential to transportation management. In many cities, only partial parking lots are equipped with sensors, causing severe data missing issues. Predicting PVs for parking lots without sensors is attractive but challenging. First, PV prediction itself is a nontrivial task since spatial dependencies among different regions in a city are complex and dynamic. By connecting parking lots based on geographical closeness using pre-designed rules, state-of-the-art PV prediction models achieve reasonable performance. However, those connectivities are not able to adapt to capture the changing dependencies in the graph. Second, node-to-node-based spatial and temporal dependencies will no longer be reliable since neighboring parking lot sensors may be intensely missing, which deteriorates the ability of the model to accurately impute PVs, leveraging the complex dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Collaborative graph Learning for pArking vacancy Prediction (CLaP). Specifically, to overcome the limitation of traditional pre-designed node connections, we propose a collaborative training method incorporating node attributes into graph augmentation, thus enhancing the ability to capture dynamic spatial dependencies through message aggregation. Besides, a recurrent PV recovering module is developed to impute missing embeddings by deeply coupling spatial-temporal dependencies. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CLaP outperforms state-of-the-art PV prediction models on city-wide PV prediction and imputation precision for parking lots without sensors.},

To enhance the MTT performance, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as effective assistants to MIMO radar system, due to their advantages of high flexibility, controllable deployment and cost-effectiveness. Towards this end, this work investigates a multi-UAV-enabled MIMO radar system, in which each UAV is equipped with a MIMO radar unit and dispatched to track multiple targets simultaneously. We are interested in the joint trajectory planning and transmit resource optimization (i.e. radar waveform optimization and transmit power allocation) to minimize the system power consumption, subject to constraints related to UAVs motion, system resources, and tracking accuracy. Specifically, the posterior Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) is derived and employed as a guideline for the joint optimization. Given the non-convex and inter-variable coupling nature of the formulated problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems and design an alternating optimization method. Firstly, for the UAVs trajectory planning, we obtain sub-optimal results leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm. Next, we present a feasible solution set for radar waveform optimization. For transmit power allocation, we perform a convex transformation and find the numerical solution. In addition, through introducing the Lagrange dual method, we further obtain the optimal analytical solution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and moving object detection and tracking (MODT) are two fundamental problems for autonomous driving systems. Multi-vehicle cooperative SLAM and cooperative object perception, which take advantage of multi-vehicle information sharing, can overcome inherent limitations of single vehicle perception, such as view occlusion. Solutions to SLAM and MODT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MODT. However, it is difficult or even impossible to have these assumptions hold in complex dynamic environments. We propose a LiDAR-based coupled cooperative simultaneous SLAM and MODT (C-SLAMMODT) strategy, which not only handles the SLAM and tracking problems in dynamic environments but also overcomes limitations of single vehicle perception. The proposed C-SLAMMODT outperforms both cooperative SLAM and cooperative MODT. This method includes a cooperative SLAM module that can augment ego-vehicle pose estimation by shared information from neighbouring vehicles, a cooperative MODT module that applies a state-of-the-art adaptive feature-level fusion model to fuse multi-vehicle data, improving detection precision and overcoming the limitations of perception in occlusion situations. Furthermore, a unified factor graph optimization integrates the information obtained from ego-vehicle states, neighbor-vehicle shared data, and dynamic object states to augment pose estimation and realize object tracking. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the performance and advantages of the proposed C-SLAMMODT solution in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The emerging prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) in shared mobility services has led to a groundbreaking trend for decarbonizing the shared mobility sector. However, it is still unclear how to maximize the efficiency of EVs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining high service quality, particularly considering the ongoing transition towards a fully electrified service fleet. In this paper, focusing on meal delivery, we proposed an eco-friendly on-demand meal delivery (ODMD) system to maximize the utilities of EVs to mitigate GHG emissions and maintain low operational cost and delay cost. The main feature of our system is that its fleet consists of electric and gasoline vehicles mirroring the evolving electrification trend in the shared delivery sector. A rolling horizon framework integrated with the adaptive large neighborhood search (RH-ALNS) algorithm was proposed to efficiently solve the meal order dispatching and routing problem with the mixed fleet. Three delivery policies were explored in the numerical study. Experiment results demonstrated that it is necessary for online meal delivery platforms to actively collect information of electric vehicles and take initiative to employ an eco-friendly delivery policy.},

  abstract     = {Presently, the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is very important for the entire traffic management system. The 5th Generation (5G) enables VANET and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to connect devices in the million/sqkm range with improved performance, incredible transmission speed (terabit), and less cost to serve a vast, transformative, and diverse automobile sector. To ensure security and avoid the free flow of information in highly scalable, dynamic 5G, there are many challenges to restrict unauthenticated users access and proper key agreements with fine-grained access control. Here, a lightweight biometrics-based dynamic Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme (AKAS) with a fine-grained authentication feature is proposed to address challenges related to the restriction of unauthenticated users access and proper key agreement with fine-grained access control specifically for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in VANET. In the proposed scheme, registered and authorized users can access services or information as per access privilege only. We have simulated our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols (AVISPA), Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), OMNET++ (Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++), and performed formal security analysis using the Real-or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme is secured against various well-known attacks. Further, we have compared the security and efficiency of our scheme with the existing schemes and found that our proposed protocol is more secure, lighter, 5G-friendly, scalable, and even faster than the other related schemes.},

  abstract     = {Rails play an essential role in railway transportation, supporting the movement of various types of trains. Due to the high-frequency and high-intensity loads, as well as harsh operating environment, rails are susceptible to cracking or even fracturing. Among existing rail structural health monitoring (RSHM) methods, the advanced ones often rely on signal-driven deep learning algorithms, necessitating substantial computational time and extensive preliminary information for effective model training. Moreover, crack-related signals with low amplitudes are easily submerged in the complex interference noise environments. Although some noise reduction solutions have been reported, the RSHM results often obtain certain discrepancies from the actual outcomes. To address above issues, this paper presents an alternative RSHM method based on electromagnetic acoustic emission (EMAE) technology. The proposed method uses a double-layer signal processing (DLSP) algorithm and a novel health monitoring index, called spectrum information entropy (SIE). It can monitor the degradation state of rails accurately and quantitatively. In this method, the DLSP algorithm is utilized to identify EMAE signals from the original dataset, which contains complex and diverse interference noise signals. In addition, the SIE is extracted from the obtained EMAE signals to perform the RSHM. Experimental results validate the accuracy and simplicity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the literature, various models of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles have been proposed and studied. To design efficient CACC systems, analytical stability analysis is needed to understand the stability properties of CACC models. Recently, a series of experiments on commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles have shown that these vehicles can be string stable only to the detriment of a low capacity. As an attempt to solve this issue, this study investigates the stability of multi-anticipative CACC vehicles with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication delay using the Lyapunov function method and the Lyapunov functional method, and the following results have been obtained: (i) From the methodological perspective, the Lyapunov function method overcomes the difficulty of the transfer function method to derive the stability condition of the multi-anticipative model. The Lyapunov functional method can predict with good accuracy the impact of communication delay. (ii) The multi-anticipative model successfully ensures both traffic stability and high capacity. (iii) The critical wavelength at which traffic becomes unstable follows a power law independently of the model’s parameters when the sensitivity to acceleration is not considered. (iv) The realistic communication delay has only a slight impact on the stability of the CACC system. Our study might represent a reliable reference to improve the stability of CACC vehicles while preserving a high throughput.},

To guarantee the reliability of a BP-based CP system, our proposed BP-CIM can detect the faulty observations in a distributed approach. Meanwhile, error analysis for BP is performed to derive the CP estimation error bound, which is subsequently used to determine the protection level (PL) of BP-CIM. The simulation and experimental results show that BP-CIM outperforms many existing fault-tolerant CP algorithms in the sides of accuracy and robustness, and the calculated PL can provide a conservative error bound for the estimated CP states. BP-CIM framework can be further extended to many other multi-sensor CP systems to improve the system reliability.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) can automatically learn a better policy through a trial-and-error paradigm and has been adopted to revolutionize and optimize traditional traffic signal control systems that are usually based on handcrafted methods. However, most existing RL-based models are either based on a single scenario or multiple independent scenarios, where each scenario has a separate simulation environment with predefined road network topology and traffic signal settings. These models implement training and testing in the same scenario, thus being strictly tied up with the specific setting and sacrificing model generalization heavily. While a few recent models could be trained by multiple scenarios, they require a huge amount of manual labor to label the intersection structure, hindering the model’s generalization. In this work, we aim at a general framework that could eliminate heavy labeling and model a variety of scenarios simultaneously. To this end, we propose a general Scenario-Agnostic (GESA) reinforcement learning framework for traffic signal control with: (1) A general plug-in module to map all different intersections into a unified structure, freeing us from the heavy manual labor to specify the structure of intersections; (2) A unified state and action space design to keep the model input and output consistently structured; (3) A large-scale co-training with multiple scenarios, leading to a generic traffic signal control algorithm. GESA can automatically handle various structured intersections from various cities without human labeling, and it co-trains a generalist agent to control traffic signals for multiple cities together, which also demonstrates superior transferability in zero-shot settings. In experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm as the first one that can be co-trained with seven different scenarios without manual annotation and gets 13.27% higher rewards than baselines. When dealing with a new scenario, our model can still achieve 9.39% higher rewards. The code, scenarios, and demos are available here.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach for addressing a fundamental challenge in pedestrian trajectory prediction: reliable future state estimation in the presence of sensor noise and uncertain perception. It is common for traditional prediction models to produce overconfident and error-prone deterministic estimates. Previous research exploring probabilistic estimation methods often overlooked inherent noise in upstream perception data which is a crucial factor under adverse conditions like bad weather or occlusion. While Bayes filters are adept at integrating data from noisy sensors, they falter in handling non-linearities and long-term forecasting. Our proposed approach is an end-to-end estimator capable of handling noisy sensor data to deliver robust predictions of future states with uncertainty bounds while factoring in upstream perception uncertainty. This is achieved through an innovative encoder-decoder-based deep ensemble network designed to capture both perception and prediction uncertainty during trajectory prediction. We benchmark our model against other established approximate Bayesian inference methods on publicly available pedestrian datasets. The results demonstrate that our deep ensembles not only yield more robust predictions but also capable of reliable predictions on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories. Our method plays a key role in improving dynamic agent trajectory prediction, offering a more precise and robust framework for future state estimation.},

Utilizing model predictive control, this approach keeps the vehicle within predefined combined wheel slip limits, suitable for various vehicle configurations. This formulation is independent of friction properties. The paper presents a comprehensive control framework that integrates braking, acceleration, and steering actions while mirroring the driver’s commands and confines to the driving envelope. Extensive experiments conducted using IPG CarMaker validate the controller’s performance in scenarios such as sine with dwell, slippery surface acceleration, and braking while cornering with and without friction split pad.

The current advanced deep-learning networks encounter limitations in simultaneously capturing both the global context and local features of cracks, leading to discontinuous segmentation results and suboptimal recovery of local details. This paper proposes a robust architecture named Mix-Graph CrackNet to present an efficacious solution for this challenge. The Mix-Graph CrackNet, as proposed, is designed to mix the global context and local features multiple times, allowing for a comprehensively understanding of the essential features. Specifically, this paper develops the learnable parallel convolutional-Transformer mixing module to parallelly capture the sophisticated local features as well as the crucial global context. In addition, a new fusion unit is devised in the paper and deployed in the learnable parallel convolutional-Transformer mixing module. The proposed fusion unit is capable of effectively mixing contextual features extracted at both global and local scales while retaining an abundant level of textural details germane to the crack. Moreover, this paper constructs a graph-based skip connection that functions as a shortcut connecting the encoder and decoder, with the primary objective of mitigating information decay. The experimental results are remarkable, with the Mix-Graph CrackNet achieving F-measure and Intersection-Over-Union of 90.37% and 82.43%, respectively, on 1000 testing images. Based on the performance evaluations conducted on both public and private datasets, the proposed Mix-Graph CrackNet architecture demonstrates a significantly superior detection accuracy in comparison to several state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of Internet services dramatically drives the development of various intelligent technologies. As an important composition, modern ride-hailing platforms allow citizens to order taxis in a fast, simple, and secure manner. The key to developing a successful ride-hailing system largely depends on efficient fleet management that narrows the demand-supply gap. For this reason, many Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks are becoming increasingly popular for proactive taxi dispatching. However, existing approaches have very coarse formulations and solutions to the dispatching problem, which overly simplify the real situations. To this end, we propose a fine-grained DRL framework for effective taxi dispatching with tractable solutions. Our framework features three components. 1) The basic model is a multi-agent DRL that optimizes the standard objectives (i.e., fulfilling the taxi orders). To reduce the status space and environment dynamics, we cluster regions based on their daily moving patterns and allow agents in the same cluster to learn cooperatively by sharing their policies, i.e., learning from like-pattern peers. 2) We further employ a recurrent neural network to forecast the demand and supply, which helps the agents make globally optimal decisions. 3) Finally, we design a two-phase central dispatching strategy based on Maximum Network Flow to relocate taxis in fine granularity. We conduct extensive experiments in a realistic environment simulator using a real-world dataset, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our new framework over existing approaches, promoting the average total order response rate by 2.67%, taxi effort gain by 25.77%, and decreasing the average number of repositions by 2.96%.},

  abstract     = {One of the challenging topics in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) is the metro passenger flow prediction. It has great practical significance for the daily crowd management and vehicle scheduling of metro passenger flow. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) represent a station of metros by aggregating information of stations directly and indirectly connected with the station, and improve the effectiveness of predicting metro passenger flow. Despite its effectiveness, the neighborhood aggregation scheme also brings two limitations in predicting metro passenger flow. First, it limits to predict accurately the peak of passenger flow with large data fluctuation. Second, it enlarges the impact of noisy data and makes results vulnerable to noisy data of metro passenger flow. To solve these problems, we propose regularized spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks for metro passenger flow prediction (PMR-GCN). More specifically, we first propose a novel personalized enhanced GCN (P-GCN), which defines a trainable diagonal matrix to adaptively learn to control the impact of the neighborhood aggregation scheme for predicting the peak of passenger flow. Then, we introduce the multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture richer spatial-temporal features of passenger flow. In addition, we utilize a Fourier Transform module and a dual structure based on KL-divergence regularization to improve the robustness of the proposed model. Extensive experiments on Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hangzhou datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

  abstract     = {The increased use of smartphones and in-vehicle infotainment systems leads to more distraction related accidents. Although numerous deep learning techniques have been developed to identify driver distraction based on images, they often perform poorly or even fail in cross-domain conditions. Retraining models on the target domain is a traditional solution, but it requires a significant number of manually annotated data, time, and computer resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a distance-based domain-adaptive approach for global feature matching. It lowers the ${\mathcal {H}}$ -divergence at the feature level for cross-domain classification. Specifically, a domain-adaptive algorithm is developed based on partial minimum classification confusion (PMCC) matching. The proposed method first predicts target image category weights using a classification network, and then regularizes them by minimizing the classification confusion. It subsequently employs the regularized category weights as pseudo-labels for target domain images, which are then aligned with identically labelled source domain image features. Three cross-domain distracted driving datasets are used to examine the proposed method, including State-farm, AUC-Real and AUC-Laboratory. The results show that our proposed strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches, which provides a solution to further improve distraction detection performance in various situations.},

  abstract     = {Accurate extraction of tunnel lining is crucial for deformation monitoring, damage detection, and tunnel modeling. However, the extraction of tunnel lining is still challenging due to the different tunnel shapes and complicated construction scenes. As for tunnel point clouds, inconsistent local density and non-structural features also pose challenges. Previous research has shown that utilizing the centerline of a tunnel is the preferred method for extracting tunnel lining. However, imprecision often arises due to noise points and point cloud hole. To address these challenges, we propose a novel extraction framework for various tunnel shapes that seldom depends on the centerline. First, the structure detection module is designed to detect the lining structure from the raw point cloud. Following that, multi-scale clustering filtering is applied for fine extraction. The global clustering filtering procedure is then implemented to process the projected point cloud. Finally, the local filtering approach is created for confusion clustering. Experimental results show that the highest Kappa coefficient of the proposed method is 95.5%. Compared with the elliptic cylinder method, the angle threshold method, and the template method, the extraction accuracy of our method is improved by 6.2%, 10.9%, and 9.7%, respectively.},

High-reliability cooperative control of heavy haul train (HHT) formations encounters greater challenges due to the distinctive dynamic characteristics and uncertainties. This paper proposes a communication-based distributed global composite learning cooperative control protocol for virtually coupled heavy haul train formations that enables all HHTs to achieve autonomous dynamic steady coordination with a minimum safe interval and collision avoidance. A pneumatic braking algorithm is first presented for each HHT’s vehicles in the formation to satisfy the distinctive electro-pneumatic braking mode of HHTs and attain improved longitudinal impulses. Then, the complicated dynamic characteristics and uncertainties of HHTs are considered based on a constructed control-oriented dynamic model for HHTs and a neural network (NN) approximation. Additionally, corresponding control protocols are proposed, where the interpretability of the NN approximation and the globally uniform ultimate boundedness property hold. Finally, the control feasibility and abilities of the proposed control protocol are analyzed and demonstrated to be effective via simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of the amount of uncertainty featured by predictive machine learning models has acquired a great momentum in recent years. Uncertainty estimation provides the user with augmented information about the model’s confidence in its predicted outcome. Despite the inherent utility of this information for the trustworthiness of the user, there is a thin consensus around the different types of uncertainty that one can gauge in machine learning models and the suitability of different techniques that can be used to quantify the uncertainty of a specific model. This subject is mostly non existent within the traffic modeling domain, even though the measurement of the confidence associated to traffic forecasts can favor significantly their actionability in practical traffic management systems. This work aims to cover this lack of research by reviewing different techniques and metrics of uncertainty available in the literature, and by critically discussing how confidence levels computed for traffic forecasting models can be helpful for researchers and practitioners working in this research area. To shed light with empirical evidence, this critical discussion is further informed by experimental results produced by different uncertainty estimation techniques over real traffic data collected in Madrid (Spain), rendering a general overview of the benefits and caveats of every technique, how they can be compared to each other, and how the measured uncertainty decreases depending on the amount, quality and diversity of data used to produce the forecasts.},

  abstract     = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has gained widespread use in smartphones, providing support for various pedestrian applications. In urban areas, multipath effects introduce large errors in different measurements, severely degrading the GNSS accuracy. To mitigate multipath effects, several Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) methods have been developed. However, in urban canyons, their effectiveness is significantly degraded due to the lack of fault-free measurements in the cross-street direction. In urban canyons, the pedestrian network provides an opportunity to improve the urban GNSS accuracy for pedestrians. The purpose of this study is to improve the GNSS FDE performance through the sidewalk constraints. A new scheme has been proposed to distinguish the correct side of the street effectively. The Hough Transform estimator was used to find the most consistent GNSS measurements under sidewalk constraints. To assess the proposed algorithm’s performance, extensive tests were conducted in urban canyons. The analysis of Carrier-to-Noise density ratio (C/N0) shows that 92% of sidewalks can be distinguished from the opposite sidewalk along the same street. The static test shows that the positioning accuracy can be improved from 22 m to 4.9 m, a 77% improvement over the residual based FDE. The dynamic test showed that the proposed method can achieve the sidewalk positioning, which is essential for many pedestrian applications such as last-mile delivery, emergency caller positioning and jaywalking monitoring.},

To this end, a delay system framework is first established by investigating the effect of both denial-of-service attacks and time-varying delays. In order to reduce the consumption of the network resource, a novel dynamic event-triggering scheme is proposed. The sensor is time-triggered while the controller and the actuator are event-triggered in the scheme. Based on the Lyapunov stability approach and a data-based representation of unknown systems, a data-driven method for co-designing the controller gain and event-triggering parameters is developed. In the presence of denial-of-service attacks with unknown patterns, the proposed data-driven co-designing method demonstrates the trade-off between the system performance metric and the denial-of-service resilience level. Furthermore, the impact of time-varying communication delays on the denial-of-service resilience level is investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Designing robust controllers that follow a desired trajectory against unexpected internal/external disturbances presents a major challenge in the field of autonomous driving technology. In general, robust controller designs ensuring the ${H}_{\infty }$ performance are a popular solution. However, the ${H}_{\infty }$ performance only focuses on reducing the total energy of tracking errors. Sometimes, attenuating the peak value of the tracking error can be considered of equal or more importance in terms of safe driving, although this can only be achieved through the ${L}_{2}-{L}_{\infty }$ performance. Accordingly, we propose a new controller synthesis for path-following systems in autonomous vehicles using the extended dissipativity that can consider both the maximum and total energies of the tracking error in a unified framework. In addition, autonomous vehicles usually suffer from an inevitable steering delay, which has a more adverse effect on driving stability at higher speeds. To mitigate the effect of these steering delays, we derive a new set of delay-dependent conditions for the proposed controller using the extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality. Finally, CarSim/Simulink joint-simulations under different road environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique.},

To deal with the environmental constraints (which are formulated as the bilateral constraints) in the formation tracking process, a novel transform method is designed based on the differential homeomorphism method. The TCRs’ position is bounded within a prescribed bound by the choice of a suitable mapping function. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, the proposed control method ensures formation tracking performance (including uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness).

Meanwhile, passive mobile phone data, such as Location-Based Service (LBS) data, has high user penetration but remains unexplored for travel behavior analysis. The irregular frequency of data collection results in distorted features and non-uniformly distributed information of trajectories in the Travel Mode Identification (TMI) task. The diversity of trajectories also poses challenges for TMI models. To fill the gap, we propose a TMI framework named Trajectory-as-a-Sequence for Non-uniform data (TaaSN). Specifically, we incorporate GIS features to address the sparsity of motion features. Then, we design a model structure that accounts for time gaps, capturing non-uniform information of trajectory due to irregular frequency. To further enhance model’s generalizability to diverse trajectory data, we propose a trajectory point dropout training strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the TaaSN framework can greatly exploit the potential of LBS data in travel behavior mining. The proposed model achieves high accuracy on both non-uniform and uniform trajectories. On pseudo-LBS data, the accuracy reaches 84.9% when applied to the trajectories of existing travelers, and achieves 83.5% when applied to the trajectories of new travelers. On uniform data, it reaches 86.8% and 85.4%, respectively. Furthermore, we carry out comprehensive experiments and conclude valuable insights for future TMI framework design.},

  abstract     = {Previous license plate recognition (LPR) methods have achieved impressive performance on single-type license plates. However, multi-type license plate recognition is still challenging due to various character layouts and fonts. There are two main problems: one is that recognition models are prone to incorrectly perceive the location of characters due to diverse character layouts, and the other is that characters of different categories may have similar glyphs due to various fonts, causing character misidentification. Therefore, to solve the above problems, we propose two plug-and-play modules based on an attention-based framework for multi-type license plate recognition. First, we propose a global modeling module to integrate character layout information to precisely perceive the location of characters, thus generating accurate predictions. Second, a position-aware contrastive learning module is proposed to enhance the robustness and discriminability of features to alleviate character misidentification of similar glyphs. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and generality, we apply the proposed modules to six baseline models, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three multi-type license plate datasets. Moreover, extensive experiments prove that our proposed modules can significantly improve performance by 6.8% on RODOSOL-ALPR with a small parameter increase.},

  abstract     = {Teleoperation is considered as a viable option to control fully automated vehicles (AVs) of Level 4 and 5 in special conditions. However, by bringing the remote drivers in the loop, their driving experience should be realistic to secure safe and comfortable remote control. Therefore, the remote control tower should be designed such that remote drivers receive high quality cues regarding the vehicle state and the driving environment. In this direction, the steering feedback could be manipulated to provide feedback to the remote drivers regarding how the vehicle reacts to their commands. However, until now, it is unclear how the remote drivers’ steering feel could impact occupant’s motion comfort. This paper focuses on exploring how the driver feel in remote (RD) and normal driving (ND) are related with occupants’ motion comfort. More specifically, different types of steering feedback controllers are applied in (a) the steering system of a Research Concept Vehicle-model E (RCV-E) and (b) the steering system of a remote control tower. An experiment was performed to assess driver feel when the RCV-E is normally and remotely driven. Subjective assessment and objective metrics are employed to assess drivers’ feel and occupants’ motion comfort in both remote and normal driving scenarios. The results illustrate that motion sickness and ride comfort are dominated by steering velocity variations in remote driving, while throttle input variations dominate in normal driving.

An integral compensation of input delays is introduced in the position tracking system, resulting in an improved constant time headway (CTH) spacing policy to offer the more realistic spacing between vehicles. The prescribed control performance is achieved by making use of the mapping transformation of spacing errors, and the assumption of initial error condition is relaxed via an additive modification of auxiliary variable. Then a platooning controller capable of guaranteeing both individual vehicle stability and string stability of vehicular platoons is derived in the context of coupling sliding mode control theory.

The methodology was applied to the transit network of Metrorrey in Monterrey, Mexico, assuming three planning periods along a weekday. It was found that considering holding decisions leads to significant improvements when generating synchronous timetables at transfer stops. Furthermore, three different types of variability were simulated, and their effects on four different fuzzy synchronization functions were evaluated. Thus, we provide a tool to analyze different scenarios and to support decision-makers in the planning stage of public transport systems. The analysis can be extended considering other types of travel time variability and nonlinear synchronization functions.},

  abstract     = {Interactive behavior-aware planning benefits from the hierarchical learning process when adapting to dense traffic. However, the difficulty in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is that the autonomous vehicle fails to execute real-time response due to hardly perceiving dynamic objects beyond the visual range. This problem can be tackled by vehicle-road-cloud cooperation that synchronously collects global perception information and makes strategic policy for deployment. Here we propose a hierarchical edge-decision framework, which addresses real-time motion skill that distills from analogical reasoning of spatial-temporal events. The first step is establishing the goal-conditioned motion library from the centralized edge-cloud perception, to compose the belief-based best response with collision avoidance. In addition, a novel perspective of latent space is presented to promote motion rehearsal in the cloud, which could generate prior credible trajectories based on the policy distillation procedure of extracting informative action from thoroughly exploring changing events. Moreover, the two-stage hierarchy decision is developed to boost the efficiency of advanced policy modification, through evaluating the hierarchical judgment matrices considering conditional criteria, thereby constituting an optimum auto-driving motion with vehicle-road-cloud collaborative system. Extensive validation on challenging autonomous driving scenarios outperforms, demonstrating that our edge-decision method significantly promotes adaption to the complex time-varying environment in ITS system in a smooth and sustainable manner.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure development is one of the key aspects of the electrification of transportation systems. However, incorporating EV public charging facilities has practical and financial concerns, especially in developing economies. Recently, mobile public charging stations (MPCS) have been considered an alternate, practical, commercially scalable solution. Present research on MPCS operation algorithms assumes centralized algorithm execution and does not offer any features related to consumer data security. Moreover, they do not exploit the multi-port charging facility of MPCS, which is more economical for scheduling services. In this paper, a comprehensive framework for the decentralized execution of the MPCS operation algorithm for EV charging service using a hybrid cloud-edge server architecture is proposed. The decentralized execution enhances EV data security and reduces load on the cloud server, data transmission, and storage charges. Four vehicle routing algorithms, including exact integer programming (IP), Greedy, Greedy+2Opt heuristic, and meta-heuristic Tabu search algorithms, are applied to test the efficacy of the proposed framework. From the studies, the proposed framework with Greedy+2Opt performed well concerning scalability. Compared to one-to-one MPCS-EV charging, the proposed one-to-many charging framework offered a significant reduction in the transportation cost and the required number of MPCSs for a given energy delivered. Further, for a given MPCS battery capacity and service time window, the framework delivered higher energy compared to one-to-one service model.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) comprise a whole infrastructure of conventional vehicles, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), roadside units, and communication equipment. As a result, a variety of smart sensors, cloud, and edge services are used. Due to the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication involved in these, the infrastructure becomes prone to security attacks. The most common of these is False Data Injection Attack (FDIA), which causes serious consequences upon driving decisions of a CAV. Blockchain is an ascending technology to provide proficient data security solutions; however, its implementation in securing CAV data is restricted due to its parallel reliance on cloud services. Furthermore, a standalone blockchain is prone to transaction verification delay and reduced transaction throughput, which is intolerable in the fast-paced CAV communication. This paper presents a novel framework enabling multichain, an open-source blockchain platform. Components of the proposed framework include multiple blockchains running on CAVs. The hashing algorithm operates on their Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), inputted to it as blockchain transactions. Our findings reveal that this multichain framework eliminates reliance on cloud services by devising a fully decentralized security solution against stealthy FDIAs that jeopardize a CAV’s lane-changing. It provides an economy-building point for the CAV-metaverse by incentivizing the participating CAVs. Further, it manages transactions by employing multiple parallel blockchains for enhanced throughput. CAVs perform these security checks in as low as a few milliseconds compared to the existing centralized and computationally intensive frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Research in Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM), utilizing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication among Connected and/or Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), is crucial for enhancing intersection safety and driving experience. CAVs can transceive basic and/or advanced safety information, thereby improving situational awareness at intersections. The focus of this study is on unsignalized intersections, particularly Stop Controlled-Intersections (SC-Is), where one of the main reasons involving crashes is the ambiguity among CAVs in SC-I crossing priority upon arriving at similar time intervals. Numerous studies have been performed on CIM for unsignalized intersections based on centralized and distributed systems in the presence and absence of Road-Side Unit (RSU), respectively. However, most of these studies are focused towards replacing SC-I where the scheduler provides spatio-temporal or sequence-based reservation to CAVs, or where it controls CAVs via kinematic commands. These methods cause CAVs to arrive at the intersection at non-conflicting times and cross without stopping. This logic is severely limited in real-world mixed traffic comprising human drivers where kinematic commands and other reservations cannot be implemented as intended. Thus, given the existence of SC-Is and mixed traffic, it is significant to develop CIM systems incorporating SC-I rules while assigning crossing priorities and resolving the related ambiguity. In this regard, we propose a distributed Automated Right-of-Way (AROW) algorithm for CIM to assign explicit SC-I crossing turns to CAVs and mitigate hazardous scenarios due to ambiguity towards crossing priority. The algorithm is validated with extensive experiments for its functionality, scalability, and robustness towards CAV non-compliance, and it outperforms the current solutions.},

  abstract     = {Conflicting objectives of traffic signal settings for arterials with multimodal traffic often trouble practitioners, particularly when one needs to consider various modes and competing flows en masse. Although many sophisticated real-time adaptive signal control systems have been developed over the past decades, how to offer transit-friendly signals while responding to the fluctuating demand of general traffic remains an ongoing issue that has yet to be fully addressed. As such, this study has proposed an adaptive traffic control system adjusting cycle length, offsets, and splits featuring the capability of 1) generating progression bands for both through and turning vehicles in real-time; 2) offering transit-friendly signal for high-frequency service without disrupting the general traffic; and 3) a decision process to select the signal plans among a pool of candidates that concurrently satisfy multiple objectives while offering a stable plan when altering the signal plan in real-time. The signal plan adjustment is on a cycle-by-cycle basis, and its short computation time allows the plan to be ready prior to the beginning of the next cycle. The promising results can be seen in the case study: the proposed model has shown improvements in the networkwide delay, ranging from 4.7% to 5.7%, compared to state-of-the-practice coordination-actuation. By integrating the objective of reducing bus delays, the system has further shown a significant reduction in bus delays, ranging from 6.6% to 15.0%.},

  abstract     = {Cameras, millimeter-wave radars, and lidars are widely deployed on smart roads to obtain personalized vehicle trajectories for advanced traffic control and risk avoidance. However, these asynchronous roadside sensors need to be spatiotemporally calibrated accurately before they are put into service. Traditional manual manipulation methods are inefficient and will affect traffic operation and safety. A rapid and convenient method has become essential under the trend that large amounts of roadside sensors need to be tested and calibrated frequently. As more and more connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) flood the smart roads, this paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal calibration framework using the positioning and perception data of CAVs. First, a trajectory matching algorithm is designed using motion feature and point feature histogram sequences as the descriptors, which can determine the approximate spatiotemporal correspondence for the CAV from the roadside trajectory dataset. An optimization method is then formulated to tune transformation parameters through the Gaussian Process trajectory representation and Gauss-Newton algorithms, considering the sampling frequency deviation and measurement noise. Based on numerical analysis via the NGSIM and HighD datasets, it is shown that the proposed calibration method can significantly reduce transformation errors and perform robustly in different scenarios. The feasibility and practicability of the calibration method are further validated through real-world experiments at Tongji University and on the Donghai Bridge in Shanghai, China. This study provides an economical and practical way for spatiotemporal calibration of roadside sensors in an era of CAVs.},

  abstract     = {Being part of the 6G ecosystem vision, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) will enjoy sophisticated tailored services offering road safety and entertainment for users. As one of the 6G cornerstones, Network Slicing (NS) allows the creation of various customized 6G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases on the same physical infrastructure. However, 6G-NS advances can open up breaches to cyber-attacks aiming to break 6G-V2X Network slices to inflict maximum damage on CAVs and their users. Crossing borders, where CAVs leave their V2X-NS (V2X Network Slice) in the Home Mobile Network Operator (H-MNO) toward a similar V2X-NS in the Visited MNO (V-MNO), is an attractive opportunity to exploit by attackers. Detecting and mitigating attacks, in this case, becomes a priority, confronted by NS requirements and MNOs not ready to share their private data. To this end, this paper proposes a 3GPP-compliant privacy preservation collaborative learning scheme for 6G-NS security, focusing on V2X-NS cross-border areas. Our scheme leverages multi-process Federated Learning (FL) architecture to build efficient V2X-NS security-related models while preserving 6G V2X-NS isolation. In addition, it uses differential privacy-enabled stacking to build up attack detection knowledge at the V2X-NSs and MNOs levels while ensuring privacy preservation. We conducted an experimental study on the 5G-NIDD dataset, which is one of the most realistic publicly available 5G datasets. Our results demonstrate that multi-process FL with stacking can deliver high accuracy while ensuring isolation between 6G-V2X-NSs and privacy preservation between H-MNO and V-MNO.},

  abstract     = {Multipath error is a major challenge for positioning integrity monitoring in autonomous driving, which requires conservative and effective overbounding methods. Traditional methods based on Gaussian overbound need the error distribution information, which is hard to obtain when using multiple features related to multipath as prior knowledge. A recent study used quantile overbound based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network with promising results but ignored the temporal correlation of multipath and the dynamic surrounding information. This paper proposes a multipath overbounding method based on a designed long short-term memory (LSTM) network using LiDAR, cameras, and global navigation satellite systems data. The method aims to improve the model’s effectiveness while ensuring the model’s conservatism. The effectiveness of the model is assessed using a generalized coefficient of determination, which shows how close the predicted quantile is to the actual value. Results show that the LSTM model outperforms the previous MLP-based study in predicting the quantile of multipath error in Hong Kong urban data. By using multi-sensor data as input, the effectiveness of LSTM improves by over 10% when using time windows of 15 seconds for different urban scenarios. The longer the time window, the better the performance of effectiveness. The predicted quantile is then used to compute an overbounded standard deviation based on a zero-mean Gaussian distribution, whose conservatism is verified by the cumulative distribution function. Overall, this study indicates that the use of multi-sensor data and a longer time window can better facilitate the effective bounding of the multipath error while ensuring conservatism.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular services aim to provide smart and timely services (e.g., collision warning) by taking the advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence and employing task offloading techniques in mobile edge computing. In practice, the volume of vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) often surges at a single location and renders the edge servers (ESs) severely overloaded, resulting in a very high delay in delivering the services. Therefore, it is of practical importance and urgency to coordinate the resources of ESs with bandwidth allocation for mitigating the occurrence of a spike traffic flow. For this challenge, existing work sought the periodicities of traffic flow by analyzing historical traffic data. However, the changes in traffic flow caused by sudden traffic conditions cannot be obtained from these periodicities. In this paper, we propose a distributed traffic flow forecasting and task offloading approach named TFFTO to optimize the execution time and power consumption in service processing. Specifically, graph attention networks (GATs) are leveraged to forecast future traffic flow in short-term and the traffic volume is utilized to estimate the number of services offloaded to the ESs in the subsequent period. With the estimate, the current load of the ESs is adjusted to ensure that the services can be handled in a timely manner. Potential game theory is adopted to determine the optimal service offloading strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our approach and the results validate our robust performance.},

  abstract     = {In the connected environment, traffic information sources become more heterogeneous, transforming vehicle-road information from static isolation to dynamic interconnection. Therefore, this work aims to examine the effects of the connected environment on Lane-Changing Intention (LCI). Firstly, a driving simulator experiment was designed to imitate the connected environment. Secondly, the LCI time window and feature parameters, including eye movement parameters, vehicle motion parameters, and driver operation parameters, were compared in connected and non-connected environments. The results demonstrated that the LCI time window was longer in the connected environment (6.6 s) than the non-connected environment (4.1 s). Moreover, the LCI feature parameters were significantly different between both environments. Finally, a novel driver LCI recognition model was developed for both environments. This involves utilizing phase space reconstruction and recurrence plot technology to convert time-series feature parameters into images. The swin transformer algorithm was then introduced to classify these images into lane-changing and lane-keeping. Comparing the LCI models in both environments showed no significant difference in model accuracy at 0.5 s before lane-changing maneuver. Interestingly, the model accuracy in the connected environment significantly outperforms that in the non-connected environment during the 2–4 s before lane-changing maneuver. In addition, the novel LCI model accuracy was 90.80% at 3 s before lane-changing maneuver, surpassing that of the traditional machine learning algorithm. To sum up, this research contributes to enhancing the accurate response of lane-changing assistance systems as well as the transfer control right between human and machine co-driving in the connected environment.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing power demand and distribution in real time is the primary challenge in the energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. To address this challenge, this study proposes an online ecological energy management strategy using the optimal state of charge (SOC) prediction and stochastic optimization. Future energy-consumption features at each location are computed from the traffic and route information of the entire remaining trip and the optimal SOC value at the next location is predicted from the computed features using a recurrent neural network. By considering the predicted optimal SOC and average speed as references, the speed and SOC values at the next location are optimized using a modified estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). The process of generating initial and new populations in EDA is modified for fast and reliable convergence. The optimal SOC prediction considering the energy consumption for the entire remaining trip from the current to final locations ensures long-term optimality. Stochastic aspects of the modified EDA can compensate for potential neural-network errors. The prediction and optimization of driving only up to the next location enables to adapt to the changes in traffic conditions. Moreover, the energy efficiency is further improved by optimizing power demand based on the characteristics of the drivetrain, as well as traffic and route conditions. Because the traffic and route information are provided on a location basis, management is performed in a distance domain. The proposed management strategy is evaluated in diverse driving scenarios, and it exhibits good performance, comparable to that of the offline optimization.},

  abstract     = {The use of virtual safety assessment as the primary method for evaluating vehicle safety technologies has emphasized the importance of crash scenario generation. One of the most common crash types is the rear-end crash, which involves a lead vehicle and a following vehicle. Most studies have focused on the following vehicle, assuming that the lead vehicle maintains a constant acceleration/deceleration before the crash. However, there is no evidence for this premise in the literature. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by thoroughly analyzing and modeling the lead vehicle’s behavior as a first step in generating rear-end crash scenarios. Accordingly, the study employed a piecewise linear model to parameterize the speed profiles of lead vehicles, utilizing two rear-end pre-crash/near-crash datasets. These datasets were merged and categorized into multiple sub-datasets; for each one, a multivariate distribution was constructed to represent the corresponding parameters. Subsequently, a synthetic dataset was generated using these distribution models and validated by comparison with the original combined dataset. The results highlight diverse lead-vehicle speed patterns, indicating that a more accurate model, such as the proposed piecewise linear model, is required instead of the conventional constant acceleration/deceleration model. Crashes generated with the proposed models accurately match crash data across the full severity range, surpassing existing lead-vehicle kinematics models in both severity range and accuracy. By providing more realistic speed profiles for the lead vehicle, the model developed in the study contributes to creating realistic rear-end crash scenarios and reconstructing real-life crashes.},

The analytical expression of the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) for beamforming (BF) strategy and interference cancellation (IC) strategy are derived. For exploring engineering design, we investigate the tight bounds of EAR with much simpler form. Then, the EAR gain brought by RIS compared to the traditional D2D system is analyzed. Further, four specific scenarios are discussed in detail, including the weak interference case, the high SNR case, the large number of BS antennas case and the large number of reflective elements case. We derive the EAR approximations of these four cases and explore a series of insights. Numerical Results shows the perfect agreement between the analytical results and simulations.},

Roadside Units (RSUs) play a crucial role in enabling V2I communication, as they can gather and broadcast traffic event information in the road network. Implementing a well-thought-out RSU strategy can significantly improve the stability and efficiency of traffic event information transmission in the road network. However, there is a lack of effective strategies for RSU deployment in stochastic scenarios. The presence of unpredictable factors like equipment failures and network attacks may disrupt the normal functioning of the RSUs. To guide the deployment of roadside facilities, we analyze the transmission time of traffic events in the road network and construct a multi-objective RSU deployment model considering the possibility of RSU failures. This model aims to maximize the number of connected vehicles served and minimize the expected transmission time of events. Through fuzzy programming theory and different decision preferences, we transform the two objectives into a single objective function. A random-key genetic algorithm (RKGA) is designed to solve the transformed model. Moreover, several simulation examples are presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results indicate that decentralized deployment is preferred for low RSU failure probabilities, while centralized deployment is preferred for high failure probabilities.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is essential and challenging to intelligent city management and public safety. In this paper, we attempt to use a pure self-attention method in traffic flow forecasting. However, when dealing with input sequences, including large-scale regions’ historical records, it is difficult for the self-attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant ones for forecasting. To address this issue, we design a progressive space-time self-attention mechanism named ProSTformer, which can reduce self-attention computation times from thousands to tens. Our design is based on two pieces of prior knowledge in the traffic flow forecasting literature: (i) spatiotemporal dependencies can be factorized into spatial and temporal dependencies; (ii) adjacent regions have more influences than distant regions, and temporal characteristics of closeness, period and trend are more important than crossed relations between them. Our ProSTformer has two characteristics. First, each block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependencies, ProSTformer progressively focuses on spatial dependencies from local to global regions, on temporal dependencies from closeness, period and trend to crossed relations between them, and on external dependencies such as weather conditions, temperature and day-of-week. Second, we use the Tensor Rearranging technique to force the model to compute self-attention only to adjacent regions and to the unique temporal characteristic. Then, we use the Patch Merging technique to greatly reduce self-attention computation times to distant regions and crossed temporal relations. We evaluate ProSTformer on two traffic datasets and find that it performs better than sixteen baseline models. The code is available at https://github.com/yanxiao1930/ProSTformer_code/tree/main .},

Using a real-world scenario from the Leeds Metropolitan Area as a case study, we demonstrate an effective way of combining macro-level mobility simulations based on open data with global optimisation techniques to discover realistic optimal deployment strategies for CAVs. The macro-level mobility simulations are used to assess the quality of a potential multi-route CAV service by quantifying geographic accessibility improvements using an extended version of Dijkstra’s algorithm on an abstract multi-modal transport network. The optimisations were carried out using several popular population-based optimisation algorithms that were combined with several routing strategies aimed at constructing the best routes by ordering stops in a realistic sequence.},

In many situations, converting a multi-objective problem into a single-objective one is impossible, intractable or insufficient, making such RL algorithms inapplicable. We propose a multi-objective, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm with high learning efficiency and low computational requirements, which automatically triggers adaptive few-shot learning in a dynamic, distributed and noisy environment with sparse and delayed reward. We test our algorithm in an ITS environment with edge cloud computing. Empirical results show that the algorithm is quick to adapt to new environments and performs better in all individual and system metrics compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark. Our algorithm also addresses various practical concerns with its modularized and asynchronous online training method.

Traditional GNSS approaches are vulnerable to interference in certain environments, rendering them unreliable in situations such as urban canyons, under flyovers, or in low reception areas. This study proposes a vehicle positioning method based on learning the road signature from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. In our approach, the route is divided into segments, each with a distinct signature that the IMU can detect through the vibrations of a vehicle in response to subtle changes in the road surface. The study presents two different data-driven methods for learning the road segment from IMU measurements. One method is based on convolutional neural networks and the other on ensemble random forest applied to handcrafted features. Additionally, the authors present an algorithm to deduce the position of a vehicle in real-time using the learned road segment. The approach was applied in two positioning tasks: (i) a car along a $6 \ [km]$ route in a dense urban area; (ii) an e-scooter on a $1 \ [km]$ route that combined road and pavement surfaces. The mean error between the proposed method’s position and the ground truth was approximately $50 \ [m] $ for the car and $30 \ [m]$ for the e-scooter. Compared to a solution based on time integration of the IMU measurements, the proposed approach has a mean error of more than 5 times better for e-scooters and 20 times better for cars.},

  abstract     = {A simple method is presented for road scene anomaly detection, which is particularly important in autonomous driving. Without the prior knowledge about the appearance and size, anomaly detection is formulated as an OoD (Out-of-Distribution) detection task. Epistemic uncertainty indicates that when a model is trained with finite training data, it will fail to yield reliable prediction if the testing data is far from the training data distribution (OoD). Deviating from previous works, instead of modelling the uncertainty of a single model explicitly, this work casts the individual uncertainty into an ensemble uncertainty metric by measuring the discrepancy between the different models. The benefits are: 1) Following a meta-learning framework, outputs from the off-the-shelf models can be used directly, which results in a very small training cost; 2) With the ensemble approach, the model is especially robust to dataset shift. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive: 1) Its APs (Average precisions) are 3.5%, 3.1%, and 5.2% higher than the best SOTAs (State-of-the-arts) on LaF (Lost-and-Found), RA (Road Anomaly), and RO (Road Obstacles) respectively; 2) For all datasets with different road conditions, it obtains consistent performance.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a fractional order optimization method of a fractional order multi-variable Grey model (GM( $r$ ,2)) based on a full transfer learning LSTM network. Firstly, a GM( $r$ ,2) was built with adhesion coefficient as input variable, namely, correlation factor sequence, and driving intention as output variable, namely, system behaviour characteristic sequence. Secondly, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network was trained by means of driving intention dataset, which is defined as source domain dataset. Adhesion coefficient, which is selected as test dataset, is defined as target domain dataset. By utilizing relative degree of grey incidence, it is proved that source domain dataset is extremely similar with target domain dataset. The LSTM network trained by driving intention dataset can be transferred fully to calculate optimization data. Finally, with the optimization data predicted by the LSTM network, an optimized fractional order of GM( $r$ ,2) can be calculated by fractional-order accumulation matrix calculation and least square fitting. Comparing with particle swarm optimization (PSO), the proposed optimization method can effectively improve the convergence of fractional order optimization values. The optimized GM( $r_{opt}$ ,2) was applied in inferring diving intention for an active safety driving system of electric vehicles. Simulation experiments are performed in car-following and lane-changing processes, respectively. The driving intention inferred by GM( $r_{opt}$ ,2) can change not only longitudinal safety distance, but also lane-changing trajectory with different road conditions. It can ensure vehicle driving safety. Experimental data can demonstrate that the proposed optimization method of fractional order is effective, and the optimized GM( $r_{opt}$ ,2) is appropriate to infer driving intention.},

  abstract     = {Managing urban traffic dynamics is critical in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where short-term traffic prediction is vital for effective congestion management and vehicle routing. While existing centralized deep learning (DL) models have achieved high prediction accuracy, their applicability is limited in decentralized ITS environments. The increasing use of connected vehicles and mobile sensors has led to decentralized data generation in ITS, presenting an opportunity to improve traffic prediction through collaborative machine learning. Recently, blockchain technology has shown promise in improving ITS efficiency, security, and reliability. In conjunction with blockchain, Federated Learning (FL) is a suitable approach to leverage online data streams in ITS; however, most research on FL for traffic prediction focuses on offline learning scenarios. This paper researches a blockchain-enhanced architecture for training online traffic prediction models using FL. The proposed approach enables decentralized model training at the edge of the ITS network, and extensive experiments used dynamically collected arterial traffic data shards as a case study to evaluate online learning performance. The results demonstrate that our online FL approach outperforms the per-device, non-federated baseline models for most sensors while maintaining a suitable execution time and latency for real-world deployment.},

  abstract     = {As drivers are frequently distracted during conditionally automated driving, how and when to issue takeover requests when it is necessary have become concerns. A good practice is to predict takeover performance of drivers in real time, so that appropriate measures can be taken in corresponding to the predicted results. However, that is difficult in that a lot of factors need to be taken into consideration, especially human-related factors. Among all the factors researched, impact of personality on takeover performance has rarely been researched, which is essential for building a personalized prediction model that involves human drivers. To explore the effect of personality on takeover performance, a driving simulator experiment involving 48 participants and 6 critical takeover scenarios was conducted in this study. The big five personality test was utilized for assessing personality of the participants. Overall, results revealed that different personality traits seemed to affect takeover performance in different aspects, such that extraversion and openness mainly affect takeover time, and neuroticism and agreeableness mainly affect longitudinal and lateral performance, respectively. Moreover, effects of personality are most significant when drivers have gained certain levels of situation awareness. Finally, regarding using of turn signals shortly after takeover requests, it was found that turn signal missing rates were positively related with neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, respectively, and negatively quadratically related with agreeableness. These results might shed light on the factors we need to take into consideration when considering building a personalized prediction model to predict different aspects of takeover performance of drivers.},

First, the algorithm improves the memory mode of LSTM network by using Modulation LSTM neural network and establishes IMU state model and observation model. Then, in order to adapt to the application of deep learning algorithm in UKF, an equal spacing sigma sampling method is proposed.

  abstract     = {Fine-grained vehicle recognition (FGVR) is an essential fundamental technology for intelligent transportation systems. However, it is challenging because of its inherent intra-class variation. Most previous FGVR studies only focus on the intra-class variation caused by spatial factors like shooting angles and positions, while the intra-class variation caused by image noise has received little attention. This paper proposes a progressive multi-task anti-noise learning (PMAL) framework and a progressive multi-task distilling (PMD) framework to address the intra-class variation problem in FGVR caused by image noise. The PMAL framework achieves high recognition accuracy by treating image denoising as an additional task in image recognition. It progressively trains the model to learn noise invariance. The PMD framework transfers the knowledge learned by PMAL-trained model into the original backbone network. This results in a model with similar recognition accuracy to the PMAL-trained model but without any additional overhead on the original backbone network. Combining the two frameworks, we obtain models that significantly exceed previous state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy on two widely-used, standard FGVR datasets, namely Stanford Cars and CompCars. In addition, we observed improvements on three other surveillance image-based vehicle-type classification datasets, namely Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)-Vehicle, Vehicle Type Image Data 2 (VTID2), and Vehicle Images Dataset for Make &amp; Model Recognition (VIDMMR), without any additional overhead on the original backbone networks.

  abstract     = {A practical approach to realizing the comprehensive perception of the surrounding environment is to use a multi-modal fusion method based on various types of vehicular sensors. In clear weather, the camera and LiDAR can provide high-resolution images and point clouds that can be utilized for 3D object detection. However, in foggy weather, the propagation of light is affected by the fog in the air. Consequently, both images and point clouds become distorted to varying degrees. Thus, it is challenging to implement accurate detection in adverse weather conditions. Compared to cameras and LiDAR, Radar possesses strong penetrating power and is not affected by fog. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel two-stage detection framework called “TransFusion”, which leverages LiDAR and Radar fusion to solve the problem of environment perception in foggy weather. The proposed framework is composed of Multi-modal Rotate Region Proposal Network (MM-RRPN) and Multi-modal Refine Network (MM-RFN). Specifically, Spatial Vision Transformer (SVT) and Cross-Modal Attention Mechanism (CMAM) are introduced in the MM-RRPN to improve the robustness of the algorithm in foggy weather. Furthermore, Temporal-Spatial Memory Fusion (TSMF) module in MM-RFN is employed to fuse the spatial-temporal prior information. In addition, the Multi-branches Combination Loss function (MC-Loss) is designed to efficiently supervise the learning of the network. Extensive experiments were conducted on Oxford Radar RobotCar (ORR) dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance in both foggy and clear weather. Especially in foggy weather, the proposed TransFusion achieves 85.31mAP, outperforming all other competing approaches. The demo is available at: https://youtu.be/ ugjIYHLgn98.},

Motivated by these, in this work, we proposed a bloom filter-enabled smart contract-based scheme for access control in V2G environment. In comparison to complex signature-based cryptographic techniques, we propose bloom filter-based authentication for the registered nodes for efficient storage and searching of stored data on the blockchain network. We also designed the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which selects authority nodes dynamically to verify various transactions on the blockchain network. To validate the proposal, we implemented it on the Ethereum network on benchmark datasets using various evaluation parameters such as- latency, throughput, false positive probability, and gas cost.},

This paper proposes an $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control strategy for AVs under time-constrained denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and external interference. A switching-like path following control model of AVs is first built in the presence of DoS attacks, which is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of the sleeping period and active period of the DoS attacker. Then, the exponential stability and $L_{2}$ -gain performance of the resulting switched system are analyzed by using a time-varying Lyapunov function method. On the basis of the obtained analysis results, $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient controllers are designed to achieve an acceptable path-following performance despite the presence of such DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control method is confirmed by the simulation results obtained for the considered AVs model with different DoS attack parameters.},

As a result, there has been a growing interest in the literature on the subject, leading to the development of various road surface defect detection methods. The methods for detecting road defects can be categorised in various ways depending on the input data types or training methodologies. The predominant approach involves image-based methods, which analyse pixel intensities and surface textures to identify defects. Despite popularity, image-based methods share the distinct limitation of vulnerability to weather and lighting changes. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of additional sensors, such as laser scanners or LiDARs, providing explicit depth information to enable the detection of defects in terms of scale and volume. However, the exploration of data beyond images has not been sufficiently investigated. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of road surface defect detection studies, categorising them based on input data types and methodologies used. Additionally, we review recently proposed non-image-based methods and discuss several challenges and open problems associated with these techniques.},

In this paper, two ways of interactions between 6G networks and transportation are extensively investigated. On one hand, the new usage scenarios and capabilities of 6G over existing cellular networks are firstly highlighted. Then, its potential in seamless and ubiquitous connectivity across the heterogeneous space-air-ground transportation systems is demonstrated, where railways, airplanes, high-altitude platforms and satellites are investigated. On the other hand, we reveal that the introduction of 6G guarantees a more intelligent, efficient and secure transportation system. Specifically, technical analysis on how 6G can empower future transportation is provided, based on the latest research and standardization progresses in localization, integrated sensing and communications, and security. The technical challenges and insights for a road ahead are also summarized for possible inspirations on 6G enabled advanced transportation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide a survey on automotive surround-view fisheye optics, with an emphasis on the impact of optical artifacts on computer vision tasks in autonomous driving and ADAS. The automotive industry has advanced in applying state-of-the-art computer vision to enhance road safety and provide automated driving functionality. When using camera systems on vehicles, there is a particular need for a wide field of view to capture the entire vehicle’s surroundings, in areas such as low-speed maneuvering, automated parking, and cocoon sensing. However, one crucial challenge in surround-view cameras is the strong optical aberrations of the fisheye camera, which is an area that has received little attention in the literature. Additionally, a comprehensive dataset is needed for testing safety-critical scenarios in vehicle automation. The industry has turned to simulation as a cost-effective strategy for creating synthetic datasets with surround-view camera imagery. We examine different simulation methods (such as model-driven and data-driven simulations) and discuss the simulators’ ability (or lack thereof) to model real-world optical performance. Overall, this paper highlights the optical aberrations in automotive fisheye datasets, and the limitations of optical reality in simulated fisheye datasets, with a focus on computer vision in surround-view optical systems.},

  abstract     = {In the context of automated driving, navigating through challenging urban environments with dynamic objects, large-scale scenes, and varying lighting/weather conditions, achieving accurate localization is paramount for highly-automated (HAVs) or autonomous vehicles (AVs). An imprecise localization can greatly impact subsequent decision-making to manage an HAV or AV’s motion (planning and control tasks). In recent years, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) has shown substantial progress and equipping it can lead to handling non-standardized situations of real-world scenes and achieving higher localization and mapping accuracy. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the current research status of VSLAM and its potential application to HAV or AV operating in complex urban environments. We first discuss the criteria to assess how well for the solutions that VSLAM methods offer to address the challenges, which include real-time performance, accuracy, robustness, and system operating cost. By employing these assessment criteria, we evaluate various VSLAM methods in four essential aspects including rejection and tracking of high dynamic objects, map construction in large-scale environments, loop detection and error correction, and sustainable operation and map updating. This evaluation provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different VSLAM techniques. We then discuss potential research directions for leveraging VSLAM methods in achieving high-level automated driving in complex settings. We hope this article to serve as a timely update on recent progress and advances in VSLAM which are applicable to HAVs or AVs. To facilitate future research, we create a repository that includes links to relevant reviews and methodological papers for learning at https://github.com/bumblebee15138/VSLAM for HAVs and AVs.},

Inertial sensor-based positioning is essential in various applications, including personal navigation, location-based security, and human-device interaction. However, low-cost MEMS inertial sensors’ measurements are inevitably corrupted by various error sources, leading to unbounded drifts when integrated doubly in traditional inertial navigation algorithms, subjecting inertial positioning to the problem of error drifts. In recent years, with the rapid increase in sensor data and computational power, deep learning techniques have been developed, sparking significant research into addressing the problem of inertial positioning. Relevant literature in this field spans across mobile computing, robotics, and machine learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning-based inertial positioning and its applications in tracking pedestrians, drones, vehicles, and robots. We connect efforts from different fields and discuss how deep learning can be applied to address issues such as sensor calibration, positioning error drift reduction, and multi-sensor fusion. This article aims to attract readers from various backgrounds, including researchers and practitioners interested in the potential of deep learning-based techniques to solve inertial positioning problems.

This paper comprehensively reviews the smart charging strategies that address the challenges of uncontrolled EV charging while exploring the opportunities that smart charging can offer to stakeholders. In this paper, EV smart charging strategies are categorized based on different attributes including control topology, methodology, objectives, and electricity pricing. The control topology-based strategies viz., centralized, decentralized, distributed, hierarchical, and local strategies, are analyzed considering different stakeholder objectives, information &amp; decision signal flow, and transactive EV charging scenarios. In this paper, the benefits of electricity pricing-based strategies and transactive smart charging of EVs are investigated.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to provide diverse services from the air. The service quality may rely on the wireless performance which is affected by the UAV’s position. In this paper, we focus on the UAV placement problem in the Internet of Vehicles, where the UAV is deployed to monitor the road traffic and sends the monitored videos to vehicles. The studied problem is formulated as video resolution maximization by optimizing over the UAV’s position. Moreover, we take into account the maximal transmission delay and impose a probabilistic constraint. To solve the formulated problem, we first leverage the techniques in extreme value theory (EVT) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to characterize the influence of the UAV’s position on the delay performance. Based on this characterization, we subsequently propose a proactive resolution selection and UAV placement approach, which adaptively places the UAV according to the geographic distribution of vehicles. Numerical results justify the joint usage of EVT and GPR for maximal delay characterization. Through investigating the maximal transmission delay, the proposed approach nearly achieves the optimal performance when vehicles are evenly distributed, and reduces 10% and 19% of the 999-th 1000-quantile over two baselines when vehicles are biased distributed.},

In recent years, the security of vehicle communication buses and electronic control units (ECUs) has been extensively studied. However, in actual deployment, there is little concern for the fine management of secure communication schemes with respect to the security level of the ECU on the controller area network (CAN). On this basis, this paper proposes a two-layer ECU group dynamic management scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem. Dynamic grouping management based on the credibility of ECUs while the vehicle is running can effectively balance efficiency and security. During communication, different groups use different modes to achieve higher efficiency. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can satisfy the requirements of security and privacy. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of computing and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {With the integration of 5G NR (New Radio) into railway systems, the demand for enhanced positioning and trajectory tracking performance in High-Speed Train (HST) networks has grown. However, many existing train positioning schemes rely on traditional algorithms like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which may fall short of meeting the precision requirements, particularly in 5G HST scenarios. Addressing this limitation, this paper draws on the concepts presented by Ko et al. (2022) and introduces an Improved Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) using the Least Squares of Undermeasurement (LSU) technique, specifically tailored for nonlinear systems. The IEKF, expanding step by step, theoretically captures statistical properties of the Knorr set for any order prediction error, providing richer information on higher-order terms compared to the traditional EKF. Additionally, for a more intuitive comparison of the IEKF unfolded to different orders, a novel performance indicator is introduced. In conclusion, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios, we demonstrate its superior localization performance by comparing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with traditional nonlinear localization algorithms. The comparisons are based on simulation examples involving train localization tracking and an industrial device ablation system.},

  abstract     = {As 3D LiDAR point cloud and 2D images capture complementary information for autonomous driving, great efforts are made on 3D semantic segmentation using both modalities data. However, they suffer from different problems. 3D-to-2D fusion methods is difficult to determine accurate mapping relations, and the moving objects cannot be carefully considered. 2D-to-3D fusion methods need to process strictly paired data simultaneously, which is time-consuming and impractical in real-time scenarios. In this paper, a novel image-guided knowledge distillation framework based on tri-plane-view is proposed for 3D semantic segmentation. Our method has two main contributions. First, the image features are represented in an efficient 3D tri-plane-view space, which facilitates features alignment and fusion. Second, the object movements can be predicted in such a unified 3D space to fully utilize the time information. The fusion data knowledge is transferred to pure 3D network using knowledge distillation, so only the point cloud branch is needed during inference and thus achieving real-time deployment. Our method is evaluated on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes dataset as well as outdoor environments. As a result, models based on point cloud inputs are significantly improved after applying our method.},

As the most advanced data communication technology, 6G can significantly reduce the latency. Additionally, utilizing remote satellites for assistance can alleviate the computational pressure. In this paper, an Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Internet of Vehicles (IST-IOV) environment was established with 6G networks. Firstly, we established the Edge Computation Service Provider (ECSP) to manage task allocation and data flow. Secondly, considering energy consumption, latency, and offloading process, we define utility values for vehicles and ECSP, construct a Stackelberg bi-level dynamic cooperative game. The existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the game has also been proved by backward induction methods. Finally, based on the interaction between vehicles and ECSP, we proposed a computation offloading algorithm called Dynamic Cooperative Game Theory in IOV (DCGT-IOV). The DCGT-IOV algorithm can find the optimal offloading strategy for vehicles and the optimal pricing strategy for ECSP based on the gradient of the utility function. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher overall utility in various scenarios compared with other strategies and exhibits good convergence properties.},

  abstract     = {In push delivery mode, a supplier determines both delivery orders of customers and vehicle routes. Some customers have small inventory capacity and rapid sale speed (called small-C/S customers). Thus, each of them needs to receive multiple deliveries in a work shift (e.g., one day). The number of deliveries and quantity of each delivery for a customer are unknown. Each delivery has a pair of accommodation time and stockout time, both of which are variable and constitute the soft time window of the delivery. This work proposes a Single-period Inventory Routing problem with split delivery and variable time windows for Small-C/S customers (SIRSC). The number of deliveries for each customer, and the quantity, time window, and arrival time of each delivery are variable. Various products that cannot be mixed can be loaded on the same truck with multiple compartments and a truck can return several times to the depot to resupply in the period. A mathematical programming model is developed for SIRSC, to minimize the sum of transportation and stockout costs. A hybrid ant colony optimization with variable neighborhood search (ACO-VNS) is proposed to solve SIRSC. A distribution network model of ACO is developed and several problem-specific neighborhood structures are designed. ACO-VNS is applied to some problem instances and a real-world gasoline delivery case. Experimental results show that it can effectively solve SIRSC, and outperforms CPLEX and other meta-heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Self-powered wireless sensors are a promising design paradigm for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that need to enable continuous, real-time environmental monitoring using energy harvesting devices. However, currently available energy harvesting devices such as the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), generally have either millimetre-scale environmental monitoring devices or self-powered wireless transmitters, but not both. Typical low energy density of environmental energy has limited self-powered wireless sensors’ long-term operation to laboratory settings and prevented their widespread and large-scale deployment. Here we have developed a battery-free wireless moisture meter with simple structure and high accuracy. Our device is based on off-the-shelf parts suitable for various sensor and artificial intelligence applications. In the detection process, the light signal from the droplet-powered triboelectric nanogenerator is detected by the machine learning algorithm, and the humidity level detection accuracy is up to 97.3%.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of vehicle-to-everything communication technologies, many emerging compute-intensive in-vehicle applications have emerged. Vehicle edge computing (VEC) leverages the computational resources available at edge nodes to alleviate the strain on public network transmission and reduce task processing latency. However, the dynamic nature of the vehicle environment, the challenge of incentivizing vehicles to share idle resources, and the uncertainty surrounding the number of resources shared by vehicles present significant obstacles in designing task offloading and resource allocation methods for VEC systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offloading model wherein task vehicles can offload tasks to roadside units (RSUs) or other vehicles sharing resources. To maximize the benefits derived from task vehicles, RSUs, and shared resource vehicles, we first introduce an adaptive type selection algorithm (ALTS) for shared resource vehicles based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory. Furthermore, we model the three-party interaction as a multi-stage Stackelberg game involving a computational resource lease contract. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ALTS algorithm over existing learning algorithms, thereby showcasing the effectiveness of the lease contract and the three-party transaction mechanism. Comparative experiments also reveal that integrating RSUs and idle vehicle resources offers better services compared to mechanisms relying solely on edge servers or shared resource vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction for neighboring agents is crucial for autonomous vehicles navigating complex scenes. Recent deep learning (DL) methods excel in encoding complex interactions but often generate invalid predictions due to difficulties in modeling transient and contingency interactions. This paper proposes a hierarchical hybrid framework that combines DL and reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, capturing multi-scale interactions that shape future motion. In the DL stage, Transformer-style graph neural network (GNN) is employed to encode heterogeneous interactions at intermediate and global scales, predicting multi-modal intentions as key future positions for agents. In the RL stage, we divide the scene into local scenes based on DL predictions. A Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model, incorporated with vehicle kinematics, generates future trajectories in the form of motion planning shaped by microscopic interactions and guided by a multi-objective reward for balanced agent-centric accuracy and scene-wise compatibility. Experimental results on the Argoverse benchmark and driver-in-loop simulations demonstrate that our framework enhances trajectory prediction feasibility and plausibility in interactive scenes.},

  abstract     = {Considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of motion planning algorithms, which form a cornerstone of the autonomous driving system (ADS). Nonetheless, acquiring an interactive and secure trajectory for the ADS remains challenging due to the complex nature of interaction modeling in planning. Modern planning methods still employ a uniform treatment of prediction outcomes and solely rely on collision-avoidance strategies, leading to suboptimal planning performance. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel prediction-based interactive planning framework for autonomous driving. Our method incorporates interaction reasoning into spatio-temporal (s-t) planning by defining interaction conditions and constraints. Specifically, it records and continually updates interaction relations for each planned state throughout the forward search. We assess the performance of our approach alongside state-of-the-art methods in the CommonRoad environment. Our experiments include a total of 232 scenarios, with variations in the accuracy of prediction outcomes, modality, and degrees of planner aggressiveness. The experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. It leads to a reduction of collision times by approximately 17.6% in 3-modal scenarios, along with improvements of nearly 7.6% in distance completeness and 31.7% in the fail rate in single-modal scenarios.

  abstract     = {Rapid and accurate three-dimensional (3D) detection of asphalt pavement pothole damage is crucial for pavement performance and quality evaluation. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods based on lasers and depth cameras are expensive and lack operability. In addition, ‘false potholes’ are formed through gaps between the asphalt aggregate particles and they interfere with the reconstruction of real potholes. In order to solve the above problems, a new CBAM (convolutional block attention module) optimized pothole segmentation and reconstruction system for monocular images is proposed. First, a network called CBAM-Seg-CapsNet is developed to accurately segment pothole areas from two-dimensional monocular images of pavement. The influence of ‘false potholes’ on the reconstruction of real potholes is avoided. Secondly, an unsupervised monomural depth estimation intelligent network, called ‘CBAM-Recon-Depth’, is developed to realize effective reconstruction of the segmented pothole area. The expensive problem of 3D reconstruction methods, based on lasers and depth cameras, is solved. Compared with some famous segmentation and reconstruction models, the segmentation and reconstruction accuracy of the proposed system are 96.62% and 91.32%, respectively, and the F1-score is 93.89% and 90.76%, respectively. The Dice value of segmentation is 92.27%. The reconstructed RMES Log and Abs Rel are as low as 0.1436 and 0.1252, respectively. On-site experiments are carried out and the reconstruction rate reached 96.05%. The results show that the CBAM optimization system can accurately extract the pothole area and realize the high-precision reconstruction of pothole damage after extraction.},

Therefore, the paper proposes a secure and effective authentication protocol for UAV-assisted IoV. The protocol utilises elliptic curve cryptography to assure the security of the authentication. The protocol undergoes proof of security, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis and informal security analysis to ensure secure and mutual authentication, and have a good resistance to known attacks.

One of the main reasons associated with cyclists’ crashes is the adverse effect of drivers’ cognitive distractions. However, very limited studies have evaluated the impact of cyclists’ cognitive distraction on their behaviors and safety. This study leverages an Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) simulation environment to explore the effect of secondary tasks on cyclists’ cognitive distraction by evaluating their behavioral and physiological responses. Specifically, by recruiting 75 participants, this study explores the effect of listening to music versus talking on the phone as standardized secondary tasks on participants’ behavior (i.e., speed, lane position, input power, head movement) as well as, physiological responses including participants’ heart rate variability and skin conductance metrics. Our results show that listening to high-tempo music can lead to a significantly higher speed, a lower standard deviation of speed, and higher input power. Additionally, the trend is more significant for cyclists who have a strong habit of daily music listening (&gt;4 hours/day). In the high cognitive workload situation (simulated hands-free phone talking), cyclists had a lower speed with less input power and less head movement variation. Our results indicate that participants’ heart rate variability (HRV) features (the power of high frequency, pnni-50) and electrodermal activity (EDA) features like numbers of skin conductance responses (SCR) peaks are sensitive to cyclists’ cognitive load changes in the IVE simulator. Gender differences are identified in cycling performance and physiological response.},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching is a prominent research area in autonomous driving and computer vision. Despite significant progress made by learning-based methods, accurately predicting disparities in hazardous regions, which is crucial for ensuring safe vehicle operation, remains challenging. The limitations of methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are most noticeable in textureless regions and repetitive patterns, leading to unreliable predictions. Furthermore, calculating disparities for boundaries and thin structures, where the disparity jump phenomenon is prominent remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight stereo matching architecture that focuses on obtaining real-time and high-precision disparity maps in hazardous areas. We exploit an efficient global enhanced path to provide global representations in ill-posed regions, where CNN-based approaches often struggle. Second, our model integrates local and global features to generate more reliable cost volume. Finally, our innovative uncertainty-aware module refines disparity, making full use of high-frequency detailed information and uncertainty attention, effectively preserving complex structures. Comprehensive experimental studies on SceneFlow demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an End-Point Error (EPE) of 0.47 with only 3.60M parameters. The effectiveness of our method speed-accuracy trade-off is further confirmed by competitive results obtained from the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 experiments.

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are cost-effective and widely recognized for their significant role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, concerns surrounding range anxiety and charge anxiety have hindered their widespread adoption. To address these concerns, traffic engineers have been working on developing control strategies to reduce energy consumption (EC). Unlike traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, EVs experience a notable increase in EC at speeds exceeding 25km/h. Consequently, minimizing EC often results in reduced speed and longer total travel time (TTT). In light of this, our paper proposes a novel trajectory and signal control method that leverages connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology to realize a tradeoff between EC and TTT. Initially, the approach assumes all vehicles are connected and automated electric vehicles (CAEVs) capable of communication and coordination, to which a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model was applied. Then, the vehicles were controlled to avoid stops and achieve smoother trajectories at the intersections. Finally, the signal control was integrated to further reduce EC and TTT. The proposed method was evaluated with a simulation conducted in SUMO based on a busy corridor in the City of Edmonton, Canada. The developed method successfully balanced energy and traffic efficiency, reducing both EC and TTT by 14% and 38% respectively. More importantly, the computational burden of our method is considerably lighter compared to existing studies, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Overall, the results presented in our study showcase the potential of achieving a more efficient and sustainable traffic system with the future existence of CAEVs.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of batteries in electric vehicles. Due to the slow aging process and complex chemical reactions of batteries, it is challenging to obtain the complete battery lifecycle data to predict the RUL. To embrace these challenges, we propose an intelligent Transformer network with the improved self-attention mechanism based on data of the key interval area. Firstly, the knee-point and knee-onset in the capacity decay curve of the battery are identified by the Bacon-Watts model. The feature data that does not meet the minimum aging period between the knee-point and knee-onset in the aging curve is eliminated to ensure the accuracy and quickness of the prediction. Secondly, the denoising autoencoder (DAE) is used to mine the correlation between the aging characteristics in this interval and the low-dimensional hidden feature of battery aging is reconstructed. Finally, the Transformer network with improved multi-head self-attention mechanism is taken to capture the dependencies between features at different positions. A feed-forward neural network is employed to determine the weights of the features at the different sample time, which are then used in conjunction with fully connected layers and a prediction layer to estimate the remaining lifespan of lithium batteries. The proposed method is validated using the CALCE battery dataset. Simulation results show that the method achieves accurate and fast health prognosis with an average error of 0.0091 for the accuracy metric RE when only key feature interval data are used. There is also a significant advantage in computation time compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, and our method can provide more accurate and faster health prognosis of batteries.},

  abstract     = {Tower cranes are typical underactuated system commonly used on land as a large transport device. Moreover, workers regularly move loads and adjust the length of the rope simultaneously to improve the efficiency of crane transport. However, most of these methods require accurate velocity feedback and do not take into account the lifetime of the driving motor and variable rope length, leading to frequent safety accidents in practical working conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an amplitude saturated nonlinear output feedback controller for five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) underactuated tower cranes without velocity measurement. Firstly, all studies are based on a variable rope length tower crane system. Secondly, an amplitude saturated nonlinear output feedback controller without velocity measurement is designed. Furthermore, Lyapunov theorem and LaSalle’s invariance principle are used to prove the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system at the target position. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Different from almost all canonical SOTA solutions, which are usually computationally expensive and lack generalizability to unforeseen destination nodes, SEGAC offers the following appealing characteristics. SEGAC updates the ego vehicle’s navigation policy in a sample efficient manner, reduces the variance of both value network and policy network during training, and is automatically adaptive to new destinations. Furthermore, the pre-trained SEGAC policy network enables its real-time decision-making ability within seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art SOTA algorithms in simulations across various transportation networks. We also successfully deploy SEGAC to two real metropolitan transportation networks, namely Chengdu and Beijing, using real traffic data, with satisfying results.},

  abstract     = {Drones, particularly when deployed in swarms, hold immense potential for various applications, such as aerial imaging, delivery services, disaster response, and advanced surveillance. Their effective and efficient use, however, hinges on the accurate estimation of energy consumption. This study focuses on determining energy consumption patterns for small drones weighing less than 2 kg and with diameters under 1 m. Through an extensive series of test flights, empirical energy consumption data was collected and used to develop four distinct energy models: a theoretical model based on fundamental flight forces, a simple linear regression model, a cubic polynomial regression model, and a machine learning-based model using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm. A cost function for swarm topology control was also derived for assessing energy consumption during various activities, like connectivity restoration and formation change, facilitating more energy-efficient decision-making in swarm operations. Our findings highlighted an energy-efficient “valley” within the airspeed range, indicating that flying at speeds outside this range results in higher energy consumption. The machine learning model demonstrated superior accuracy within its training range, achieving an R2 of 0.9999, whereas the polynomial regression model was deemed best for extrapolation purposes, delivering an R2 of 0.966. Simple linear regression and theoretical models, although less accurate, can offer quick energy demand calculations and insights into the effects of hardware modifications, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In the process of data acquisition of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), the safety of the network is threatened by the disclosure of source node location information. So how to protect the security and privacy of source node location is the main challenge faced by UASN security. To realize this taeget, a hierarchical structure-based algorithm for protecting source location privacy (HSSLP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it is proposed to divide UASNs into dynamic and static layers based on Ekman drift model. Location privacy protection schemes suitable for source nodes located in different layers have been proposed separately. In the static layer, k-means clustering separates the nodes into groups, and the source node’s location privacy is protected using fake source node and phantom nodes, while auxiliary cluster head and sleep scheduling mechanism are used to save node energy. Nodes in the dynamic layer, whose positions are prone to change, are no longer clustered. The source node makes use of inducing nodes to take adversaries away from the source node, enhancing the privacy and security of the source node with minimal energy expenditure. Finally, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) need to support the cluster head in collecting data combined in the static layer and data uploaded in the dynamic layer. Based on the communication range of AUV, the network is segmented into areas, and when the AUV receives warning messages while traveling, it changes its route to lead the adversary to an area remote from the source node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm owns the capacity to balance the relationship between network security, transmission delay, and node energy consumption. To be more specific, the HSSLP algorithm improves the safety time by about 50%, reduces the delay by about 20% and saves the node energy by about 36% as compared to the DIS-PLP algorithm.},

However, multi-intersection control presents challenges, primarily due to the need for efficient information exchange across increasing intersections, and the importance of spatiotemporal dynamics in traffic flows. Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal aspects, leading to suboptimal control strategies. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Incentive Communication Deep Reinforcement Learning (MICDRL) method, designed for collaborative control across multiple intersections. MICDRL features an incentive communication mechanism, allowing agents to generate customized messages that influence other agents’ policies, thereby enhancing coordination and achieving globally optimal decisions. A key feature of MICDRL is its reliance on local information for message generation, effectively reducing communication overhead while ensuring collaboration. Additionally, MICDRL integrates a teammate module that leverages temporal data for predicting other agents’ actions, crucial for understanding collective dynamics and spatial environment characteristics. Empirical results show that MICDRL outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in metrics like queue length and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a tailored three-layer Internet-of-Things architecture to enhance data collection and transmission.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has generated significant interest in routing techniques for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in both academic and industrial communities. To address the complexity of urban environments and dynamic vehicle mobility, we propose a hierarchical Q-learning-based routing algorithm with grouped roadside unit (RSU) for VANETs. RSUs are grouped, and a Q-vector containing group information is exchanged through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Q-vector-based road-segment (QVRS) control messages are periodically broadcasted to refresh the V2X evaluation metric, which considers vehicle positions, velocities, directions, and communication conditions. To adapt to the nonstationary vehicular environment, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is performed on RSUs at each intersection to achieve distributed learning and local decisions. The hierarchical Q-learning algorithm trains group Q-table and local Q-table individually for reaching destinations on each RSU. The optimal data routing behavior is conducted with two separate Q-tables by utilizing the integrated V2X metric as the reward function. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces broadcasting overhead, prolongs path lifetime and maintains a high packet delivery ratio and low average end-to-end delay. The incorporation of group design in our method accelerates the learning process, which facilitates more efficient communication in VANETs.},

First, we utilize a model predictive control (MPC) driver model to capture the characteristics of driver experience deficit in low adhesion road conditions, considering the driver’s neuromuscular delay as the system time lag. Then, a dynamic driving weighting strategy is proposed to adjust the driving weights, taking into account both driver-automation handling conflicts and road risks. Next, in order to account for the nonlinear tire dynamics encountered on low adhesion road surfaces, the problem of driver-automation cooperative steering control is mathematically framed as a nonlinear game. The utilization of the piecewise affine(PWA) theory enables the linearization of the nonlinear game optimization problem, facilitating the derivation of an optimal control strategy for ensuring vehicle stability on low adhesion road conditions. Finally, the proposed method is rigorously validated through simulations and driver-in-the-loop tests, comparing its performance against an existing driver-automation cooperative steering control approach. The experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating the driver’s steering workload and leveraging tire forces optimally to enhance vehicle stability.},

With the short-term prediction of vehicle speed and road grade, the upper-level controller for the diesel engine could respond in advance and hence reduce fuel consumption by avoiding sudden braking and acceleration. Similarly, according to the engine-out NOx emissions predicted through upper-level control actions, the lower-level dosing controller of SCR system could remove the NOx emissions more efficiently as well.

  abstract     = {Explaining the decision made by end-to-end autonomous driving is a difficult task. These approaches take raw sensor data and compute the decision as a black box with large deep learning models. Understanding the output of deep learning is a complex challenge due to the complicated nature of explainability; as data passes through the network, it becomes untraceable, making it difficult to understand. Explainability increases confidence in the decision by making the black box that drives the vehicle transparent to the user inside. Achieving a Level 5 autonomous vehicle necessitates the resolution of that challenging task. In this work, we propose a model that leverages the driver’s attention to obtain explainable decisions based on an attention map and the scene context. Our novel architecture addresses the task of obtaining a decision and its explanation from a single RGB sequence of the driving scene ahead. We base this architecture on the Transformer architecture with some efficiency tricks in order to use it at a reasonable frame rate. Moreover, we integrate in this proposal our previous ARAGAN model, which obtains SOTA attention maps, to improve the performance of the model thanks to understand the sequence as a human does. We train and validate our proposal on the BDD-OIA dataset, achieving on-pair results or even better than other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present a simulation-based proof of concept demonstrating the model’s performance as a copilot in a close-loop vehicle to driver interaction.},

  abstract     = {Visual tracking plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems and has a wide range of practical applications such as autonomous driving and traffic counting. Recently, the attention mechanism in Transformers has been successfully applied to the field of visual tracking, leading to a significant improvement in tracking performance. However, Transformer-based trackers directly flatten two-dimensional image features into one-dimensional vectors to compute attention scores. This process unavoidably results in the omission of crucial position distribution information necessary for precise target localization. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-attention based tracking-by-segmentation framework, called Dynamical Position Embedding based Tracking framework (DPET). DPET incorporates an additional network for modeling position information to complement the cross-attention module. To be specific, a dynamical position embedding network is introduced to adaptively encode position information. This network is then integrated into the cross-attention based feature fusion network to compensate for the loss of position distribution information. As a result, the fused feature incorporates abundant contextual semantic cues for target classification and precise position information for target localization simultaneously. To overcome the constraints imposed by bounding-boxes, a segmentation network that takes the fused feature as input is designed to achieve accurate pixel-wise tracking. Extensive experiments on eight challenging tracking benchmarks show that our DPET tracker enables real-time operations and achieves promising tracking performance on the GOT-10K benchmark. Especially, DPET tracker achieves the top accuracy scores on VOT2016, VOT2018 and VOT2019 benchmarks.},

In this paper, we focus on the multi-UAV network area coverage problem (ACP) which require intelligent UAVs long-term trajectory decisions in the complex and scalable network environment. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as an effective tool for solving long-term decisions problems. However, since the input dimension of multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based deep neural network (DNN) is fixed, it is difficult for standard DNN to adapt to a variable number of UAVs and network users. Therefore, we combine Transformer with DRL to meet the scalability of the network and propose a Transformer-based deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (T-MARL) algorithm. Transformer can adapt to variable input dimensions and extract important information from complex network states by attention module. In our research, we find that random initialization of Transformer may cause DRL training failure, so we propose a baseline-assisted pre-training scheme. This scheme can quickly provide an initial policy model for UAVs based on imitation learning, and use the temporal-difference(1) algorithm to initialize policy evaluation network. Finally, based on parameter sharing, T-MARL is applicable to any standard DRL algorithm and supports expansion on networks of different sizes. Experimental results show that T-MARL can make UAVs have cooperative behaviors and perform outstandingly on ACP.},

Before the commercialization and adoption of this emerging transportation mode, however, aviation safety must be guaranteed, i.e., all the aircraft have to be safely separated by strategic and tactical deconfliction. Reinforcement learning has demonstrated effectiveness in the tactical deconfliction of en route commercial air traffic in simulation. However, its performance is found to be dependent on the traffic density. In this project, we propose a novel framework that combines demand capacity balancing (DCB) for strategic conflict management and reinforcement learning for tactical separation. By using DCB to precondition traffic to proper density levels, we show that reinforcement learning can achieve much better performance for tactical safety separation. Our results also indicate that this DCB preconditioning can allow target levels of safety to be met that are otherwise impossible. In addition, combining strategic DCB with reinforcement learning for tactical separation can meet these safety levels while achieving greater operational efficiency than alternative solutions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-vehicle pursuit (MVP) such as autonomous police vehicles pursuing suspects is important but very challenging due to its mission and safety-critical nature. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed for MVP in structured grid-pattern roads, the existing algorithms use random training samples in centralized learning, which leads to homogeneous agents showing low collaboration performance. For the more challenging problem of pursuing multiple evaders, these algorithms typically select a fixed target evader for pursuers without considering dynamic traffic situation, which significantly reduces pursuing success rate. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Progression Cognition Reinforcement Learning with Prioritized Experience for MVP (PEPCRL-MVP) in urban multi-intersection dynamic traffic scenes. PEPCRL-MVP uses a prioritization network to assess the transitions in the global experience replay buffer according to each MARL agent’s parameters. With the personalized and prioritized experience set selected via the prioritization network, diversity is introduced to the MARL learning process, which can improve collaboration and task-related performance. Furthermore, PEPCRL-MVP employs an attention module to extract critical features from dynamic urban traffic environments. These features are used to develop a progression cognition method to adaptively group pursuing vehicles. Each group efficiently targets one evading vehicle. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator over unstructured roads of an urban area show that PEPCRL-MVP is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, PEPCRL-MVP improves pursuing efficiency by 3.95% over Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient-Decentralized Multi-Agent Pursuit and its success rate is 34.78% higher than that of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. Codes are open-sourced.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach based on virtual coupling of train control systems in subway lines has the potential to enhance transportation efficiency. Y-shaped lines have proven to be valuable in improving efficiency, and the rational application of the virtual coupling strategy on these lines can help to alleviate passenger flow pressure. However, train operations can be affected by uncertain disturbances that require real-time adjustments. Due to the complexity of train scheduling on Y-shaped lines, delays may be difficult to manage if they are scheduled according to a single timetable. In this paper, we propose a flexible adjustment of the planned schedule on Y-shaped lines, which considers the switching sequence of turnouts while ensuring safety. We present a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that optimizes the total train delays, number of stranded passengers, and passenger waiting time. The simulation results demonstrate that our model effectively improves train punctuality while reducing stranded passengers and passenger waiting time.},

  abstract     = {Recently, heterogeneous automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are widely deployed to improve the work efficiency of the logistics warehouse with limited space. While completing various tasks to improve efficiency and reduce transport costs, heterogeneous AGVs also bring new challenges to task planning in warehouses because of their different shapes, speeds, and capabilities. Briefly, it is difficult to efficiently calculate the costs for heterogeneous AGVs to complete tasks and assign heterogeneous AGVs suitable tasks in real time. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study the Task Planning for Heterogeneous AGVs (TPHA) problem, in which the warehouse assigns tasks to suitable heterogeneous AGVs to minimize the total cost containing the travel cost and the tardiness cost. To solve the TPHA problem, we propose a novel framework that considers the route planning and task assignment simultaneously. Within this framework, we first present an efficient cost computation algorithm to calculate costs between tasks and heterogeneous AGVs. Then, we present two task assignment algorithms to assign tasks to suitable heterogeneous AGVs. Finally, we propose an improved route planning algorithm for further improving the processing time and reducing the total cost. Compared with state-of-the-art, extensive experiments on both real and synthesized datasets examine that our proposed algorithms can save 91.83%~97.19% of processing time and reduce 29.08% of the total cost at most.},

  abstract     = {Automatic prediction of visibility from surveillance images can provide timely warnings for transportation management departments and drivers, which is of great significance for improving the driving safety of highways in foggy weather. The currently mainstream prediction models are based on deep networks, which mainly learn visual features as clues to predict visibility levels. However, the geometric features of highways, such as the lane lines that can be observed from surveillance images are also important clues to reflect the visibility. Therefore, we propose a dual-branch fusion network driven by both geometric and visual features to achieve robust and effective visibility prediction. Specifically, we first exploit dual branches to learn geometric features of highway and deep visual features from the foggy surveillance images, respectively. We then design a fused classification module to fuse the dual-branch features to predict the visibility level. In order to simultaneously purify features during the fusion process, it utilizes a road attention block to highlight the deep visual features corresponding to the highway road area, and a lane length estimation block to extract the feature of the length of observable lane lines. Therefore, the dual-branch features can be adaptively fused to boost prediction performance. Meanwhile, we construct a real-scene foggy image dataset, which are all gathered from the surveillance video of real highways in China. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed network on this real-scene dataset and the synthetic dataset FRIDA. The experimental results show that our method can predict visibility levels more accurately than multiple existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of occluded moving vehicles at intersections can prevent collisions, but most of the existing sensors only detect objects in sight. Sound propagates around obstacles by means such as reflection and diffraction, allowing passive acoustic sensing of the occluded vehicle. We propose a deep learning-based acoustic non-line-of-sight (NLOS) vehicle detection method. With the direction-of-arrival feature and time-frequency feature calculated from the microphone array data as inputs in image form, we designed and trained the parallel neural network to perceive the direction of the occluded moving vehicle at intersections. Since intelligent vehicles react differently to the approaching and leaving occluded moving vehicle, we further distinguished the occluded moving vehicle’s approaching/leaving status. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data from different locations in the urban environment. The experimental results show that the classification for 6-class intersection traffic conditions reached 96.71%, and the occluded approaching vehicle was detected 1 second before it entered the line of sight, providing additional reaction time for intelligent vehicles. The direction of the occluded moving vehicle is accurately predicted, and the approaching/leaving status is further inferred, providing detailed traffic information for the intelligent vehicles’ response decisions. Furthermore, experiments show that the predictions of our method outperform the state-of-the-art acoustic NLOS approach vehicle detection baseline on real-world traffic datasets.

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional light detection and ranging (3D LiDAR) sensors are widely used in autonomous vehicles. Among various perception problems using a 3D LiDAR, the identification of drivable region (DR) is one of the most important problems. In this paper, the DR identification using a 3D LiDAR is reformulated as a completion problem. In other words, the problem is to generate the virtual points so that the virtual points cover the DR as densely and uniformly as possible, thereby representing the DR well enough. The problem considered herein is named the DR completion problem. To solve the DRC, a new network called the Drivable Region Completion Network (DRCN) is proposed. The proposed DRCN consists of an encoder part and a decoder part. The encoder part consists of two encoders. The first one is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) encoder, and it captures the global feature of the given LiDAR points. The second one is named the Point Pyramid Network (PPN) encoder, and it extracts local features between the points in the point cloud. The decoder part takes the coarse-to-fine structure, and it consists of the coarse and refinement decoders. The coarse decoder predicts seed points for the DR. The refinement decoder refines the seed points to predict the final dense DR points. Finally, the DRCN is applied to the SemanticKITTI dataset for evaluation. The proposed DRCN is validated by showing that our DRCN outperforms other DR detection methods in terms of accuracy.},

Researchers have focused on autonomously detecting distracted driver behavior so that drivers can be alerted in time to reduce the risk of crashes. Despite the large number of approaches presented in the literature, there are still issues related to proper performance evaluation, reproducibility and lack of or very slow adoption of these approaches by the transportation industry. Most existing approaches either do not provide documented and usable codes or use private datasets, or do not present the experiment details, such as data split, sometimes resulting in inflated accuracy numbers. Moreover, these factors also make many results not reproducible. In addition, the performance metrics should be chosen carefully to measure various aspects of different methods, including their generalizability, and action localization ability in time. In this work, we perform a commensurate comparison of different state-of-the-art methods by using different data splits and performance metrics on the StateFarm distracted driving and AI CITY Challenge datasets. With the data split experiments, we highlight the importance of leave-N-driver-out cross validation, since these models should perform well in real-world testing with never-before-seen drivers. The results show the importance of data splitting and the performance metric for the comparison and evaluation of different methods, and their significant effects on the results.},

Short-term metro origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is an essential component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which allows operators to better monitor the metro system and improve the level of service for passengers. In this paper, we exploit a novel data structure, hypergraph, to represent the complex correlation between OD pairs, and propose an elaborately designed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Attentive Multi-HyperGraph Network (ST-DAMHGN) to tackle the short-term OD passenger flow prediction problem. In the proposed framework, we construct multiple hypergraphs to model the relationship between OD pairs and adopt the perceptual field to realize efficient and effective vertex feature extraction. Then, we utilize the attention mechanism to adaptively and dynamically synthesize information from multiple hypergraphs and make a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. A case study is conducted on the metro system of Hangzhou, China. The results of extensive experiments show that ST-DAMHGN outperforms baseline models. The efficiency is validated for the multi-hypergraph model, perceptual field, spatial feature extraction, and attention mechanism. The hypergraph structure used in our model is verified suitable for modeling traffic data without physical road networks to map directly, e.g., OD passenger flow. ST-DAMHGN can be widely implemented by defining proper correlations for model relationships.},

In this paper, we investigate a dynamic parcel pick-up problem where a vehicle with limited capacity collects customers’ parcels on a closed tour. We consider stochastic demand, stochastic service requests, and stochastic service cancellations simultaneously. Aimed at minimizing the total travel distance of the vehicle, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and jointly apply state aggregation and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to overcome the curse of dimensionality in solution solving. First, we introduce the concept of $aggregation~granularity$ , which refers to the number of states that are combined into a single common vector. Based on the cardinalities of the post-decision state’s component sets, we propose a state aggregation method that reduces the size of the state searching space from exponential to quartic. By utilizing this aggregation, our routing policy is represented implicitly by state value functions that are stored in a lookup table in memory. Second, we develop a novel and well-performing ADP-based routing policy that differs from the general ADP-based policy. We derive a lower bound of the post-decision state value function and use it in policy development. Third, during online execution, we apply a rollout algorithm with the lower bound-based policy as its base policy, resulting in an online rollout policy. Finally, through numerical analysis, we examine the impact of $aggregation~granularity$ and the advantages of the online rollout policy.},

  abstract     = {Achieving real-time and accuracy on embedded platforms has always been the pursuit of road segmentation methods. To this end, they have proposed many lightweight networks. However, they ignore the fact that roads are “stuff” (background or environmental elements) rather than “things” (specific identifiable objects), which inspires us to explore the feasibility of representing roads with low-level instead of high-level features. Surprisingly, we find that the primary stage of mainstream network models is sufficient to represent most pixels of the road for segmentation. Motivated by this, we propose a Low-level Feature Dominated Road Segmentation network (LFD-RoadSeg). Specifically, LFD-RoadSeg employs a bilateral structure. The spatial detail branch is firstly designed to extract low-level feature representation for the road by the first stage of ResNet-18. To suppress texture-less regions mistaken as the road in the low-level feature, the context semantic branch is then designed to extract the context feature in a fast manner. To this end, in the second branch, we asymmetrically downsample the input image and design an aggregation module to achieve comparable receptive fields to the third stage of ResNet-18 but with less time consumption. Finally, to segment the road from the low-level feature, a selective fusion module is proposed to calculate pixel-wise attention between the low-level representation and context feature, and suppress the non-road low-level response by this attention. On KITTI-Road, LFD-RoadSeg achieves a maximum F1-measure (MaxF) of 95.21% and an average precision of 93.71%, while reaching 238 FPS on a single TITAN Xp and 54 FPS on a Jetson TX2, all with a compact model size of just 936k parameters.

We use these rules for traffic situation assessment and to derive traffic-related constraints that are inserted in the optimization problem. Our optimization-based approach enables the formalization of abstract verbal expressions, such as traffic rules, and their incorporation in the trajectory optimization algorithm along with the dynamics and other constraints that dictate the system’s evolution over a sufficiently long planning horizon. The ability to plan considering different types of constraints and the system’s dynamics, over a long horizon in a unified manner, leads to a proactive motion planner that mimics rule-compliant maneuvering behavior, suitable for navigation in mixed-traffic environments. The efficacy and scalability of the derived algorithm are validated in different simulation scenarios, including complex traffic situations with multiple Obstacle Vessels.},

  abstract     = {Passengers of level 3–5 autonomous personal mobility vehicles (APMV) can perform non-driving tasks, such as reading books and smartphones, while driving. It has been pointed out that such activities may increase motion sickness, especially when frequently avoiding pedestrians or obstacles in shared spaces. Many studies have been conducted to build countermeasures, of which various computational motion sickness models have been developed. Among them, models based on subjective vertical conflict (SVC) theory, which describes vertical changes in direction sensed by human sensory organs v.s. those expected by the central nervous system, have been actively developed. To model motion sickness due to conflict between visual vertical information and vestibular sensation, we proposed a 6 DoF SVC-VV model which added a visually perceived vertical block into a conventional 6 DoF SVC model to predict visual vertical directions from image data simulating the visual input of a human. In a driving experiment, 27 participants rode on the APMV and experienced slalom driving with two visual conditions: looking ahead (LAD) and working with a tablet device (WAD). We verified that passengers got motion sickness while riding the APMV, and the symptoms were severer when especially working on it, by simulating the frequent pedestrian avoidance scenarios of the APMV in the experiment. In addition, the results of the experiment demonstrated that the proposed 6 DoF SVC-VV model could describe the increased motion sickness experienced when the visual vertical and gravitational acceleration directions were different.},

  abstract     = {“Read-write-own” based Web3 has been proposed as a promising user-centric Internet to open the new generation of the World Wide Web, where Web3 users can independently manage data and derive value from creating content without relying on intermediaries. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in Web3 can trade models in a self-controlled and decentralized credible way, which is a fundamentally and principally innovation based on novel architecture. Effectively implementing such paradigms involves proper model trading strategies. However, reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies face challenges of poor generalization ability, low feasibility, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. It is also difficult to define an explicit and appropriate reward function. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence-based reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for CAVs in Web3. We present a framework to enable model transactions between CAVs. Also, we provide a decentralized identifier (DID)-based identity management system for resource description and data verification to access Web3, followed by the mechanism and supporting smart contracts. Furthermore, we formulate the model trading issue as an active inference to form higher-level cognition about the environment without rewards. Then we use IRL to solve it. And we use “intelligence,” a high-level indicator, to quantify the efficiency of such cognition. It can evaluate the difference between the predicted state and the real state in policy exploration. The proposed scheme shows good generalization and can auto-balance exploration and exploitation, simultaneously achieving outperforming performance on the model trading issue with no rewards. In simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with existing methods.},

The common approach of human-like AD is to learn from human demonstration data, for which it is exhausting and difficult to construct well-rounded and reliable datasets. Therefore, we proposed the human-like AD decision-making method based on drivers’ cognition mechanism. The fundamental and difficult thing of this method is to figure out drivers’ cognitive mechanism systematically and comprehensively, which is still either too rough or too fragmented for AD development. By integrating the abundant studies about drivers’ cognition in multiple fields, we propose two novel conceptual models: Potential Hazard Model (PHM) illustrates the mechanisms of drivers’ reaction in the simple meta-scenarios while Candidate Selection Model (CSM) explains how drivers handle complicated scenarios based on PHM. Based on PHM and CSM, we propose the human-like decision-making method for AD. This method integrates cognitive mechanisms, natural driving data, optimization-based planning, and other techniques profoundly. The experiments in extensive road and traffic scenarios verify that the method show good generalizability, interpretability, and human-likeness.},

This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets related to driving scenarios that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-the-art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test. Finally, the paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the performance of some defense methods against such attacks, showing how the datasets generated with CARLA-GeAR might be used in future work as a benchmark for adversarial defense in the real world.

This work proposes VDTNet, an accurate, lightweight, and fast network for visually detecting and tracking intruding drones. We first incorporate an SPP module into the first head of YOLOv4 to enhance detection accuracy. Model compression is utilized to shrink the model size and concurrently speed up inference. We then propose and insert an SPPS module and a ResNeck module into the neck, and introduce an effective attention module for the backbone to compensate for the accuracy drop brought on by compression. With the above strategies, we present the accurate and compact VDTNet with a model size of merely 3.9 MB, ensuring low computational cost and fast detection and tracking performance in real time. Extensive experiments on four challenging public datasets show that our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In real-world scenarios, the comparative ground-to-air detection testing proves the generalization ability of the VDTNet, and we further demonstrate the portability and practicability of the network by deploying it on drone onboard edge-computing devices for air-to-air real-time detection of the intruding drones.},

  abstract     = {Private car-based carpooling (PCC) has become an important transportation mode in our daily life. Unlike ride-hailing or taxi-based carpooling, PCC has two unique features that have yet to be fully explored: (i) A private-car driver has more bargaining space than a non-private car driver; (ii) There exists unfriendly congestion in private car-based carpooling if not handled well. Existing carpooling schemes are not tailored for PCC services with an oversimplified assumption that passengers pay detour fees and there is no guarantee on the passenger’s travel time. Consequently, such limitations not only harm the passenger’s carpooling incentive but also hurt the passenger’s quality of experience as well as the driver’s utility. We propose a novel framework for the double-sided preference-aware carpooling (D-SPAC) problem, after comprehensively addressing the above two unique features. We formulate the D-SPAC problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, which is proved to be NP-hard, to maximize the total utility of passengers while meeting the driver’s buyout asking price, traversal radius, passenger’s waiting time, budget and both sides’ detour length constraints. We design a coalitional double auction-based scheme that can better motivate both sides with guaranteed economic properties. We further design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to cope with the position dynamics and the changing user requests. Extensive experimental results based on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms over three benchmark algorithms.},

This paper focuses on investigating the influence of motion-cueing, sound and vibration feedback on driving behaviour and experience. A prototype teleoperation station is developed with feedback from audio, vibration actuators, and motion cues. Using this prototype, the experiment is carried out in two scenarios: a low-speed disturbance scenario with 30 participants and a dynamic driving scenario with 22 participants. Objective and subjective assessment methods are used to evaluate driving behaviour and experience separately. The results indicate that the combination of motion-cueing, sound and vibration feedback provides the most favourable driving experience for the participants. Specifically, sound and vibration feedback enhance drivers’ sense of speed, while motion-cueing feedback helps in road surface sensing, leading to increased throttle reversal rate in the low-speed disturbance scenario. However, it is noteworthy that motion-cueing feedback does not significantly improve driving performance in the dynamic driving scenario of this study.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that diverse prediction benefits from region-based relation learning. The predicted intermediate location distributions better fit the ground truth when incorporating the relation module.

However, dynamic vehicular environments and various safety applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements cannot be accommodated by a fixed set of communication parameters and network configuration. This paper proposes and exploits a real-time constrained optimization platform that leverages the combination of a fast stochastic model with a carefully configured regression deep learning neural network (DLNN) to achieve an optimal balance between the QoS and the channel spectrum efficiency. The stochastic model is utilized to predict the QoS of IEEE 802.11 broadcast vehicular ad hoc networks given a selected group of communication parameters and analytical equations or measured data about the communication channels. The data provided by the stochastic model is sorted based on the QoS requirements for a given safety service and is preprocessed to keep enough distance between the training data patterns. The DLNN is trained by a randomly sampled data set to accomplish the inverse mapping (from the QoS to the corresponding parameter sets) to facilitate real-time optimization. In the process of optimization, by working in tandem, the DLNN and stochastic model synergistically identify the optimal parameter set that maximizes channel efficiency while adhering to QoS constraints in a fast and precise manner. The computation complexity of the optimization is analyzed and estimated. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization system have been demonstrated through experiments conducted on Google Colab using TensorFlow and Python, showcasing its superiority over the alternative optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deemed as a potential technique for the future of the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their capability of smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment using a large number of low-cost passive elements. To benefit from RIS technology, the problem of RIS-assisted channel state information (CSI) acquisition needs to be carefully considered. Existing channel estimation methods usually ignored the different channel characteristics of direct channel and reflected channels. In fact, the reflected channel can be smartly configured by adjusting the phase shifts of the RIS, which is different from the direct channel due to the different path loss exponents between the transmitter and receiver. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop a RIS-assisted channel estimation to determine the direct and reflected channels, respectively. In this paper, we study a RIS-assisted channel estimation that jointly exploits the properties of the direct and the reflected channel to provide more accurate CSI. The direct channel is estimated using weighted $\ell _{1}$ norm minimization, while the reflected channel is modeled based upon the robust $\ell _{1,\tau }$ norm minimization to sequentially estimate the channel parameters. Moreover, by combining the gradient descent and the alternating minimization method, a flexible and fast algorithm is developed to provide a feasible solution. Simulation results demonstrate that an RIS-aided MIMO system significantly reduces the active antennas/RF chains compared to other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Traditional monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems rely on point features or line features to estimate and optimize the camera trajectory and build a map of the surrounding environment. However, in complex scenarios such as underground parking, the performance of traditional point-line SLAM systems tends to degrade due to mirror reflection, illumination change, poor texture, and other interference. This paper proposes VPL-SLAM, a structural vertical line supported point-line monocular SLAM system that works well in complex environments such as underground parking or campus. The proposed system leverages structural vertical lines at all instances of the process. With the assistance of the structural vertical lines and global vertical direction, our system can output a more accurate visual odometry result. Furthermore, the resulting map of our system is a more reasonable structural line feature map than the previous point-line-based monocular SLAM systems. Our system has been tested with the popular autonomous driving dataset Kitti Odometry. In addition, to fully test the proposed SLAM system, we also test our system using a self-collected dataset, including underground parking and campus scenarios. As a result, our proposal reveals a more accurate navigation result and a more reasonable structural resulting map compared to state-of-the-art point-line SLAM systems such as Structure PLP-SLAM.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication, as a traffic offloading technology in the fifth-generation (5G) network, can be widely used in several scenarios to provide 5G characteristics of higher speed, lower latency, and larger capacity. D2D data transmission over wireless channels among mobile devices is vulnerable to security threats and privacy violations from third parties and relay nodes. However, academia and industry have yet to propose relevant schemes or standards for D2D relay data transmission scenarios. We first propose a generic construction for D2D relay communication in this paper. Then, a concrete anonymous and secure D2D data transmission scheme with trajectory tracking is presented based on Chebyshev polynomials, hash-based message authentication code, and symmetric encryption. We employ a formal verification tool - Tamarin, modal logic analysis - BAN logic, and informal security analysis to demonstrate the security features of the proposed scheme. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve desirable efficiency compared with other related schemes. Finally, we developed an APP, ‘D2DWatchmen’, to simulate the whole protocol and test its robustness and real execution time, where the result shows good availability and effectiveness.},

The current CACC algorithms are designed with the assumption that the communication channel is secure. However, the use of communication channels makes CACC susceptible to attacks, such as False data injection (FDI). This paper develops a novel secure nonlinear controller and a nonlinear observer which can estimate FDI attacks in real-time. Furthermore, this paper shows that the developed controller and FDI attack estimation techniques ensure semi-globally uniformly bounded tracking under FDI attacks, noise, and disturbances. The efficaciousness of the proposed CACC algorithm was demonstrated in simulation and through experimental implementation. During testing using both methodologies, the controller was able to maintain a safe following distance and estimate FDI attacks and noise in real-time.},

Existing methods primarily focused on the driving behavior of light-duty vehicles based on analysis methods using simulation or questionnaire data, while heavy-duty vehicles, which bear significant responsibility for fatal accidents, are seldom investigated. This study develops a context-aware attention encoder-decoder deep framework for aggressive driving identification, utilizing real massive multi-source heterogeneous data collected under naturalistic driving conditions. The proposed framework incorporates vehicle-related, driving-related, weather-related and environment-related data. Through the BiLSTM based encoder-decoder deep architecture, high-level representations of driving behavior are learned from driving signals layer by layer, and temporal dependencies are captured from both forward and backward directions. By learning context-aware personalized latent semantic vectors at different time step, the model is capable of adaptively focusing on the important information for prediction. To our knowledge, the aggressive driving of heavy-duty vehicles under connected and naturalistic driving conditions has been rarely explored. This study contributes to the current understanding in this field. The proposed framework is evaluated based on the multi-source heterogeneous driving behavior data generated from over 13000 vehicles in a connected environment under naturalistic driving conditions. Empirical results from extensive experiments validate that the proposed model outperforms competing models, providing a promising approach with high effectiveness and robustness for aggressive driving behavior identification.},

To be able to improve the passing efficiency of intelligent vehicles, it is crucial to be able to interact with oncoming vehicles with different driving styles. An overtaking decision needs to be adapted to the situation where the vehicle being overtaken is potentially stationary or moving. Therefore, this paper proposes an overtaking decision method based on potential conflict area based on the requirements. Firstly, the planning method for each stage is given, and the generation method of the potential conflict area is proposed. Second, the interaction process between the host vehicle and the opposite oncoming vehicle is modelled by a dynamic game based on the potential conflict area. A driving style assessment method for oncoming vehicles based on potential conflict area is proposed. Thirdly, the priority of passing the potential conflict area of multiple oncoming vehicles is divided to correct the speed planning in the waiting and the speed payoff function in the game. Finally, the overtaking decision is simulated and validated by Virtual Test Drive.},

  abstract     = {Bus bunching is harmful to the efficiency and stability of bus transit systems, consequently delaying the arrival time of passengers and lowering the public transportation’s adoption rate. Traditional solutions adjust the additional holding time of buses at certain stations to mitigate this phenomenon. These methods sacrifice the system efficiency in exchange for even headway between neighboring buses. Little work focuses on optimizing multiple strategies when a single bus line not only has a bus bay to increase bus dwell time but also owns several dedicated bus lanes to accelerate. In this work, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL) framework to combine these two strategies. Speeding up certain buses via dedicated lanes can counteract the negative influence of additional holding time. Next, to support the two strategies, we devise a two-layer policy scheme, one for high-level policy deciding holding or accelerating and the other for low-level policy determining the specific dwell time or increase of speed. Besides, to handle the issue that the controlling actions of agents are asynchronous and temporally extended, we establish a duration-critic module based on the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) mechanism to model other agents’ impact during the period between two consecutive control. We evaluate the proposed framework on a simulated bus line with a quasi-real-world pattern to compare the performance of both traditional headway-based control methods and existing MARL methods. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines, not only stabilizing a strongly unstable bus line but also shortening the traveling times of passengers.},

  abstract     = {Driver Distraction Detection (3D) is of great significance in helping intelligent vehicles decide whether to remind drivers or take over the driving task and avoid traffic accidents. However, the current centralized learning paradigm of 3D has become unpractical because of rising limitations on data sharing and increasing concerns about user privacy. In this context, 3D is further facing three emerging challenges, namely data islands, data heterogeneity, and the straggler issue. To jointly address these three issues and make the 3D model training and deployment more practical and efficient, this paper proposes an Asynchronous Federated Meta-learning framework called AFM3D. Specifically, AFM3D bridges data islands through Federated Learning (FL), a novel distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients (i.e., private vehicles with individual data of drivers) to learn a global model collaboratively without data exchange. Moreover, AFM3D further utilizes meta-learning to tackle data heterogeneity by training a meta-model that can adapt to new driver data quickly with satisfactory performance. Finally, AFM3D is designed to operate in an asynchronous mode to reduce delays caused by stragglers and achieve efficient learning. A temporally weighted aggregation strategy is also designed to handle stale models commonly encountered in the asynchronous mode and in turn, optimize the aggregation direction. Extensive experiment results show that AFM3D can boost performance in terms of model accuracy, recall, F1 score, test loss, and learning speed by 7.61%, 7.44%, 7.95%, 9.95%, and 50.91%, respectively, against five state-of-the-art methods.},

A new pedestrian–vehicle game utility matrix is embedded into the social-generative adversarial network pedestrian trajectory prediction model, which considers information between pedestrians and vehicles and analyzes the state of pedestrian–vehicle-interactions under various decisions through microscopic motion factors and macroscopic game decisions. The experimental results show that the proposed model is more accurate and explanatory than traditional pedestrian trajectory prediction models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), Social LSTM, Social generative adversarial network(S-GAN), and Sophie.},

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach to travel time estimation, utilizing a well-designed deep neural network model called Knowledge Distillation for Travel Time Estimation (KDTTE). By implementing knowledge distillation techniques, the model’s computational and memory requirements are reduced, while simultaneously improving its accuracy. The student model leverages the knowledge of the Teacher model to learn features it would not have been able to on its own, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of the model.

  abstract     = {Detecting driver fatigue is critical for ensuring traffic safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the golden standard for brain activity measurement and is considered a good indicator of detecting driver fatigue. However, the current driver fatigue detection algorithm has limitations in mining and fusing the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch deep learning network named spatio-temporal fusion network with brain region partitioning strategy (STFN-BRPS) to improve the accuracy and robustness of driver fatigue recognition. Initially, we develop a recurrent multi-scale convolution module (RMSCM) comprising a multi-scale convolution sub-module, a CNN-Bi-LSTM sub-module, and a residual structure branch. RMSCM effectively extracts highly discriminative long short-term temporal feature information. Secondly, we propose a dynamic graph convolution module and a spatial graph edges’ importance weight assignment method based on brain region partitioning strategy, which can acquire intrinsic spatial feature information between electrodes. Thirdly, we design a feature fusion module (FFM) that utilizes channel attention to fuse long short-term temporal and spatial features. FFM learns and prioritizes the significance and relevance of each channel in the fused features. Finally, the fused spatio-temporal features are passed into the classification module to obtain the predicted driver fatigue state. Extensive comparison and ablation studies are conducted on EEG signals collected from real-world driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed STFN-BRPS model delivers superior classification performance compared to the mainstream methods. This study establishes a benchmark for EEG-based driver fatigue detection and related deep-learning modeling work.},

Zero-speed pedestrians can be encountered in places such as shopping centers, sidewalks with retail stores, or public gatherings. When integrated into a crowd simulation, zero-speed pedestrians can cause blockages, particularly livelocks, as observed when using the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm. A livelock in a simulation is a situation where an agent is blocked but still has room to move. If the livelock is not handled properly, it will invalidate the simulation runs. We provide insight into the causes of livelocks and propose a modification of ORCA that successfully prevents livelocks from occurring in typical situations in which they can be observed using ORCA. Among other applications, this model can be used as a crowd management tool to evaluate the impact of zero-speed pedestrians on crowd flow.},

In this paper, a UAV-assisted Intelligent True Data Evaluation (UITDE) method has been proposed to solve this problem effectively. UITDE has two main contributions. First, we abandon traditional algorithms that only use workers’ data to obtain estimated truths and compute their trusts directly. In contrast, we employ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect data as ground truths to test and calculate workers’ trusts. Second, there are some unmalicious workers who collect inaccurate data due to their aged sensing equipment, extreme weather, or other objective reasons, so we propose a data rectification algorithm to rectify their data.

We propose an analytical comfort model that considers the coupled and nonlinear effect of acceleration and jerk levels on the comfort perceived by standing bus passengers. This is studied through offline path planning by formulating the docking problem as a Nonlinear Program while implementing the comfort model to minimize discomfort. Geometry constraints are imposed on several points on the vehicle contour to ensure that the bus stays within the road bounds and docking is performed safely. The offline solution is then used as a reference in a real-time control event using a Volvo 7900 autonomous bus. To gain perspective, the measurements from the field test were compared to those of a human-driven trajectory. The results indicate that only around $\mathbf {\mathrm {1.7~\%}}$ of bus occupants will experience discomfort with the proposed model, in comparison to $\mathbf {\mathrm {60~\%}}$ in a human-driven bus, while respecting road and vehicle constraints and accurately docking within an acceptable predefined distance from the curb. We also show through simulations that in comparison to our proposed model, the traditional method of quadratic penalties for comfort modeling produces higher discomfort levels and prevents some trajectories characterized by high acceleration and jerk. Such trajectories can be permitted and comfortable using our approach.},

  abstract     = {Multi-step traffic speed prediction is a challenging issue due to the multiple spatial-temporal dependencies among roads. Some spatial dependencies, especially those formed by different traffic modes, are not fully exploited, and how to simultaneously consider spatial and temporal dependencies and effectively integrate them within a single prediction framework needs further exploration. To tackle the above issues, we propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional framework MVSTG, which adequately exploits the multi-view spatial-temporal dependencies and their interactions to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. Multi-view temporal learning captures the multiple temporal trends by temporal convolution from multi-granularity historical data, and multi-view spatial learning handles the multiple spatial correlations by graph convolution from multiple graphs. In addition, view-wise attention-based fusion is proposed to adaptively identify the importance of each upstream view, fuse the multi-view information, and generate integrated results for downstream views. The experiments on two real-world urban traffic datasets demonstrate that the multi-view data and the proposed model framework enhance performance on the accuracy of speed prediction, especially in mid-term and long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {Transports is one of the sectors that produce the highest emissions of CO2; in the last ten years, there has been a process of decarbonization which has led to a considerable increase in Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the sudden introduction of a large number of Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) supplying electrical energy to EVs could cause problems in the management of the electric grid which must cope with the consequent increase in the electrical load demand. In this context, the 24 hour ahead forecast of the power curve associated with the recharge of EVs becomes of vital importance to ensure the reliability of the electric grid. In this paper, different Machine Learning models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU) and with different architectures, are compared based on their capability to accurately predict the power curve of an EV charging station one day in advance. A Sequence to Sequence model has been implemented and a thorough analysis of an Attention layer has been detailed. The models are tested on a real world open dataset.},

  abstract     = {Real-time transportation surveillance is an essential part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, images captured under low-light conditions often suffer poor visibility with types of degradation, such as noise interference and vague edge features, etc. With the development of imaging devices, the quality of the visual surveillance data is continually increasing, like 2K and 4K, which have more strict requirements on the efficiency of image processing. To satisfy the requirements on both enhancement quality and computational speed, this paper proposes a double domain guided real-time low-light image enhancement network (DDNet) for ultra-high-definition (UHD) transportation surveillance. Specifically, we design an encoder-decoder structure as the main architecture of the learning network. In particular, the enhancement processing is divided into two subtasks (i.e., color enhancement and gradient enhancement) via the proposed coarse enhancement module (CEM) and LoG-based gradient enhancement module (GEM), which are embedded in the encoder-decoder structure. It enables the network to enhance the color and edge features simultaneously. Through the decomposition and reconstruction on both color and gradient domains, our DDNet can restore the detailed feature information concealed by the darkness with better visual quality and efficiency. The evaluation experiments on standard and transportation-related datasets demonstrate that our DDNet provides superior enhancement quality and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the object detection and scene segmentation experiments indicate the practical benefits for higher-level image analysis under low-light environments in ITS.

  abstract     = {This paper studies control strategies of intelligent vehicles at unsignalized intersections. By considering the interaction among multiple vehicles and communication disturbances, the problem is formulated as a robust differential game in which the controlled vehicle computes actions using disturbed information of locally neighboring vehicles. Both cooperative and non-cooperative differential game models are considered. The controlled vehicle optimizes its own cost in the non-cooperative game while coordinates its strategy with other vehicles to optimize a joint cost in the cooperative game. We show that the local optimal strategy of each intelligent vehicle defined by a single optimization problem converges to global robust Nash equilibrium in the non-cooperative game, and converges to the global robust Pareto-Nash equilibrium in the cooperative game. The effectiveness of the robust differential game method is verified by simulations under two scenarios. Results show that under the proposed differential game approach, vehicles pass through unsignalized intersections more quickly than methods using traditional discrete game approaches. In addition, vehicles can avoid colliding with each other and obstacles at the presence of communication disturbances.},

Reinforcement Learning has been implemented in the literature for such electric racing strategy development but only accounts for one single car. In this paper, we proposed a new architecture iRaXL to implement reinforcement learning for such complex strategy development featuring hybrid action space, multi-car interactions, and non-zero-sum gaming. The iRaXL proves to be able to develop different strategies for individual competitors and also team-based objectives. In a bigger scope, this framework can be used to solve more generic problems with hybrid features such as zero/non-zero-sum games, discretized/continuous action space, and competition/collaboration interactions.},

Unlike the conventional hierarchical collision avoidance methods, our approach employs an integral heuristic barrier function that addresses obstacle avoidance planning and reference trajectory tracking problems simultaneously. Via this, the complex safe trajectory following problem is simplified into a tractable yaw angle tracking problem. We then present a novel finite-time adaptive barrier function-based sliding mode controller that handles input saturation and enhances robustness. This ensures precise and robust yaw angle tracking within specified performance constraints. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves accelerated finite-time convergence compared to the exponential convergence rate. Finally, the Carsim-Simulink co-simulations and real-vehicle experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in addressing the path-tracking challenge, while upholding driving safety.},

  abstract     = {High-precision GNSS positioning plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, and leveraging artificial intelligence can enable the development of reliable context-aware models that enhance context-adaptive GNSS algorithms. However, the complexity of contexts and the variability of features limit the performance of GNSS-based context-aware models. Therefore, this study aims to construct a context-aware model in kinematic vehicle-mounted environments. Firstly, due to the lack of publicly available datasets, a kinematic vehicle-mounted dataset comprising over 40,000 data samples is constructed. This dataset includes five contexts including open area, urban canyon, boulevard, under viaduct, and tunnel. Meanwhile, efficient feature selection methods are applied, namely SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and SFFS (Sequential Forward Floating Selection), to obtain effective data features. Secondly, considering the temporal correlation of GNSS signals, eight alternative models (SVM, MLP, CNN-b, CNN-r, CNN-i, ML-LSTM, ML-RNN, ML-GRU) are designed and trained. Context probability is introduced to indicate context transition area. Comparative studies show that the ML-LSTM model exhibits the best performance, with an an accuracy of 92.72% and a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.94% in context-separated areas, and with an accuracy of 87.49% and a mAP of 89.21% in context-continuous areas. Furthermore, to address the performance degradation when deploying the model on different receiver types, this study explores model-based transfer learning. Four transfer approaches, namely direct transfer, fully connected layer transfer, partial layer transfer, and all layer transfer, are applied. The all layer transfer approach demonstrates the best performance, exhibiting a 18.34% improvement compared to the non-transfer approach.},

Unfortunately, when multiple autonomous vehicles are deployed while exposed to communication failure, there might be a conflict of ideal conditions between various autonomous vehicles leading to adversarial situation on the roads. In South Korea, virtual and real-world urban autonomous multi-vehicle races were held in March and November of 2021, respectively. During the competition, multiple vehicles were involved simultaneously, which required maneuvers such as overtaking low-speed vehicles, negotiating intersections, and obeying traffic laws. In this study, we introduce a fully autonomous driving software stack to deploy a competitive driving model, which enabled us to win the urban autonomous multi-vehicle races. We evaluate module-based systems such as navigation, perception, and planning in real and virtual environments. Additionally, an analysis of traffic is performed after collecting multiple vehicle position data over communication to gain additional insight into a multi-agent autonomous driving scenario. Finally, we propose a method for analyzing traffic in order to compare the spatial distribution of multiple autonomous vehicles. We study the similarity distribution between each team’s driving log data to determine the impact of competitive autonomous driving on the traffic environment. Our fully autonomous software architecture, proven successful in winning urban autonomous multi-vehicle races in South Korea, is ready for deployment on urban robot taxis. Our traffic analysis addresses multi-agent scenarios and resolves competitive conflicts among robot taxi companies, crucial for smart city integration and optimizing autonomous vehicle performance in complex urban settings.},

  abstract     = {Video-based multiple object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in intelligent transportation with applications ranging from automated traffic surveillance to autonomous driving. MOT methods commonly follow a tracking-by-detection paradigm, tracking objects by associating their detections across video frames. However, insofar, these methods have not used the entire vehicle trajectory motion characteristics to perform tracking, which converts the vehicle localization problem into a motion parameter estimation problem. Moreover, MOT methods mainly rely on off-the-shelf detectors. An independently trained detector is sub-optimal for the tracking-by-detection paradigm and adversely affects the overall system performance. In this article, we address these issues by proposing a novel MOT method for moving vehicles in traffic scenarios. Our tracker treats the vehicle tracks as unified 3D spatio-temporal trajectory instances and leverages the power of deep learning to extract vehicle motion from the 3D instances. We propose a new simultaneous detection and tracking network, called YOLO-3D Motion Model Network (Yolo-3DMM) that employs spatio-temporal features of traffic videos for simultaneous vehicle detection and tracking in an end-to-end manner. We adopt a variety of different vehicle tracking datasets to evaluate our method. Moreover, we also propose a tunnel MOT dataset from real highway tunnel surveillance in Guangdong, China to expand the experimental scenarios. To establish the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on 100 different roadside traffic scenarios. Our method shows excellent performance on UA-DETRAC and Omni-MOT datasets. It achieves a PR-MOTA score of 29.40% on UA-DETRAC and gets a 69.7% MOTA score on the Omni-MOT dataset.},

Despite excellent improvements in unsupervised domain adaptive object detection achieved by adversarial training, those approaches fail to capture the transfer core underlying the holistic scenes. To solve this problem, we propose a progressive critical region transfer framework for cross-domain visual object detection. Specifically, we exploit a potential foreground mining (PFM) module and a semantic-specific RoI aggregation (SRA) module to improve the robustness of the cross-domain detection framework. Upon the critical regions in the broad sense, the PFM module first highlights the foreground regions by reweighting the hierarchical feature maps in sequence, and then modifies location biases at the downstream position of the backbone network for more accurate upstream predictions. Deep into the critical regions in the narrow sense, the SRA module concentrates on establishing an appropriate matching between batch-wise RoIs and all semantic centers, and further strengthens the aggregation of cross-domain identical semantic with the complement of context references. Together these modules are obligated to transform the adaptation importance from the whole scope to the latent foreground areas, and afterward to the informative regions of interest along the detection pipeline. Experiments show that our progressive critical region transfer framework achieves a state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather, camera configuration, and complicated scene adaptation, which outperforms the baselines by 19.4%, 5.0%, and 6.1%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {A reliable driving trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is an essential reference for decision-making and safe driving of an autonomous vehicle. Although predicting short-term trajectories can be well achieved, it is still very challenging for long-term prediction of trajectories since the prediction space grows exponentially. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for trajectory prediction from factored intention estimation (I2T), which decouples the trajectory prediction space into a high-level space for intention estimation and a low-level space for motion prediction. The long-term dependencies between intention cues and future motions during driving are naturally extended to the internal sharing mechanism of I2T, leading to improved performance. Furthermore, we design a Prioriformer model to serve as the backbone network for I2T so that it can accurately capture the long-term dependency couplings related to the task of intention estimation or motion prediction. Prioriformer model adopts a personalized normalization method, which facilitates learning latent representations of long-term features and avoids getting stuck on local optimum. A designed multi-scale fusion encoder extracts features from various receptive fields and then learns richer information from the representation subspaces. An efficient non-autoregressive decoder reduces the pressure in long-term prediction of trajectories while avoiding cumulative errors. Experiments on three real-world motion datasets show that I2T can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {To achieve more accurate perception performance, LiDAR and camera are gradually chosen to improve 3D object detection simultaneously. However, it is still a non-trivial task to build an effective fusion mechanism, and this is hindering the development of multi-modal based method. Especially, the mapping relationship construction between two modalities is far from fully explored. Canonical cross-modal mapping suffers from failure when the calibration matrix is incorrect, and it also greatly wastes the amount and density of RGB image information. This paper aims to extend the traditional one-to-one alignment relationship between LiDAR and camera. For all projected point clouds, we enhance their cross-modal mapping relationship through aggregating color-texture related feature and shape-contour related feature. Further, a mapping pyramid is proposed to leverage the semantic representation of the image feature at different stages. Based on the above mapping enhancement strategies, our method increases the engagement rate of image. Finally, we design a fusion module based on an attention mechanism to improve the point cloud feature with the auxiliary image feature. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset and SUN-RGBD dataset show that our model achieves satisfactory 3D object detection, especially for categories with sparse point clouds compared with other multi-modal fusion networks.},

  abstract     = {Today, there is an ongoing transition to more sustainable transportation, for which an essential part is the switch from combustion engine vehicles to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). BEVs have many advantages from a sustainability perspective, but issues such as limited driving range and long recharge times slow down the transition from combustion engines. One way to mitigate these issues is by performing battery thermal preconditioning, which increases the energy efficiency of the battery. However, to optimally perform battery thermal preconditioning, the vehicle usage pattern needs to be known, i.e., how and when the vehicle will be used. This study attempts to predict the departure time and distance of the first drive each day using online machine learning models. The online machine learning models are trained and evaluated on historical driving data collected from a fleet of BEVs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prediction models are extended to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, which can be used to decide whether the prediction should be used or dismissed. Based on our results, the best-performing prediction models yield an aggregated mean absolute error of 2.75 hours when predicting departure time and 13.37 km when predicting trip distance.},

To solve this problem, a learning-based data-driven technique is proposed to identify and reconstruct the unknown system matrices. Then, based on the identified system matrices, an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to derive both the optimal control policies and the policy iteration solution for graphical games, as well as its corresponding convergence is analyzed. Besides, an online learning algorithm only relying on the online information of states and inputs in an online way is developed to solve the optimal path tracking control problem. As a result, the requirement of relying on the vehicle’s dynamics in the traditional tracking control protocols is completely relaxed by our proposed method. The optimal distributed control policies found by the proposed RL algorithm satisfies the global Nash equilibrium and synchronizes all tracked vehicles to the pinning vehicle.

  abstract     = {Single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) are charged to use the high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lanes, while high-occupancy-vehicles (HOVs) can drive in them at no cost. The pricing scheme for HOT lanes has been extensively studied at local bottlenecks or at the network level through computationally expensive simulations. However, the HOT lane pricing study on a freeway corridor with multiple origins and destinations as well as multiple interacting bottlenecks is a challenging problem for which no analytical results are available. In this paper, we attempt to fill the gap by proposing to study the traffic dynamics in the corridor based on the relative space paradigm. In this new paradigm, the interaction of multiple bottlenecks and trips can be captured with Vickrey’s bathtub model by a simple ordinary differential equation. We consider three types of lane choice behavior and analyze their properties. Then, we propose a distance-based dynamic pricing scheme based on a linear combination of I-controllers. This closed-loop controller is independent of the model and feeds back the travel time difference between HOT lanes and general-purpose lanes. Given the mathematical tractability of the system model, we analytically study the performance of the proposed closed-loop control under constant demand and show the existence and stability of the optimal equilibrium. Finally, we verify the results with numerical simulations considering a typical peak period demand pattern. In the future, we are interested in extending this work and testing the performance of the proposed linear combination of I-controllers for other traffic flow models.},

This study presents a hierarchical control strategy for commuter plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), incorporating historical driving data and real-time traffic conditions. Firstly, in the upper layer, an iterative learning algorithm is introduced to analyze the historical driving patterns, enabling derivation of a battery state-of-charge (SOC) reference on the commuter route through solving a global energy optimization problem, that is subsequently provided to the lower layer controller. In the lower layer, real-time influence from preceding vehicles is considered by designing a short-term speed prediction algorithm based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. Then, two MPC controllers are designed: one for speed scheduling and another for power distribution.

  abstract     = {Lane detection is one of the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving perception, but it still faces many challenges in some special driving scenarios. For example, in dazzling light, crowded roads, etc., lane detection is very dependent on surrounding visual cues. Previous segmentation-based lane detection methods have not paid enough attention to the surrounding visual range, resulting in poor performance. In this paper, we design a novel lane detection network namely HW-Transformer, which is based on row and column multi-head self-attention. It restricts the attention only to their respective rows and columns, and transfers information across rows and columns by intersection features. In this way, the attention to the visual range around the lane is greatly expanded, and the communication of global information can be achieved through intersecting features. In addition, we further propose a self-attention knowledge distillation (SAKD) method for the Transformer model, where higher-level attention guides lower-level attention to learn. SAKD not only helps to improve the performance of lane detection, but also has universality in better learning semantic features from general images. Extensive experiments on BDD100K, TuSimple, CULane, and VIL100 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation-based lane detection methods. We also apply the proposed SAKD to DeiT-tiny, and it achieves 1.51 Top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K dataset. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Cuibaby/HWLane .},

We apply the Bayesian calibration technique to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and develop a novel stochastic car-following model named memory-augmented IDM (MA-IDM). To evaluate the effectiveness of MA-IDM, we compare the proposed MA-IDM with Bayesian IDM in which errors are assumed to be i.i.d., and our simulation results based on the HighD dataset show that MA-IDM can generate more realistic driving behaviors and provide better uncertainty quantification than Bayesian IDM. By analyzing the lengthscale parameter of the Gaussian process, we also show that taking the driving actions from the past five seconds into account can be helpful in modeling and simulating the human driver’s car-following behaviors.},

This paper tackles the anomaly detection problem by introducing a novel framework in multi-sensor CAVs, which applies an efficient data preprocessing and deep learning method. In this paper, two preprocessing methods have been used and compared in the deep learning based models. The main contributions of this paper compared to previous works include two fundamental tasks. First, the quality of time series data is improved in the preprocessing phase by Differencing (DIFF) or Moving Standard Deviation (MSD). Second, the applied deep learning method is based on an autoencoder where a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized as the autoencoder architecture, which is referred to as D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder in this paper. The D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder method optimizes the anomaly detection rate for all of the anomalies, specifically in the case of low magnitude anomalies, enhancing F1-score up to 18.12% in single types of anomalies and 32.83% in mixed types of anomalies. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method for time series anomaly detection over the state-of-the-art and benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Sensors, such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and LiDAR, are widely deployed in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems. The demand for calibration of initial installation, damage replacements, and unstable installation has risen dramatically. Traditional methods require on-site operation and road closure; thus, repeated calibration can severely affect traffic conditions and expose operational personnel to potential safety threats. As more and more autonomous vehicles (AVs) flood the roads, this paper proposes an automatic calibration framework of roadside sensors by leveraging the high-precision positioning and perception data of AVs. First, we design a graph-based target-matching algorithm using an AV’s surrounding traffic perception data to identify the AV of interest from a dataset of multiple target trajectories recorded by roadside sensors. A line search algorithm is then designed to adjust the clock delay between sensors and establish the temporal correspondence, where a Gaussian process is applied to estimate the vehicle state in continuous time. Finally, we develop a least squares optimization model to complete the final calibration with the AV positioning data. The influence of measurement noise and missed detections on the proposed calibration framework are analyzed in simulated scenarios based on a Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset, and the practicability is validated based on real-world data collected at Donghai Bridge, Hangzhou Bay Bridge, and DAIR-V2X dataset. It is shown that the proposed target matching algorithm can identify an AV trajectory from roadside sensor data with 20%-90% higher accuracy than baseline models, and the framework can accurately estimate the spatial and temporal parameters even with poor data quality. The mean least squares error of the trajectory alignment reaches centimeter-level accuracy.},

In each decision-making step, the CVN monitors the state of the vehicles and selects one of the vehicles. Subsequently, the attention-based route generating network (RGN) determines the next node to be visited by the chosen vehicle. Instead of using a penalty term in the reward function to regulate the sequence of visits to pickup and delivery nodes, a more precise control method, namely the rolling mask scheme (RMS), is implemented. The method’s evaluation is carried out via a simulation experiment using a real-world road network. This evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method effectively tackles the DMV-PDPC challenge, outperforming current state-of-the-art learning-based models and heuristic methods. Moreover, the method shows exceptional generalization capabilities, as evidenced by its adaptability to different numbers of tasks and vehicles.},

  abstract     = {3D object perception in maritime is a promising means to enhance the ability of the autonomous navigation. However, 3D automatic reconstruction of dynamic targets remains a challenging task in the 3D object perception systems. In this paper, we present an innovative GAN-based deep learning neural network for 3D ship reconstruction. The method is able to reconstruct 3D ship models from single view images or videos using shape prior knowledge and a vessel generative adversarial network (Vessel-GAN), which can effectively extract the ship shape features from the single-view images or videos. Furthermore, a 3D feature network optimization model is proposed for loop optimization of 3D ship shape perception. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a high resolution single ship dataset (HSSD) was created, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated against the existing methods, The experimental results show that the Vessel Segment Network (VSNet) can improve the accuracy of the HSSD dataset by 2.5% in the single ship segmentation tasks. In addition, Vessel-GAN was demonstrated to be able to generate multi-view ship images with an impressive FID value of 5.82. Moreover, our model can improve the accuracy of 3D ship modeling by 8.9% on the ShapeNet dataset. This innovative approach promises to enable 3D perception of the marine environment for autonomous ship.},

  abstract     = {Interacting with human road users is one of the most challenging tasks for autonomous vehicles. For congruent driving behaviors, it is essential to recognize and comprehend sociality, encompassing both implicit social norms and individualized social preferences of human drivers. To understand and quantify the complex sociality in driving interactions, we propose a Virtual-Game-based Interaction Model (VGIM) that is parameterized by a social preference measurement, Interaction Preference Value (IPV). The IPV is designed to capture the driver’s relative inclination towards individual rewards over group rewards. A method for identifying IPV from observed driving trajectory is also developed, with which we assessed human drivers’ IPV using driving data recorded in a typical interactive driving scenario, the unprotected left turn. Our findings reveal that (1) human drivers exhibit particular social preference patterns while undertaking specific tasks, such as turning left or proceeding straight; (2) competitive actions could be strategically conducted by human drivers in order to coordinate with others. Finally, we discuss the potential of learning sociality-aware navigation from human demonstrations by incorporating a rule-based humanlike IPV expressing strategy into VGIM and optimization-based motion planners. Simulation experiments demonstrate that (1) IPV identification improves the motion prediction performance in interactive driving scenarios and (2) the dynamic IPV expressing strategy extracted from human driving data makes it possible to reproduce humanlike coordination patterns in the driving interaction.},

  abstract     = {With the surge of vehicles and transportation, sensing obstacles and warning drivers to avoid accidents have become a great concern in recent years. In the current roadworthy electromagnetic environment, the number of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (MMW) automotive radars has exploded due to their unique advantages in environmental sensing. However, the frequency band of the automotive radars is limited from 77 to 81 GHz, hence the burgeoning of radars on the road is bound to cause mutual interference and jeopardize further target detection and parameter estimation. In this paper, two basic schemes are considered to mitigate mutual interference of automotive radars. First, we consider the sparse characteristics of the mutual interference in the two-dimensional (2-D) time domain and employ a sparse interference extraction (SIE) method to tackle the mutual interference. Next, we further consider the low-rank property of the useful echoes across multiple channels and propose a novel three-dimensional (3-D) tensor decomposition (TD) method to decompose the received signals into mutual interference and useful echoes. Several numerical simulations are fulfilled to test the robustness of the proposed TD method, especially for multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems under complex electromagnetic circumstances. Furthermore, more experiments are implemented to demonstrate its feasibility in practical applications in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art methods.},

We formulate this problem as an optimal control problem (OCP) according to the requirements of the task and propose a planner to solve it numerically. To ensure optimal planning results, the proposed planner consists of three procedures, which are responsible for generating the guiding route, constructing the collision-free tunnel, and optimizing the trajectory, respectively. Firstly, we use the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) to build an equidistant roadmap and propose an improved adaptive A* algorithm (IAA*) to improve the time efficiency of the guiding route generation process. Secondly, we employ a coarse trajectory to guide a homotopic route and replace the intractably scaled collision-avoidance constraints with within-tunnel constraints, which are small-scale and independent of the environment’s complexity. Our tunnel construction method ensures the integrity of the free spaces, so that repeated construction is not necessary. Finally, in the process of trajectory optimization, we propose a lightweight OCP iterative solution framework to search for the optimal solution with high computational efficiency, in which the customized OCP with only box constraints is quickly solved in each iteration. Besides, the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments had been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion is a pressing issue worldwide, and machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly being used in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to address this problem. Deep hybrid models, in particular, have emerged as an efficient solution for traffic flow prediction. Among these models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) have been widely used to capture the temporal and periodic features of traffic data. The advancements in RNNs provide an opportunity to enhance the performance of existing models. Therefore, this work proposes a BiGRU-BiGRU model with two modules to extract temporal and periodic features from traffic data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proven to perform well using attention mechanism. However, there is a need for attention mechanism that strictly focuses on traffic dynamics and nearby data from the prediction points. Thus, a novel confined attention mechanism is proposed and incorporated into the first module to improve the model’s performance by focusing only on the recent relevant information in the traffic flow sequence. Furthermore, the external features are integrated to improve the model’s prediction performance. The proposed model is evaluated on the publicly available real-world dataset and compared with several baseline state-of-the-art methods. As an outcome, the model offers a reduction in the average value of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for all the prediction horizons, that is ranged from 5.1% – 20.4%, 7.3% – 27.3%, and 6.1% – 56.6%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The drone delivery problem (DDP) has been introduced to include aerial vehicles in last-mile delivery operations to increase efficiency. However, the existing studies have not incorporated the communication quality requirements of such a delivery operation. This study introduces the communication-aware DDP (C-DDP), which incorporates handover and outage constraints into the conventional multi-depot multi-trip green vehicle routing problem with time windows. In particular, any trip of a drone to deliver a customer package must require less than a certain number of handover operations and cannot exceed a predefined outage duration threshold. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed to minimize the total flight distance while satisfying communication constraints. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) that can solve large instances and compare its performance with an off-the-shelf MIP solver. Computational study shows that the GA and MIP solver performances are equivalent to solving smaller instances. We also compare the GA performance against another evolutionary algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), for larger instances and find that the GA outperforms the PSO with slightly longer CPU times. The results indicate that ignoring the communication constraints would cause significant operational disruption risk and this risk can be easily mitigated with a slight sacrifice from flight distances by incorporating the proposed communication constraints. In particular, the communication performance can be improved by up to 28.9% when the flight distance is increased by 19.1% at most on average.},

Recent deep neural networks have made significant progress in 3D visual tasks by using point cloud data. However, the acquisition of geometric features and the expression of local fine-grained features in point clouds are still not sufficient for the classification and segmentation tasks. Inspired by the application of transformer structures in 2D and 3D computer vision tasks, in this paper, a multi-scale neighborhood aggregation transformer network (MNAT-Net) is proposed for point cloud classification and segmentation, which captures the global semantic information and local geometric structure features of point clouds by aggregating the receptive field and node weights. MNAT-Net consists of three key components, namely the multi-scale neighborhood feature aggregation module, the global transformer module and the category-weighted focal loss. The neighborhood features learned by the MNAT-Net network is sent to the global transformer module to fully enrich the contextual representation. Experimental results show that MNAT-Net achieves competitive performance on publicly available ModelNet40, ShapeNet, S3DIS and SemanticKITTI data sets in comparison to related methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep-learning-based data-driven forecasting methods have achieved impressive results for traffic forecasting. Specifically, spatiotemporal graph neural networks have emerged as a promising class of approaches because of their ability to model both spatial and temporal patterns in traffic data. A major limitation of these methods, however, is that they provide forecasts without estimates of data and model uncertainty, which are critical for understanding inherent variations of the data and forecast limitations due to a lack of training data. We develop a scalable deep ensemble approach to quantify data and model uncertainties for spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Our approach consists of four stages: 1) using a Gaussian-assumption-free simultaneous quantile regression loss for training a spatiotemporal graph neural network to model the traffic distribution; 2) applying a scalable Bayesian optimization method to tune the hyperparameters of the spatiotemporal graph neural network; 3) fitting a Gaussian copula generative model to capture the joint distributions of the high-performing hyperparameter configurations, and training an ensemble of models by sampling a new set of hyperparameter configurations from the generative model; and 4) decomposing the data and model uncertainties from the spatiotemporal graph neural network ensembles. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network, a state-of-the-art method for short-term traffic forecasting. We demonstrate the efficacy of our ensemble-based uncertainty quantification method by comparing it with other uncertainty estimation techniques. We show that our generic and scalable approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art Bayesian and a number of other commonly used frequentist uncertainty estimation techniques.

The key idea is a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based model, which can cope with the continuous state and action spaces of the monitor and learn the optimal acceleration control policy adapting to the solar power availability and the target’s movement. The state space is designed to be the relative position of the monitor to the target, thereby preventing model infeasibility. Experiments show that the new algorithm can maintain a desired distance from the target, and outperform control- and optimization-based alternatives in terms of energy efficiency and tracking accuracy. An interesting finding is that our algorithm learns faster and better with a constraint of a minimum allowed battery energy reserve. The reason is that, without the constraint, the monitor is more likely to deplete its battery before the end of a surveillance mission.},

This paper proposes a vehicle matching algorithm designed to maximize the travel time probability using ALPR data, while accounting for recognition errors and unrecognized issues. The proposed algorithm consists of several modules, including the estimation of travel time distribution, computation of travel time probability, calculation of travel time confidence intervals and matching time window size, restricted fuzzy matching, and vehicle matching optimization. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm across varying lighting and weather conditions, ALPR data was collected from a survey road in four scenarios: sunny day, sunny night, rainy day, and rainy night. The results indicate that when compared to a sunny day scenario, severe lighting and adverse weather conditions lead to decreased matching accuracy and increased matching accuracy errors for all methods evaluated.

Three alternative implementations of parking guidance involving allocating commercial vehicles to dedicated loading/unloading bays are investigated alongside a vehicle-specific geofence strategy. Methodologically, an agent-based model framework is employed to reproduce the interactions among (parking and cruising) carriers, the surrounding traffic, and a traffic controller. An efficient metaheuristic is integrated with simulation to address the corresponding optimization. The effectiveness of the strategies in reducing traffic congestion and other externalities varies depending on the level and configuration of freight demand. Among the parking guidance strategies, those weighing more on carriers’ convenience mitigate potential risks of equity and acceptability issues but at the cost of an efficiency loss. Geofencing is less problematic due to the minor operational modifications, offering comparable traffic performance improvement for low and medium demand levels.},

The proposed approach combines the zonotope-based Set-Membership Approach (SMA) and Set Invariance Approach (SIA). Firstly, an online fault detection strategy based on zonotopic set-membership state estimation is introduced, where the optimal observer gain is calculated offline by solving LMI optimization problems. To characterize the Minimum Detectable Fault (MDF) and Minimum Isolable Fault (MIF), the invariant residual sets are first obtained for the system operated in healthy and faulty modes. The proposed method relies on the propagation of the zonotopic state estimation error in steady state based on SIA. Then, MDF and MIF are characterized for several types of faults by solving optimization problems subject to set separation conditions. Finally, experiment validations using a prototype vehicle are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In the presence of emergencies, autonomous unmanned air vehicles should be able to land at a minimum distance or minimum time. Impaired unmanned air vehicles define actuator failures and this impairment changes their unstable and uncertain dynamics; henceforth, path planning algorithms must be adaptive and model-free. In addition, path planning optimization problems must consider the unavoidable actuator saturations, kinematic and dynamic constraints for successful real-time applications. Therefore, this paper develops 3D path planning algorithms for quadrotors with parametric uncertainties and various constraints. In this respect, this paper constructs a multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization and a multi-dimensional genetic algorithm to plan paths for translational, rotational, and Euler angles and generates the corresponding control signals. The algorithms are assessed and compared both in the simulation and experimental environments. Results show that the multi-dimensional genetic algorithm produces shorter minimum distance and minimum time paths under the constraints. The real-time experiments prove that the quadrotor exactly follows the produced path utilizing the available maximum rotor speeds.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging research field, vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) can realize identity search between the vehicles, which plays an important role in the over-the-horizon perception of Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving (VICAD). At present, due to the lack of data sets, the relevant research on Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative (VIC) Re-ID can only be evaluated in the cross-view monitoring test set which leads to the lack of persuasion of the research. Therefore, based on the DAID-V2X dataset of Tsinghua University, this paper constructs a VIC Re-ID dataset “DAIR-V2XReid” from real vehicle scenarios through vehicle-road end target tag association, thereby making it better applicable to the research of VIC Re-ID. Owing to different task scenarios, existing algorithms trained on monitoring test sets are unable to effectively complete the Re-ID task in this new dataset. Therefore, Cross-shot Feature Aggregation Network (CFA-Net) is also proposed in this paper, to tackle the case where a vehicle becomes unrecognizable due to a large change in its visual appearance across different cameras. Firstly, we put forward a camera embedding module and add it to the Backbone, to group different cameras and solve the problem of cross-shot perspective mutation. Secondly, in order to address the situation where background and vehicle division are not distinguishable, we propose a cross-stage feature fusion module, which integrates low-order semantics with high-order semantics. Finally, we use multi-directional attention network to achieve the final feature extraction. The experimental results show that our proposed CFA-Net method achieves new state-of-the-art in DAIR-V2XReid, with mAP of 58.47%.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an improved Intelligent Driving Model (Sigmoid-IDM) to address the issues of excessive acceleration in traffic oscillation and following failure in free flow. The Sigmoid-IDM utilizes a Sigmoid function to enhance the starting-following characteristics, improve the output strategy of the spacing term, and stabilize the steady-state velocity in free flow. Furthermore, the model’s asymmetry is enhanced by introducing cautious following distance, caution driving factor, and segmentation function. The anti-interference ability of the Sigmoid-IDM is demonstrated through local stability and string stability analyses. The model parameters were calibrated using the Hefei dataset and High D data across various traffic scenarios: start-up, stop-go, and free-flow. The Sigmoid-IDM outperforms the IDM by significantly reducing errors and enhancing performance metrics. Specifically, in start-up and stop-go scenarios, the Sigmoid-IDM achieves a 28.57% and 19.04% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for acceleration, respectively. Comfort error during start-up is also lowered by 18.1%. In the free-flow scenario, the RMSE for spacing and velocity decreases by 15.64% and 16.36%, respectively. Furthermore, the Sigmoid-IDM demonstrates a more pronounced asymmetric behavior than the IDM, offering a more accurate representation of human drivers’ following patterns. The model’s efficacy was further validated through circular road simulation and Simulink-Carsim co-simulation, confirming its ability to accurately simulate the transition from synchronized flow to wide moving jams under variable parameters, as well as the traceability of its trajectory planning.},

  abstract     = {Employing onboard sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communication, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) allows vehicles in a platoon to follow their predecessors with accuracy, resulting in enhanced traffic flow, safety, and comfort. On the other hand, CACC is sensitive to wireless communication failure. In addressing the latter issue, this paper proposes a degraded CACC (d-CACC) that, in contrast with the CACC, does not require wireless communication, as so, it is not affected by communication failures. The proposed d-CACC is obtained by replacing the preceding vehicle acceleration in the CACC with an estimate obtained using backward derivative approximation. Resulting in a d-CACC since the host vehicles operate with degraded information compared to a traditional CACC system. The main advantages of the proposed d-CACC are the easy implementation, it does not require an extra algorithm for estimating the preceding vehicle acceleration; the error due to the acceleration estimative formula is taken into account in the control design mitigating unpredictable errors. Internal and string stability conditions are derived by frequency domain analysis methods. Then, in light of such stability conditions, an algorithm for the proposed d-CACC design is presented. The paper is concluded by showing simulated experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed d-CACC, considering also real-world implementation issues.},

DSSs have been built to assist with a wide range of applications; however, in this paper, we are primarily concerned with risk assessment, which helps decision-makers to evaluate the risk of events. In recent years, advancements in big data processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have provided new opportunities for businesses to use these technologies for risk assessment. Yet, using these techniques with massive unlabeled data in an uncertain situation is challenging. This paper presents an autonomous fuzzy decision support system (AFDSS) for risk assessment that uses advanced artificial intelligence, unsupervised learning, and fuzzy logic. The model learns from big data characterized by uncertainty and a lack of labels for maximum utility. In an innovative approach, fuzzy clustering first extracts events from big data. Then, the risks associated with those events are assessed via a fuzzy inference system. New events are subsequently predicted based on their similarity to previously evaluated events. Evaluations of AFDSS with a real-world insurance dataset containing 500,000 journeys by 2500 drivers show that the proposed model can consistently assess risk in the big data environment. These results were drawn from a sensitivity analysis where all input parameters were changed using optimistic, pessimistic, and neural strategies. Performance was good across all three categories.},

This paper aims to provide a reliable alternative solution for localization and path planning-related challenges in environments where GPS is unavailable or unreliable, such as rural areas with dense forest cover, where tree canopies may obstruct GPS signals, and urban landscapes characterized by tall buildings that can similarly disrupt navigation accuracy. The proposed method consists of a robust lane detection algorithm to generate a reference path of the vehicle and a model predictive controller (MPC) for tracking the reference path. The lane detector extracts lane markings from image frames to determine ego-lane boundaries from which the lane center is calculated in the vehicle’s coordinate frame. The MPC uses a kinematic vehicle model to generate the lateral and longitudinal control values necessary for smoothly tracking the reference path. The proposed technique has been implemented and tested on a Lincoln MKZ hybrid vehicle equipped with a computing platform having Intel’s quad-core Xeon processors. The developed framework was experimentally validated by deployment in a rural test track. Experimental results show that the proposed vision-based lane detection method performs well under various challenging road conditions such as shadows, road texture variations, interference from other road signs, and missing lane boundaries. The multi-threaded implementation of lane detection and the MPC allowed us to run the integrated system at the speed of 25 HZ. The integration of lane detection and MPC resulted in smoothly keeping the car in the center of the lane over a curved test track while respecting the physical constraints of the car.},

In this paper, we use the risk pulse energy to measure the threat ability of each traffic element, establish the corresponding driving risk pulse field based on the risk analysis of each traffic element, measure the overall risk performance and overall level of the road traffic environment from the perspectives of vector superposition and quantity superposition, and establish a unified driving risk pulse field model. The characteristics of the established driving risk pulse field model are simulated and described, including basic risk pulse energy, random risk pulse energy and relevant parameters. Taking GM model as an example, a car following model based on driving risk pulse field is established by combining driving risk pulse field with GM model. Finally, the simulation analysis of car following model considering driving risk pulse field is carried out by taking a typical car following scene as an example. The results show that the car following model considering the impact of driving risk pulse field has the following advantages: (i) It can take into consideration the impact of the front and rear vehicle motion state changes on the current vehicle driving. (ii) The headway can be adjusted according to the change of the risk pulse energy of the front and rear vehicles. (iii) It is able to select appropriate driving strategies according to the risk pulse energy level of the front and rear vehicles. The whole process aims to minimize the risk threat to the vehicles.

This paper is the first one that implements an abstract MAC layer using a distributed deep reinforcement learning scheme, which can directly meet the reliable communication requirements of cooperative learning in previous works. Our abstract MAC layer performs two operations: acknowledgement, which makes sure that all vehicles can successfully broadcast their messages to all of their neighbors, and progress, which ensures that each vehicle can receive at least one message from its neighbors. These operations facilitate vehicles to exchange and update their training models in a cooperative learning service.

  abstract     = {The wheel wear status of high-speed trains (HSTs) is an essential indicator of their safety and reliability. However, due to the time-varying operating state of HSTs, noisy and complex non-stationary signals are collected. This makes it difficult for data-driven algorithms to learn valuable discriminative features from data. Therefore, this inspired us to introduce signal analysis methods with clear physical meaning to improve the interpretability and performance of prediction models. This paper proposes a novel multi-layer wavelet integrated convolutional neural network (MWI-Net) for predicting HST wheel-wear. Specifically, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) extends the feature learning space of CNN from the time domain to the wavelet domain, thereby capturing the frequency features that are difficult to learn in the time domain. As a remarkable information space, the DWT can effectively alleviate the frequency aliasing problem, enabling MWI-Net to distinguish valuable frequency information from complex signals. In particular, the proposed dynamic frequency aggregation mechanism endows MWI-Net with excellent frequency analysis and feature selection capabilities. Experiments on the real operation dataset of CRH1A HSTs show that MWI-Net accurately predicts the wheel wear curves, which is more competitive than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feature learning mechanism inside MWI-Net through visual analysis and illustrate how it optimizes and extracts valuable features layer by layer.},

Herein, we address the problem of automatically estimating the flow rate (number of vehicles/unit of time) from surveillance cameras at low computation cost. To do so, we rely on end-to-end deep architectures applied to compressed MPEG4 part-2 video streams issued from road surveillance cameras. By leveraging the approximate flow representation induced by the compression, we heavily reduce the computation and memory requirements. We propose three end-to-end deep architectures using this coarse pixel flow representation as input. We also release two datasets, one based on synthetic videos and one collected on industrial tunnel cameras. By training the deep models on the newly introduced datasets, we evidence the effectiveness of predicting the flow rate directly from MPEG4 part-2 compressed video streams. We demonstrate an improved accuracy in comparison with a more classical RGB-based architecture and show an impressive speed up of $\times 2065$ at prediction time.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high degree of controllability of the flexible smart traction power supply system (FSTPSS), day-ahead energy management strategy (DAEMS) was developed to optimize the power flow of the FSTPSS. However, the use of DAEMS is not based on real-time information. For FSTPSS, without real-time information, it cannot solve the problem of planning deviation caused by the real-time fluctuation of uncertain loads or sources. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time energy management strategy (REMS) which is based on the real-time information to address the problem of planning deviation. REMS is implemented by LSTM and deep Q learning algorithm, where LSTM predicts uncertain loads or sources, and the deep Q-learning controls the operation of FSTPSS based on real-time predicted state. The proposed strategy is validated with the power flow simulation model of TPSS and the real measured data. The simulation results verify the necessity and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is crucial for autonomous driving. However, most existing methods focus on the foreground objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians, while ignoring some important background objects for traffic scene understanding, especially road intersections. Moreover, existing datasets (e.g., KITTI, Waymo) do not provide the labels for intersections, and the evaluation metric is also unsuitable for intersection detection. To address the above issues, we first present a LiDAR-based intersection dataset on the basis of KITTI dataset, called KITTI-Intersection Dataset. The new dataset includes 4718 frames with 5178 instances belonging to Forkroad and Crossroad, respectively. To weaken the impact of uncertain intersection size on the performance evaluation, we introduce CEIOU instead of IOU as a new evaluation metric. Then, we propose MInsectDet and MMInsectDet, two LiDAR-based detection methods, to solve the intersection detection problem. We start with a lightweight BEV backbone to alleviate the influence of numerous dynamic foreground objects at the intersection and obtain discriminative features. After that, to obtain more abundant and complete intersection features, we propose a Multi-Representation Backbone that integrates the BEV and voxel features to achieve better detection performance. Furthermore, in order to better adapt to various appearances and sizes of intersection, we propose a Class-Aware MultiHead, which classifies and regresses different categories with specific head. Finally, we evaluate our MInsectDet and MMInsectDet methods on the proposed KITTI-Intersection Dataset with the state-of-the-art foreground 3D detection methods. The results show that MMInsectDet achieves the best performance, and MInsectDet ranks second but could run at 65.0 FPS.},

  abstract     = {Real-time safety metrics are important for automated driving systems (ADS) to assess the risk of driving situations and assist in decision-making. Although a number of real-time safety metrics have been proposed in the literature, there is a lack of systematic performance evaluations of these metrics. As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety metrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their performance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an evaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data so that vehicle trajectories for both the subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are obtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be eliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision unavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of BVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety metrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the collision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips are available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics’ statistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time safety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC), the PEGASUS Criticality Metric (PCM) and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM), are evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The results demonstrate that the MPrISM achieves the highest recall and the PCM has the best accuracy. The proposed evaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and regulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics for different applications. Moreover, by conducting failure analysis on moments when a safety metric fails, we can identify its potential weaknesses, which can be valuable for potential refinements and improvements.},

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicles offer the possibility to carry out control strategies, thus having great potential to improve traffic efficiency and road safety. The efficient passage of an emergency vehicle calls for the collaborative driving decision-making among multiple vehicles in a dynamically changing local area. However, existing work fails to efficiently adapt to dynamic and complex traffic conditions, thus cannot well solve the task. For better solution, we propose a flexible cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning approach based on value function factorization, called Q-LSTM. Since the traffic environment is partially observable, the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm is adopted to learn effective cooperative strategies for individual agents. To flexibly adapt to the changing neighborhood condition around the emergency vehicle, we introduce a long short-term memory network to decompose the learned global value function into local value function of each agent within the neighborhood, whose quantity and entities vary over time. To address the credit assignment problem and realize different roles of the emergency and regular vehicles, reward mechanism and the way agent-wise Q-networks update are well-designed. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Simulation of Urban MObility platform. Results show that our Q-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art value-based MARL methods. Moreover, the robustness and adaptability of the Q-LSTM are verified in the cases of increased traffic density.},

However, existing studies utilizing connected vehicle (CV) data have not effectively addressed fixed-time control due to their reliance on specific vehicle arrival assumptions. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel traffic control approach for fixed-time signalized intersections based on a cumulative flow diagram (CFD) framework. The proposed method comprises a CFD model and a multi-objective optimization model. The CFD model establishes analytical relationships between traffic flow operations and varying signal timing parameters, with intersection demand estimated using a novel weighted maximum likelihood estimation method. A multi-objective optimization model based on CFD is formulated to minimize exceeded queue dissipation time as the primary objective and average delay as the secondary objective, which is applicable under both undersaturated and oversaturated traffic conditions. Leveraging the data-driven nature of the CFD model, a specially designed bi-level particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is employed to determine optimal cycle length (and offset if applicable) and green ratios separately. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms Synchro, a conventional approach, in terms of average delay and queue under various traffic conditions. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits the capability to handle specialized scenarios involving spillbacks.},

DAITS employs drivers’ mobile devices to act as verifiers, and hence message authentication is provided in an as-a-service basis for the ITS nodes. Moreover, DAITS is a certificateless system, which deploys private smart contracts in a permissioned blockchain, for certifying nodes. Furthermore, the smart contracts store authentication tokens for the ITS nodes which ensure authentication between the ITS nodes and road infrastructure. DAITS relies on lightweight security primitives such as hash function, bitwise XOR, and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Extensive security analysis shows that DAITS can resist various security attacks. The simulation results demonstrate that DAITS is both resource-efficient and scalable, and outperforms competing schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead, and verification delay.},

Inspired by the inherent regularity of human mobility, existing approaches capture spatial-temporal transition regularities in historical trajectory for data recovery. Although promising, existing solutions suffer from two limitations. i) These methods fail to recover occasionally-visited points (OVP) due to the lack of semantic information when learning spatial-temporal transition regularities. ii) The information before and after missing data is not be fully utilized for trajectory recovery. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel semantic-aware trajectory recovery framework. First, we leverage heterogeneous information network (HIN) to encode various semantic correlations for obtaining rich semantic embeddings, which are fused with temporal information to form spatial-temporal semantic context. Then, we develop a behavior attention mechanism to capture semantic behavior transition regularities for trajectory recovery based on the bidirectional spatial-temporal semantic context before and after missing data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by 7%-11% in term of recall, F1-score and mean average precision.},

However, most of the existing methods do not consider the perception quality and the safety simultaneously. This article proposes a perception-aware trajectory planning strategy for quadrotors, which can ensure the safety and localization accuracy. In contrast to the existing methods, the main idea of the proposed method lies in that the yaw angle trajectory is planned to actively obtain more information in the environment to improve the localization accuracy and keep the safe flight simultaneously. Following the mainstream two-stage motion planning framework, a coarse-to-fine graph search strategy is proposed to search for a safe and perception-aware yaw angle path in the first stage. Specifically, a Yaw Safety Corridor (YSC) is proposed to guarantee the safety, which can observe the obstacles directly along the tangent direction of the position trajectory. In addition, a dedicated map Fisher Information Field (FIF) is employed to evaluate the perception quality. In the second stage, a path-guided optimization method is proposed to quickly generate a safe and perception-aware trajectory. Finally, comparative simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to verify the superior performance in terms of the perception quality and the safety of the proposed method.},

This model is extended to capture per-path densities, yielding a path-based OD matrix problem formulation that results in a nonlinear optimisation problem. Efficient solution methodologies, based on convex and nonconvex optimisation theory, are developed for free-flow and congested conditions, respectively. In contrast with the majority of research for the OD matrix estimation problem, this work offers the following advantages: 1) no prior or target OD matrices are needed to implement the approach outlasting the bias and dependency on such matrices, 2) no historical data are required for accurate estimations, 3) no route choice model or split ratios are needed, 4) no user equilibrium conditions are required for high-quality estimation, and 5) even low partial coverage of the network is sufficient to provide high-quality OD matrix estimation.

  abstract     = {For the SLAM system in robotics and autonomous driving, the accuracy of front-end odometry and back-end loop-closure detection determine the whole intelligent system performance. But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 3rd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have significantly improved the prediction accuracy of travel demand using graph neural networks. However, these studies largely ignored uncertainty that inevitably exists in travel demand prediction. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework of probabilistic graph neural networks (Prob-GNN) to quantify the spatiotemporal uncertainty of travel demand. This Prob-GNN framework is substantiated by deterministic and probabilistic assumptions, and empirically applied to the task of predicting the transit and ridesharing demand in Chicago. We found that the probabilistic assumptions (e.g. distribution tail, support) have a greater impact on uncertainty prediction than the deterministic ones (e.g. deep modules, depth). Among the family of Prob-GNNs, the GNNs with truncated Gaussian and Laplace distributions achieve the highest performance in transit and ridesharing data. Even under significant domain shifts, Prob-GNNs can predict the ridership uncertainty in a stable manner, when the models are trained on pre-COVID data and tested across multiple periods during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Prob-GNNs also reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of uncertainty, which is concentrated on the afternoon peak hours and the areas with large travel volumes. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating randomness into deep learning for spatiotemporal ridership prediction. Future research should continue to investigate versatile probabilistic assumptions to capture behavioral randomness, and further develop methods to quantify uncertainty to build resilient cities.},

  abstract     = {Virtual coupling is expected to primarily improve the capacity of a railway system. Virtual coupled systems are affected by multi-source disturbances due to the complex operating environment. However, existing research only partially considers the effects of structural or external disturbances, which limits the stability and robustness of the virtually coupled train set (VCTS). In this paper, we aim to tackle the challenges arising from both structural and external disturbances in virtual coupling. We specifically propose a distributed robust model predictive control (DRMPC) solution based on a linearized model by joining linear feedback and feedforward control into a model predictive control (MPC) framework with a discrete Kalman filter (DKF). We also theoretically derive and prove a set of sufficient conditions for both local and string stabilities under structural uncertainty. The stability conditions are incorporated into the constraint space of the distributed MPC framework in order to guarantee system stability in the presence of structural and external uncertainties. The simulation results validate that our proposed control method can stabilize train platooning under both structural and external disturbances. Our control method particularly reduces the spacing and velocity tracking errors by approximately 97.55% and 99.97% on average, respectively, as compared to several baselines.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a vital task in the field of autonomous driving for it provides valuable information on drivable locations. However, complex scenarios like severe occlusion, discontinuous lane appearance, and illumination variation still hinder the accurate detection of lanes. This paper presents FlipNet, a novel and efficient neural network that detects lanes in complex environments by taking advantage of feature flip fusion and attention mechanism. First, a hierarchical feature flip fusion module (HFFF) is developed to utilize spatial information and aggregate global content. HFFF constructs a hierarchical structure consisting of multiple scales of sub-feature maps and uses flip fusion to pass spatial information in a two-way manner. Then, a double-layer attention enhancement mechanism (DAEM) and a dual-pooling coordinate attention (DCA) are proposed to enhance the features extracted by the encoder backbone. DAEM highlights valuable features and reduces background noise, which helps the network better capture the long-range dependent lane structure and be more robust in challenging scenarios. Experiments show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains new best results among segmentation-based methods in three popular lane detection benchmarks: CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS.},

Moreover, pedestrian movements are more challenging to predict because humans can quickly change their direction and status (e.g., walking or stopping). In this research, we build a system called PedCross, which uses human image semantic information to predict the behavior of pedestrians (i.e., crossing or not crossing). In PedCross, images of pedestrians are first used to detect skeletons. The features in the detected skeletons are then extracted for model training. Two types of models, Random Forest and LSTM, are considered for pedestrian crossing prediction. To further improve the efficiency and accuracy of PedCross, Skip Frame, Head Orientation, and Warning/Dangerous Zones are integrated. PedCross is tested with the collected ITRI dataset and deployed on the auto-driving bus for a road test. The road test indicates that PedCross achieves all the requirements set forth by ITRI and outperforms Free Space, a baseline system developed by ITRI.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants can efficiently capture the features of time-series characteristic data and are widely used for intelligent transportation tasks. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) edge devices deploying RNN models are an important impetus for the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and provide convenient services for users and managers. However, the input data of some transportation tasks have high dimensional characteristics, resulting in the number of training parameters and computational complexity of RNN models being too large, making it difficult to deploy high-performance RNN models on resource-constrained IoV edge devices. To overcome this problem, we compress the training parameters of the RNN model using the proposed multi-tree compact hierarchical tensor representation-Dtensor Block Decomposition (DBD), which reduces the computational complexity of the model and speeds up the training process of the model, thus making the network model lightweight. We evaluate the performance of Dtensor Block-Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) and Improved Dtensor Block-LSTM (IDB-LSTM) models on multiple real datasets and compare them with the current state-of-the-art LSTM compression models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can massively compress the number of training parameters of the models on different datasets and shorten the training time of the models without degrading the testing accuracy of the models. In addition, our proposed DB-LSTM and IDB-LSTM models have better comprehensive performance compared with other models and are more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoV edge devices.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is vital to traffic planning, control, and optimization, which is necessary for intelligent traffic management. Existing methods mostly capture spatiotemporal correlations on a fine-grained traffic graph, which cannot make full use of cluster information in coarse-grained traffic graph. However, the flow variation of clusters in the coarse-grained traffic graph is more stable compared with nodes in the fine-grained traffic graph. And the flow variation of a fine-grained node is generally consistent with the trend of the cluster to which the node belongs. Thus information in the coarse-grained traffic graph can guide feature learning in the fine-grained traffic graph. To this end, we propose a Spatiotemporal Multiscale Graph Convolutional Network (SMGCN) that explores spatiotemporal correlations on a multiscale graph. Specifically, given a fine-grained traffic graph, we first generate a coarse-grained traffic graph by graph clustering, and extract spatiotemporal correlations on both fine-grained and coarse-grained traffic graphs. Then we propose a cross-scale fusion (CF) to implement information diffusion between the fine-grained and coarse-grained traffic graphs. Moreover, we employ an adaptive dynamic graph convolution network to mine both static and dynamic spatial features. We evaluate SMGCN on real-world datasets and obtain a $1.18\% -3.32\%$ improvement over state-of-the-arts.},

With the recent advancement in data science and sensing technologies, embedded sensors have been applied to collect the in-situ signal induced by traffic loading and estimate the traffic information. However, very limited studies have focused on evaluating the mechanical properties of pavement materials and structures using embedded sensors. This paper aims to present a practical approach to performing the in-situ dynamic modulus test and develop an in-situ dynamic modulus predictive model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on real-time sensing data. Particle-size wireless sensors were implemented in several pavement sections to collect data under vehicular loading. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method was introduced to calculate the intrinsic modes of the collected data as the ANN model inputs. Laboratory dynamic modulus tests using the same material as the paving projects were also performed with embedded wireless sensors. Those laboratory data, combined with the field sensing data, were used as the training and testing dataset for developing the ANN model. The results show that the developed ANN model, when adequately trained with particle-level sensing data, is feasible and robust for predicting the in-situ dynamic modulus of asphalt pavement.},

FCR introduces a flow-based traffic management method that enables us to compute detour paths in units of flow rather than per vehicle processing, which reduces the load to calculate detour paths and makes the centralized system practically feasible. With the flow-based traffic management, FCR also enables us to consider traffic volume that should bypass the congested roads to mitigate the congestion and suggest detour paths to the corresponding traffic volume of vehicles. By prioritizing travel time loss when choosing detour routes to apply, FCR leads to better global optimality with the limited volume of rerouting traffic while considering each rerouted vehicle’s benefit, such as travel time loss. FCR offers a new centralized system architecture for actual real-time traffic control, which improves both global optimality and each vehicle’s benefit within a feasible computational load.},

To achieve this, one typical solution is designing modules based on RNN to capture their preferences to various locations. Although these RNN-based methods can effectively learn individual’s hidden personalized preferences to her visited places, the interactions among users can only be weakly learned through the representations of locations. Targeting this, we propose an end-to-end framework named personalized and group preference guided network (PG2Net), considering the users’ preferences to various places at both individual and collective levels. Specifically, PG2Net concatenates Bi-LSTM and attention mechanism to capture each user’s long-term mobility tendency. To learn population’s group preferences, we utilize spatial and temporal information of the visitations to construct a spatial-temporal dependency module. We adopt a graph embedding method to map users’ trajectory into a hidden space, capturing their sequential relation. In addition, we devise an auxiliary loss to learn the vectorial representation of her next location. Experimental results on two Foursquare check-in datasets and one mobile phone dataset indicate the advantages of our model compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

Although many languages for high-level scenario modelling have been proposed, they lack the features to precisely and reliably control the required micro-simulation, while also supporting behavior reuse and test reproducibility for a wide range of interactive scenarios. To fill this gap between scenario design and execution, we propose the Simulated Driver-Vehicle (SDV) model to represent and simulate vehicles as dynamic entities with their behavior being constrained by scenario design and goals set by testers. The model combines driver and vehicle as a single entity. It is based on human-like driving and the mechanical limitations of real vehicles for realistic simulation. The model leverages behavior trees to express high-level behaviors in terms of lower-level maneuvers, affording multiple driving styles and reuse. Furthermore, optimization-based maneuver planners guide the simulated vehicles towards the desired behavior. Our extensive evaluation shows the model’s design effectiveness using NHTSA pre-crash scenarios, its motion realism in comparison to naturalistic urban traffic, and its scalability with traffic density. Finally, we show the applicability of our SDV model to test a real ADS and to identify crash scenarios, which are impractical to represent using predefined vehicle trajectories. The SDV model instances can be injected into existing simulation environments via co-simulation.},

  abstract     = {General Visual Inspection is a manual inspection process regularly used to detect and localise obvious damage on the exterior of commercial aircraft. There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera’s pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft’s surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera’s pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2° for all real scenes.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are rapidly evolving and will soon enable large-scale mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems applications. Managing the fleets of available vehicles, commonly known as “rebalancing,” is crucial to ensure that vehicles are distributed properly to meet customer demands. This paper presents an optimal control approach to optimize vehicle scheduling and rebalancing in an autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system. We use graph theory to model a city partitioned into virtual zones. Zones represent small areas of the city where vehicles can stop and pick up/drop off customers, whereas links denote corridors of the city along which autonomous vehicles can move. They are considered vertices and edges in the graph. Vehicles employed in the AMoD scheme are autonomous, and rebalancing can be executed by dispatching available empty vehicles to areas undersupplied. Rebalancing is performed on the graph’s vertices, i.e., between city areas. We propose a linear, discrete-time model of an AMoD system using a transformed network. After acquiring the model, the desired number of rebalancing vehicles for the AMoD model is derived through an optimization problem. Moreover, the well-posedness of the model is illustrated. To leverage the proposed model, we implemented the model predictive control (MPC) framework to find the optimal rebalancing and scheduling policy. We show the MPC’s effectiveness and how the MPC framework can be implemented in real-time for a real-world case study. The numerical results show that the MPC with a linear cost function and linear reference, which it tracks, is effective, outperforming other MPC-based and state-of-the-art algorithms across all evaluation criteria.},

  abstract     = {Accurate vision-based driver attention estimation is a challenging task due to the limitations of the visual sensor, and it is a critical and fundamental function of building a human-centered intelligent driving system. Unlike previous investigations which consider it a classification task, this study newly introduces scenario contextual information to improve the accuracy and obtain a fine-grained estimation. Therefore, a data-driven hybrid architecture for context-aware driver attention estimation is proposed to jointly model the scene and state of the driver during driving. A visual saliency map is typically assumed to highlight a distinct area that can capture human attention. To leverage this characteristic, a multi-hierarchy fusion network is proposed to extract effectively saliency features of a scene image. A gaze-tracking network is employed to estimate the potential focus zone of the driver, and this coarse estimation is optimized subsequently using the extracted saliency information to obtain a fine-grained estimation. Three related and commonly used task-agnostic and task-driven datasets are adopted to evaluate the proposed saliency estimation model, and experimental results show that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance. To verify the joint modeling methodology, two new driving attention datasets supplemented with driver information are collected based on the existing ones. The results of comparative experiments indicate that the consideration of saliency features can significantly improve the estimation performance of gaze fixation, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {US Department of Transportation (DOT) operators commonly use adjustable surveillance cameras for traffic monitoring and desire to have an automated traffic counting system by lane. To fill this need, this paper describes an automatic, novel, multiple-ROI (Regions of Interest) lane learning (MRLL) system. It detects lane centers, boundaries, and traffic directions, irrespective of zoom or direction. It finds optimal ROIs without user input by analyzing confidence scores from a chosen Machine Learning (ML) object detector. A simple but effective Continual Learning strategy is used to control the MRLL’s start and stop that optimizes lane counting performance in various real-world conditions: nighttime, extremely harsh weather, or low traffic flow conditions. Tested on 45 varied videos, it achieves an F1_score above 0.79 for lane center detection, 0.88 for lane boundaries, and 94% accuracy in traffic direction detection. This innovative system, which does not rely on lane markings and adapts to camera views, is currently used by the Indiana Department of Transportation for vehicle counting and flow rate estimation in real-world ITS scenarios.

  abstract     = {Traffic speed forecasting has been a very active research area as it is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Although a plethora of deep learning methods have been proposed for traffic speed forecasting, the majority of them can only make point-wise prediction, which may not provide enough information for critical real-world scenarios where prediction confidence also need to be estimated, e.g., route planning for ambulances and rescue vehicles. To address this issue, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning method coined Uncertainty-Aware Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (UAT-GCN). UAT-GCN employs a Graph Convolutional Network and Gated Recurrent Unit based architecture to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. In addition, UAT-GCN consists of a specialized regressor for estimating both epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) uncertainty. In particular, UAT-GCN utilizes Monte Carlo dropout and predictive variances to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, respectively. In addition, we also consider the recursive dependency between predictions to further improve the forecasting performance. An extensive empirical study with real datasets offers evidence that the proposed model is capable of advancing current state-of-the-arts in terms of point-wise forecasting and quantifying prediction uncertainty with high reliability. The obtained results suggest that, compared to existing methods, the RMSE and MAE of the proposed model on the SZ-taxi dataset are reduced by 2.15% and 7.23%, respectively; the RMSE and MAE of the proposed model on the Los-loop dataset are reduced by 4.17% and 8.53%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes weak TDMA (WTDMA) as a new method for slotted medium access on the controller area network (CAN). Different from TDMA, WTDMA does not require guard times for the temporal isolation of different time slots. Instead, a certain degree of overlap of time slots can be tolerated due to the usage of Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Resolution (CSMA/CR) and the non-preemptive message transmission on CAN. WTDMA can be realized in software with a moderate accuracy of the synchronized clocks of different CAN nodes and without any modifications to the CAN standard. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the correct operation of WTDMA and performs a comprehensive experimental evaluation. We show that bus loads above 90% can be achieved, whereby the message latencies are mostly determined by the message transmission times in the order of hundreds of microseconds. In addition, WTDMA is robust to disturbances such as bit errors. These properties are vital for contemporary mission-critical real-time vehicle applications.},

In this paper, a lightweight Multi-entity Authenticated Group Key Agreement (MAGKA) protocol is proposed for blockchain-based VEC networks. The proposed blockchain network built from the roadside units is to ensure the un-deniability of any data exchanged among the edge networks to provide data trust management. The MAGKA protocol substantiates the lightweight authentication between the vehicles, the roadside unit, and the trusted authority anonymously, allowing the vehicles to join or leave the edge network dynamically on the premise of ensured security. The security analysis shows that MAGKA protocol can resist common attacks effectively. In addition, the performance evaluation shows that the MAGKA reduces the computational cost for the low-power node and powerful node by 75% and 50%, respectively, over the existing authentication protocols.},

  abstract     = {The deep understanding of the behaviors of traffic participants is essential to guarantee the safety of automated vehicles (AV) in mixed traffic with vulnerable road users (VRUs). Precise trajectory prediction of traffic participants can provide reasonable solution space for motion planning of AV. Early works mainly focused on handcrafting the feature representation and designing complicated architectures in deep learning-based prediction models. However, these approaches overlooked the fact that different road users perceive the safety of the same interaction differently and also exhibit heterogeneous risk-taking styles. In this paper, we will develop a model for trajectory prediction based on risk-taking styles. The model accounts for the expected positions and occupancy of traffic participants in the surrounding environment. It consists of two sequential steps: risk-taking styles of multi-modal road users under interactive scenes are first clustered, and then reformulated in the heterogeneous graph model for trajectory prediction. The model is validated by the driving data collected on the urban road using a public dataset. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the trajectory of traffic participants much more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, due to their failure to exploit image semantics, their performance in detecting small targets or under challenging conditions does not exceed that of fusion-based approaches. In order to elevate the detection performance in a complex environment, this paper proposes a multi-modal and multi-class 3D object detection network, named Voxel-Pixel Fusion Network (VoPiFNet). Within this network, we design a key novel component called the Voxel-Pixel Fusion Layer, which takes advantage of the geometric relation of a voxel-pixel pair and effectively fuses voxel features and pixel features with the cross-modal attention mechanism. Moreover, after considering the characteristics of the voxel-pixel pair, we design four parameters to guide and enhance this fusion effect. This proposed layer can be integrated with voxel-based 3D LiDAR detectors and 2D image detectors. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the public KITTI benchmark dataset for multi-class 3D object detection at different levels. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting challenging pedestrian category and achieve promising performance in overall 3D mean average precision (mAP).},

On-path caching feature in the conventional vehicular named data Networks (VNDN) enables content storage that can reduce latency. However, due to the constantly changing dynamic ad hoc nature of the vehicular network, the availability of stored content for the requester vehicle cannot be guaranteed. In addition, without knowing which content will be requested, where it will be requested and when it will be requested, the content caching functionality of VNDN is underutilized. To address this issue, this manuscript proposes a content prefetching scheme for the Content-centric Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) by introducing the content Value of Popularity ( $VoP$ ) matrix. Considering vehicles requesting content of similar interests, we evaluate $VoP$ through three value update functions that follow the power law of the time elapsed since the last content requested. By multiple parameters of consumer vehicle similarity, an on-road proactive content retriever vehicle is selected. The simulation results showed that the proposed proactive on-path content prefetching mechanism significantly reduces the content delivery delay while increasing the success delivery ratio by 48% and extends the spread of content within the network by 53%.},

Firstly, the running resistance is assumed to be nonlinear and multiple traction units are connected by elastic couplings, then a multi-particle model is created. Next, a finite-time coordinated control protocol is designed based on the principle of multi-agent control and the finite-time Lyapunov stability theorem. The protocol is proved to be robust to disturbances and the speed consensus for all traction units is achieved. Meanwhile, the interaction forces between successive traction units converge to zero within a finite time. Finally, some numerical results are conducted to validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Even though the traffic systems in developed countries have been analyzed rigorously and operated efficiently, the same does not generally hold for developing countries due to inadequate planning, design, and operations of their transportation systems. Because of inherent differences between internal infrastructures, the strategies deployed in developed countries may not be amenable to developing ones. Besides, developing countries’ traffic systems are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge. For example, it is yet to explore how a developed country’s lane-based traffic flow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally experiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed traffic simulator ‘RoadBird,’ we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and non-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed countries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted from the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh), considering different scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or heterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate various car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and investigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open research question, our experimental evidence indicates: 1) lane-based approaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted non-lane-based scenarios, and 2) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system performance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic. Nonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences both in developing and developed countries.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained vehicle classification of make and model recognition is of practical significance and can be widely applied in the tasks such as traffic perception and control. To date, vision-based vehicle make and model recognition methods have improved through the years; however, they often fail in low-visibility scenes. This paper proposes a fine-grained vehicle model recognition framework based on magnetic fingerprints instead of videos from surveillance cameras. The magnetic fingerprint refers to the pattern of magnetic field data obtained when vehicles pass magnetic sensors, which have less sensitivity and more robustness towards low-visibility scenes than surveillance cameras. Specifically, the proposed framework first utilizes adversarial autoencoders to extract the magnetic fingerprint from the raw magnetic field data, keeping detailed information for fine-grained vehicle model recognition as complete as possible. Then, an AdaBoostSVM algorithm is used to identify vehicle models from the magnetic fingerprint and further alleviate the hard-negative issue to reduce false classifications. Massive experimental results show that the proposed fine-grained vehicle magnetic fingerprint/AdaBoostSVM method achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained vehicle make and model recognition. The average precision reached 94.3% and the average recall reached 94.2% in the dataset containing 36 vehicle models in total. Notably, the proposed method outperforms surveillance camera methods, especially in low-visibility scenes, making it a valuable addition to future intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {In the foreseeable Intelligent Transportation System, Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) will play an important role in improving travel efficiency and safety. However, it is challenging for ICVs to support the resource-hungry autonomous driving applications due to the limitation of hardware computing power. Fortunately, the emergence of Multi-access Edge Computing helps overcome this limitation effectively. This paper addresses the vehicle-to-edge server computation offloading conundrum by optimizing the trade-offs in partial offloading and resource allocation. Proposing a distributed approach, this study confronts the multi-variable non-convex challenge directly by decoupling variables and deriving constraint-based bounds that guide the decisions for offloading and allocation. A novel low-complexity distributed algorithm is introduced that not only tends toward optimal but also demonstrates superior real-time applicability and efficiency, illustrated through enhanced performances both in simulated trials and genuine vehicular edge computing settings. The algorithm’s practical effectiveness addresses a notable gap between the theoretical models for computation offloading and actual real-life execution, reinforcing the soundness and relevance of the proposed method. Furthermore, its advanced integration with federated learning frameworks marks a leading-edge application, substantiating significant enhancements in computational efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Accident risk and severity are closely associated with speeding. Reducing vehicles’ speeds can contribute to road traffic safety. Conventional speed reduction measures, such as speed limit enforcement or speed indicator devices, only have a local effect, so they are not suitable for longer road stretches with varying speed limit, e.g. narrow curves in motorway exits. We present a novel speed reduction measure based on the concept of “nudging”. The measure consists of LEDs embedded in the road marking that light up in front of vehicles which exceed a predefined speed threshold. The speeds and positions of the vehicles are gathered in real-time by thermal cameras and computer vision algorithms in order to target and follow only the speeding vehicles without distracting other drivers. The speed reduction measure was implemented and evaluated at a motorway exit with a narrow curve in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The effectiveness was analyzed using linear regression models in order to take external influences on the speed (e.g. daylight, weather) into account. The mean speed was reduced by up to 2.7 km/h and the ratio of speeding vehicles by up to 40%. The most substantial speed reduction was observed on the straight part of the exit lane, which means that drivers decelerate earlier in front of the curve rather than in the curve, where longitudinal and lateral acceleration would overlap.},

Firstly, it incorporates a bio-inspired neural network-based (BINN) approach which predicts the most efficient paths for individual UUVs while simultaneously ensuring collision avoidance among the vehicles. Secondly, an efficient target assignment component is integrated by considering the path distances determined by the BINN algorithm. In addition, a critical innovation within the CBNNTAP algorithm is its capacity to address the disruptive effects of ocean currents, where an adjustment component is seamlessly integrated to counteract the deviations caused by these currents, which enhances the accuracy of both motion planning and target assignment for the UUVs. The effectiveness of the CBNNTAP algorithm is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation results and the outcomes underscore the superiority of the developed algorithm in nullifying the effects of static and dynamic ocean currents in 2D and 3D scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) integrates mobile edge computing with traditional vehicular networks, which shifts the majority of computation and storage workload of resource-constrained vehicles to the edge nodes. The high mobility of vehicles usually leads to frequent network changes and connection interruptions, making data sharing more challenging in such dynamic and unstable environments. To address this issue, cache-based content delivery is considered a promising solution for efficient data sharing in VEC. However, access control and fair incentive distribution in privacy-aware data sharing are rarely taken into account in prior VEC-oriented studies. In this paper, we propose RFIP-VEC, a Revocable access control scheme with Fair Incentive for Privacy-aware content delivery in VEC. Specifically, to enable anonymous authentication and conditional revocation, we construct a secure group signature scheme with formally proved security guarantees. Subsequently, based on our group signature scheme, we design a two-layer access control framework by employing proxy re-encryption. We also establish an evolutionary game theory model to analyze the effectiveness and fairness of the fair incentive in our scheme. Thus, our scheme can achieve flexible access control and fair incentive distribution with the assistance of edge nodes. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve security goals with affordable cost in terms of network performance in VEC.},

  abstract     = {Many special events, including sports games and concerts, often cause surges in demand and congestion for transit systems. Therefore, it is important for transit providers to understand their impact on disruptions, delays, and fare revenues. Ridership after large sporting events is distinct from many other ridership patterns due to the high density of ridership localized to a few nearby stations. This paper provides the following novel methodology for long-term planning of large-event, post-game ridership by 1) predicting the total post-game ridership; 2) combining the total prediction with historical trends to forecast the passenger flow curve at nearby stations after the game; and 3) estimating the required train frequencies to serve these customers with minimal passengers left behind by each train. Additionally, this paper proposes a suite of data-driven techniques that together create a data-driven pipeline to exploit Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data for evaluating, anticipating, and managing the performance of transit systems. This paper includes a case study where the proposed pipeline is used to generate an adjusted train schedule for the post-game period and simulated with the rail ridership data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The simulation results highlight how the proposed schedules based on the estimated required post-game train frequencies could significantly improve post-game congestion and wait time. Furthermore, the results show that the long-term post-game demand forecasts could be an effective tool for tactical planning decisions such as the number of additional trains and operators that are needed during post-game periods compared to the regularly scheduled timetables.},

Despite significant efforts to automate the requirements consistency detection, current inconsistency analysis techniques of railway safety requirements still suffer from scalability issues. This paper proposes a two-layer approach for detecting inconsistencies in time-related safety requirements of railway systems, integrating two distinct formal methods from a pragmatic perspective. At the SafeNL layer, we employ an SMT-based approach to extract conflict patterns and use them to filter out inconsistent requirements descriptions, thus avoiding the more expensive general use of the SMT-based approach. At the CCSL layer, temporal dependencies in requirements are transformed into causal relations, which are then detected for circular inconsistencies using a graph search technique. Our evaluations demonstrate the utility and scalability of our approach.},

While there exists an extensive body of literature on this topic, exploring computation offloading from the standpoint of task types has been relatively underrepresented. This motivates our survey, which seeks to classify the state-of-the-art (SoTA) from the task type point-of-view. To achieve this, a thorough literature review is conducted to reveal the SoTA from various aspects, including architecture, objective, offloading strategy, and task types, with the consideration of task generation. It has been observed that task types are associated with data and have an impact on the offloading process, including elements like resource allocation and task assignment. Building upon this insight, computation offloading is categorized into two groups based on task types: static task-based offloading and dynamic task-based offloading.

  abstract     = {Reducing traffic accidents and associated casualties is a growing concern for modern human society. The secondary or even chain collisions for an unstable vehicle after an initial impact can result in more hazards and fatalities. Passive safety systems such as airbags and seat belts only provide limited level of protection for vehicle occupants, but cannot prevent collision accidents, while active safety systems usually work before the initial collision. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop dedicated post-impact stability control systems to help vehicles quickly restore stability to mitigate and/or avoid secondary collisions. However, the loss of original nonholonomic constraint property and the nonlinearity and saturation of tire forces due to post-impact sideslip, over-spinning, and drifting motions pose great challenges in controller design. Moreover, how to simulate and analyze the collision process and to further construct a simulation environment is the primary problem to solve for enabling controller development. Also, exploring repeatable, effective and low-cost experiment methods lays the foundation for controller verification. This paper aims to provide an overview of the latest technological advancements in collision modeling, control synthesis, and experimental procedures for post-impact stability control. The advantages and disadvantages of different modeling, control and experimental approaches are compared in succession.

  abstract     = {Automatic detection of traffic signs is crucial for Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Current two-stage approaches consist of a preliminary object detection step, where the traffic signs are categorized within broader families (e.g., speed limits), and then sub-classes (e.g., speed limit 40). However, these cascading methods fail to achieve satisfying performance, especially in more realistic driving scenarios where images are acquired under more challenging conditions. Under such conditions, the first-stage detection step is likely to provide inaccurate predictions, making the subsequent classification step useless. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage fusion framework for traffic sign detection. Different from the previous cascading method, our framework directly predicts categories in the first-stage detection and fuse the two-stage category predictions to improves overall robustness. Besides, in order to filter the false detection boxes under low-resolution inputs, we also propose an effective post-processing method called Surrounding-Aware Non-Maximum Suppression (SA-NMS) as an alternative technique for the first-stage detection. After combining the above proposed methods, our framework obtains good detection performance. Experimental results on the widely used Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) traffic sign dataset, which contains images of traffic signs collected under a variety of challenging conditions, show that the proposed framework outperforms current approaches in both accuracy and inference speed, achieving 89.7 mAP and 65 FPS for ${608\times 608}$ low resolution images.},

We identify two significant obstacles in cost-effectively and efficiently developing such a LiDAR-based traffic monitoring system: (i) public LiDAR datasets are insufficient for supporting perception tasks in infrastructure systems, and (ii) 3D annotations on LiDAR point clouds are time-consuming and expensive. To fill this gap, we present an efficient semi-automated annotation tool that automatically annotates LiDAR sequences with tracking algorithms while offering a fully annotated infrastructure LiDAR dataset—FLORIDA (Florida LiDAR-based Object Recognition and Intelligent Data Annotation)—which will be made publicly available. Our advanced annotation tool seamlessly integrates multi-object tracking (MOT), single-object tracking (SOT), and suitable trajectory post-processing techniques. Specifically, we introduce a human-in-the-loop schema in which annotators recursively fix and refine annotations imperfectly predicted by our tool and incrementally add them to the training dataset to obtain better SOT and MOT models. By repeating the process, we significantly increase the overall annotation speed by $3- 4$ times and obtain better qualitative annotations than a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The human annotation experiments verify the effectiveness of our annotation tool. In addition, we provide detailed statistics and object detection evaluation results for our dataset in serving as a benchmark for perception tasks at traffic intersections.},

  abstract     = {Multi-step highway traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, and existing works have made significant advancements in this field. However, the physical structure, including path, distance, and node degree, is critical information in traffic networks and is often overlooked when encoding spatiotemporal dependencies. Meanwhile, the problem of prediction error propagation in multi-step flow forecasting is challenging to mitigate and can significantly impact overall forecasting performance. Moreover, traffic flows between toll and gantry stations in the highway network exhibit notable differences, leading to heterogeneous flow distributions. To overcome the above issues, a novel multi-task spatiotemporal network for highway traffic flow prediction (MT-STNet) is proposed, consisting of the encoder-decoder structure, a generative inference system, and multi-task learning. The spatiotemporal block with physical transformation is developed to construct both the encoder and decoder, integrating the physical structure information into modeling the highway network’s spatiotemporal dependencies. Additionally, the generative inference architecture is designed to extract the correlation between the historical- and target- sequences to generate the target hidden representations rather than a dynamic decoding way, avoiding multi-step prediction error propagation. Furthermore, because of traffic flow heterogeneity in the highway network, multi-task learning divides highway traffic flow prediction into three tasks, sharing the underlying traffic network and knowledge learned, thereby enhancing the prediction performance of each subtask. The evaluation experiments used monitoring data from a highway in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed prediction model is better than that of the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a framework for deep Long Short-Term Memory (D-LSTM) network embedded model predictive control (MPC) for car-following control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in traffic mixed with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs. The framework consists of: 1) lead HDV trajectory prediction through D-LSTM; and 2) CAV car-following control via MPC based on the predicted vehicle trajectory. For the trajectory prediction, two D-LSTM structures are developed based on the availability of preceding vehicle information: 1) ‘sufficient’ historical information of the position and speed of multiple vehicles ahead; and 2) ‘insufficient’ information where preceding vehicle information is unavailable (e.g., due to failed communication). Based on the prediction, a distributed MPC is designed for each scenario by incorporating the predicted trajectory into state space construction. The proposed D-LSTM models are trained and tested with the NGSIM data for validation. Numerical simulation results for various traffic conditions suggest that the proposed strategies perform better than traditional MPC methods in terms of control objective cost reduction, smoother control, and stabilizing effect. The results also indicate that the sufficient information case outperforms the insufficient information case as expected, which highlights the importance of stable communication.},

Initially, train delay patterns are identified using the K-means clustering algorithm and incorporated as additional variables into the prediction model. To capture dynamic causality in delay propagation, we utilize a dynamic Bayesian network-based dynamic causality graph, incorporating train delay data and domain knowledge to effectively model the train delay propagation. Leveraging these insights on delay dynamic propagation, we propose an attention based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network that effectively models the dynamic spatio-temporal dependency among train events and enhances the accuracy of delay predictions. The proposed method is assessed using operational data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models, particularly with the expansion of the prediction horizon. The learned dynamic causality of the train delay propagation enhances interpretability and results in a 6.97% reduction in mean absolute error. Furthermore, train delay patterns and weather variables contribute to a respective 12.85% and 4.37% reduction in mean absolute error. The statistical tests further validate the efficacy of the proposed model.},

However, the refuelling of the HFCEV is still an essential problem. Specifically, there are not enough hydrogen refuelling stations at hand. In this paper, a hydrogen based microgrid is presented to produce hydrogen to refuel the HFCEV, and different strategies are proposed to guide the HFCEV’s refuelling within the coupled transportation network and power system. First, the HFCEV traffic flow model based on a real-world transportation network is presented. Then, a real-time simulation platform links the Sumo and Matlab is presented. Third, a hydrogen based microgrid to refuel HFCEV is built. Forth, an IEEE 30-node utility grid exporting power model is presented. At last, the real-time hydrogen refuelling of HFCEV through the coupled transportation network and power system is proposed. Four coupled structures are considered, and different HFCEV refuelling strategies (fixed price, dynamic price, LSTM decision price) are compared. The simulation results demonstrate that with the dynamic price, the congestion of the transportation network is improved, the waiting time is reduced by 17.71%, and the time loss of the network is reduced by 13.29%. With reasonable guidance of the price, vehicles choose the selected station to refuel hydrogen and influence the temporal-spatial distribution of the traffic flow of the transportation network. In addition, by adjusting the power station exporting power and the refuelling station importing power, the voltage condition of the power system can be improved.},

In the real driving environment, there is much unlabeled information and the total number of categories of information is uncertain. While human brains are adept at processing such information, current methods are not. Thus, this study presented a novel hybrid unsupervised deep learning method to model the information processing mechanism of the driver’s visual perception. The proposed approach (CAE-SOM) was a neuron-triggered method, which leveraged the virtues of a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The CAE mimicked the hierarchical structures of the driver’s visual system to extract the high-level features, whilst the SOM neural network simulated the working principle of human brain neurons during the information judgment process to perform unsupervised clustering. The CAE-SOM method was built by using a dataset with eight common types of objects in road environments, and then it was tested on a public dataset LabelMe. The results showed that the CAE-SOM method performed well with an average accuracy of 90%. Compared with current unsupervised methods, the CAE-SOM model could improve the accuracy by nearly 10%. Compared with current supervised methods, this new model was still competitive, and its accuracy was close to the highest one. More importantly, the CAE-SOM model could reduce the cost of human labeling work in an unsupervised way and handle data from new categories that had never appeared. The outcomes could contribute to the visual algorithm optimization and safety improvement for autonomous vehicles.},

We characterize the optimal storage control policy for price arbitrage during transportation-idle times and leverage equilibrium analysis of $M/G/N/N$ queues with $N$ cars to calculate the platform’s average revenue rate from dual service provision. For the single-EV case, we explicitly characterize the optimal price, both with patient and impatient customers.

The experiments showed that the proposed method improved 69.6% of the benchmark instances compared with the literature state-of-the-art, with 0.44% of average reduction in the total cost.

Therefore, it is extremely promising in intelligent transportation systems. However, in practice, it is difficult to accurately cluster vehicular clients with mobility according to data distribution. In addition, vehicular clients may be reluctant to contribute their computation and communication resources to perform learning tasks if the CVFL server does not give them proper incentives. In this paper, we would like to address the above issues. Specifically, considering the mobility of vehicular clients, we first propose a clustering method to cluster vehicular clients into several clusters based on the cosine similarity between the model gradient of local vehicular clients and the K-means method. Then, we design a set of optimal contracts specifically for the clusters, aiming to motivate them to select the optimal number of intra-cluster iterations for model training and give the closed-form solution to the contracts under the constraints of individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and task accuracy. The proposed contract theory based incentive mechanism not only effectively motivates every cluster, but also overcomes the information asymmetry problem to maximize the utility of the CVFL server. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method and the designed contract.},

To guarantee safety and convergence properties at each iteration, the collision-free terminal constraint set and approximated merging time cost are designed using the historical vehicle states as a dataset. For adapting the trained trajectories into dynamic traffic flow at on-ramps online, we systematically analyze the arrival time of inter-vehicle potential actions and model a decision tree to express all possible vehicle cluster passing sequences. Then, a heuristic Monte-Carlo tree search (HMCTS) algorithm with a modified searching principle is presented to derive a minimum-time passing sequence. Also, a customized two-stage velocity planning method is used to regulate the vehicle flow following the optimal sequence and trained condition. The proposed approach is verified on the SUMO and compared with three baselines under different on-ramps traffic demands. Results show that our approach enables the conflicting vehicles to merge into the mainline without queuing, rendering both robust and high efficiency multi-vehicle coordination.},

Understanding how drivers assess driving risks and modeling their differences is crucial for developing human-like and personalized behaviors in automated vehicles, gaining people’s trust and acceptance. However, existing driving risk models are usually developed at a statistical level, and no single model can accurately describe and explain the variations in risk perception among drivers. We propose a concise yet effective model known as the Potential Damage Risk (PODAR) model, which provides a universal and physically meaningful structure for estimating driving risk and explaining the reasons for differences in risk perception. Leveraging an open-access dataset collected from an obstacle avoidance experiment, this paper establishes individual risk perception models for drivers with high fitness performances. We conclude that the variations in risk perception among drivers stem from their assessments of potential damage, accounting for the uncertainty in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our findings offer an explanation for human risk perceptions and present a promising risk model for autonomous vehicles to develop human-like behaviors and personalized services.},

First, a Total-Variation norm minimization constraints model that includes both L1 and L2 norm functions is established. The split Bregman iterative method solves the model with convex optimization. Then, a robust adaptive image block compressive sensing algorithm is studied based on an analysis of the image features. The image is divided into blocks, and an overlap image block compressive reconstruction method is proposed. Finally, to solve the block effect caused by block compressive sensing reconstruction, a novel image overlap block compressive sensing reconstruction based on the Poisson function is suggested to avoid the block effect in the reconstruction process. The experimental results show that compared with other traditional compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms, the proposed method can generate a better image reconstruction result. According to the PSNR evaluation, when the sampling rate is 0.3, the proposed method is improved by more than 20.98% compared to the conventional techniques, and according to the SSIM evaluation, it has improved by more than 11.92% from the traditional methods. We can also find that the proposed method has better construction effect for traffic sign image recognition compared with ordinary natural image reconstruction. When the sampling rate is only 0.1, the PSNR value reaches 44.28dB, and the SSIM reconstruction accuracy reaches 98.14%. After reconstructing different types and characteristic images, it is supported that the proposed algorithm has good robustness and anti-noise performance.},

  abstract     = {Company strategy influences many decisions in freight transportation. Behavioral models of company decision-making therefore could benefit from including strategy variables. However, strategy is difficult to observe and quantify. Attitudinal surveys of company executives can be used to collect measurements of latent strategy to use in quantitative models. However, surveys are costly and burdensome. Text mining methods to collect measurements overcome these issues somewhat, but typically require manual intervention and ignore the context of words, which can be problematic. This study introduces a new machine learning method to generate strategy measurement data from existing big text data. The new method, called W2VPCA, combines Natural Language Processing and Principal Components Analysis. W2VPCA produces measurement data that serve as quantitative indicators of latent strategy in behavioral models. W2VPCA is unsupervised, data-driven, and uses information on word context. We apply W2VPCA to generate measurements of latent strategies using readily available, large-scale text data: annual company reports. The empirical measurements are used successfully to associate two latent strategies, one focusing on distribution and the other on products, with truck fleet and distribution center outsourcing decisions. The main empirical outcome is that the W2VPCA measurements outperform Bag-of-Words measurements in a psychometric analysis of latent firm strategies. While this study focuses on freight behavioral models, W2VPCA may also have applications in behavioral modeling in other domains.},

The model tuning control is used to adjust the variable modelling-term that includes the self-aligning torque, which means that some posteriori knowledge of the control system is utilized to make the model more accurate. The model predictive control is adopted to compute the variable stepping-parameters of the backstepping control, which means that some priori knowledge of the control system is utilized to optimize the control performance. Then we discuss a series of studies on the steer-by-wire system and the control algorithms that, collectively, develop an approach of how the hybrid control algorithm steers the front wheels based on a desired angle. The designed approach has been deployed into a steering control unit, and tested in a steering test vehicle to realize the angle following of electric motor steer-by-wire system.

  abstract     = {Visual-based methods for rail surface defect inspection (RSDI) effectively improve the limitations of manual inspection, as they can intuitively display the locations and segmented areas of sensitive defects. The RGB-D RSDI task, which leverages the complementarity between RGB and depth (D) image information to enhance detection performance, has attracted widespread attention and achieved significant development. However, existing methods primarily depend on fully supervised training strategies that necessitate a substantial number of manually annotated pixel-level labels to supervise model training. Undoubtedly, extensive manual annotation is exceedingly time-consuming and labor-intensive, particularly considering the irregular shapes and textures of surface defects on rails, further compounding the burden of manual labeling. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to introduce the semi-supervised learning paradigm into this task. Towards the semi-supervised RGB-D RSDI task, a specific semi-supervised network for this task and an effective cross-modal fusion module are crucial to ensuring detection performance under the constraints of limited labeled samples. Thus, we propose a Depth-assisted Semi-Supervised RGB-D RSDI network (DSSNet) to simultaneously alleviate the annotation burden and achieve satisfactory detection performance. Specifically, adhering to the consistency training paradigm, we construct a semi-supervised RGB-D RSDI architecture for this task by optimizing structures, perturbation mechanisms, loss settings, etc. Furthermore, we propose a Depth-assisted Multi-scale Cross-modal Fusion Module (DMCFM) that conducts multi-scale exploration and cross-modal complementary fusion with the assistance of depth. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the latest 14 state-of-the-art fully supervised methods, the proposed DSSNet achieves highly competitive results while effectively alleviating an 80% annotation burden.},

  abstract     = {The uncertainty held by a system’s users can cause ineffective decision-making. Nowhere is this more apparent than in transportation networks, where drivers’ uncertainty over current road/traffic conditions can negatively alter their routing choices. To alleviate this, an informed system operator may signal information to uninformed users to persuade them into taking more preferable actions (e.g., Google/Apple maps providing live traffic updates). In this work, we study public signalling mechanisms in the context of Bayesian congestion games. We observe the phenomenon that though revealing information can reduce system cost in some settings, in others, it can induce worse performance than not signalling at all. However, we find an important relationship between information signalling and monetary incentives: by utilizing both mechanisms concurrently, the system operator can guarantee that revealing information does not worsen performance. We prove these findings in a general class of Bayesian congestion games. To understand the magnitude at which information signalling can affect system performance, we put a deeper focus in the class of parallel networks with polynomial latency functions and analytically characterize bounds on the change in system cost from signalling. Finally, we consider the problem of solving for optimal signals with and without the concurrent use of monetary incentives. We construct solvable optimization problems whose solutions give optimal signalling policies even when the signalling policy is limited in its support; we then quantify the benefit of these and other signalling mechanisms in numerical examples.},

In this contribution, we extend this approach to achieve an actuation signal that is $n$ -smooth and differentially bounded. While the global stability under matched disturbances is maintained, the finite time reaching behavior is exchanged for asymptotic convergence. With the $n$ -smooth output, $n$ new parameters are introduced, weighing the control characteristics between the tracking performance and the magnitude of the steering angles derivatives. The controller is also evaluated in simulation, demonstrating the tuning capabilities, as well as the reaching and tracking behavior.

Firstly, to characterize the formation pattern and mechanism of the mixed vehicle groups, the subgroup division and subgroup reorganization method is presented in the VTSL. Secondly, since human factors can affect the driving behavior of all vehicles within a subgroup, a HV model is established via considering human factors, such as the driver’s insensitivity to distance and speed of the preceding vehicle. Thirdly, to guarantee the maximum number of vehicles passing the VTSL and the minimum travel time under the traffic signal light constraints, a distributed MPC-based hierarchical cooperative control method is proposed from the Transportation Cyber-Physical System (T-CPS) perspective. Finally, the simulator experiment results indicate that the proposed control protocol is more advantageous and effective as the penetration rate of CAVs continuously increase.},

The traditional sparse-based methods are effective in interference suppression but have a high computational overhead. However, automotive radars are sensitive to computational overhead. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a fast convergence method based on the fused Lasso. Taking advantage of the pulse-like shape of the mutual interference in the time domain, a fused Lasso based sparse model is proposed to extract and eliminate the mutual interference. Experiments on simulated and real radar data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and experiments in dynamic scenarios are conducted. In the two-dimensional range-Doppler (RD) map, the increased signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the proposed method is about 11.95 dB. In addition, the time cost of the proposed method is much lower than the traditional methods. The robustness of the proposed method is also verified via experiments with different chirp rates and pulse durations.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have reached the market share required to meaningfully affect many aspects of the road transport system, including traffic behaviour, energy consumption, and emissions. However, traffic models for hybrids remain insufficiently addressed in microscopic simulation because traditional models ignore vehicle dynamics, and therefore, cannot capture driving differences that exist among the hybrid, conventional, and electric vehicles. This study extends the lightweight microsimulation free-flow acceleration (MFC) model and fills the above gap in the literature by introducing hybrid vehicle dynamics into traffic simulation. First, the methodology underlying the MFC model to reproduce hybrid vehicle dynamics is described, for both charge depleting (CD) and charge sustaining (CS) modes. Then, the experimental setup for model validation and implementation was introduced. The simulations suggest the proposed MFC model can ensure smooth speed and acceleration profiles while converging to the steady state. The results show the MFC model can accurately capture the dynamics of the hybrid vehicle tested on the chassis dynamometer. The MFC model is compared with the Gipps’ model and the intelligent driver model (IDM) regarding their abilities to reproduce driving trajectories of the hybrid vehicle. It was found, in CD mode, the MFC model leads to reductions in both speed and acceleration root mean square errors (RMSEs). In CS mode, the MFC model yields even greater accuracy gains. When predicting the 0–100 km/h acceleration specifications, the MFC model also outperforms the Gipps’ and the IDM, reducing RMSE by 45.8 % and 51.9 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The air traffic control paradigm is shifting from sector-based operations to flow-centric approaches to overcome sectors’ geographical limits. Modeling and predicting intersecting air traffic flows can assist controllers in flow coordination under the flow-centric paradigm. This paper proposes a flow-centric framework– TEMPT: Text-Enriched air traffic flow Modeling and Prediction using Transformers– to identify, represent, and predict intersecting flows in the airspace. Firstly, nominal flow intersections (NFI) are identified through hierarchical clustering of flight trajectory intersections. A flow pattern consistency-based graph analytics approach is proposed to determine the number of NFIs. Secondly, in contrast to the traditional traffic flow feature representation, i.e., numerical time series of flights, this paper proposes a text-enriched flow feature representation to intuitively describe the “flow of flights” in the airspace. More specifically, air traffic flow features are described by a “text paragraph” composed of the time and flight sequences transiting through the NFIs. Finally, a transformer neural network model is adopted to learn the text-enriched flow features and predict the future traffic demand at the NFIs during future time windows. An experimental study was carried out in French airspace to validate the efficacy of TEMPT using one-month ADS-B data in December 2019. Prediction results show that TEMPT outperforms the competitive air traffic flow modeling and prediction approaches: time-series-based Transformers, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), as well as aerodynamic trajectory simulation-based prediction and the historical average.},

  abstract     = {In order to play the key role of automotive millimeter wave radar in intelligent vehicle systems, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is an essential problem to be solved. For practical intelligent driving applications, DOA estimation requires both real-time performance and high accuracy. Due to unique advantages, deep learning (DL) based methods have attracted more attention. Most of the existing DL-based methods require a large number of snapshots, but only a few snapshots can be guaranteed in practical applications. Moreover, they usually model DOA estimation as a multi-label classification task. The output represents the position of signal DOA on the discrete grid, and the resolution will be limited by the grid. In this paper, a new space-time Network (STNet) is proposed, which models DOA estimation as a regression task to achieve the effect of gridless estimation. We design a space correlation extraction module (SCEM) and a time correlation extraction module (TCEM), using the covariance matrix of the received signal and the original received signal as inputs respectively, treat them as different types of data. In these two modules, skip connection dense blocks (SCDBs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are adopted to process two different forms of data. Through such processing, we retain sufficient information, obtain more features for the regression task, and ensure the estimation effect of using a small number of snapshots. The experimental results indicate that the STNet shows obvious performance gain in the case of small snapshots, achieves gridless estimation effect, and demonstrates excellent adaptability in situations where target DOAs are closely positioned.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of unmanned vehicles in urban logistics has gradually become a trend. It can effectively lower carbon emissions, reduce labor costs, and improve logistics efficiency. In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of unmanned vehicle scheduling (UVS) for large-scale urban logistics, where the logistics platform assigns unmanned vehicles to deliver parcels among stations under the constraints of time, capacity, and electricity to maximize the overall revenue of the logistics platform. Although the UVS problem is of practical usefulness, solving it requires non-trivial efforts, because we have proved that the UVS problem is NP-hard. To solve the UVS problem efficiently, we propose an efficient two-stage processing framework, including task assignment and vehicle reposition. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose an effective preference-aware matching (PAM) algorithm to deal with task assignments between unmanned vehicles and delivery tasks, which considers not only the electricity consumption of unmanned vehicles but also the supply-demand balance between delivery tasks and unmanned vehicles. In the second stage, we propose two vehicle repositioning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning, termed restricted DQN repositioning algorithm (RDR) and restricted A2C repositioning algorithm (RAR), which can effectively refine the vehicle’s reposition stations based on vehicle supply and demand, electricity supply and demand, charging pile availability and collision avoidance restriction rules at current and neighbor stations, so that the vehicles can be efficiently relocated to stations with over-delivery tasks. Finally, extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed algorithms can achieve desirable efficiency and effectiveness.},

Firstly, the T-S fuzzy model is constructed to represent the global nonlinear dynamics of a China Railway High-speed (CRH) trailer car. Secondly, the data-driven ToMFIR based on T-S fuzzy theory and system identification is designed with the help of system input/output(I/O) data models. Moreover, Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence based evaluation function is proposed for monitoring the slight changes of data-driven ToMFIR. Furthermore, generalized likelihood ratio (LR) reconstruction method combined with data-driven ToMFIR is designed for incipient isolation of suspension actuator and sensor faults. Finally, simulation studies conducted on SIMPACK-MATLAB/Simulink Co-simulation environment are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed FDI scheme for both slowly developing faults and incipient faults with intermittent characteristics.},

Considering that the truck-drone collaborative delivery system can both reduce the risk of COVID-19 propagation and deliver supplies in a cost effective and timely manner, this paper introduces the Multiple visits Travelling Salesman Problem with Multiple Heterogeneous Drones (MTSP-MHD). The model allows a truck to carry a fleet of heterogeneous multi-visit drones for cooperative deliveries, where the drones are capable of delivering to multiple customers on a single route and the flight is restricted by energy consumption and payload constraints. To solve MTSP-MHD, we develop an approach that combines K-Means++ clustering, Nearest neighbor search and Greedy strategies (KNG) to construct feasible solutions. Meanwhile, an Improved Artificial Bee Colony algorithm combining Metropolis acceptance criterion of Simulated Annealing, Tabu list of Tabu Search, and Elite selection strategies (IABC-MTE) is proposed to enhance the quality of solutions. Particularly, three problem-specific neighborhood operators are adopted to search for new solutions. The massive experimental results indicate that IABC-MTE achieves significant improvements over other competitors, with average objective value reductions ranging from 1.81% to 29.16% and standard deviations reduced by 0.04 to 26.44. Finally, the influencing factors of the drone fleet, the performance of different drone fleets and delivery modes are evaluated in detail.},

  abstract     = {Bus scheduling is vital for public transportation to ensure high transit service quality. In actual bus operation, buses’ travel time may change due to some uncertain factors, which makes the planned scheduling scheme fail to meet users’ actual requirements. This work proposes a Controller-based Bus Scheduling Approach (CBSA). In this approach, each departure time in a timetable is regarded as a decision point, and a controller is devised to select a bus in real-time to depart from the departure time. The controller makes a decision at each departure time to cover all departure times in a given timetable. The controller consists of a Duty Type Converter (DTC) and a Bus Selector (BS). DTC determines bus duty types to improve bus utilization, while BS selects a bus to cover the departure time. Since the controller makes decisions in a real-time manner, it can effectively handle uncertain events and factors (such as uncertain travel time). Some key parameters of the controller are optimized by a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to improve its performance. CBSA is applied to real-world problem instances. Experimental results show that it outperforms the compared algorithms and a manual scheduling scheme. It can schedule buses in real-time to generate a high-quality scheduling solution under uncertain environments.},

Most of studies on this problem aim to design a new transit network, which is often an infeasible option in practice since it is highly challenging to replace an existing network with a completely new one. In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective Ant Colony System-based Approach (MACSA) to adjust routes of bus lines for an existing transit network, such that transit service quality is improved while making the smallest deviation of the adjusted network from the existing one. First, all the bus lines in a network are sorted according to their performance. Then, a multi-objective ant colony system is adapted to adjust the sorted bus lines one by one. Besides traditional optimization objectives to maximize direct passenger flow and minimize line repetition coefficient, a new optimization objective (metric), termed adjustment degree, is proposed to measure the difference between adjusted bus lines and existing ones. Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is introduced to calculate the adjustment degree. A multi-pheromone updating mechanism is suggested to guide ants to search for better bus lines for each objective. MACSA is applied to benchmark problem instances and a real-world problem and compared with six approaches. Experiments show that MACSA can achieve an adjusted network with higher direct passenger flow, lower repetition coefficient and smaller adjustment degree. The adjustment degree achieved by MACSA is 1.61-53.82% smaller than that of other comparative approaches.},

The proposed FTV-AOD-DR-CP-ABE is computing-efficient that all the algorithms executed by vehicles including $\mathbf {Enc}$ , $\mathbf {OutKeyGen}$ and $\mathbf {FinalDec}$ are constant complexity.

An outsourced key auditing algorithm $\mathbf {TKAudit}$ is also innovated for RSU to audit the legality and freshness of outsourced key $\mathsf {TK}$ , which can protect the propagating data system against the flooding and DDoS attack with the illegal outsourced keys. Based on the traceability of the ciphertext and outsourced key, a dynamic vehicle revocation mechanism is designed in our scheme. Next the rigorous proofs of the data confidentiality, ciphertext and message traceable verifiability, $\mathsf {TK}$ auditability and revocable security are given in random oracle model (ROM).

In this paper, our primary focus lies in enhancing the QoS of V2X applications utilizing Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. To this end, we propose a novel optimization framework that creates dynamic RAN slicing covering tailored functional split selection per slice, and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) server placement within O-RAN architecture. In addition, Packet Duplication (PD) techniques are used in the proposed work to enhance V2X application reliability. First, we define the proposed problem as convex and linear, and then we use Benders a distributed technique that accelerates performance while ensuring the global optimal solution. The approach is validated through simulations, which demonstrate its capability to meet the QoS requirements of V2X applications and outperform existing methods. According to the results, there is a trade-off between the achieved throughput and the extra overhead due to replicated packets which incurs extra resources such as radio and computation to the network. For example, our approach can reach up to 42% increases in the served demand at the expense of 6% more spectrum usage when compared to the literature.},

  abstract     = {Since the traffic administration at road intersections determines the capacity bottleneck of modern transportation systems, intelligent cooperative coordination for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has shown to be an effective solution. In this paper, we try to formulate a Bi-Level CAVs intersection coordination framework, where coordinators from High and Low levels are tightly coupled. In the High-Level coordinator where vehicles from multiple roads are involved, we take various metrics including throughput, safety, fairness and comfort into consideration. Motivated by the time consuming space-time resource allocation framework, we try to give a low complexity solution by transforming the complicated original problem into a sequential linear programming one. Based on the “feasible tunnels” (FT) generated from the high-Level coordinator, we then propose a rapid gradient-based trajectory optimization strategy in the low-level planner, to effectively avoid collisions beyond high-level considerations, such as the unexpected pedestrian or bicycles. Simulation results and laboratory experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing strategies. Moreover, the most impressive advantage is that the proposed strategy can plan vehicle trajectory in milliseconds, which is promising in real-world deployments.

When the spatiotemporal graph structure turns complex, it becomes a challenge to capture the deep traffic patterns on it. In this paper, a heterogeneous modular flows graph is constructed to characterize the implied spatiotemporal correlations within the traffic data. Then, we proposed a Multilayer Graph Skip Temporal Convolution Network (MGSTCN) which extracts skip aggregated representations of node status to the modular flows graph. And an extended random walk on diverse modular graphs is used to learn the spatial dependencies.

  abstract     = {The reasonable deployment of roadside units (RSUs) in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is important for the efficient and safe operation of automated vehicles (AVs) that are mixed with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in a near future modern city. Because an RSU faces failure under the circumstances of such as electricity depletion and line fault, we consider RSU failure probability in studying the problem of RSU deployment optimization. First, we establish the formulas of connectivity considering failure probability and communication radius of RSUs. Second, assuming that the road traffic is mixed with AVs and HVs, we propose a connectivity-based stochastic user equilibrium model to describe the route choice of mixed traffic. Third, we propose a bi-level programming for optimizing RSUs deployment with the objective function as total connectivity and coverage (TCC) of the network. The lower level is the stochastic user equilibrium of mixed traffic. Fourth, we design an improved binary particle swarm optimization algorithm embedded with the method of successive average to solve the bi-level model to obtain the optimal deployment scheme of RSUs. Numerical results show that: 1) the optimal RSUs deployment scheme suggests deploying the optimal number of RSUs with appropriate communication radius at selected sites. Especially, to ensure at least 90% TCC, the optimal scheme reduces the number of deployed RSUs; and 2) failure probability significantly affects the TCC in scenarios with low modal share of AV (0.05-0.1). RSU communication range, compared with the failure probability, has greater influence on deployed RSU number to ensure at least 90% TCC.},

  abstract     = {Accidents are inevitable in the transportation systems; however, harnessing the big data generated from traffic accidents can significantly enhance the intelligence of the transportation system. Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs), owing to its flexibility and collaboration, can rapidly track the accidents and gather the acquire relevant data with reasonable deployment. Therefore, we propose an architecture utilizing multiple UAVs to track traffic accidents (targets) and collect relevant data. However, dynamic factors such as no-fly zones and reappearing targets in real-world traffic environments pose challenges to the rapid deployment of UAVs with current algorithms. In this paper, we design a model for deploying multiple UAVs, considering no-fly zones and dynamically reappearing targets. This model aims to optimize UAV deployment by minimizing both the flight distance of each UAV and the associated risk. Risk is defined as the urgency of processing accident scenes, which escalates with the elapsed time from the initial appearance of the targets to their processing. To address the joint UAV deployment problem, we first introduce an algorithm termed preprocessing and group-crossover nondominated sort genetic algorithm II (PGC-NSGAII). In PGC-NSGAII, we employ a group-based selection crossover (GBSC) method to enhance the algorithm’s search capability. This method segregates the initial population into two groups, selecting two individuals for crossover within each group. Secondly, building upon the framework of NSGAII, we incorporate a novel preprocessing component to enrich solution diversity. Thirdly, we develop a prediction method for dynamic environment parameters and a no-fly zone avoidance strategy for multi-UAV deployment. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that PGC-NSGAII surpasses other existing methods in scenarios with varying numbers of UAVs or targets. Compared with state-of-the-art optimization methods, PGC-NSGAII proves to be more efficient in UAV deployment in dynamic environment.},

One common method to improve the accuracy of sensing data in this context is truth discovery. However, the emergence of privacy leakage and data misuse has reduced users’ motivation to participate in sensing tasks. Meanwhile, existing solutions for privacy-preserving truth discovery generally suffer from low computational efficiency and frequent interactions between users and servers. Hence, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving truth discovery scheme based on secure multi-party computation. For the purpose of high efficiency and strong privacy protection, we utilize the Secret Sharing method to securely decompose data and construct a Secure Multi-party Computation protocol to compute the ground truth. In addition, the weight value generated by truth discovery is employed as a quantitative data quality indicator that dynamically adjusts the user’s rewards and constructs a data quality-driven incentive mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the high performance of our method through a detailed analysis, showing its effectiveness even in scenarios with numerous users.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms often face challenges in achieving stability and efficiency due to significant policy gradient variance and inaccurate reward function estimation in complex scenarios. This study addresses these issues in the context of multi-objective car-following control tasks with time lag in traffic oscillations. We propose an expert demonstration reinforcement learning (EDRL) approach that aims to stabilize training, accelerate learning, and enhance car-following performance. The key idea is to leverage expert demonstrations, which represent superior car-following control experiences, to improve the DRL policy. Our method involves two sequential steps. In the first step, expert demonstrations are obtained during offline pretraining by utilizing prior traffic knowledge, including car-following trajectories from an empirical database and classic car-following models. In the second step, expert demonstrations are obtained during online training, where the agent interacts with the car-following environment. The EDRL agents are trained through supervised regression on the expert demonstrations using the behavioral cloning technique. Experimental results conducted in various traffic oscillation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances training stability, learning speed, and rewards compared to baseline algorithms.},

This paper proposes a combined semantic model and reasoning, and real-time planning approach to decision making for safe and efficient airport taxiway operations. A key challenge in this work is finding ways to coordinate the real-time planning with the semantic model knowledge and reasoning capability to produce a system that has good performance, and can dynamically adapt to unexpected events.

  abstract     = {As bird’s-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is simple-to-visualize and easy-to-handle, it has been applied in autonomous driving to provide the surrounding information to downstream tasks. Inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the community as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work implemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via Vision Transformer (ViT). However, its quadratic complexity confines the relationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede the representation of fine-grained objects. In view of information absorption, when representing position-related BEV features, their weighted fusion of all view feature imposes inconducive features to disturb the fusion of conducive features. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel cross-scale hierarchical Transformer with correspondence-augmented attention for semantic segmentation inference. Specifically, we devise a hierarchical framework to refine the BEV feature representation, where the last size is only half of the final segmentation. To save the computation increase caused by this hierarchical framework, we exploit the cross-scale Transformer to learn feature relationships in a reversed-aligning way, and leverage the residual connection of BEV features to facilitate information transmission between scales. We propose correspondence-augmented attention to distinguish conducive and inconducive correspondences. It is implemented in a simple yet effective way, amplifying attention scores before the Softmax operation, so that the position-view-related and the position-view-disrelated attention scores are highlighted and suppressed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance in inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle edge computing (VEC) acts as an enhancement to provide low latency and low energy consumption for internet of vehicles (IoV) applications. Mobility of vehicles and load difference of roadside units (RSUs) are two important issues in VEC. The former results in task result reception failures owing to vehicles moving out of the coverage of their current RSUs; the latter leads to system performance degradation owing to load imbalance among the RSUs. They can be well solved by exploiting flexible RSU-RSU cooperation, which has not been fully studied by existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel resource management scheme for joint task offloading, computing resource allocation for vehicles and RSUs, vehicle-to-RSU transmit power allocation, and RSU-to-RSU transmission rate allocation. In our scheme, a task result can be transferred to the RSU where the vehicle is currently located, and a task can be further offloaded from a high-load RSU to a low-load RSU. To minimize the total task processing delay and energy consumption of all the vehicles, we design a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, where we embed an optimization subroutine to solve 2 sub-problems via numerical methods, thus reducing the training complexity of the algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted in 6 different scenarios. Compared with 4 reference schemes, our scheme can reduce the total task processing cost by 17.3%-28.4%.},

Most traditional methods extract trajectory representations based on manually defined features, while deep learning-based methods can reduce part of the human effort. We propose a Deep Spatiotemporal Trajectory Clustering (DSTC) framework to tackle the Spatiotemporal Trajectory Representation Learning towards the Clustering-friendly space (STRLC) problem. Solving the STRLC problem is not a trivial task because: (1) Defining a uniform token size for datasets with an uneven density of trajectory data is challenging. (2) Measuring the similarity between trajectories spanning time zero in the time dimension is a problem to be solved. (3) It requires first learning a vector that can represent the overall characteristics of spatiotemporal trajectories and then mapping it to a more suitable space for clustering. To tackle these challenges, we first utilize the density-based clustering method to define tokens representing the trajectory points automatically. Then, we use polar coordinates to represent the temporal dimension of trajectories. Additionally, we improve the learned trajectory representations in a clustering-oriented latent space end to end. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSTC achieves better accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, the representations learned from spatiotemporal trajectory data in the real world can be used to identify popular routes during the day.},

In real-world scenarios, we can often acquire the text descriptions of target vehicle through witness accounts, and then manually search the image queries for vehicle Re-ID, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a new fine-grained cross-modal retrieval task called text-to-image vehicle re-identification, which seeks to retrieve target vehicle images based on the given text descriptions. To bridge the significant gap between language and visual modalities, we propose a novel Multi-scale multi-view Cross-modal Alignment Network (MCANet). In particular, we incorporate view masks and multi-scale features to align image and text features in a progressive way. In addition, we design the Masked Bidirectional InfoNCE (MB-InfoNCE) loss to enhance the training stability and make the best use of negative samples. To provide an evaluation platform for text-to-image vehicle re-identification, we create a Text-to-Image Vehicle Re-Identification dataset (T2I VeRi), which contains 2465 image-text pairs from 776 vehicles with an average sentence length of 26.8 words. Extensive experiments conducted on T2I VeRi demonstrate MCANet outperforms the current state-of-art (SOTA) method by 2.2% in rank-1 accuracy.},

These systems, including vehicular networks and transportation infrastructure, are vulnerable to several security issues, which could disrupt services and potentially cause harm to the users. It is crucial to establish robust security measures to protect against evolving attacks and ensure the safe and reliable operation of ITS. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are mainly used to enhance the security of ITS. The adoption of AI-based techniques to secure ITS against new emerging threats has been limited due to a lack of realistic and recent data on these types of attacks ( $i.e.$ , zero-day attacks). In this context, we introduce a novel Edge-based Framework that uses Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain to secure ITS against new emerging threats. In particular, our proposed framework consists of (1) a novel distributed Edge-based architecture that allows multiple Edge nodes to securely collaborate while preserving their privacy; and (2) a decentralized and secure reputation system based on blockchain technology to maintain the reliability and trustworthiness of the FL process within the ITS; This system manages reputation data for individual nodes (such as vehicles), guaranteeing the integrity of the FL training process. Experiment results using the UNSW-NB15 dataset show that our proposed framework achieves high accuracy and F1 score (99%) in detecting new threats while ensuring the privacy and reliability of the whole ITS. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in securing ITS.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic forecasting is essential in urban traffic management, route planning, and flow detection. Recent advances in spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives and have neglected the interactive learning between spatial and temporal correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies fail to consider distinct spatial-temporal patterns of each node. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose an interactive learning framework composed of spatial and temporal modules for downsampling traffic data. This framework aims to capture spatial and temporal correlations by adopting a perception perspective from the global to the local level and facilitating their mutual utilization with positive feedback. In the spatial module, we design a dynamic graph convolutional network based on graph construction methods. The network is designed to leverage a traffic pattern bank considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic graph structure. The reconstructed graph structure can reveal dynamic associations between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on eight real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) based traffic signal control lbecomes a popular research topic in recent years. To alleviate the scalability issue of completely centralized reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and the non-stationarity issue of completely decentralized RL techniques on large-scale traffic networks, some literature utilizes a regional control approach where the whole network is firstly partitioned into multiple disjoint regions, followed by applying the centralized RL approach to each region. However, the existing partitioning rules either have no constraints on the topology of regions or require the same topology for all regions. Meanwhile, no existing regional control approach explores the performance of optimal joint action in an exponentially growing regional action space when intersections are controlled by 4-phase traffic signals (EW, EWL, NS, NSL). In this paper, we propose a novel RL training framework named RegionLight to tackle the above limitations. Specifically, the topology of regions is firstly constrained to a star network which comprises one center and an arbitrary number of leaves. Next, the network partitioning problem is modeled as an optimization problem to minimize the number of regions. Then, an Adaptive Branching Dueling Q-Network (ABDQ) model is proposed to decompose the regional control task into several joint signal control sub-tasks corresponding to particular intersections. Subsequently, these sub-tasks maximize the regional benefits cooperatively. Finally, the global control strategy for the whole network is obtained by concatenating the optimal joint actions of all regions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over all baselines under both real and synthetic scenarios in all evaluation metrics.},

We endeavor to adopt a neural-activation based constraint-following approach to resolve these two issues concurrently. First, an adaptive robust constraint-following control scheme is proposed. The control tracks a desired trajectory with guaranteed performance even in the presence of uncertainty. Second, a neural-activation mechanism is proposed, which generates desired trajectory effectively based on traffic pattern with sufficiently smoothness.

For optimizing task assignments in the face of unpredictable oceanic variables, a Double Layer Biological Self-organizing Map (DLBSOM) algorithm is proposed. Post assignment, the initial path, generated via DLBSOM, is refined by the end-to-end direct connection model to eliminate superfluous routes. Enhanced by the A* algorithm and Fermat’s spiral curve, our approach ensures paths align with AUV navigational constraints. Integrating real-time sonar data, our Distance-Speed Comprehensive Evaluation (DSCE) strategy, combined with the local dynamic neural network, facilitates the avoidance of unforeseen barriers, ensuring safe AUV navigation. The correction redistribution mechanism, leveraging live data and assessing AUV and target statuses, refines task assignment. We holistically evaluate environmental, cooperative, and AUV-specific constraints, with our algorithm’s efficacy validated through rigorous theoretical analysis, simulations, and field tests.},

  abstract     = {The bunching mitigation and eco-driving of buses have traditionally been treated separately in the literature and formulated in different frameworks. Although a large amount of research has been conducted aiming at providing eco-driving advisory to drivers, impacts of bus operation are not considered. Ignoring the constraints induced by buses could result in transit service irregularity. The present work aims to bridge this gap by formulating optimal control model of buses’ eco-speed and service regularity as a non-linear program. In this study, an integrated bus eco-driving speed and holding time controller is developed to obtain the optimal eco-driving advisory and operational schedule of bus fleet. A bi-level optimization model is formulated for the whole transit line with multiple signalized intersections. The proposed model is solved by a hybrid solution algorithm, which embeds the particle swarm optimization for the upper-level problem and the pseudo-spectral method for the lower-level problem. The proposed controller is tested on real-world cases with the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), and is compared to non-control, speed control, and holding control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed controller reduces the headway deviation by 78.27% and reduces total fuel consumption by 23.95%.},

The proposed approach comprises two layers: a merging sequencing layer and a trajectory optimization layer, which are coupled by a hierarchical model that utilizes sequence set and vehicle state variables. In the merging sequencing layer, a sequence set variable is introduced to simplify the sequence space and identify the optimal merging sequence using a customized tabu search algorithm. In the trajectory planning layer, we formulate a two-point-boundary optimal control model for CAV trajectory planning, incorporating a platoon formation strategy to further enhance travel efficiency. To handle outliers caused by variations in the preceding vehicle’s trajectory, we have developed a heuristic trajectory optimization algorithm to ensure the generation of feasible trajectories with predetermined optimal acceleration values as proposed. Numerical experiments conducted demonstrate the robust convergence performance and computational efficiency of the HTMO approach across different arrival flow scenarios and parameters setting, thanks to its utilization of a rolling horizon strategy. Additionally, when combined with the platoon formation strategy, the schedule produced by HTMO significantly reduces total travel time and delay, as evidenced by our findings.},

There exist two advantages of this mechanism: 1) the use of fusion signal is able to avoid the information loss between two sampling instants and reduce the redundant triggering events resulted from system disturbances and noises; 2) by requiring the error signal in the triggering condition not only lager than a lower threshold but also less than an upper threshold, the false triggering events incurred by measurement outliers also can be discarded.

In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods that strive to prevent or handle FIs. We observe that current design-time methods of preventing FIs lack completeness guarantees. Complementary solutions for on-line handling cannot suitably increase safety without seriously impacting availability of journey continuing autonomous functionality. To fill this gap, we propose the Safety Shell, a scalable multi-channel architecture and arbitration design, built upon preexisting functional safety redundant channel architectures. We compare this novel approach to existing architectures using numerical case studies. The results show that the Safety Shell architecture allows the automated vehicle to be as safe or safer compared to alternatives, while simultaneously improving availability of vehicle autonomy, thereby increasing the possible coverage of on-line functional insufficiency handling.},

Furthermore, the energy attributes of wireless signals are influenced by both antenna height and carrier frequency, yet few studies have explored their impact on human-vehicle recognition performance. Addressing this critical research gap, this study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network-based method that leverages both sub-GHz bands and variable antenna heights. Specifically, this paper focuses on two key aspects: received signal strength signal-to-noise ratio analysis and wireless sensing-based human-vehicle recognition performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimal human-vehicle recognition performance is achieved with 2.4 GHz wireless signals and an antenna height of 0.8 m, resulting in an average vehicle recognition accuracy of 95.96%. Besides, the dataset with various carrier frequencies and antenna heights has been publicly available at https://github.com/TZ-mx/mixed-RSS-dataset .},

  abstract     = {“Where was this place?”-figuring out the location of a point cloud scene is a challenge that has attracted researchers in recent years, under the name of point cloud place recognition. Driven by the drastic acceleration of 3D data and corresponding technique forces, research in this field has witnessed remarkable progress. However, the existing methods are stuck in a dilemma, the limited capability of feature representations needs more complicated architectures to enhance the performance further. This inspires us to envision whether there is a better representation for this task. To explore its possibility, in this paper, we propose a new framework, dubbed ComPoint, in the form of complex-valued representations for large-scale point cloud place recognition. Theoretically, the framework is guided by two proven propositions where one implies that richer information provided by the complex-valued representations of point clouds can benefit the performance. Practically speaking, ComPoint is designed with three modules, with each module highlighting its different characteristics. First, Com-Transform guarantees informative data delivery by mining informative complex-valued representations of initial point clouds. Next, Com-Perception perceives and digs deeper into complex-valued features via a series of simple-design convolution blocks, i.e., ComplexPointConv and ComplexPointFT. Then, Com-Fusion dynamic aggregates and interacts with the above features to obtain compact global complex-valued ones based on devised effective soft-balancing block in the VLAD network without involving extra memory footprint. Finally, our method is trained with proper strategies that are analyzed in-depth. The proposed method is witnessed to outperform the prior methods on four large-scale benchmarks quantitatively and qualitatively. It is also flexible plug-and-play in other approaches to improve their performance.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) has been recognized as one of key technologies for 5G and beyond networks due to its potential to enhance channel bandwidth and network capacity. The use of mmWave for various applications including vehicular communications has been extensively discussed. However, applying mmWave to vehicular communications faces challenges of high mobility nodes and narrow coverage along the mmWave beams. Due to high mobility in dense networks, overlapping beams can cause strong interference which leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, beam switching capability in mmWave can be utilized. Then, frequent beam switching and cell change become inevitable to manage interference, which increase computational and signalling complexity. In order to deal with the complexity in interference control, we develop a new strategy called Multi-Agent Context Learning (MACOL), which utilizes Contextual Bandit to manage interference while allocating mmWave beams to serve vehicles in the network. Our approach demonstrates that by leveraging knowledge of neighbouring beam status, the machine learning agent can identify and avoid potential interfering transmissions to other ongoing transmissions. Furthermore, we show that even under heavy traffic loads, our proposed MACOL strategy is able to maintain low interference levels at around 10%.},

As a resolution method, we suggest in this study a policy iteration (PI) method, which gives the best policy to follow so as to choose the action that determines the phase duration. These phases minimize the reward, which is the average waiting time (AWT) for all vehicles crossing the intersection. The PI has demonstrated greater efficiency compared to management systems based on fixed durations in various traffic situations. Instead of triggering the PI system for each new situation encountered and minimizing the processing time, the PI will act as a learning method for the DL program. We build a learning database by storing several situations represented by the variables: input flow, latest switching dates, output flows, traffic light states, and queue lengths, with their respective solutions returned by PI as the policy for selecting next switching dates. Due to this configuration, DL has been able to respond optimally and in real-time to different levels of throughput: low, medium, and high.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing communications between the In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) and external networks, security has become a stringent problem. In addition, the controller area network bus in IVN lacks security mechanisms by design, which is vulnerable to various attacks. Thus, it is important to detect IVN anomalies for complete vehicular security. However, current studies are constrained by either requiring labeled data or failing to accurately detect message-level anomalies without labeled data. In addition, the concept drift of existing methods has become a challenge over time. To address these problems, this paper proposes an IVN anomaly detection method based on Self-supervised Learning (IVNSL), which is capable of detecting message-level anomalies without labels. The essential idea of IVNSL is to make the message prediction model learn the distribution of normal messages in sequences using message sequences with noise. Furthermore, to accurately detect anomalies, a Message Prediction Model based on Hierarchical transformers (MPMHit) is proposed, which captures the spatial features of the message and the dependencies between messages. Meanwhile, to solve the concept drift over time, this paper proposes an online update mechanism for MPMHit based on vehicle-cloud collaboration. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on the car hacking dataset, resulting to an F1-score average and average false positive rates of IVNSL being 2.282% higher and 1.595% lower than the best baseline method. The average detection speed of each message is as fast as 0.1075 ms.},

CVs can share status information (i.e., position, velocity, etc.) between each other through vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, and DASs can provide CV drivers with motion suggestions (e.g., optimal velocity, etc.) based on the shared information. However, CV drivers may not completely follow these suggestions, and may combine them with their own driving experience and perception of traffic information which may be influenced by the interference of vehicles on the adjacent lane. Hence, this paper proposes a two-lane car-following model to simulate CVs under connected environment. The proposed model incorporates the compliance rate of CV drivers to DASs and considers the interference of vehicles on the adjacent lane to CV drivers by introducing the visual angle and its change rate of CV drivers. Linear stability analysis and numerical simulations of homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic flow are performed. Results show that the increases in the penetration rate of CVs and the compliance rate of CV drivers promote traffic stability, while the interference of vehicles on the adjacent lane reduces traffic stability.},

  abstract     = {With the unprecedented scalability issues rising in vehicular edge computing (VEC), we argue in this paper that the scalability, along with the remarkable growth of demands for offloading, should be integrated into the modelling for effective offloading decision-making strategies requested by a large number of vehicles. A two-stage game-theory model can depict offloading decision-making strategies by considering both the revenue of network operators and the cost of VEC users. However, heuristic processes of solving such models show significant limitations in terms of high computational complexity and energy consumption due to the changing VEC environment. Therefore, our objective in this study is to solve the game-theory model efficiently and achieve scalable offloading for the changing VEC environment. We first develop a two-stage game-theory model for the offloading decision-making strategy for VEC, by which an operator’s revenue, energy consumption and latency are considered. Then a neural network (NN) model is designed to learn the predicted behaviours of the established game-theory model for offloading decisions in a more efficient manner. After that, a feature-based transfer learning algorithm is proposed for scalable offloading optimization under unseen VEC environments. Experimental results show that the proposed NN can significantly improve the efficiency of solving the game theory model, and the developed transfer learning approach can effectively achieve the scalability of offloading decisions in a changing VEC environment. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed transfer learning approach is 37% higher than that of several state-of-the-art algorithms, and the runtime halves.},

  abstract     = {Recently, efforts have been made to standardize signal phase and timing (SPaT) messages. These messages contain signal phase timings of all signalized intersection approaches. This information can thus be used for efficient motion planning, resulting in more homogeneous traffic flows and uniform speed profiles. Despite efforts to provide robust predictions for semi-actuated signal control systems, predicting signal phase timings for fully-actuated controls remains challenging. This paper proposes a time series prediction framework using aggregated traffic signal and loop detector data. We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict future signal phases’ duration. The performance of a Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), a light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), a bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network (BiLSTM) and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCOV) are assessed against a naive baseline model. Results based on an empirical data set from a fully-actuated signal control system in Zurich, Switzerland, show that state of the art machine learning models outperform conventional prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the computational efficiency of the artificial neural networks is crucial for resource-constrained platforms like autonomous driving systems. To address this challenge, we proposed a Lightweight Context-aware Network (LCNet) that accelerates semantic segmentation while maintaining a favorable trade-off between inference speed and segmentation accuracy in this paper. The proposed LCNet introduces a partial-channel transformation (PCT) strategy to minimize computing latency and hardware requirements of the basic unit. Within the PCT block, a three-branch context aggregation (TCA) module expands the feature receptive fields, capturing multiscale contextual information. Additionally, a dual-attention-guided decoder (DD) recovers spatial details and enhances pixel prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LCNet model. Remarkably, a smaller model LCNet $_{3\_{}7}$ achieves 73.8% mIoU with only 0.51 million parameters, with an impressive inference speed of $\sim $ 142.5 fps and $\sim $ 9 fps using a single RTX 3090 GPU and Jetson Xavier NX, respectively, on the Cityscapes test set at $1024\times 1024$ resolution. A more accurate version of the LCNet $_{3\_{}11}$ can achieve 75.8% mIoU with 0.74 million parameters at $\sim $ 117 fps inference speed on Cityscapes at the same resolution. Much faster inference speed can be achieved at smaller image resolutions. LCNet strikes a great balance between computational efficiency and prediction capability for mobile application scenarios.

  abstract     = {Image retrieval is the eye of industrial robots, which determines the performance of machine visual search, street view search, and object grasping. Learning to hash, as a promising technique, has attracted much attention. Existing image hashing methods often directly learn hash codes by a single hash function. Despite their success, they suffer from the following limits: 1) It is difficult to perfectly preserve the intrinsic structure of the data using a single-layer hash function to generate discriminative hash codes; 2) they unconsciously ignore the main energy information of the original data, which lead to severe information loss of low-dimensional hash codes. To alleviate these issues, we propose a concise yet effective Relaxed Energy Preserving Hashing (REPH) method. Specifically, we utilize a two-layer hash function to provide more flexibility, thereby learning discriminant hash codes. The first-layer hash function projects the image data into a transition space, and the second-layer hash function narrows the semantic gap between features and hash codes. Then, we propose an energy preserving strategy to retain the energy of the original data in the transition space, thereby alleviating the energy loss of hash projecting. Moreover, the semantic reconstruction mechanism is proposed to guarantee the semantic information can be well preserved into hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed REPH on five real-world image datasets. Our source code has been released at https://github.com/sunyuan-cs/REPH_main .},

To address this, cloud computing is essential for constructing a high-performance IoV network with accurate machine learning, extracting latent value from data. Despite cloud advances, privacy concerns in data transmission and processing within IoV persist. This paper proposed a lightweight fully homomorphic encryption algorithm to address privacy. Notably, the proposed encryption algorithm can be reduced to the conjugacy search problem (CSP) under the standard model. Based on the algorithm, a model for processing encrypted data is established and implemented on a neural network for traffic data classification. The approach is compared against conventional methods in terms of complexity, efficiency, and security. Results unequivocally demonstrate comparable accuracy with original neural networks. In contrast to traditional homomorphic encryption, the proposed approach provides equivalent security with a substantial 100-fold increase in efficiency.},

A dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed, which reduces the number of triggers by tracking the intermittent transmission of error signals, thus avoiding actuator wear and excessive consumption of communication resources. The experience replay method is brought in the gradient descent method for improvement of the weight learning efficiency. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that the designed tracking control strategy ensures that all signals and weights in the closed-loop system are semi-globally bounded with Zeno-free behavior.

Analogically, human drivers are expected to have great potential in improving the performance of autonomous driving under real-world traffic. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework for evolutionary decision-making and planning by developing a hybrid augmented intelligence (HAI) method to introduce human feedback into the learning process. In the framework, a decision-making scheme based on interactive reinforcement learning (Int-RL) is first developed. Specifically, a human driver evaluates the learning level of the ego vehicle in real-time and intervenes to assist the learning of the vehicle with a conditional sampling mechanism, which encourages the vehicle to pursue human preferences and punishes the bad experience of conflicts with the human. Then, the longitudinal and lateral motion planning tasks are performed utilizing model predictive control (MPC), respectively. The multiple constraints from the vehicle’s physical limitation and driving task requirements are elaborated. Finally, a safety guarantee mechanism is proposed to ensure the safety of the HAI system. Specifically, a safe driving envelope is established, and a safe exploration/exploitation logic based on the trial-and-error on the desired decision is designed. Simulation with a high-fidelity vehicle model is conducted, and results show the proposed framework can realize an efficient, reliable, and safe evolution to pursue higher traffic efficiency of the ego vehicle in both multi-lane and congested ramp scenarios.},

Existing eco-routing solutions do not effectively consider the critical traffic signal information and rely on fuel consumption models that may not be sufficiently accurate. To address the eco-routing problem in a signalized traffic network, this paper proposes a graph convolutional network based multi-objective meta-deep Q-learning (GM2DQL) method. The problem is formulated as dynamic multi-objective Markov decision processes (MOMDP) and is tackled through deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning. We identify that graph convolutional network (GCN) is an efficient and suitable feature representation for a signalized traffic network. GM2DQL can explore the optimal routes with respect to drivers’ different preferences on saving fuel and travel time. Through GM2DQL, the agent is trained under a series of learning environments that are characterized by historical vehicle trajectories, fuel consumption data, and traffic signal data in the remote data center. The vehicle requesting eco-routing service can download the model that represents the action value function of the historical dynamic driving conditions. The model in the vehicle can quickly adapt to the most recent driving condition through online one-shot learning and predict the optimal eco-routes for the subsequent unseen driving conditions of the signalized traffic network. Extensive proof-of-concept experiments validate that GM2DQL can effectively discover optimal eco-routes. It saves up to 71% travel time and 62% fuel, compared to the conventional shortest-path routing strategy that is widely used in navigation systems.},

Among perception observations, accurately representing the set of surrounding participants poses significant challenges due to its variable size and unordered nature. These challenges result in dimension sensitivity and permutation sensitivity issues, respectively. To systematically tackle these complexities, we introduce a general framework for learning a state representation module, which can be regarded as a combination of any transformation and aggregation modules. Specifically, we employ a transformer encoder as the transformation module to attract features individually and design a novel aggregation module called Feature-wise Sorted Query (FSQ) to effectively aggregate the feature set into a state representation vector while adaptively attending to essential participant features. In FSQ, the feature-wise sort and latent query attention mechanisms can address permutation sensitivity and dimension sensitivity, respectively. Additionally, we propose an offline training paradigm to decouple state representation learning from downstream reinforcement learning tasks, enhancing stability and avoiding overfitting for particular scenarios. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and a more stable training process of our method across six varying-size set regression tasks and downstream autonomous driving tasks, particularly when leveraging the offline training paradigm.},

That is, given a set of airport nodes, a set of flight flows with known origin positions and destination positions, finding a limited number of hub edges to transfer flows and determining routing allocation mode considering customer preference such that the overall transportation profit utility is maximized. To address HURO problem, we first consider a relaxed version of HURO (HURO-R for short). We prove that HURO-R falls into the realm of maximizing a submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint, and propose an algorithm with a constant approximation ratio. Next, we design a two-level algorithm framework with a constant approximation ratio to address HURO. Besides, we consider variants of HURO, HURO-C and HURO-RU, and design approximation algorithms to address them. We conduct simulation experiments on standard dataset and field experiments to verify our theoretical findings. The results shows that our proposed algorithm can outperform other comparison algorithms by 75.28 percent.},

  abstract     = {Emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) aims to provide the right-of-way to emergency vehicles (EVs) so that they can travel to the incident location efficiently. The travel time of EVs is the most important indicator of EVP efficiency, which should be minimized by distinct methods or algorithms. However, conventional EVP methods using strobe emitters, light emitters or sirens performs poorly in high-density vehicular traffic. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can assist EVs to travel safely and efficiently in connected autonomous transport systems (CATS). Enabled by V2X, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-aided mobility-aware lane change algorithm (DRL-MLC) to enhance the efficiency of EVP. In the first stage, the EV learns to change lane based on a policy-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the shortest trajectory. In the second stage, autonomous vehicles (AVs) perform mobility-aware lane changing (MLC) to make way for the EV based on the emergency messages (EM) they received. Note that the performance of DRL-MLC strongly relies on the quality of service (QoS) of V2X, and improper network parameters of the on- board units (OBUs) that do not match with the vehicular density will significantly degrade the QoS. Therefore, in the third stage, the proposed algorithm fine-tunes specific parameters including communication range, carrier sensing range, packet rate, and contention window according to the real-time vehicular density based on a curve-fitting optimization method. Our results indicate that at medium-to-high density (e.g., 0.15 veh/m), the average speed of DRL-MLC has more than 49% average improvement than traditional lane changing models, and the ten-minute target travel time for EVs can be achieved by 95% with the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to optimize train timetables with hour-dependent origin-destination passenger demand for an oversaturated high-speed rail corridor, where some passengers may be delayed to the next hour. By introducing arc-based binary variables and assignment-based integer variables in the elaborated space-time network, we formulate the problem under consideration as an integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing passenger travel time. To transform nonlinear demand loading constraints, multiple sets of big- $M$ constraints linking different types of variables are established equivalently. While relaxing these big- $M$ constraints under the standard Lagrangian decomposition framework, a thorny issue is that the lower bounds are often not ideal due to the existence of big- $M$ values. To tackle this important and common computational challenge, a novel approach is employed to split the arc-based variables into train skip-stopping and departing variables. Furthermore, a series of valid constraints are proposed to augment the decomposed assignment subproblem. With the help of Lagrangian dual information, a dynamic programming heuristic is also developed to generate feasible solutions to the primal problem. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that compared with traditional solution approaches, the proposed approach can obtain satisfactory solutions in acceptable computation times for all the instances, in which the optimality gaps are less than 5% and the travel time is reduced by 17.28% on average.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue driving has been regarded as one of the most important factors that cause traffic accidents. This paper proposes a robust human-machine shared control strategy to improve the vehicle performance for different driver fatigue states. Firstly, the time-varying driver steering model is proposed to address the model mismatch caused by fatigue driving. And the driver fatigue evaluation system is established based on facial features to quantify driver fatigue levels. Based on the quantified fatigue levels, a novel strategy for allocating authorities of the driver and controller is developed for building the driver-vehicle interaction system. Then, to weaken the influence of parameter perturbations caused by the time-varying driver states, we design a fatigue-based shared controller through state feedback. The actuator saturation and system constraints are considered in the controller design through the robust set-invariance property to improve vehicle safety and driving comfort. The driver-in-the-loop platform is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed shared steering controller. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy can adaptively optimize the human-machine authorities according to fatigue states and comprehensively improve vehicle performance.},

This paper proposes a synchronous and precise control problem in VCTS arriving-phase operation and designs a hierarchical control approach to solve this problem. First, the control problem of VCTS arriving-phase operation is mathematically modeled, capturing the uncertain disturbances and measurement errors in train dynamics and considering input and safety constraints. Then, a two-layer control framework is designed, with the upper layer for coordinated trajectory planning and the lower layer for offset-free tracking of each train (unit) in VCTS. Specifically, in the upper layer, all units in VCTS are coordinated in an optimization problem to generate the reference trajectories that increase the synchronicity of arrival; in the lower layer, to track the reference trajectory, we propose an offset-free model predictive control (MPC) approach, which is based on an observer to handle uncertain disturbances and measurement errors. The stability of the offset-free MPC approach is proved, such that all units in VCTS can arrive at the station synchronously and precisely. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed hierarchical approach.},

Nonetheless, as the fog access points (F-APs) in crowed areas are often overloaded, the conventional single F-AP VFC may become incompetent and energy-inefficient. To tackle the issue, a novel scheme of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled multi-F-AP VFC with partial offloading is proposed in this work. However, the corresponding energy minimization turns out to be a highly non-trivial non-linear mixed-integer programming problem. To this end, the optimal power allocation is derived by exploiting monotonicity while good task splitting ratio and user association are found through successive convex approximation (SCA)-based interior-point method and game theoretic approach, respectively. Extensive simulations based on MATLAB show that, in the considered scenarios, the proposed scheme can fulfill a more balanced offloading and better exploit the available computing resources, thereby leading to an approximately 30% energy consumption reduction compared to the baselines.},

This study provides a reliable prediction model called low-rank Bayesian temporal matrix factorization (LBTMF) to address these challenges. First, on the basis of a high-dimensional spatiotemporal matrix of transfer time data, we develop a low-rank temporal-regularized matrix factorization-based imputation module to capture spatial and temporal characteristics to replace missing transfer time data. Second, to further predict the transfer time with the imputation of missing data, we propose the spatiotemporal-based Bayesian temporal matrix factorization prediction module to recover hourly and daily regular characteristics to predict the transfer time at different metro stations during various periods. Finally, the comprehensive experimental findings suggest that the LBTMF model outperforms other excellent approaches in terms of imputation efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robustness.},

To replicate this intelligence, a novel approach called MRNet based on deep convolutional networks is proposed. It employs a highly customized neural network to extract critical information from successive radar scans, ranging from low-level characteristics to high-level semantics. The feature fusion network of MRNet is also built with a Depthwise Separable Convolution-based network, which reduces parameter size and calculational usage while improving overfitting issues significantly. In the final prediction procedure, a method based on weighted-box fusion and a Scylla-IoU function is used to accelerate convergence. A marine radar image dataset, namely radar3000, was established to validate the proposed approach. In the corresponding experiments, the recall, identification accuracy, and precision of MRNet reached 0.9663, 0.9418, and 0.9267 respectively. On the other hand, the parameter size and calculational consumption were controlled to only 34.41M and 21.55G respectively. Compared with the commonly-used fractal algorithms and the YOLO series, the MRNet can be described as significantly superior in the application of recognizing ships from marine radar blips, especially in crowded scenarios, which is very similar to human eyes, and can be of great use to navigation and coastal surveillance.},

Previous studies using automotive radar sensors have proposed methods to roughly estimate the moving direction of vehicles, such as left, straight, or right. This study proposes methods to estimate not only the specific moving direction but also the approximate size of the vehicle. First, we use the high-resolution frequency-modulated continuous wave radar to acquire point cloud data for vehicles moving at various angles. In the point cloud data, radar signals are strongly reflected from the side of the vehicle and detected as a line segment. The proposed moving direction and size estimation method is based on line segment extracted from the Hough transform (HT). To extract the line segment from the point cloud data, the Hough transform is used. Using the extracted line segment, methods for estimating the moving direction and size of the vehicle are proposed. And then, the quick hull algorithm is used to estimate the center point of the vehicle to match the position of the target in the coordinate system. Finally, the direction, width, and length of the vehicle estimated from the proposed methods show average errors of 1.94°, 4.32%, and 6.32%, respectively. In addition, when compared to the conventional principal component analysis (PCA)-based method, our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of estimation accuracy. Moreover, we have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method even in scenarios with multiple vehicles and in noisy road environments.},

However, challenges often arise in accurately recognizing activity patterns, predicting activity patterns, and ensuring the temporal transferability of these prediction models. This paper presents a novel approach that combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to recognize and predict activity patterns of urban residents using 10-year interval Household Travel Survey data. The proposed method based on NLP to effectively transforms activity sequence information, identifies more categories and provides clearer and more explanatory activity pattern information compared to using only K-Means++ for clustering. Furthermore, the study develops a correlation model between activity patterns and socio-demographic characteristics of traveler by combining various machine learning models and identifies the optimal model with positive predictive performance for both weekdays and weekends. Lastly, the temporal transferability of the model is examined by comparing activity pattern characteristics at 10-year intervals and using machine learning interpretability methods to analyze model performance, relative importance of explanatory variables, and partial dependence plots (PDPs). The results show that the proposed model possesses temporal transferability, indicating its potential for predicting refined activity demand of the population in future years. These findings enhance our understanding of urban residents’ travel and activity demand, and have potential implications for urban planning, transportation management, and policy-making.},

  abstract     = {Considering the high complexity of actual railway line conditions, this paper proposes a two-level energy-efficient timetable optimization method empowered by time-energy Pareto solution to reduce energy consumption while maintaining the existing infrastructure unchanged. At the train-level, an efficient equivalence method for actual line conditions, including varying slopes, curves, and tunnels is proposed to formulate the train driving process as a multi-objective optimization model to balance the time cost and energy consumption. An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (INSGA-II) enhanced by differential evolution (DE) and a new crowding distance (NCD) operator is further proposed to access the time-energy Pareto solution of the potential speed profile for a single train by comparing different control strategies. At the timetable-level, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is designed with the computed train-level Pareto solution to optimize the energy-efficient timetable by restricting the headway between trains, in which a novel operation time-based branch-and-bound (BBOT) method is proposed to enable quick search of optimal control strategy and thus allows for accurate output of the optimal timetable while retaining real simulation results. A case study on the actual operation data of the Beijing-Jinan section of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway shows that the optimized timetable can save up to 18.69% of energy when the train is on time. In cases of train delays, the total savings under 8-min, 9-min, and 14-min delay scenarios are 4.69%, 9.93%, and 8.05%, respectively compared to the method using time-oriented strategies, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed two-level optimization formulation.},

However, the combination of various influencing factors affects airport delay prediction strongly, which would bring severe challenges in prediction. This paper introduces the sequence-to-sequence network and proposes a multi-step regression prediction method for the airport delay (DA-BILSTM) to accurately predict the airport delay. Rather than only considering a single kind of airport delay influencing factors, we design an attention fusion network for learning the sequence and condition correlation features adaptively. Moreover, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize DA-BILSTM’s hyperparameters. The method is applied individually to two datasets for predicting the airport’s delays. The experiment results show that the prediction performance of DA-BILSTM is better than many state-of-the-art methods including the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit(GRU), CNN-BILSTM, and TS-LSTM. When using DA-BILSTM in the two datasets, the average MAE of airport delay prediction in the next 5 hours is about 10 minutes, and the average RMSE is 20 minutes.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNNs) to build powerful vision perception systems, which provide a theoretical foundation for automated vehicle control. Due to the inherent vulnerability of DNNs, many research works have implemented white-box attacks against automotive vision perception systems in the physical world. However, successful black-box attacks (especially decision-based) in the physical world are rarely mentioned because it is difficult to implement a physical-world adversarial attack without internal knowledge about the vision perception systems. In this paper, we propose PRAD, an end-to-end framework that transfers the existing decision-based black-box adversarial attack algorithms (as the backbone of the framework) targeting the digital domain to the physical world for the first time. Specifically, $T(\cdot)$ is first introduced to simulate the real environment changes, e.g., angle, distance, slight shaking, illumination, etc. Then, and crucially, PRAD bridges the non-differentiable black-box attack and the differentiable $T(\cdot)$ by the $L_{1}$ loss function. We use the traffic sign recognition system in the vision perception system as an object to conduct comprehensive experiments, including different environmental conditions, black-box attack backbones, models, and datasets. The results demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples in the decision-based black-box setting can fool the commercial traffic sign recognition system into outputting designated misclassifications with high success rates and strong robustness in the physical world (average 90% in target attacks and nearly 100% in non-target attacks), which outperforms the state-of-the-art homogeneous attack methods.},

  abstract     = {The visual behavior before and during a lane change maneuver is critical to driving safety. This paper aims to link the mismatched driver visual attention during lane changes with crash risk. A novel Embedding Kernel (EK) algorithm is proposed to identify the critical moment at which the driver’s eye-glance pattern differs significantly between safety-critical events (SCEs) and normal driving maneuvers. The embedding approach translates the eye-glance patterns into embedding representations containing information on the timing and location of eye glances. A subsequent two-sample kernel test is applied to identify the safety-critical moment. The proposed EK algorithm was implemented on lane change events from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study. The analysis revealed that the duration and number of safety-critical moments could vary depending on factors such as the driver’s age, the time of day, traffic conditions, driving speed, and lane change direction. Young drivers’ two critical moments happen (3.2 s to 3.4 s and 4.4 s to 4.6 s from the beginning of events, i.e. 5 s before lane change initiation) later than middle-aged drivers one critical moment (0.8 s to 1.2 s). The study shows that mismatched driver visual attention differs significantly between SCEs and normal driving. This finding is essential for deploying safety countermeasures such as the driver monitoring system and the advanced driver assistance system.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies spatiotemporal pricing and fleet management for autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems while taking elastic demand into account. We consider a platform that offers ride-hailing services using a fleet of autonomous vehicles and makes pricing, rebalancing, and fleet sizing decisions in response to demand fluctuations. A network flow model is developed to characterize the evolution of system states over space and time, which captures the vehicle-passenger matching process and demand elasticity with respect to price and waiting time. The platform’s objective of maximizing profit is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem, which is highly nonconvex due to the nonlinear demand model and complex supply-demand interdependence. To address this challenge, an integrated decomposition and dynamic programming approach is proposed, where we first relax the problem through a change of variable, then separate the relaxed problem into a few small-scale subproblems via dual decomposition, and finally solve each subproblem using dynamic programming. Despite the nonconvexity, our approach establishes a theoretical upper bound to evaluate the solution optimality. The proposed model and methodology are validated in numerical studies for Manhattan. We find that compared to the benchmark case, the proposed upper bound is significantly tighter. We also find that compared to pricing alone, joint pricing and fleet rebalancing can only offer a minor profit improvement when demand can be accurately predicted. However, during unanticipated demand surges, joint pricing and rebalancing can lead to substantially improved profits, and the impacts of demand shocks, despite being more widespread, can dissipate faster.},

In this paper, we propose the Intersection to Vector model, named Intersec2vec, to achieve an accurate, efficient, and low-dimensional representation of each intersection in the large-scale intersection network. It introduces structural and temporal modules with attention mechanisms to specifically represent the evolution of intersection features in the spatiotemporal dimension, ensuring that intersections with stronger correlations have a higher probability of co-occurrence. Furthermore, our proposed Intersec2vec model is integrated into a traffic signal control method based on deep reinforcement learning by supporting more precise sub-area divisions, named Intersec2vec-TSC. For each sub-area, Intersec2vec-TSC adopts a hierarchical structure to design agents, where the upper agent determines the common cycle length based on the overall states of the sub-area, and lower agents jointly train a centralized evaluation network to achieve optimization of green time for each intersection. We conduct the experiment on 108 signalized intersections using real online car-hailing data, and the experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the stability of sub-area division and reduces the waiting time of cars during peak hours compared with other comparison methods.},

However, current perception methods often struggle to effectively detect intelligent vehicles when obstacles block their field of view. Collaborative perception, although attracting considerable attention, presents challenges in terms of privacy and data trust. In this study, we present a novel design for Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle (EIV), a cost-effective and comprehensive perception system for intelligent vehicles. We discovered that during the process of memory caching raw sensing data in the intelligent vehicle’s system-on-chip (SOC), continuous fluctuating currents inside the memory result in the emission of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). As a result, intelligent vehicles actively expose themselves on the electromagnetic spectrum. EIV is based on a set of specially designed antenna arrays that scan the spectrum and utilize a joint Kalman filtering algorithm to enhance EMR signals. The micro-Doppler signature of each EMR signal is then analyzed to identify signals from intelligent vehicles and construct a vehicle database. A multi-antenna joint estimation algorithm is also designed to further estimate the position, distance, and direction of the target vehicle. Our experiments demonstrate that EIV offers advantages in terms of timeliness, robustness, and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Since the past decade, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been extensively adopted for traffic object recognition tasks. Existing methodologies often assume LiDAR data are acquired under normal weather conditions. Nevertheless, many researchers have observed that the LiDAR data captured under inclement weather are often contaminated with noises such as fog and snow, which may deteriorate the data quality and lead to false detections in traffic object recognition. This paper proposes a neighborhood-based noise removal methodology to eliminate snow noises from LiDAR data. It identifies a point of interest from a specific laser channel as an outlier, if the number of neighboring points in the same channel within a dynamic search radius is fewer than a threshold. Unlike existing methods that filter the entire LiDAR point cloud, the proposed methodology processes LiDAR data channel-by-channel, which helps reduce the data dimensionality and decouple the snow effects along the vertical axis of the 3D point cloud, leading to more effective and efficient outlier detection. Furthermore, by dynamically changing the search radius based on the point-to-sensor distance rather than adopting a fixed search radius, the proposed methodology can account for the reduced point density at far distances caused by the non-uniformity of LiDAR data. In the experimental study, the proposed methodology is compared against some existing LiDAR de-noising approaches, including two state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy (i.e., F1 score = 98.3%) and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue driving is a significant cause of road traffic accidents and associated casualties. Automatic assessment of driver drowsiness by monitoring electroencephalography (EEG) signals offer a more objective way to improve driving safety. However, most existing measures are based on multi-channel EEG signals, which are more difficult to apply in practical scenarios as it usually lacks better portability and comfort. In addition, due to the relatively parsimonious and non-stationary characteristics, it is still challenging to effectively accomplish drowsiness recognition by exploiting single-channel EEG signals alone. To this end, we propose a novel temporal-frequential attentional convolutional neural network (TFAC-Net) to take full advantage of spectral-temporal features for single-channel EEG driver drowsiness recognition. Specifically, to capture the potentially valuable information contained in single-channel EEG, the continuous wavelet transform is first employed to generate a corresponding spectral-temporal representation. Then, the temporal-frequential attention mechanism is adopted to reveal critical time-frequency regions in terms of the driver’s mental state. Finally, an adaptive feature fusion module is considered to recalibrate and integrate the most relevant feature channels for final prediction. Extensive experimental results on a widely used public EEG driving dataset demonstrate that the TFAC-Net approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods, and could discover some discriminative temporal-frequential regions. Moreover, this study also sheds light on the development of portable EEG devices and practical driver drowsiness recognition.},

We constructed a target detection model YOLOv7-RDD modified You Only Look Once version 7 for Road Detection by modifying the YOLOv7 framework to reduce the complexity of the model while improving the detection precision of multiple types of pavement distress. The lightweight efficient aggregation network structure using distributed shift convolution (EDC), the improved spatial feature pyramid structure (SPPCSPD) proposed, and the similarity-based attention mechanism (SimAM) were integrated into our model. We created a dataset called CQURDD containing 12 pavement distress types for urban roads. The SPPCSPD structure has been proven to reduce the running time by nearly 54% compared to the spatial pyramid pooling structure in YOLOv7 while losing little precision. The introduced SimAM module and SIoU (Smooth Intersection Over Union) loss function have improved the model precision, and the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) can help reduce redundant detection boxes. A comparative study was carried out based on the CQURDD dataset, YOLOv7-RDD achieved the best precision and efficiency with mAP@0.5 reaching 89.5% and FPS reaching 145. Except for linear cracks, the AP values for the other types of distress detection are all greater than 85%.

Firstly, the fast HSI (FHSI) is proposed to decompose the light and color information of the RGB image, whose hue is defined as the cosine value of the included angle, instead of the included angle in HSI. The saturation of FHSI is defined as the ratio of the projection vector length and the side length of the projection equilateral triangle, and a saturation correction model is further proposed to correct color distortion of the low-light image by adjusting the saturation of FHSI. FHSI is more concise and faster than HSI. Secondly, a novel QRCP enhancement (QRCPE) model is proposed to improve the light of the low-light image by enhancing the intensity of FHSI, which first strengthens diagonal elements of QRCP, and followed by controlling the normalization of strengthened diagonal elements of QRCP. Finally, the FHSI-QRCPE based RGB image can be obtained by transforming the processed FHSI to RGB. The experimental results on NTM, SICE, ExDark, and BDD 100K databases, indicate that the proposed FHSI-QRCPE is fast and efficient to tackle low-light image enhancement.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle-road cooperative perception needs high accuracy and real-time automatic background filtering to separate background objects from foreground objects in complex traffic scenes. Reducing the influence of foreground objects to improve accuracy, and introducing a new framework to improve real-time performance are two main challenges in automatic background filtering. This paper proposes an Automatic Background Filtering method with innovative Frame Selection and Background Matrix Extraction modules (ABF-FSBME) to address these challenges. Firstly, a new space division method with equal hitting probability is proposed to divide the 3D point cloud formed by roadside Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), which can reduce the influence of slight LiDAR vibrations. Secondly, the terminal-edge-cloud framework is introduced to balance delay-constrained tasks and computation-intensive tasks in automatic background filtering. Thirdly, a variance-based frame selection strategy with a sliding window mechanism is proposed to select candidate frames with fewer foreground objects. This strategy can reduce the influence of foreground objects in a coarse-grained way. Meanwhile, a new background matrix extraction method is proposed to construct the background matrix. This method can further reduce the influence of foreground objects in a fine-grained way. Finally, based on the extracted background matrix from a cloud server, the edge server can filter the raw frame in real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed ABF-FSBME method has better accuracy than other methods in error rate and integrity rate. Besides, the proposed ABF-FSBME can complete fame filtering within 10ms, and has almost no network delay, so it can satisfy the real-time requirement.},

This decentralized approach is achieved by minimizing a novel cost function that leverages the advantages of the active contour model from image processing. Additionally, future trajectories are predicted by approximating the minima of the novel cost function using calculus of variation, which enables proactive actions and defines the initial conditions for PSO.

To address these issues, a video-based driver drowsiness detection method according to the key facial features including facial landmarks and local facial areas (VBFLLFA) is proposed in this paper. In order to fully utilize the key facial features related to drowsiness and exclude the interference of redundant information, the head movement information is obtained through facial landmark analysis and the movement information of eyes and mouth is acquired from the local facial areas. And the spatial filtering based on the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is introduced to improve the discrimination of different classes of samples. To adequately extract the temporal and spatial features, a two-branch multi-head attention (TB-MHA) module is designed in this paper. Furthermore, the center loss with center vector distance penalty is introduced to further improve the discrimination of different classes of samples in the feature space.

  abstract     = {For autonomous driving, it is important to develop safe and efficient decision algorithms to handle multi-vehicle interactions. Game theory is suitable to manage the interactive driving decision modelling, however, common approaches of multi-player game formulation is computationally complex for dynamic and intense interactions. The main contributions of this work are two-fold: 1) a global sorting-local gaming framework, namely GLOSO-LOGA, is proposed to solve the intersection interaction problem for autonomous driving, which can comprehensively consider the advantages of multi-vehicle collaboration and single-vehicle intelligence approaches; 2) an interaction disturbance function is used to quantify the impact of indirect interactions on ego vehicle. To validate the algorithm performances, corner case simulations and human-in-the-loop simulator experiments are carried out, in which a four-armed intersection scenario with various urgent and challenging interaction conditions is used. Compared to a traditional approach that decomposes a multi-vehicle game into multiple two-vehicle games, the proposed algorithm can improve both safety and traffic efficiency in intensively interactive driving scenarios.},

However, collecting labels/annotations while switching multiple transport modes into different journeys is tedious. Also, transport type identification working across cities and countries is a prime need. This paper proposes a method for generalizable journey mode detection without using any annotations during training exploiting unsupervised representation learning. Our method uses commonalities and diversities across various user’s different journeys, to identify user-specific journey segments from either the same or different city/country. This method is also sensitive to preserve privacy, as it does not use GPS information. We propose a multistage unsupervised learning mechanism to form clusters on the learned latent representation using a choice of best distance measure. We also propose an Invariant Auto-Encoded Compact Sequence, which is a learned compact representation encompassing the common encoded latent feature representation across diverse users and cities. We prove with an exhaustive experimental analysis, that our method, is generalizable across varying users and cities using IMU-Accelerometer sensors. We use real-life publicly available transportation datasets captured from two different cities of different countries - Sussex (United Kingdom) and Bologna (Italy), and also in-house data collected from three Indian cities.},

Conventional crack segmentation models usually focus on optimizing the cross-entropy-based objective function and overlook the optimization of the subsequent binarization process. In this paper, we redefine the crack segmentation problem as a joint optimization problem, which requires optimizing the binarization process in addition to the objective function of the segmentation model. Simultaneously optimizing both processes demonstrates significant improvements in the model’s segmentation performance. To optimize the binarization process, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Thresholding Module (ADTM), which reuses the spatial features in the segmentation network to perform an additional regression task to obtain the optimal threshold for each crack image. ADTM is a pluggable component for practical deployment, consuming only a small amount of additional memory during deployment while significantly improving inference accuracy. Experimental results using four different datasets with diverse sources and distributions for crack semantic and instance segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of ADTM in improving segmentation performance. While ADTM has only been evaluated on cracked data, our findings suggest its potential to improve the performance of other binary classification image segmentation problems.},

  abstract     = {The integrated ride-sourcing mode, developed by third-party integrators, is a feasible solution to market fragmentation because it integrates travel demand and vehicle supply. However, intense competition between platforms reduces the efficiency of the dispatching process. To tackle this issue, a two-stage dispatching framework is proposed, utilizing a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to model the dispatching problem as a mixed cooperative-competitive reinforcement learning task. Within this framework, the Multi-Graph Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MGHMHA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to determine the generalized values of driver-passenger pairs. A combinatorial optimization model is then formulated to identify the dispatching scheme that maximizes these values. Furthermore, the MGHMHA-DDPG algorithm incorporates a multi-graph convolutional module, a hierarchical multi-head attention module, and a gated recurrent module to model the global supply-demand distribution, the cooperation potential of vehicles, and the hidden features of the temporal dimension, respectively. Experiments using Beijing-based data demonstrate that the MGHMHA-DDPG algorithm outperforms benchmark methods in terms of market revenues and order response rates. This indicates that the MGHMHA-DDPG algorithm effectively mitigates dispatching conflicts between platforms and enhances overall market efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We propose a simple and novel method to actively resolve the temporary congestion caused by a freeway mainline vehicle’s facilitating maneuver of creating a gap for on-ramp merging vehicles, under under-critical mainline conditions. We first present an analytical finding derived from the kinematic wave model with a triangular fundamental diagram. That is, when the prevailing mainline traffic is under-critical, the total delay of the mainline vehicles affected by the gap creation does not depend on the choice of speed by which the gap is created, namely the facilitating speed. This is because the recovery wave speed is constantly equal to the characteristic wave speed of the congestion regime, $-w$ . In light of this observation, to improve mainline traffic efficiency, we propose the strategy of active congestion resolving, which features a recovery wave of a speed higher than $-w$ . Characterizing CAVs’ car-following behaviors by Newell’s simplified car-following model, we analytically show that such a recovery wave can be achieved by properly modifying the values of the affected CAVs’ car-following characteristic parameters and adopting the modified values in a proper way during congestion resolving. Then, in the presence of this active congestion resolving strategy, an optimization program is formulated to seek an optimal facilitating speed that can balance between traffic efficiency and speed variation. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In order to overcome the practical problem of spectrum scarcity, ultra-low latency, large-scale connectivity in ITS, we propose a cooperative multiple-input single output non-orthogonal multiple access (MISO-NOMA) for ITS with intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). An user fairness optimization problem is formulated to maximize the fairness rate of the vehicles, subject to the quality of service requirements of the vehicles and the successive interference cancellation. The optimization problem involves the transmit beamformers design, the IRS reflection matrix design, and the power splitting ratio of the SWIPT, which lead to the problem is difficult to solve. For solving the challenging problem, an iterative successive convex approximation and semi-definite relaxation based algorithm is proposed. Explicitly, we firstly adopt the method of reconstructing epigraph for simplification due to the objective function is non-convex, and then the original problem is decomposed into two sub-problems that are easy to solve. Finally, Experimental results illustrate that the user fairness of the proposed cooperative MISO-NOMA for ITS with IRS and SWIPT is better than that of both the IRS-NOMA for ITS without SWIPT and the IRS-OMA for ITS.},

This method may be inaccurate for in-service pavement thickness estimation with dielectric constant variation through the depth, which could be addressed using the extended common mid-point method (XCMP) with air-coupled GPR antennas. However, the factors affecting the XCMP method on thickness prediction accuracy haven’t been studied. Manual acquisition of key factors is required, which hinders its real-time applications. This study investigates the affecting factors and develops a modified XCMP method to allow automatic thickness prediction of in-service asphalt pavement with non-uniform dielectric properties through depth. A sensitivity analysis was performed, necessitating the accurate estimation of time of flights (TOFs) from antenna pairs. A modified XCMP method based on edge detection was proposed to allow real-time TOFs estimation, then dielectric constant and thickness predictions. Field tests using a multi-channel GPR system were performed for validation. Both the surface reflection and XCMP setups were conducted. Results show that the modified XCMP method is recommended with a mean prediction error of 1.86%, which is more accurate than the surface reflection method (5.73%).},

To optimally achieve the combined operation of BCSSs, this paper proposes a hybrid swapped battery charging and logistics dispatch model in the continuous-time domain. Specifically, the battery charging system will arrange the optimal battery charging strategy by a rectangle packing algorithm. Furthermore, the logistics system will set up a transportation dispatch model for the battery charging system to deliver the charged batteries from the battery charging system to the battery swapping system and then retrieve them. The combined model is involved in the demand side response considering the price. Simulation studies for different cases verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Secondly, to prevent the privacy of the transmitted data of vehicles from being inferred by untrusted cloud servers or external attackers, an affine masking-based privacy strategy is designed. Specifically, the vehicle first uploads the encrypted state data to the cloud with the affine masking method. Then the cloud returns the control input by solving the newly constructed optimization problem, which is different but equivalent to the original problem. Then the vehicle calculates the real control input by the inverse affine masking mechanism. Simulation examples show that the proposed PPDC scheme can guarantee collision avoidance and the privacy protection of transmitted data of CAVs, improve traffic efficiency as well as fuel economy, and avoid extensive computation burden.},

The key problems are that the occlusion of point clouds by dynamic objects in the scene affects the point cloud structure, a single perceptual field of the network cannot adequately extract point cloud features, and the correlation between features is not fully utilized. To overcome this, we propose a novel network called CapsLoc3D. We first use the static point cloud generation module to remove the occlusion effects of dynamic objects, and then obtain the point cloud descriptors by processing with the CapsLoc3D network which contains the point spatial transformation module, multi-scale feature fusion module, Capsnet module and a GeM Pooling layer.

  abstract     = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most wide-used bus system in Intra-Vehicle Networks(IVN). However, the nature of broadcast communication and the lack of security mechanisms make the CAN bus extremely fragile against malicious attacks. Although there are works protecting IVN, most of them are not feasible when applied to real vehicles because they do not consider the IVN node capability. In this paper, we propose a security framework for the CAN bus, covering ECU entity identity management and authentication, symmetric key generation and update, intra-domain, cross-domain secure transmission, and sensitivity-based security classification methods. We formally verify our protocols using the up-to-date tool Tamarin and simulate real attacks in a simulation environment and the results show that the proposed protocol can resist these attacks. By the use of speck encryption and the Chaskey MAC algorithm in our schemes, the analysis results show that the increased time of a frame for a single ECU in our proposed intra-domain scheme is $2.09 ms$ to $2.78 ms$ on Arduino Mega, and $121.65 \mu s$ to $152.15 \mu s$ on Arduino DUE, which takes up 6.08% to 7.61% of a 10ms cyclic time frame. And in the cross-domain scheme is $2.55 ms$ to $3.24 ms$ on Arduino Mega, and $134.30 \mu s$ to $164.80 \mu s$ on Arduino DUE, which takes up 6.72% to 8.24% of a 10ms frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an IVN cross-domain secure transmission protocol has been proposed without changing the IVN network topology or the CAN protocol.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the design of models for performing the trajectory prediction task, one of the critical tasks in autonomous driving, has received great attention from researchers. However, accurately predicting future locations is challenging due to the difficulty of learning accurate intentions and modeling multimodality. Historical paths at a certain location can help predict the future trajectory of an agent currently located in that position and address these limitations. In this work, we propose a goal-based local behavior guided model, Goal-LBP, using such information (referred to as local behavior data) to generate potential goals and guide the prediction of trajectories conditioned on such goals. Goal-LBP uses Transformer encoders to extract homogeneous features and attention mechanism to represent the heterogeneous interactions and subsequently uses an encoder-decoder Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to generate predictions. We evaluate our Goal-LBP using two large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, namely nuScenes and Argoverse. Our results show that compared to several SOTA models, Goal-LBP achieves the best ADE/FDE performance and it ranked #2 on the leaderboard of the nuScenes trajectory benchmark in June 2023. In addition, we also demonstrate that our local behavior estimator block can be easily added to two existing SOTA methods, namely AgentFormer and LaPred. Adding this LBE block improves the original AgentFormer and LaPred performance by at least 10%.},

  abstract     = {Model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been developed extensively as two independent techniques for traffic management. Although the features of MPC and DRL complement each other very well, few of the current studies consider combining these two methods for application in the field of freeway traffic control. This paper proposes a novel framework for integrating MPC and DRL methods for freeway traffic control that is different from existing MPC-(D)RL methods. Specifically, the proposed framework adopts a hierarchical structure, where a high-level efficient MPC component works at a low frequency to provide a baseline control input, while the DRL component works at a high frequency to modify online the output generated by MPC. The control framework, therefore, needs only limited online computational resources and is able to handle uncertainties and external disturbances after proper learning with enough training data. The proposed framework is implemented on a benchmark freeway network in order to coordinate ramp metering and variable speed limits, and the performance is compared with standard MPC and DRL approaches. The simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms standalone MPC and DRL methods in terms of total time spent (TTS) and constraint satisfaction, despite model uncertainties and external disturbances.},

It will enable them to exchange planned trajectories and actively cooperate via Maneuver Coordination Messages (MCMs). Our study presented in this paper analyzes the capacity and performance of an ITS-G5 communication channel employed to exchange these messages, varying a set of different parameters. One of Europe’s most frequented highway intersections was modeled for the simulations, including realistic traffic patterns. Generic channel-centric metrics show that substantial channel loads can be caused, both by existing messages and by the MCM, such that multiple channels are required to host all services - depending on parameterization. New metrics specific to Maneuver Coordination, such as the Manuver Coordination Time, show a sufficient service performance even in a resource-constraint environment. However, it degrades quickly with increasing channel loads. The study provides insights on what to expect from Maneuver Coordination for researchers, engineers and regulators on both ends of the communication stack.},

Then, a braking force distribution controller is built to improve vehicle endurance mileage. Subsequently, after analyzing vibration transfer characteristics of the IWSRM-suspension integrated system, an optimized linear quadratic regulator controller for active suspension system is built to improve vehicle ride comfort, and the corresponding weight matrices of the controller are optimized by genetic algorithm. Further, based on the proposed fuzzy-PI-PWM control method, a coordination controller is designed to improve vehicle comprehensive performance.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of 5G and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies, vehicles have evolved from mere transportation devices to mobile living spaces for humans. Thus, the complexity of data processing is growing along with the increasing of vehicle applications, which makes relying solely on on-board processing capabilities insufficient. Traditional Roadside Units (RSUs)-based edge computing has limitations such as high deployment cost and finite coverage. To address those issues, we construct an Air-Ground Vehicular Cooperative Computing Network (AVC $^{ {2}}\text{N}$ ) that introduces Cooperative Vehicles (CVs) to reduce deployment cost while incorporating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to expand communication coverage. We aim to balance offloading efficiency and environmental sustainability by proposing a system cost minimization problem with weighted sum of delay and energy consumption. However, it faces new challenges such as the lack of Global State Information (GSI), and the Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) queue delay constraints, rendering traditional methods inadequate. To address the coupling between immediate decision and long-term queuing constraints, we employ Lyapunov optimization to partition the initial problem into two distinct sub-problems. The first focuses on optimizing the system transmission cost, which is tackled using a collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we design an algorithm based on Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), which effectively addresses GSI uncertainty and ensures URLLC awareness. The second sub-problem addresses server-side computing resource optimization, and we propose a greedy algorithm to tackle it. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating notable achievement in terms of learning convergence speed, overall system cost, queue delay, and queue backlog.},

  abstract     = {Freeway on-ramps are typical bottlenecks in the freeway network due to the frequent disturbances caused by their associated merging, weaving, and lane-changing behaviors. With real-time communication and precise motion control, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide an opportunity to substantially enhance the traffic operational performance of on-ramp bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose an upper-level control strategy to coordinate the two traffic streams at on-ramp merging through proactive gap creation and platoon formation. The coordination consists of three components: 1) mainline vehicles proactively decelerate to create large merging gaps; 2) ramp vehicles form platoons before entering the main road; 3) the gaps created on the main road and the platoons formed on the ramp are coordinated with each other in terms of size, speed, and arrival time. The coordination is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, incorporating both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. The model uses traffic state parameters as inputs and determines the optimal coordination plan adaptive to real-time traffic conditions. The benefits of the proposed coordination are demonstrated through an illustrative case study. Results show that the coordination is compatible with real-world implementation and can substantially improve the overall efficiency of on-ramp merging, especially under high traffic volume conditions, where recurrent traffic congestion is prevented, and merging throughput increased.},

With the advantages of high flexibility and efficiency, this paper proposes to use UAVs as temporary and mobile relays for disaster data collection. However, different from many existing data collection scenarios in industrial sectors, the disaster data value varies with UAV arrival time and service time in terms of their importance for disaster response, which makes the scheduling of UAVs challenging. To address such a problem, this paper proposes an attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method for multi-UAV scheduling considering time-varying data value. Specifically, the problem is modeled as a specific team orienteering problem with time-varying value. Then the relationships between UAV route selection and service time at each node are analyzed, based on which the computing efficiency for solution algorithms can be improved. After that, an attention-based DRL method is developed, with a calibrated attention model and decoding method. Finally, systematic computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which demonstrates its superiority over popular methods in UAV scheduling, especially for large-scale and complex scenarios.},

A trajectory prediction network with an enhanced Graph Transformer (TP-EGT) is proposed to forecast the future trajectories of traffic-agents. A collision-aware Graph Transformer is introduced to capture the complex social interactions between traffic-agents. Following that, an additional interaction prediction task that could predict the interaction probabilities between agents is proposed to mitigate the over-smoothing issue of the Graph Transformer via a multi-task learning strategy. Afterward, the trajectory prediction performance is improved with additional interaction probabilities, which are beneficial for the decision-making and planning modules of autonomous vehicles. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of TP-EGT on the ETH/UCY and ApolloScape databases demonstrate that the trajectory prediction accuracy of TP-EGT is comparable to the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and the predicted interaction probabilities can help autonomous vehicles comprehend the complex traffic scenes.},

  abstract     = {With the capability of communicating with surrounding vehicles and infrastructures, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can safely drive closer with reduced headway, thereby potentially improving traffic efficiency. However, their superiority is compromised in the mixed traffic environment because of the interruption of human-driving vehicles (HDVs). In this circumstance, researchers proposed to physically separate CAVs and HDVs by deploying CAV-dedicated lanes (CAV-DLs). Nevertheless, the CAV-DLs may be underutilized, especially in low CAV penetration rate (PR) cases which may even reduce traffic efficiency. To solve this problem, two novel strategies were proposed in our study to better manage the CAV-DLs and magnify the benefit of CAVs: The first one is to dynamically allocate the right-of-way for CAV-DLs based on the predicted CAV-DLs’ effective utilization rate so that the HDVs can be allowed to use the dedicated lanes when they are not adequately occupied. The second strategy is motivated by the economic instrument, which allows HDVs to use the CAV-DLs by paying a toll. The toll is determined by the travel time difference between CAV-DL and general lane (GL), and these tolls can be utilized as subsidies to stimulate drivers to purchase CAVs for promoting their adoption. The two strategies were evaluated using the case study designed based on the network of Edmonton downtown area in Canada, and the results demonstrated that both methods can significantly reduce travel time. Besides, the two strategies were compared comprehensively in terms of their effectiveness and policy enforceability, which can provide some guidance for both traffic policymakers and practitioners.},

The hierarchical nature of such large-scale and distributed systems brings obvious challenges in creating a scalable and sustainable computing environment, and hence the development and application of edge intelligence become critical. Federated learning (FL), as an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, aims to offer secure knowledge sharing and effective learning across multiple devices. However, conventional FL may fall into trouble when facing large-scale and network-agnostic systems with fast moving devices and changing network attributes. In this study, we propose an Adaptive Segmentation enhanced Asynchronous Federated Learning (AS-AFL) model, aiming to improve the learning efficiency and reliability in sustainable ITS via a decentralized fashion. Specifically, a meta-learning based adaptive segmentation scheme is designed to automatically separate the client nodes (e.g., vehicles) into multiple edge groups according to their homogeneous attributes. An integrated aggregation mechanism is then developed to realize the horizontal FL among a group of similar client nodes via the so-called intra-group synchronous aggregation, while allowing the vertical FL across different groups via the so-called inter-group asynchronous aggregation. Experiment and evaluation results based on an open-source dataset demonstrate the outstanding learning and communication performance of our proposed model, compared with several conventional FL schemes in a distributed ITS application scenario.},

We thus develop a data-driven simulation model that applies the existing Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (MAGAIL) framework considering both Vehicle and Link agents to learn vehicles’ link-to-link transitions and within-link movements (travel speed), and road links’ traffic state evolution patterns simultaneously, which is referred to as MAGAIL-VL model. We evaluate the model’s performance in terms of its ability to generate realistic vehicle trajectories, route distribution, and link travel time and congestion state. The comparison with several deep-learning based benchmark models shows that vehicle and link agents in the developed MAGAIL-VL model can mimic real-world vehicle movement and link state change patterns, producing superior performance over other tested methods.},

Specifically, a Multi-Type Cue Correlation (MTCC) covering CNNs and CapsNets is designed to extract the contrast and part-whole relational semantics, respectively. Using MTCC, two correlation matrices containing complementary information are computed with these two types of semantics. In return, these correlation matrices are used to guide the learning of the above semantics to generate better saliency cues. Besides, a Type Interaction Attention (TIA) is developed to interact semantics from CNNs and CapsNets for the aim of saliency prediction. Experiments and analysis on five benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed approach. Codes has been released on https://github.com/liuyi1989/TCGNet .},

  abstract     = {High-performance and real-time road detection plays an essential role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) of intelligent transportation. However, existing approaches still suffer from ambiguous road contour in traffic environment because deep learning methods lack explicit constraints on road boundaries with similar textures and structures. To address the unsatisfactory boundaries, we propose an efficient architecture for urban road detection to refine road edges adaptively. First, we design a lightweight symmetrical data-fusion network to merge spatial responses into visual features. Second, we construct cross-layer attention transformation to aggregate non-local contextual information. Moreover, a progressive uncertainty analysis module eliminates indistinct road and obstacle edges. Finally, we introduce upgrade uncertainty loss and improved deep supervision to constrain margin error for multi-scale predictions. Results of experiments using three famous datasets confirm the superiority of our method (F1-measure of 96.91% in KITTI, 98.86% in Cityscapes, and 95.18% in R2D, processing speed of 0.02s) over previous approaches. We demonstrate that, to ensure the safety of autonomous driving, the Epurate-Net adaptively refines road contour to reach exquisite road margins. The source code will be available soon.},

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal prediction task in the transportation network is the core of the solutions for various traffic problems. On one hand, the mobility pattern in traffic can be reflected in the travel behavior of the crowd. In most traffic prediction tasks, the importance of the mobility pattern is often overlooked. On the other hand, traffic prediction also has a variety of predicting scenarios, including short-term and long-term prediction, and relevant research cannot solve the problems under the two scenarios at the same time. In view of the problem of existing work, we propose a multi-pattern traffic prediction framework, MPGNNFormer. First, we construct a new bus stop distance network to model the relationships between stops. Then, we use a graph neural network-based deep clustering method to extract the bus stop mobility pattern. Finally, we design a transformer-based spatio-temporal prediction model (STGNNFormer) to predict bus stop flow by taking full advantage of time dependency and space dependency. After that, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate and test them on the real bus dataset, including analyzing mobility patterns and comparing prediction results. The experimental results prove that MPGNNFormer can improve the calculation efficiency in the prediction scene while ensuring prediction accuracy in the stop-flow prediction of the transportation network.},

  abstract     = {Human-vehicle interfaces have evolved with technologies such as touchscreens, voice commands, and advanced steering wheels with control panels. However, these technologies can increase the driver’s cognitive workload and distraction, potentially compromising road safety. Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) offer an alternative way of controlling in-vehicle features with minimal distraction. This study presents a closed-loop steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) based BMI for controlling in-vehicle features via a windshield head-up display to control multiple vehicle features such as music, temperature, settings, and navigation system. The custom software synchronizes visual stimuli, processes electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and selects target icons in real-time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the SE-ResNet architecture efficiently detects SSVEPs and the driver’s intended target icon in under 1 second. Comparative evaluations against traditional and deep learning methods using time and frequency features show superior performance. With just 225 seconds of calibration data, the proposed compact deep-learning model enables drivers to adjust their environment within 0.5 seconds, achieving an Information Transfer Rate (ITR) of 93.43±7.26 bits/min. This SSVEP-based BMI system demonstrates multi-layer in-vehicle feature control with ten human participants, highlighting its potential to enhance road safety by allowing drivers to make adjustments without diverting their attention from the road.

  abstract     = {The efficient exchange of perception information between vehicles and infrastructure is crucial for implementing vehicle-infrastructure (VI) collaborative intelligent driving. To address the high real-time requirements of VI communication and lack of intelligence and flexibility in VI cooperation, this study proposes an efficient collaborative perception method based on vehicle re-identification for VI collaboration scenarios. The real-time requirements of such scenarios are addressed and a lightweight vehicle re-identification network called ShuffleBNLSH is designed. This network is combined with a hash algorithm to quickly generate ID information for collaborative sensing targets. Based on the state of the VI communication channel, the network can adaptively extract the bit features of the perceived vehicle target, adjust the feature length, and quickly perform feature matching for vehicle target re-identification. To rapidly fuse the VI collaborative perception information combined with the re-identification results and LiDAR 3D perception information from the vehicle and infrastructure, we designed a mini-ICP algorithm that can automatically select feature points and perform point-cloud registration. Experimental results show that the amount of data transmitted by a single target in cooperative sensing can be as small as hundreds of bits during the fusion of sensing targets on the vehicle and infrastructure sides. This reduces the bandwidth requirements for fusing perception targets, accelerates feature transmission and matching, and expands the perception range of VI collaborative autonomous vehicles without GPS information.},

Rainy weather is ${a}$ common yet typical problem which may significantly deteriorate trajectory extraction performance. To tackle the problem, the study proposes an ensemble framework to extract personnel trajectory from port-like surveillance videos under varied rainy weather scenarios. Firstly, the proposed framework learns fine-grained personnel features with the help of the object query and transformer encoder-decoder module from the input port-like image sequences, and thus obtains port personnel locations from the input low-visibility images. Secondly, the personnel positions are further associated in a frame-by-frame manner with the help of neighboring kinematic movement information and feature information. Finally, a memory mechanism is introduced in the proposed framework to suppress personnel trajectory discontinuity outlier. In that manner, we can obtain accurate yet consistent personnel trajectories, and each person is assigned with a unique ID. We verified the proposed model performance on three port-like rainy videos involving with interferences of rain, rain streak and fog. Experimental results show that the proposed port personnel trajectory extraction framework can obtain satisfied performance considering that the average multi-target accuracy (MOTA), the average value of judging the same target ( ${\mathbf {IDF}}_{\mathbf {1}}$ ), average recall rate (IDR) and average precision (IDP) were larger than 92%.},

Since the slippage of the wheel directly affects the motion control and safety, it becomes urgent to effectively estimate the slippage. In this paper, an intuitive slippage estimation method is proposed based on wheel-ruts images, which aims to reduce the number of extra sensors and take advantages of the visual information effectively. Since the image samples sometimes are difficult to collect, a few-shot learning method is employed using distribution propagation graph network with dilated causal convolution layer (DCC-DPGN). The dilated causal convolution (DCC) layer is adopted in ResNet block to expand the receptive field and obtain the sequence information of wheel-ruts, which makes the model training more efficient. The proposed model is verified in the test set of images collected in real scene, which shows the potential of the proposed algorithm in slippage estimation.},

Towards this end, we present an instance-aware monocular semantic scene completion framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first endeavor specifically targeting the challenge of instance perception in the camera-based semantic scene completion task. Our method consists of two stages. In stage I, we design a region-based VQ-VAE network, providing an effective solution for 3D occupancy prediction. In stage II, we first introduce an instance-aware attention module, explicitly incorporating instance-level cues captured from mask images to enhance the instance features in RGB images. Then we leverage the deformable cross-attention to aggregate image features corresponding to each voxel query and utilize the deformable self-attention to refine query proposals. We combine these key ingredients and evaluate our method on two challenging datasets, namely SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. The results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art VoxFormer-S. Specifically, our method surpasses VoxFormer-S by 0.22 IoU and 0.72 mIoU on the validation set and achieves an impressive improvement of 3.04 IoU and 1.06 mIoU on the SSCBench-KITTI-360 validation set.

However, existing high-performance trajectory prediction methods are more focused on fully autonomous vehicles, and it is difficult to deal with the problem of driving trajectory prediction with different risks when the driver is in the loop. So, an ego vehicle trajectory prediction method based on time-feature encoding and physics-intention decoding (TFE-PID) is proposed. Through the bidirectional enhancement of the encoding and decoding process, it can accurately predict the trajectory of the ego vehicle by using only the state data of the vehicle and the driver. In the encoding stage, time and feature information are used for dual encoding, which makes the amount of information carried in the context vector used for decoding more abundant. In the decoding stage, context vector, physical prediction data, and driver’s intention are used to control the flow of information in the network, which enables the model to converge in a direction that is more consistent with the physical characteristics of the vehicle and driver’s intention. The experimental results show that TFE-PID can accurately predict the trajectory of the ego vehicle under different risky driving behaviors of drivers, and has good prediction stability and generalization ability.},

Then, the anti-interference performance of deep learning models such as transformer is tested. By comparing dataset with and without noises, we develop an evaluation method containing several predictive performance metrics and statistical measures. The results show that: (1) the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle has the lowest sensitivity to noise, and the lateral velocity has the weakest anti-interference and the highest sensitivity.

Frequently, such data are acquired by traffic sensors with two issues: it is not practicable or even possible to place traffic sensors on every link in a network; sensors do not provide direct information about origin–destination (O–D) demand flows. Therefore, it is imperative to locate the best places to deploy traffic sensors and then augment the knowledge obtained from this link flow sample to predict the entire traffic flow of the network. This article provides a resilient deep learning (DL) architecture combined with a global sensitivity analysis tool to solve O–D estimation and sensor location problems simultaneously. The proposed DL architecture is based on the stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE) model for accurately estimating the entire O–D flows of the network using link flows, thus reversing the conventional traffic assignment problem. The SAE model extracts traffic flow characteristics and derives a meaningful relationship between traffic flow data and network topology. To train the proposed DL architecture, synthetic link flow data were created randomly from the historical demand data of the network. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis was implemented to prioritize the importance of each link in the O–D estimation step to solve the sensor location problem. Two networks of different sizes were used to validate the performance of the model. The efficiency of the proposed method for solving the combination of traffic flow estimation and sensor location problems was confirmed from a low root-mean-square error with a reduction in the number of link flows required.},

However, most of the existing methods either require some strong assumptions or are validated in simple scenarios, which greatly hinders their implementation in the real world. In this paper, more complex environments are considered in which robots can only acquire local observations from their own sensors and have only limited communication capabilities for mapless collaborative navigation. To address this challenging task, we propose a hierarchical framework, by fusing both Sensor-wise and Agent-wise features for Perception-Improving (SAPI), which can adaptively integrate features from different information sources to improve perception capabilities. Specifically, to facilitate scene understanding, we assign prior knowledge to the visual coder to generate efficient embeddings. For effective feature representation, an attention-based sensor fusion network is designed to fuse sensor-level information of visual and LiDAR sensors, while graph convolution with multi-head attention mechanism is applied to aggregate agent-level information from an arbitrary number of neighbors. In addition, reinforcement learning is used to optimize the policy, where a novel compound reward function is introduced to guide training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has excellent generalization ability in different scenarios and scalability for large-scale systems.},

Currently, this work is still done manually by train dispatchers, which is challenging to maintain performance under various problem instances. To mitigate this issue, this study proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach to TTR, which makes the following contributions compared to existing work. First, we design a simple directed graph to represent the TTR problem, enabling the automatic extraction of informative states through graph neural networks. Second, we reformulate the construction process of TTR’s solution, not only decoupling the decision model from the problem size but also ensuring the generated scheme’s feasibility. Third, we design a learning curriculum for our model to handle the scenarios with different levels of delay. Finally, a simple local search method is proposed to assist the learned decision model, which can significantly improve solution quality with little additional computation cost, further enhancing the practical value of our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The learned decision model can achieve better performance for various problems with varying degrees of train delay and different scales when compared to handcrafted rules and state-of-the-art solvers.},

  abstract     = {Transportation infrastructure constitutes a significant part of civil infrastructure, such as bridges, tunnels, and roads, enormously promoting economic development. Transportation infrastructure is subjected to a high volume of traffic, damage, and component deterioration, as well as disaster events during the service period. Monitoring and management of the transportation infrastructure is always a critical task. Recently, digital twin (DT) is an emerging topic for transportation infrastructure management, with the advancement of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, and other smart technologies. Herein, DT aims to build a virtual counterpart of the physical infrastructure that is continually updated with its performance, maintenance, and health status. However, research in DT for transportation infrastructure mainly focused on infrastructure management (e.g., traffic state prediction and passenger flow assessment) and ignored the health status of the infrastructure itself. Challenges and associated opportunities exist in the adoption of DT for transportation infrastructure, such as balancing model fidelity and computation efficiency. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the key enabling technologies of DT in transportation infrastructure and provide a comprehensive reference for ongoing and future research. In this paper, a systematic investigation to identify the development of DTs for transportation infrastructure is presented. The paper starts by explaining the definition of DT and highlighting the various characteristics of DT. Next, the key enabling technologies and applications of DT for transportation infrastructure are discussed. Finally, based on the current development status of DT, challenges and open research are discussed along with their potential solutions.},

Therefore, railway intrusion detection is crucial for the safety of railway operation. Among the current methods of intrusion detection, machine vision-based methods have been widely used in railways, and have attracted close attention because of their great benefits. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of railway intrusion detection based on machine vision, covering ground monitoring, on-board inspection, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection. First, this paper systematically reviews most of the studies over the past two decades and presents the survey in three parts. Second, by analyzing these studies and the requirements for railway monitoring, we summarize the major challenges that hinder railway intrusion detection based on machine vision. Finally, we propose several promising perspectives for railway intrusion detection based on machine vision by comprehensively considering the development of machine vision, sensors, and pattern recognition together with the needs of railway scenes.},

  abstract     = {In the contemporary landscape, the escalating deployment of drones across diverse industries has ushered in a consequential concern, including ensuring the security of drone operations. This concern extends to a spectrum of challenges, encompassing collisions with stationary and mobile obstacles and encounters with other drones. Moreover, the inherent limitations of drones, namely constraints on energy consumption, data storage capacity, and processing power, present formidable obstacles in developing collision avoidance algorithms. This review paper explores the challenges of ensuring safe drone operations, focusing on collision avoidance. We explore collision avoidance methods for UAVs from various perspectives, categorizing them into four main groups: obstacle detection and avoidance, collision avoidance algorithms, drone swarm, and path optimization. Additionally, our analysis delves into machine learning techniques, discusses metrics and simulation tools to validate collision avoidance systems, and delineates local and global algorithmic perspectives. Our evaluation reveals significant challenges in current drone collision prevention algorithms. Despite advancements, critical UAV network and communication challenges are often overlooked, prompting a reliance on simulation-based research due to cost and safety concerns. Challenges encompass precise detection of small and moving obstacles, minimizing path deviations at minimal cost, high machine learning and automation expenses, prohibitive costs of real testbeds, limited environmental comprehension, and security apprehensions. By addressing these key areas, future research can advance the field of drone collision avoidance and pave the way for safer and more efficient UAV operations.},

This interest has yielded a vast literature on CAV platooning, which generally describes its benefits in terms of traffic efficiency, safety and environmental impacts, among others. However, the boundary conditions of these studies and the reported magnitude of these benefits vary greatly among the different contributions. In this context, this paper presents the result of a comprehensive literature review on CAV platooning on highways, organizing the existing research and establishing links between the different strategies proposed and their expected impacts. Starting points for future investigations are suggested, and the research gaps to be addressed are identified. The analysis performed shows that the current state-of-the-art has two major limitations. First, few CAV platooning strategies have been proven to be asymptotically stable, which should be a requirement for any feasible solution. Second, in most cases, the CAV platooning algorithms are simplistic adaptations from existing car-following models proposed for human driving that, therefore, unnecessarily transfer current traffic-related problems to future cooperative environments.},

  abstract     = {Relative vehicle positioning methods can contribute to safer and more efficient autonomous driving by enabling collision avoidance and platooning applications. For full automation, these applications require cm-level positioning accuracy and greater than 50 Hz update rate. Since sensor-based methods (e.g., LIDAR, cameras) have not been able to reliably satisfy these requirements under all conditions so far, complementary methods are sought. Recently, positioning based on visible light communication signals from vehicle head/tail LED lights (VLP) has shown significant promise as a complementary method attaining cm-level accuracy and near-kHz rate in realistic driving scenarios. Vehicular VLP methods measure relative bearing (angle) or range (distance) of transmitters (i.e., head/tail lights) based on received signals from on-board photodiodes and estimate transmitter relative positions based on those measurements. In this survey, we first review existing vehicular VLP methods and propose a new method that advances the state-of-the-art in positioning performance. Next, we analyze the theoretical and simulated performance of all methods in realistic driving scenarios under challenging noise and weather conditions, real asymmetric light beam patterns and different vehicle dimensions and light placements. Our simulation results show that the newly proposed VLP method is the overall best performer, and can indeed satisfy the accuracy and rate requirements for localization in collision avoidance and platooning applications within practical constraints. Finally, we discuss remaining open challenges that are faced for the deployment of VLP solutions in the automotive sector and further research questions.},

An intelligent transportation system (ITS) using roadside infrastructure can overcome these problems. For this reason, the number of such systems is increasing dramatically, and therefore requires an adequate overview. To the best of our knowledge, no current systematic review of existing ITS solutions exists. To fill this knowledge gap, our paper provides an overview of existing ITS that use roadside infrastructure worldwide. Accordingly, this paper addresses current questions and challenges. For this purpose, we performed a literature review of documents that describe existing ITS solutions from 2009 until today. We categorized the results according to technology levels and analyzed its hardware system setup and value-added contributions. In doing so, we made the ITS solutions comparable and highlighted past development alongside current trends. We analyzed more than 400 papers, including 53 test bed projects. In summary, current ITSs can deliver accurate information about individuals in traffic situations in real-time. However, further research into ITS should focus on more reliable perception of the traffic using modern sensors, plug-and-play mechanisms, and secure real-time distribution of the digital twins in a decentralized manner. By addressing these topics, the development of intelligent transportation systems will be able to take a step towards its comprehensive roll-out.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the air transportation industry, air traffic is facing a severe test. The accurate prediction of the estimated arrival time (EAT) plays an important role in rational and efficient scheduling of flights. Aircraft EAT predictions often rely on aircraft performance parameters or physical trajectories. This gives poor consideration to the flight environment and take-off and landing conditions. This paper applies a data-driven methodology for ETA prediction. A Cluster clustering-based modular integrated DNN (CC-MIDNN) is proposed. According to the information of flight mission and flight environment, it decomposes complex modeling tasks into multiple distinct subtasks using cluster-based clustering. Then Bayesian optimization is used to design corresponding parallel sub-networks to learn different sub-tasks in order to reduce the complexity of the subsequent sub-networks. Finally, a new integration scheme is proposed to solve the overfitting problem due to the reliance on the training accuracy of sub-modules. To verify the effectiveness of the method, CC-MIDNN performs EAT prediction on flight data of European Airlines LIS airport in 2017. The experimental results show that the CC-MIDNN improves the time prediction accuracy by 5.92 minutes and keeps the error within 13 minutes. Compared with other deep learning algorithms and integration algorithms, the CC-MIDNN has high accuracy and stability.},

  abstract     = {Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and high levels of autonomy for vehicular applications require reliable and high precision pose information for their functioning. Pose estimation comprises solving the localization and orientation problems for a rigid body in a three-dimensional space. In outdoor scenarios, the fusion of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and inertial data in high-end receivers constitutes the baseline for ground truth localization solutions, such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) or Precise Point Positioning (PPP). These techniques present two main disadvantages, namely the inability to provide absolute orientation information and the lack of observations redundancy in urban scenarios. This paper presents Array PPP-RTK, a recursive three-dimensional pose estimation technique which fuses inertial and multi-antenna GNSS measurements to provide centimeters and sub-degree precision for positioning and attitude estimates, respectively. The core filter is based on adapting the well-known Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), such that it deals with parameters belonging to the SO(3) and GNSS integer ambiguity groups. The Array PPP-RTK observational model is also derived, based on the combination of carrier phase measurements over multiple antennas along with State Space Representation (SSR) GNSS corrections. The performance assessment is based on the real data collected on an inland waterway scenario. The results demonstrate that a high precision solution is available 99.5% of the time, with a horizontal precision of around 6 cm and heading precision of 0.9 degrees. Despite the satellite occlusion after bridge passing, it is shown that Array PPP-RTK recovers high accurate estimates in less than ten seconds.},

  abstract     = {Electric buses are becoming increasingly popular in transit systems by virtue of their great potential in improving environmental sustainability. The electric bus charging scheduling problem (EBCSP) has been widely researched to minimize the operation cost by determining the charging strategies, including when and how much electricity to charge. However, few studies have considered both the battery degradation mechanism and the nonlinear charging. The former should be the implicit operational cost, while the latter should accurately estimate the electricity charged. Considering these two characteristics, this paper addresses the EBCSP with the goal of optimizing costs. First, a rigorous mathematical model is developed, constrained by the electricity quantity, preset timetable, charging facilities, and charging continuity. Then, the battery degradation cost is modeled by introducing the wear cost function, and the nonlinear charging profile is linearized by piecewise affine function. The model is further simplified to mixed integer linear programming with a reduced computational burden. Computational results suggest that the optimization can reduce battery degradation and total cost, especially for those bus routes with higher frequencies and longer travel distances. Finally, sensitive analysis indicates that a low initial state of charge can result in significant savings in degradation costs of about 19% and total costs of about 13%. Large fleet and battery sizes reduce charging costs while increasing battery degradation cost and total cost. Some solid managerial insights are provided for the application of electric transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hierarchical LiDAR simulation framework to address the challenges of accurately simulating LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios. The framework utilizes a homology mapping approach to integrate LiDAR responses hierarchically at three levels: the instantaneous power response, environmental optical channel response, and target reflection response of LiDAR. This allows for the dynamic coupling of LiDAR geometric and physical models with varying environmental parameters. By integrating an array of interactions intrinsic to the LiDAR system and its external environment, the proposed model can provide high-fidelity LiDAR point cloud simulations. The effectiveness of the simulated point clouds has been validated through extensive experiments using actual LiDAR data and detection algorithms trained on existing datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the potential to improve the realism of LiDAR simulations and the accumulation of challenging perception data.},

  abstract     = {Sampling, generation, and evaluation of scenarios are essential steps for intelligent testing of autonomous vehicles. Since uncertainty in driving behavior always leads to different occurrence frequencies of scenarios, we have to sample these scenarios in naturalistic datasets. Furthermore, a specified scenario needs to be further enriched and the driving behavior within it needs to be fully described to carry out generation in simulation systems. However, existing approaches generate scenarios randomly and uncontrollably, which makes them unable to precisely generate the specified scenarios. The driving behavior they describe is also memoryless and inflexible. To address the two issues, we propose a task-driven controllable scenario generation framework that can generate scenarios with the consideration of the driving behavior of Surrounding Vehicles (SVs) in a controllable manner. We first manually assign the driving behavior based on different testing tasks for all the considered vehicles. Then we expand the driving behavior temporally as the continuation and transition of several motion activities and generate the corresponding vehicle trajectories spatially. We adopt And-Or Graph (AOG) to model the transition between these motion activities. In contrast to the common memoryless Markov process, our framework generates driving behavior with continuity and driving memory. Finally, we evaluate our framework by generating lane-changing scenarios.},

However, the existing study largely ignores the guaranteed cost control of USV under stochastic cyber attacks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper attempts to focus on the guarantee cost control of USV systems by taking into account the finite measurable output sampling information and stochastic cyber attacks. Initially, a point output sampling control strategy based on finite measurable output sampling information is proposed, which has a strong application background and important theoretical research value in the field of power grid security. On this basis, a new stochastic composite system containing both system state and output sampling information is developed. Subsequently, a sampling-time-dependent Lyapunov function (LYFU) is exploited to ensure the workable criteria of the cost sampling controller, which can not only stabilize the stochastic composite system by means of the mean square exponential stability, but also reveal the upper bound (UPBO) of the quadratic cost function (COFU). Specially, in the strict sensu of minimizing the UPBO of the COFU, a meaningful design method for a suboptimal guaranteed cost output sampling controller is designed, which is a modulus-related LMI optimization algorithm. Finally, numerical simulation results of USV and additional vehicle lateral motion model are developed to demonstrate the validity and rationality of the proposed design method.},

However, as an integrated technology (UAV-assisted IoT applications), it suffers from many challenges, and security is one of the foremost concerns. Considering that, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid lightweight key exchange authentication model for UAV-assisted IoT applications to resolve the device-to-device (D2D) authentication and data privacy issues in these networks. The proposed model employs five different security parameters named registration, authentication, authorization, accounting, and cache wash and update (R3ACWU) in coordination with a hash function. The network architecture consists of UAVs, IoT devices, and micro base stations, followed by base stations, authentication servers, and service providers (SP). In this framework, we introduce a concept known as ‘dead time’, a specific time period after which each device’s cache memory is cleared and updated. This practice not only enhances the security of the devices in use but also reduces computational and memory overhead by eliminating the records of devices that haven’t participated in the communication process within the specified time frame. Results statistics of our lightweight R3ACWU authentication scheme exhibit notable improvement corresponded to the present authentication schemes in terms of comparative parameters.},

  abstract     = {Platoon refers to a group of vehicles traveling in a train-like strategy with a lean inter-vehicle gap, which can increase road capacity and reduce energy consumption. A platoon is composed of several member vehicles and one leader vehicle which determines the driving pattern of the platoon. Therefore, it is crucial to select a vehicle with the highest reputation value as the leader vehicle in a platoon. Reputation value is a private parameter of each vehicle, and how to preserve its privacy is also an issue worth paying attention to. Therefore, in this paper, a reputation-based and privacy-preserving platoon management (RPPM) scheme in vehicular networks is proposed. Specifically, we design a secure comparison protocol (SCP) to select a leader vehicle for each platoon. The SCP protocol not only reduces the involvement of trust authority but also preserves the privacy of vehicles’ reputation values. Furthermore, the cloud server aggregates reputation ciphertexts and feedback scores of the member vehicles based on the homomorphism characteristic of Paillier ciphertexts, and the reputation value privacy of member vehicles is preserved without affecting the aggregation results. The theoretical analysis indicates that the RPPM scheme is privacy-preserving and secure enough to resist several common attacks in vehicular networks. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the RPPM scheme, and the results show that the RPPM scheme significantly outperforms the existing schemes in computation and communication overheads.},

  abstract     = {The performance of the battery decreases dramatically in the low temperature, and the heating system of the battery in the cold environment consumes considerable energy, which leads to reduced range and increased safety hazards of electric vehicle. This article focuses on an optimal control strategy of battery thermal management system (BTMS) with waste heat recovery for connected electric vehicle (CEV), which improves heating efficiency and minimizes energy consumption. Firstly, to compensate the insufficient heating capacity of heat pump system in low temperature, the battery pack heating system integrated with heat pump air conditioning system (HPACS), waste heat recovery and electric heater is designed. Secondly, to address the problems of the battery slow thermodynamic response and the increased system complexity due to waste heat recovery, a multi-layer nonlinear model predictive control (ML-NMPC) strategy is developed, which utilizes intelligent transportation system (ITS) information to optimize the energy consumption of the integrated system. The upper layer and lower layer controllers coordinate with each other using the long and short speed prediction respectively to solve the problems of multi-layer control, fast implementation and reference trajectory tracking. The simulation results show that the waste heat recovery system can improve the performance of the HPACS, which increases the coefficient of performance (COP) from 1.79 to 2.54. Compared to centralized NMPC, ML-NMPC reduces energy consumption by 10.2% and 13.7% in the insulation stage under NEDC and real driving condition with higher state of health and less computation time, which demonstrates the superior thermal management capability.},

The Euclidean distance between the heterogeneous data is used to optimize the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, so that the position of ICVs and the distance between ICVs and roadside positioning platform with higher confidence can be obtained. Meanwhile, considering the high complication of urban intersections, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm is improved based on the covariance of error sequences so that the influences caused by observation noise anomalies can be reduced. To further improve the accuracy of positional prediction, the position of roadside positioning platform is extended dimensionally into the state vector of ICVs to observe the distance between ICVs and roadside positioning platform. Then the particle filter (PF) theory is introduced to integrate the upper-layer with the lower-layer UKF to reduce the positioning errors brought by signal interferences. Besides, an adaptive factor is adopted to connect D-S theory with the improved multi-layer UKF (IUKF) to dynamically update the weights of output values from sensors. Furthermore, a communication mechanism between the ICVs platform and the roadside positioning platform is established in this project with considering the reliability and low latency of vehicle to everything (V2X) communications. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method is validated by experiments with three ICVs at an urban intersection. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method can locate the position of ICVs rapidly and stably in urban intersections and has better positioning performance compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms.},

While machine learning has enabled intrusion detection systems (IDSs), current IDSs do not incorporate cyber-physical UAV features, which limits their detection performance. Additionally, the lack of public UAV’s cyber and physical datasets to develop IDS hinders further research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel IDS fusing UAV cyber and physical features to improve detection capabilities. First, we developed a testbed that includes UAV, controller, and data collection tools to execute cyber-attacks and gather cyber and physical data under normal and attack conditions. We made this dataset publicly available. The dataset covers a range of cyber-attacks including denial-of-service, replay, evil twin, and false data injection attacks. Then, machine learning-based IDSs fusing cyber and physical features were trained to detect cyber-attacks using support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells, and convolutional neural networks. Extensive experiments were conducted on varying complexity and range of attack training data to explore whether (a) fusion of cyber and physical features enhances detection performance compared to cyber or physical features alone, (b) fusion enhances detection when IDS is trained on a single attack type and tested on unseen attacks of varying complexity, (c) fusion enhances performance when the range of attack training data increases and models are tested on unseen attacks. Answering these research questions provides insights into IDS capabilities using cyber, physical, and cyber-physical features under different conditions.},

This paper introduces two strategies to address these issues: 1) Soft Regression Loss (SoRL) and 2) Discrete Quantization Sampling (DQS). SoRL utilizes Gaussian distributions for object predictions, measuring uncertainty based on the probability of ground truth labels within these distributions. This method effectively accounts for deviations in object location and orientation. Meanwhile, DQS introduces uncertainty scores for dynamic sample selection, aiming to refine the quality of positive samples for regression. Based on the proposed modules, we design a lightweight multi-stage object detection framework. Notably, these modules can enhance existing 3D object detection methods without affecting significantly inference speeds.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay networks with flexible and controllable characteristics are expected to complement the capacity of the gNB. This paper studies the multiplexing of enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in a multi-UAV relay network, where the strict latency requirement of URLLC can be achieved by the preemptive multiplexing of eMBB resources. However, this may affect eMBB reliability due to the transmission interruptions. Moreover, given the limited energy resources of UAVs, there is an inherent tradeoff among reliability, delay, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper develops a hierarchical UAV-assisted eMBB/URLLC multiplexing scheduling framework. For the eMBB scheduler, we first utilize multiple UAVs to assist the gNB in relaying eMBB traffic and formulate the eMBB resource allocation problem as an optimization problem. Then, we propose a decomposition-relaxation-optimization algorithm to maximize eMBB data rates while considering the personalized fairness of resource allocation and UAV power consumption. For the URLLC scheduler, we further consider the multiplexing of eMBB/URLLC traffic based on the optimization of eMBB resources. To reduce the performance fluctuations of eMBB, we propose a novel cross-slot strategy to schedule URLLC within two time slots rather than one time slot as in existing works. With this strategy, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal strategy for the preemption of URLLC on eMBB. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of convergence rate, eMBB reliability, personalized resource fairness, UAV consumption, and URLLC satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {The increase in car ownership has improved the convenience of people’s travel, but it has also increased the potential risk of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. In complex traffic scenarios, pedestrian crossing behavior may lead to frequent traffic accidents. It is crucial to accurately and timely anticipate pedestrian crossing intentions to avoid pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, improve driving safety and ensure pedestrian safety. We propose a novel dual-channel pedestrian crossing intention anticipation network (DPCIAN) to anticipate pedestrian crossing intentions. DPCIAN comprises the pedestrian action encoding module and the scene traffic object interaction relation module (STOIRM). Initially, the pedestrian action encoding module resorts to channel-refined Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract spatio-temporal action features from pedestrians’ skeletons, which improves the inflexible feature extraction of the adaptive GCN and the information redundancy of the multi-channel GCN. Afterward, the STOIRM introduces an interaction relation network to excavate scene object interaction features related to the target pedestrian’s crossing intention with better scene understanding. Finally, the adaptive average pooling layer is used to fuse the spatio-temporal and interaction features to achieve robust anticipation of pedestrian crossing intention. DPCIAN is evaluated on two public datasets, JAAD and PIE, with an accuracy of 89% and 91%, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that DPCIAN can precisely anticipate pedestrians’ crossing intentions in complex traffic scenarios.

However, precise object rotation estimation within the visual context of an input image remains underexplored due to the lack of object datasets with rotation annotations. This paper addresses these challenges by tackling rotation estimation for parked bikes with respect to their parking area. Firstly, 3D graphics were leveraged to build a camera-agnostic well-annotated Synthetic Bike Rotation Dataset (SynthBRSet). Subsequently, an object-to-spot rotation estimator (OSRE) is introduced by extending object detection to regress bike rotations in two axes. As the proposed model trained purely on synthetic data, image smoothing techniques adopted during deployment on real-world images. The proposed OSRE has undergone evaluation on both synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results. Our data and code are available at https://saghiralfasly.github.io/OSRE-Project/ .},

The major challenges for active 3D point cloud scene flow estimation for autonomous driving (AD) include mis-registrations of point cloud frames, inaccurate scene prediction, and inefficient scene similarity evaluation. This paper presents a framework of active scene flow estimation for AD applications, which consists of three main modules: robust scene flow estimation, reliable reachable area detection, and efficient observation position decision. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a robust bi-direction attention-based mechanism neural network scene flow estimation method; 2) developing a reliable reachable area detection strategy through hidden points removing (HPR) based scene prediction and a legality checking scheme between the ego-vehicle and the road as well as the predicted scene; 3) developing an efficient observation position decision strategy through building a scene similarity measure, which can help evaluate the differences between two frames of point clouds from different views. The proposed method is trained and verified using a CARLA simulator based dataset, the FlyingThings3D and KiTTI datasets, which have the accurate scene flow ground-truth. The experiment results demonstrate the superior estimation performance and generalization capacity of our method for various AD scenes as well as different system configurations, compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {Currently, cracks are the most common defect in pavement diseases. Long-term non-maintenance can lead to crack lengthening and expansion, causing serious traffic accidents, as well as shortening the service life of pavement cracks. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to maintain cracks at an early stage. Due to the effect of some challenging factors, such as various shape information of the cracks, complex textured backgrounds, light shadows, similar texture objects, micro cracks and other factors, accurate crack detection still faces a certain challenges. To solve the above problems, a dual-encoding multi-scale fusion network based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer network is proposed, named DMF-Net. To obtain stronger feature representations, a dual-encoding path is built to acquire global context features and local detail information simultaneously, where global context features are extracted based on the transformer branch, and the local detail features are extracted based on the CNN branch to detect tiny details of the cracks. Meanwhile, an interactive attention learning (IAL) module is introduced to effectively fuse the global features from the transformer branch and the local detail information from the CNN branch, achieving mutual communication and learning of different feature information. In addition, to enrich the feature representation ability, an attention-based feature enhancement (AFE) module is introduced to acquire more global contexts. Furthermore, faced with the crack detection task with class imbalance issue, a triple attention module (TAM) is built to emphasize the micro cracks. Finally, in the segmentation prediction stage, the deep supervision mechanism is also introduced to accelerate the convergence speed of the model, and serve effective multi-scale feature fusion. Compared with the current mainstream segmentation models, excellent performance has been obtained, which could provide a feasible scheme for the early maintenance of pavement cracks.

  abstract     = {Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the functional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by deep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack detection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend to treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not automatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes of the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle this problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so that the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes the front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front end with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end with a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order inconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to address open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed CrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the proposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded into different neural network models to improve their performances.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an investigation and assessment framework, which, supported by realistic data, aims at provisioning operators with in-depth insights into the consumer-perceived Quality-of-Experience (QoE) at public Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructures. Motivated by the unprecedented EV market growth, it is suspected that the existing charging infrastructure will soon be no longer capable of sustaining the rapidly growing charging demands; let alone that the currently adopted ad hoc infrastructure expansion strategies seem to be far from contributing any quality service sustainability solutions that tangibly reduce (ultimately mitigate) the severity of this problem. Without suitable QoE metrics, operators, today, face remarkable difficulty in assessing the performance of EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) in this regard. This paper aims at filling this gap through the formulation of novel and original critical QoE performance metrics that provide operators with visibility into the per-EVCS operational dynamics and allow for the optimization of these stations’ respective utilization. Such metrics shall then be used as inputs to a Machine Learning model finely tailored and trained using recent real-world data sets for the purpose of forecasting future long-term EVCS loads. This will, in turn, allow for making informed optimal EV charging infrastructure expansions that will be capable of reliably coping with the rising EV charging demands and maintaining acceptable QoE levels. The model’s accuracy has been tested and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the achieved performance in terms of the above-listed metrics and show the suitability of the recommended infrastructure expansions.},

  abstract     = {Exclusive bus lane strategy is widely adopted in many cities to improve bus operation efficiency and reliability. With the development of connected vehicle technologies, the dynamic bus lane (DBL) strategy was proposed, with allowing general vehicles to share use of the bus lane to improve traffic efficiency in general purpose lanes (GPLs). Previous studies have rarely considered the eco-driving strategy of connected and automated vehicles/buses (CAVs/CABs) in GPLs under the mixed traffic conditions, and how to ensure bus priority with DBL control. In this study, a novel DBL control strategy was developed under the partially connected vehicle environment. A trajectory planning method while considering the joint effects of bus stop and signal phase for CAB was adopted, an eco-driving strategy for CAVs in GPL was proposed using a trigonometry trajectory planning method. And a novel DBL control method was established by integrated trajectory planning for both the CAVs and CABs to ensure bus operation priority. Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed novel DBL control in terms of travel time and energy consumption of general vehicles at the different levels of CAV market penetration rates (MPRs). Results indicated that about 16%-42% energy savings can be achieved with MPR varying from 20% to 100%, and the travel time can be improved by about 4%-10%. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the impacts of key parameters, including vehicle target speeds, heterogeneous traffic flow, random arrival interval of cars, position of bus stop, traffic volume in GPLs and buffer length at the stop line of signalized intersections.},

In this paper, we propose a so-called voting election framework for efficient RMTS decision-making, in which three stages, namely constituency partition, constituency election and ballot summary, are developed. Then, for constituency election, four types of multi-task neural networks, namely, cascaded, overall parallel, grouped parallel and hybrid multi-task neural networks, are designed to identify the interrelations among six kinds of RMTSs. Besides, hyperparameter fine-tuning experiments are conducted to optimize the performance of the proposed networks. Finally, based on a dataset comprising realistic railway cases, it is found that the grouped parallel multi-task neural network performs the best by achieving an average decision accuracy of 86.9% compared to manual decision results and by outperforming the previous single-task neural network method by 10.7% in average decision accuracy.},

  abstract     = {To provide real-time parking information, existing studies focus on predicting parking availability, which seems an indirect approach to saving drivers’ cruising time. In this paper, we first time propose an on-street parking recommendation (OPR) task to directly recommend parking spaces for a driver. To this end, a learn-to-rank (LTR) based OPR model called OPR-LTR is built. Specifically, parking recommendation is closely related to the “turnover events” (state switching between occupied and vacant) of each parking space, and hence we design a highly efficient heterogeneous graph called ESGraph to represent historical and real-time meters’ turnover events as well as geographical relations; afterward, a convolution-based event-then-graph network is used to aggregate and update representations of the heterogeneous graph. A ranking model is further utilized to learn a score function that helps recommend a list of ranked parking spots for a specific on-street parking query. The method is verified using the on-street parking meter data in Hong Kong and San Francisco. By comparing with the other two types of methods: prediction-only and prediction-then-recommendation, the proposed direct-recommendation method achieves satisfactory performance in different metrics. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that the proposed ESGraph and the recommendation model are more efficient in terms of computational efficiency as well as saving drivers’ on-street parking time.},

  abstract     = {Car-following models are essential for microscopic traffic simulation. While conventional models rely on parsimonious formulas with simplified assumptions, recent studies have focused on developing data-driven models with the help of high-resolution trajectory data. This paper presents a data-driven model based on a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for probabilistic forecasting of human car-following behaviors. By incorporating past and future information, our model captures the temporal dynamics of human car-following behaviors, providing accurate predictions of the following vehicle’s behavior and quantifying the forecast uncertainty. We demonstrate the interpretability of the Bayesian GMM in modeling car-following behaviors, providing valuable insights into the heterogeneity and uncertainty of driver behaviors. Additionally, we show that the proposed model can make probabilistic multi-vehicle simulations that reproduce natural traffic phenomena. Our results suggest that the proposed Bayesian GMM is a promising approach for modeling and forecasting car-following behaviors in various driving scenarios, contributing to the development of safer and more efficient transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {The capacitated electric vehicle routing problem (CEVRP) extends the traditional vehicle routing problem by simultaneously considering the service order of the customers and the recharging schedules of the vehicles. Due to its NP-hard nature, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems: a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and a fixed route vehicle charging problem (FRVCP). A highly effective threshold acceptance based multi-layer search (TAMLS) algorithm is proposed to quickly obtain high-quality solutions. TAMLS consists of three layers. An iterated thresholding search procedure and a thresholding selection procedure are employed to produce diversified CVRP solutions in the first layer and to screen out high quality ones in the second layer, respectively. In the third layer, a removal heuristic coupling with an enumeration method is adopted to solve FRVRP, which produces optimized charging schedules. Extensive computational results show that TAMLS outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computation time. In particular, it is able to obtain new best results for 11 out of 17 benchmark instances, and reach the best known results on the remaining 6 instances. Additional experimental analyses are performed to better understand the contributions of key algorithmic components.},

Nonetheless, achieving precise TRFC estimation during straight stationary driving maneuvers, characterized by constant longitudinal speed (e.g., where the longitudinal acceleration is nearly zero) on a straight road, poses a particularly formidable challenge. In the paper, we propose a new learning strategy that leverages multi-domain fusion feature extraction in both the time domain and time-frequency domain to estimate the TRFC during straight stationary driving maneuvers. Specifically, the frequency response function of the in-wheel-motor-drive system first is inferred from the longitudinal dynamics model and single wheel dynamics model. Then, the input selection of learning strategy is determined through frequency response characteristics analysis and explainable dynamics mechanism. In addition, a parallel spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (PSTCNN) is built to extract features in both the time domain and in the time-frequency domain, respectively. Finally, the TRFC learning strategy is verified by experimental tests on different road surfaces. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable of estimating the TRFC with a lower error than the traditional learning-based method and the classical slip-slope method.},

Firstly, the models of the dual three-phase PMSM, the steer-by-wire system and 2DOF vehicle are established. Then, an angle tracking strategy based on load torque observer and modified sliding mode control, and a redundancy reconstruction rule for the dual three-phase PMSM faults are designed. Finally, verification was conducted through simulation and hardware in loop (HIL)test bench. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed angle tracking control strategy has excellent dynamic performance and can effectively reduce high-frequency chattering, while the proposed fault-tolerant control strategy can effectively reduce the fluctuations of motor speed and torque under faults. Therefore, the control strategies proposed in this paper not only can meet the high-performance requirements of lateral control of autonomous vehicles, but also can meet the high-safety requirements of steer-by-wire system in high-level autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven approaches have been widely used in the field of traction system and equipment fault diagnosis. However, limited training samples can cause data-driven models to face the dilemma of overfitting. In order to supplement sufficient training data in small-sample case, this paper proposes a data generative model based on the Multivariate Normal (MVN) distribution and Mahalanobis Distance (MD). The basic hypothesis of the method is that the diagnostic feature vectors representing the same fault state are subject to an identical MVN distribution. Afterward, its probability density function is unbiasedly estimated by the sample mean vector and sample covariance matrix, and then used to generate samples. During generation, the noise contained in the generated data is limited by the relationship between MD and Chi-square distribution. Finally, the generated samples are combined with original training samples to constitute a mix dataset to train data-driven fault diagnosis models. Taking the fault diagnosis of single-pole traction circuit breaker as an example, this paper illustrates the fault diagnosis framework with the proposed generative model and verifies its effectiveness. The results show that the generated samples cover the range of original samples well, thus increasing the prediction accuracy of the classifiers. Furthermore, three compared generative models are constructed. By comparison to these complicated models, the proposed method has better generation effect, although it limits the generative model capacity.},

The novelty of the study lies in the incorporation of the break requirement consideration of dispatchers into the personnel assignment during the operation period. A nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) model is first developed for the DN problem. By exploring the structure of the proposed model, an effective heuristic solution method consisting of optimization and simulation modules is proposed to obtain the optimal solution to the problem. Numerical experiments based on EVCARD, a popular one-way CSS operator in China, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution method and the rationality of incorporating the break requirement into the decision-making process. Furthermore, we investigated the impacts of critical parameters, such as payment for dispatchers and relocation cost, on the performance of the one-way CSS, providing valuable insights for carsharing service operators.},

For this problem, we first assign rescue priorities to different fire points according to the speed of the fire spread.

To deal with large-scale problems, a new fast and effective artificial bee colony algorithm and variable neighborhood search combined algorithm is proposed. Extensive experimental results for large-scale randomly generated instances confirm the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with MILP solver CPLEX, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization algorithms.

Current signal control plans are increasingly complex due to advances in sensing and communication capabilities, and the introduction of advanced control functionalities, such as transit signal priority or pedestrian actuation. Most optimization programs for actuated signal plans focus on setting the values of the main design parameters, such as cycle length and maximum and minimum green times. Other design components, such as phase compositions, detector placements and priority strategies, are selected by traffic engineers based on their experience or according to general engineering guidelines. This paper presents a system and its various components that fully automates the design process and generates optimal actuated signal plans with transit signal priority functions. The system consists of two main components, a traffic simulation model that evaluates candidate signal plans and a grammatical evolution algorithm that generates these plans within the optimization process. The control design system was evaluated with a case study on an intersection in Haifa, Israel controlled by an actuated plan with transit priority to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles. An automatically designed signal plan improved average person delay by 25% compared to the existing plan. It also outperformed, by 3%, a signal plan that kept the existing structure, and optimized its timing parameters (i.e., cycle length, minimum and maximum green time). Thus, the system can generate plans that are at least as good as human-designed ones, with lower effort, cost, and design time.},

Hubs are locations along highways where trucks can wait for other trucks to form platoons. A coordinator at each hub decides the departure time of trucks, and the released trucks from the hub will form platoons. The problem is cast as an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the platooning reward. We first show that the optimal release policy in the decentralized case, where the hubs do not exchange information, is to release all trucks at the hub when the number of trucks exceeds a threshold computed by dynamic programming. We develop efficient approximate release policies for the dependent arrival case using this result. To study the value of information exchange among hubs on platoon formation, we next study the distributed and centralized platoon formation policies which require information exchange among hubs. To this end, we develop receding horizon solutions for the distributed and centralized platoon formation at hubs using the dynamic programming technique. Finally, we perform a simulation study over three hubs in northern Sweden. The profits of the decentralized policies are shown to be approximately 3.5% lower than the distributed policy and 8% lower than the centralized release policy. This observation suggests that decentralized policies are prominent solutions for hub-based platooning as they do not require information exchange among hubs and can achieve a similar performance compared with distributed and centralized policies.},

  abstract     = {Pavement cracks are a common and significant problem for intelligent pavement maintainment. However, the features extracted in pavement images are often texture-less, and noise interference can be high. Segmentation using traditional convolutional neural network training can lose feature information when the network depth goes larger, which makes accurate prediction a challenging topic. To address these issues, we propose a new approach that features an enhanced tensor voting module and a customized pixel-level pavement crack segmentation network structure, called TV-Net. We optimize the tensor voting framework and find the relationship between tensor scale factors and crack distributions. A tensor voting fusion module is introduced to enhance feature maps by incorporating significant domain maps generated by tensor voting. Additionally, we propose a structural consistency loss function to improve segmentation accuracy and ensure consistency with the structural characteristics of the cracks obtained through tensor voting. The sufficient experimental analysis demonstrates that our method outperforms existing mainstream pixel-level segmentation networks on the same road crack dataset. Our proposed TV-Net has an excellent performance in avoiding noise interference and strengthening the structure of the fracture site of pavement cracks.

Tracking the trajectories of other vehicles on the road is needed for many applications ranging from collision avoidance to autonomous driving. Previously, such trajectory tracking has been done using linearized dynamic models, interacting-multiple-model (IMM) filters, or else by using LMI-based nonlinear observers. These estimation techniques suffer from some crucial shortcomings. Hence, this paper develops a high gain nonlinear observer for this application. The high gain observer approach offers the advantages of guaranteed feasibility and stability with just one constant observer gain for a wide range of motion. The challenges of transforming the vehicle dynamic model into the required companion form for applying the high gain observer technique are addressed. A coordinate transformation that allows for varying velocity and varying slip angle is shown to be appropriate. The high gain observer methodology for a dynamic system with multiple outputs is presented. Finally, simulation and experimental results on vehicle tracking are demonstrated. The experimental results show that, with a high gain observer, vehicle trajectories that span a large range of orientations can be accurately tracked using just one constant observer gain.},

Future movement of surrounding vehicles is often difficult to represent. Besides, most existing studies consider decision making and planning/control separately. Both them may lead to the oscillation and unsafe for autonomous driving. This paper proposes an integrated framework of decision making and motion planning with oscillation-free capability. The proposed approach overcomes the shortcomings of autonomous driving for lane change/keeping maneuvers and is able to: i) make oscillation-free behavior decisions given biased prediction; ii) cut through in the traffic efficiently and safely when being in squeezed; iii) accelerate computation efficiency by building a state transfer model based on prediction uncertainty; iv) reduce the dissonance between decision-making and motion planning. A belief decision planner is designed with the uncertainty of the prediction trajectories. Lateral and longitudinal drivable corridors including the reference state and the related boundary constraints are built, which provide better suited information for planning to solve the optimal motion sequence more quickly and stably, and improve its consistency with decision module. Finally, the problem is formulated as an optimal control problem considering the vehicle dynamics and some soft constraints and the motion trajectory is solved by OSQP. Simulation and experimental tests are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Test results show that the integrated approach can make proper, safe and continuous decision and planning for autonomous vehicles and the calculation time is very low.},

  abstract     = {Swarms composed of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a key tool in various application fields including aerial surveillance, urban search and rescue, and package delivery. In this context, trajectory planning remains one of the principal concerns regarding complex robotic applications. This paper proposes a 4D path planning algorithm based on the Fast Marching Square (FM2) method for multi-UAV teams in high-dimensional 3D environments with multiple obstacles. The 4D-FM2 algorithm integrates a time-dependent speed function within the Fast Marching (FM) framework. The proposed algorithm was tested in a simulated urban scenario and results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively plans safe, optimal solutions to the shortest path problem for UAVs while avoiding obstacles and other drones, even in complex situations. Additionally, the algorithm excels in providing smooth speed profiles for the vehicles. Furthermore, the study also successfully evaluated the effect of various implementation parameters on the algorithm’s outcome, such as the number of concurrent missions and the velocity of the vehicles. Moreover, computational time was kept within acceptable limits, and the method demonstrated overall good performance in terms of air traffic flow. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel 4D trajectory planning algorithm that implicitly incorporates UAV movement and speed and hence the spatio-temporal realization of the path during the planning phase, leveraging the light propagation phenomenon. This approach efficiently addresses the presence of other UAVs and environmental obstacles, thereby preventing collisions and avoiding unnecessary airspace blockages.},

  abstract     = {High-quality ship kinematic information (i.e., speed and heading) is important for Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) to assess traffic situation. Presently, the ship speed and heading are derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and radar signal transmission in VTS. However, there are uncertainties on ship speed and heading estimation caused by the false echo in radar images and packet loss rate in AIS data transmission, which affects the supervision of ship navigation and its safety. To address the uncertainty on ship speed and heading estimation and enhance the supervision of the marine traffic system, this paper proposes a ship speed and heading estimation approach by using radar sequential images and AIS data fused. The proposed approach consists of three steps: 1) ship detection using radar sequential images, 2) ship tracking with inter-frame information, and 3) ship speed and heading fusion. The experimental results in selected radar sequential images of the Yangtze River show that the variance of ship speed and heading distribution at 10s sampling frequency reduce from 2.55 to 0.38, and 28.35 to 23.48, respectively. It is indicated that the proposed approach can reduce the uncertainty on ship speed and heading estimation and quantitatively describe the ship navigation status.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular edge computing, efficient strategies for model deployment and task offloading offer tremendous potential to reduce response time for machine learning inference. However, existing works do not pay much attention to that there are shared structures among different types of inference tasks. This limits the improvement in response time. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating a share-aware joint model deployment and task offloading problem for multi-task inference in vehicular edge computing. We formulate the problem with an objective to minimize the total response time of all inference requests, under constraints of per task response time, per roadside unit storage capacity, etc. We prove that the formulated problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, a time period aware algorithm, called TPA, is proposed with guaranteed approximation ratio. In TPA, an iterative approach is designed to solve the problem of maximizing system throughput during a certain time period. Then, the certain time period approximates to the minimum time period of completing all requests. The algorithms are evaluated in the environment comprising two CPUs, two GPUs, state-of-the-art multi-task learning models and the dataset of Google cluster-usage trace. Simulation results derived from this environment show that, the proposed TPA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all cases, in terms of the total response time of all requests. For example, TPA can significantly reduce the total response time by at least 73.72% for different numbers of RSUs considered, compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

The composite learning adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed via the novel prediction error to tackle the perturbation incurred by possible sensor faults. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the application of composite adaptive control to deal with sensor faults is the first attempt for marine vehicle systems. Besides, composite neural networks (NNs) are constructed to reconstruct model uncertainties. Different from the existing schemes, a concise event-triggered communication mechanism is proposed to optimize inter-vehicle communication. In particular, the time-varying parameter is introduced to dynamically adjust the event-triggered virtual control law according to the feedback of real-time actual tracking error, thereby enhancing control accuracy. Only the attitude information between the multiple vehicle members is aperiodically exchanged at sampling instants, saving communication resources. Based on the Lyapunov criterion, the semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed covering both trigger instants and continuous intervals. Two experiment results are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles necessitate prediction of future motions of surrounding traffic participants for safe navigation. However, prediction is challenging due to complex road structures and the multimodality of driving behaviors. Recent approaches usually output a fixed number of predicted trajectories, thus can hardly generalize to situations with more options and match modalities in different situations. They also rely on complex loss design and time-consuming training. This work proposes a novel map-adaptive multimodal trajectory predictor that links driving modalities, driver’s intentions, and a vehicle’s candidate centerlines (CCLs) together, rendering the predictor map-adaptive and the multimodality explainable. The predictor is derived by training an intention-aware unimodal trajectory predictor, which consists of a CCL-based goal predictor and a goal-directed trajectory completer, and a CCL scorer for estimating the possibilities of a target vehicle (TV) choosing a CCL to follow. This decomposed approach simplifies the training process and reduces the computational resources required, thereby rendering it a faster and more cost-effective alternative. Additionally, the proposed predictor has demonstrated comparable or even superior performance to traditional multimodal predictors in specific applications. Overall, the unimodal predictor presents a promising approach for practical machine learning applications, particularly when computational resources are limited.},

In this paper, an energy management algorithm for a port power system is presented, including a solar-based local power production unit serving hybrid ferries having fuel cell/battery, as well as an electric vehicle (EV) parking lot, allowing for bi-directional power flow between the port and the grid. The proposed concept enables dual integrated green transportation with the possibility of parking EVs to the lot and then continuing to journey via another green transportation option. The stochasticity regarding the photovoltaic plant (PVP) and EV behaviors are taken into consideration under a real-time rolling horizon optimization framework. Minimizing the operational cost of the port related to the energy consumption is the objective function in this novel transportation-to-transportation integration concept.

The system is composed of three deep learning modules: a model to identify whether a vehicle is present in the image, a model to localize the vehicle parts in the image, and a model to localize the damage in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each module by evaluating them on labeled datasets containing images of vehicles after an accident, some collected by the OE (Original Equipment) Insured Fleet and some acquired by users of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) mobile application. We also describe how the modules fit together with a post-processing step to aggregate outputs between the different modules across multiple user-acquired views of the accident.

Therefore, we propose to discover potential shortness of certain perception module by analyzing its worst-scenario performance. However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB. Furthermore, searching performances w.r.t different Visual ODDs are investigated and it is found that visual representations through generative adversarial network contribute to a better performance.},

  abstract     = {The urban transportation network is crucial for societal development, but it is prone to failures like congestion caused by accidents or disasters. In particular, often network-wide failure is the result of a series of cascading failures originating from a small set of individual links. To prevent such failures, it is essential to identify these critical links and take early action. However, most existing approaches in the literature for evaluating the importance of each link rely on manually designed metrics (e.g., the Network Robustness Index). These methods are time-consuming and not suitable for large-scale urban networks. Additionally, these metrics fail to accurately capture the dynamic traffic interactions influenced by vehicle movement. In this paper, we present a novel method for identifying critical links by learning effective traffic interaction representation (the spatio-temporal dependencies) among roads. By representing the network as an un-directed graph and abstracting the road links as the nodes, we introduce a temporal graph attention model to capture spatial and temporal dependence between nodes. This model combines a graph attention network and a long short-term memory neural network and produces an attention matrix, which represents traffic interactions among links. Furthermore, we propose a traffic influence propagation model to evaluate the influence of each link for the entire road network based on the traffic interaction representation. We rank the importance of links based on their influence and then identify the critical links. A real-world case study in the city of Hangzhou, China is conducted to test our method and we use the network efficiency ratio to quantify its performance. The results suggest that our method can effectively identify the critical links at different periods.},

However, DL models have been known to perform poorly on inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. Although many works have studied these adversarial perturbations in general, the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep CFP models in particular have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based CFP models under multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions; 1) we propose CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties— C onsistency a nd V alidity—of the CFP inputs that enable the detect ion of standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR); 2) we leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense; 3) we propose CVP, a C onsistent, V alid and P hysically-realizable adversarial attack, that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is in place. We also show that CVP attack considerably outperforms the adaptively modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with useful insights emerging from our work and highlight promising future research directions.},

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent transportation, growing attention has been received to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we formulate a novel passive sensing technique to obtain information on the vehicle’s direction of arrival (DOA) using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). A novel estimation method is proposed in the scenario with a receiver using only one full-functional channel, where multiple measurements for the DOA estimation are achieved by controlling the reflection matrix (measurement matrix) in the RIS. Moreover, different from the existing estimation methods, we also consider the interference signals introduced by wireless communication in the ISAC system. Then, we propose a novel atomic norm-based method to remove the interference signals and reconstruct the sparse signal. Additionally, a novel Hankel-based multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method is formulated to obtain the DOA information after the interference removal. To reduce the interference signals more efficiently and improve the performance of the sparse reconstruction, we optimize the measurement matrix to improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Finally, the theoretical Cram’er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for the ISAC system on the vehicle DOA estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance in the DOA estimation, and the corresponding CRLB with different distributions of the sensing nodes are shown. The code for the proposed method is available online https://github.com/chenpengseu/PassiveDOA-ISAC-RIS.git .},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks (VNets), vehicular federated learning (VFL) is a new learning paradigm that can protect data privacy of vehicle nodes (VNs) while training models. In VFL, the importance of data (IoD) is a key factor that affects model training accuracy. However, due to the heterogeneity of data in the VFL, it is a challenge to evaluate the quality of data owned by different VNs and design an efficient federated learning scheme to enable the VNs to complete learning tasks collaboratively. In this paper, we consider the IoD and propose a redundancy-aware collaborative federated learning (RCFL) scheme for the VFL. In the scheme, by jointly considering the data quality and the cooperation among VNs, we first design a redundancy-aware federated learning architecture to efficiently provide learning services in VNets. Then, we develop a data importance model that integrates the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) degree and the redundancy of data (RoD) to evaluate the data quality and formulate the cooperation of the VNs as a coalition game to improve their data importance, where the equilibrium of the coalition game is obtained by designing a coalition formation algorithm. After that, by considering the diversified characteristics of data and the available resources of different VNs in each coalition, a coalition-based federated learning algorithm is designed to enable the distributed coalitions to complete the learning task cooperatively with the target of improving the learning accuracy. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the IoD obtained by the VNs and the training accuracy.},

However, uncertainty exists due to complex traffic conditions and heterogeneous driving behaviors. To analyze bus operational uncertainty, transport planners and bus operators need a tool that supports multi-granular modeling, spatio-temporal representation, and interactive exploration. To meet the requirement, we present MetroBUX, a visual analytics system for $B$ us operational $U$ ncertainty $\text{e}X$ ploration. MetroBUX aligns daily bus trips and models stop-level uncertainty of bus arrival time. It has a consolidated interface with three main views: Map View for presenting the spatial distribution of uncertainty, Temporal View for tracking the evolution of uncertainty, and Trip View for inspecting uncertainty propagation. Specifically, MetroBUX enables integrated spatio-temporal analysis by connecting topological uncertainty distribution at different periods in a nested tracking graph. Furthermore, it supports interactive and hierarchical exploration, including region-, route-, trip-, and stop-level analysis. Case studies on real-world bus operational data and domain experts’ feedback demonstrate the efficiency of MetroBUX.},

An experimental study was conducted to collect the data, including fatigue levels assessed via the Karolinska sleepiness scale and heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) features. Based on an extensive statistical analysis of the collected data, significant differences in numerous HRV and EDA features were found across varying fatigue levels. Employing several machine learning techniques for classification purposes, the most favorable binary classification performance was achieved using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine classifier, with an accuracy rate of 88.7% when HRV and EDA features were utilized as inputs. Meanwhile, for three-class classification, the accuracy decreased slightly to 85.6% when employing the Random Forest classifier. These outcomes underscore the potential of HRV and EDA feature fusion in capturing diverse physiological responses to fatigue, thereby bolstering fatigue detection performance. Besides, subject-independent classification yielded an accuracy of 52.0% and 53.3%, reflecting the potential bias introduced by unobserved heterogeneity in classification models. Moreover, feature selection should be prioritized over dimensionality reduction in feature fusion endeavors to diminish feature redundancy and prevent information loss. The findings of this study could contribute to the development of reliable driver fatigue detection methodologies utilizing readily available measures of physiological response measures, such as HRV and EDA features.},

To obtain reliable vehicle data communication with the efficient use of network resources, an event-triggered mechanism based on the formation error is established, and then a distributed data-driven controller can be designed to accomplish the platoon formation control task.

Due to the low probability of exposure to risky events, the testing process is exceedingly time-consuming. To tackle this issue, we proposed a Surrogate-based Monte Carlo Method to accelerate the risk assessment for HAVs in scenario-based simulation. Surrogate Models (SMs) were utilized to approximate the outcomes of untested scenarios, hence facilitating the identification of risky scenarios. Therefore, the large number of samples required by Monte Carlo did not need to be tested entirely. Naturalistic distributions fitted from HighD data was used to generate samples. The Car-following and Cut-in scenarios were selected for the case study, as they represented two distinct testing spaces. As such, the capabilities of different SMs can be further analyzed. We proved that the performances of six mainstream SMs were greatly distinguished from each other. Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), the proven most capable SM, was combined with Monte Carlo. Compared with Monte Carlo, up to 95% of tested samples can be saved. Compared with the Importance Sampling method, another popular improvement in Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method can further save 58.1% of CPU execution time.},

However, the constrained resources and high data updating cost may degrade the performance of DT. In this paper, we trade off the data updating cost and the performance of DT to adaptively determine the resource management and computation offloading in vehicular networks. Specifically, we propose a novel vehicle to vehicle pairing prediction algorithm assisted by DT to improve the offloading decision efficiency and investigate the effect of data updating frequency on prediction accuracy. Based on the prediction results, we formulate a joint data updating frequency selection, offloading decision and channel allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the computation and communication costs. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a prediction-based stability maximum pairing algorithm to obtain the proper task offloading strategy. Moreover, a deep Q-learning network algorithm is proposed to select the optimal DT data updating frequency according to the real-time vehicular network state. Based on the obtained optimal solution, we further propose an alternating direction method of multipliers-based iteration algorithm to optimize the computation and channel resource allocation and minimize the total costs.

To enable low-latency vehicular services, an efficient resource management should consider the communication as well as the storage I/O cache resource allocation along with a data access pattern and a priority of individual vehicular services. Therefore, we focus on a joint optimization of communication and storage I/O cache resource allocation for access to data of vehicular services hosted by the edge computing servers. The proposed framework determines the data placement for the services and allocates communication and storage I/O cache resources to each service. The objective is to minimize the overall latency experienced by vehicular services for access to data. The edge computing platforms share storage and communication resources among various vehicular services, each having distinct priorities and data access rates or patterns. Hence, to reflect different priorities of services in resource allocation, our objective metric takes into account the service priority, data access frequency, and latency. We propose a feasible solution using dual relaxation considering both communication and storage latencies. The proposed solution reduces the average latency of vehicular services by up to 1.8x compared to the state-of-the-art resource allocation method for vehicular edge computing. Even more notable improvement is observed for high priority vehicular services, where the proposal leads to 2.5x lower latency compared to the state-of-the-art storage I/O cache architecture for virtualized cloud services.},

However, existing studies on relief network design have not simultaneously considered multiple relief decision stages and the uncertainties which are reduced by improved forecast accuracy as a disaster approaches. These aspects are critical for efficient relief activities. The present study investigates a new relief network design problem for predictable disasters, especially typhoons, which have become increasingly frequent and severe in recent years. It integrates facility location decisions before any specific disaster warnings are issued, relief supply deployment and evacuation decisions between a warning and the onset of the disaster, and relief supply distribution decisions after a disaster strikes. This study also considers time-dependent uncertainties of the disaster’s trajectory and intensity together. For the problem, a novel three-stage hybrid distributionally robust and robust optimization (3HDRO) model is proposed. To make it computationally tractable, the 3HDRO model is transformed into a deterministic equivalent (DE) model. A scenario-based decomposition heuristic algorithm is then designed to solve the DE model for large-scale instances. A case study of historical typhoons in Guangdong Province, China, is used to gain insights into the critical model parameters for disaster relief activities. Furthermore, experimental results on randomly generated instances demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Automatic detection and segmentation of potholes and raveling are crucial for preventive maintenance and ensuring roads structural health. However, the extraction of pavement potholes was mainly based on traditional image processing methods, which have proven to be ineffective and inaccurate. Additionally, the absence of a unified pothole and raveling dataset has resulted in the lack of benchmarks for evaluating various methods. This work makes three contributions to address these problems. Firstly, we have curated the pavement pothole and raveling distress detection and segmentation datasets. Secondly, a two-step pavement pothole and raveling detection and segmentation method was proposed. In the initial step, an automated pavement pothole and raveling detection model was developed using the modified YOLOX. Subsequently, the segmentation model, named dual self-attention segmentation network (DSASNet), was proposed to segment distress by extracting mode-sensitive features from intensity and range images using two parallel Twins-SVT self-attention branches. Moreover, we design a mid-fusion module to adaptively fuse mode-specific and scale-specific features. Finally, a pyramid pooling module (PPM) is connected to further enhance the segmentation capability for potholes and raveling of various sizes and shapes. The F1-score and Intersection over union (IoU) of the proposed DSASNet on the test set are 93.65% and 0.881, respectively, outperforming other baseline methods. Furthermore, we conduct an experiment to quantitatively compare the two-step method with the one-step method using only a single semantic segmentation model. The results demonstrated clear advantages of the proposed two-step method in terms of accuracy and efficiency for pavement pothole and raveling segmentation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a methodology combining Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-assisted kinematic motion prediction with a hybrid coding algorithm for compressing the trajectory data of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The vehicle locations after the first two time steps are predicted based on the vehicle positions at the first two time steps and the kinematic equation. The vehicle velocities and accelerations are predicted based on the vehicle locations and LSTM. The hybrid coding algorithm integrates differential coding, Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) coding and arithmetic coding. Differential coding converts the original data into the difference between the original data and the predicted data. Since the length of the original data is large but the difference between it and predicted data is small, the required space for storing the data can be greatly reduced. BCD coding converts subsequences of different lengths to the subsequences with the same length so that the original information can be correctly reproduced after decompression. Arithmetic coding expresses the information in small space by converting the character sequence into a decimal between 0 and 1. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Next Generation Simulation Trajectory dataset. The experiment results show that the compression ratio and compression rate obtained by the proposed algorithm are respectively higher and lower than those obtained by the baseline algorithms. Also, the sum of compression time, decompression time and transmission time associated with the proposed algorithm is less than that associated with most baseline algorithms and transmission without compression.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems present a new paradigm for conflict-free cooperation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at road intersections, the aim of which is to eliminate collisions and improve the traffic efficiency and ride comfort. Given the challenges of current centralized coordination methods in balancing high computational efficiency and robust safety assurance, this paper proposes an innovative conflict-free management scheme for CAVs at unsignalized intersections, leveraging safe multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Firstly, we formulate the safe MADRL problem as a constrained Markov game (CMG) and then transform the AIM problem into a CMG by carefully designing state, action, reward, and cost functions. Subsequently, we propose the Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimization (MACPO), specifically tailored to solve the CMG problem. MACPO incorporates safety constraints that further restrict the trust region formed by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, facilitating reinforcement learning policy updates that maximize performance while keeping constraint costs within their limit bounds. This leads us to introduce the MACPO-based AIM Algorithm. Finally, we train an AIM policy and compare its computation time, ride comfort, traffic efficiency, and safety with management schemes based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), and non-safety-aware reinforcement learning. According to the results, compared with the MPC and MIP methods, our method has increased computational efficiency by 65.22 times and 731.52 times respectively, and has improved traffic efficiency by 2.41 times and 1.80 times respectively. In contrast to the non-safety awareness RL methods, our method achieves a zero collision rate for the first time, while also enhancing ride comfort, highlighting the advantages of using MACPO.},

  abstract     = {Automated Vehicles (AVs) have been receiving increasing attention as a potential highly mechanised, intelligent, self-regulating futuristic mode of transport. AVs are predicted to address limitations and human factors associated with traditional modes of transportation. Beyond the typical operations of AVs which can perform rudimentary tasks, the intelligent embedded program fit in to process challenging scenarios and deep multi-dimensional/ agent intents and interaction of the roadway is the grey area yet to be explored to design an exclusive encoding of social functionality and operation in order to address human factors causing road crashes. The aim of this study is to design a data-driven prediction framework for AVs that utilises multiple inputs to prove a multimodal, probabilistic estimate of the future intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles in freeway operation. Our proposed framework is a deep multi-agent learning-based system designed to effectively capture social interactions between vehicles without relying on map information. Our approach excels in capturing the high-level behaviours of multiple vehicles and generating a multi-modal trajectory forecast. It employs a multi-headed neural architecture to learn from social interactions between vehicle pairs and generates diverse trajectories proportional to predicted target intents, thus enabling feature fusion. Additionally, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is incorporated for prediction refinement. We achieved a good prediction performance with a lower prediction error in real traffic data at highways. Evaluation of the proposed framework using the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) and HighD datasets shows satisfactory prediction performance for long-term trajectory prediction of multiple surrounding vehicles. Additionally, the proposed framework has higher prediction accuracy and generalisability than state-of-the-art approaches.},

Most studies mainly focus on the scheduling and timetabling for one EB line based on the assumption that energy consumption of a battery is linear with distance. In this study, timetabling and scheduling for multiple EB lines are investigated by considering nonlinear energy consumption due to the dynamic load of buses. The optimization objectives are to minimize the number of vehicles and total operation costs, in which the constraints include the limitations of operation range and nonlinear energy consumption of the battery and the capacity of buses can be simultaneously charged at charging stations. Further, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution set. Compared with the existing schedule, the proposed schedule can not only reduce the number of vehicles and total charging costs but also distribute the charging periods during off-peak hours to reduce the impact on the urban electricity grid.},

From cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective, this paper proposes a vehicle group based merging control method for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). A vehicle group merging control protocol considering the physical driving disturbances is designed. Two kinds of stability proofs are given, which are asymptotic stability of the system with respect to vehicle internal disturbance and string stability of the system with respect to vehicle external disturbance. Simulation results show that through vehicle group merging control in vicinity of traffic signals, the proposed method can increase the traffic flow, average speed, and reduce traffic congestion in the vicinity of traffic signals.},

  abstract     = {Extended object tracking (EOT) has attracted much attention in recent years. EOT approaches always assume that scattering centers are distributed on the boundary of or uniformly over the object extension. However, a practical distribution is complex and scattering centers can be concentrated on regions of the extension. To describe this phenomenon, a key-point-based model is proposed. It partitions a rectangular object extension into four regions that intersect at a key point. Over different regions scattering centers are assumed uniformly distributed with different densities related to the area of the regions. Thus, the overall complex distribution of regionally concentrated measurements can be described by combining the four local simple ones. The variation of the key point’s position on the object can affect the four regions in size and shape, and thus can characterize different overall distributions. Estimation of the extension amounts to that of the key point’s kinematic state, the object orientation, and the length and width of each region. Based on the proposed model, measurements are projected into two directions along with and perpendicular to the object orientation approximated by its prediction, respectively. Variances of the projected measurements in the two directions are derived to be Gamma distributed. Using the conjugate property of a Gamma and an inverse Gamma distributions, an analytical recursive estimator of the kinematic state and the length and width variables is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated using both simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {The location information of cars contains great value, but the uncontrollable characteristics of public data and the difficulty in distributing benefits derived from the potential value of the data greatly reduces the enthusiasm for data owners to share their data. In addition, the current selective disclosure schemes based on merkle tree still require large costs when there are many data items. To solve these problems, a blockchain-based framework for sharing cars’ location information applicable to the online car hailing industry is proposed in this paper, enabling the sharing of cars’ location information while protecting passengers’ privacy through selective disclosure. The combination of homomorphic encryption and probabilistic verification enables a faster batch data verification compared to other blockchain-based data sharing schemes, as well as ensures the authenticity of the data uploaded to the blockchain. The experimental results show that the proposed selective disclosure mechanism based on hash exclusive or tree has lower costs than the baseline for cases with many data items. Moreover, the proposed framework meets both security and feasibility requirements. Specifically speaking, under the constraint of 128-bits security level, the costs of time and space on the location information during one drive are at microsecond level and kilobyte level, respectively. Finally, the scheme is suitable for scenarios with higher throughput.},

It introduces smart transportation equipment called an AI-enabled vehicle smart device (AVSD) for vehicular communications.

The experiment results show that the proposed framework provides a communication environment for sustainable safety and security using the introduced smart transportation device.

In Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022), the problem of choosing the route and CSs of EVs is modeled as a non-cooperative game of selfish EVs with probabilistic decision strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a linear pricing policy that ensures global efficiency of the obtained Nash strategies of EVs in Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022) for the Smart City Coordinator (SCC). We model the problem as a hierarchical game with a SCC as the leader and EVs as the followers. The leader aims to design optimal price functions of CSs and Traffic Coordinator (TC) and impose them on the EVs to maximize the social profits of CSs and TC. In response, the followers play a non-cooperative game with coupling constraints to optimally decide on their route and charging destination. Thus, we have a Stackelberg Game (SG) between SCC and EVs and also a Nash game among the EVs in the lower level. Compared to the conventional Nash-based pricing policies, our proposed functional SG formulation enables the possibility of simultaneous and global-optimum management of traffic and CSs’ crowdedness. Moreover, we have proposed a two-level decentralized algorithm that preserves the privacy of EVs and have considered a decentralized computation for equilibrium seeking of followers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method. Finally, we carry out simulation studies on the transportation network of Sioux Falls City to compare and evaluate the proposed method.},

IoST can be applied for various applications, like weather forecasting, navigation, satellite phone, satellite TV, satellite Internet, radio, military, and many more. It requires support of mechanisms of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In an IoST communication environment, the communication among various users, satellite access points, ground stations, and smart IoT devices occur through insecure channels, i.e., Internet. Due the transmission of data over an insecure channel, various potential attacks are possible. Due to the existence of various attacks, the important data of IoST may be altered or revealed. To mitigate these issues, an authentication and key management framework for secure and intelligent transportation of IoST has been proposed (in short, SAKM-IoST). Through the proposed SAKM-IoST, a legitimate user can access the data of ground station in a secure way. The security analysis reveals that SAKM-IoST is resilient against a variety of potential threats and attacks. Additionally, SAKM-IoST’s performance is compared with other approaches that are similar in nature. It has been noted that SAKM-IoST offers robust security, in addition to extra functional characteristics. Therefore, SAKM-IoST seems to be more suitable for its deployment in the critical applications of the IoST as compared to other competing approaches.},

Under reformulated traffic demands, the intrinsic imperfections of (implementing optimization in) discrete or continuous action spaces are revealed. By comparison, hybrid action space offers a unified search space, in which our proposed method is able to better balance the trade-off between frequent switching and unsaturated release. Experiments in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios are given to demonstrate that the proposed method reduces queue length and delay by an average of 12.72% and 11.89%, compared to the state-of-the-art RL methods. Furthermore, by calculating the Gini coefficients of right-of-way, we reveal that the proposed method does not harm fairness while improving efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Passenger comfort is a crucial aspect that influences humans’ acceptance of automated vehicles. The passenger comfort score (PCS) is closely related to the passengers’ psychological states, however, comfort quantification methods based on the passengers’ psychophysics mechanism are rare. This research pioneers a passenger comfort quantification model (PCQM) specifically designed for automated vehicles, demonstrating the model’s ability to accurately quantify subjective PCS under urban LCS. Three significant contributions form the basis of this study: 1) A dataset dedicated to comfort quantification is collected. A novel PCQM based on ensemble learning of psychophysics mechanism based sub-model and encoder-transformer based sub-model is proposed. The psychophysics mechanism model is derived from Stevens’ power law. 2) As a subjective indicator, the self-reported score (SRS), which is the indicator of PCS contains considerable noise. The PCQM addresses the issue of substantial noise prevalent in the subjective SRS by incorporating a semi-supervised learning strategy, which enhances data consistency and suppresses noise. 3) The efficacy of the proposed PCQM is corroborated via deployment on an automated vehicle, where the model’s real-time predictions strongly align with SRS from onboard passengers.},

  abstract     = {Driving in adverse weather conditions is a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AV). Typical scene perception models perform poorly in rainy, foggy, snowy, and cloudy conditions. In addition, we observe transition states between extremes (cloudy to rainy, rainy to sunny, etc.) in nature with variations in adversity. It is crucial to define and understand these transition states in order to develop robust AV perception models. Existing research works on classification focused on identifying extreme weather conditions. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the transition between these extreme weather scenes. Hence, this paper proposes an approach to define and understand six intermediate weather transition states: sunny to rainy, rainy to sunny, and others. Firstly, we propose a way to interpolate the intermediate weather transition data using a variational autoencoder and extract its spatial features using VGG. Further, we model the temporal distribution of these spatial features using a gated recurrent unit to classify the corresponding transition state. Also, we introduce a large-scale dataset called the AIWD6: Adverse Intermediate Weather Driving dataset, generated for three different time intervals. Experimental results on the AIWD6 dataset demonstrate that our model efficiently generates weather transition conditions for AV technology. Also, the spatio-temporal deep neural network can effectively classify the adverse weather transition states for different time intervals.},

  abstract     = {Ground segmentation on the 3D point cloud is fundamental to many applications, such as SLAM and object segmentation. As it is usually a preprocessing module of these applications, high efficiency and accuracy are the basic requirements for guaranteeing the whole system’s performance. To this end, we avoid ground fitting and region division on the 3D point cloud. We propose a pixel-wise image-based method named DipG-Seg, which projects the 3D point cloud onto two cylindrical images, horizontal range- and z- images, then segments based on them. To realize fast and accurate ground segmentation, we first introduce innovative designs for image-based features. Specifically, we improve the slope feature with consideration of the LiDAR model and propose combining features with different sizes of receptive fields for better recognition of the ground. Then, based on these features, we devise a pre-segmenting pattern for pixel-wise classification. For fine segmentation, we devise a hierarchical refinement framework integrating a nonlinear filter and majority-vote kernel-based convolution, which is demonstrated to enhance the accuracy by over 7% on the basis of pre-segmenting. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on a real-world platform, SemanticKITTI, and nuScenes datasets. The results have demonstrated that our method can achieve an accuracy of 94.41% and a speed of 127 Hz on 64-beams LiDAR, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods and guaranteeing competitive robustness.

  abstract     = {Railway transportation, as a pillar of modern civilization, unavoidably suffers from external risk factors such as natural disasters, track breakages, and train collisions, which lead to substantial loss of life and property. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design a mechanism for warning and preventing railway accidents in order to diminish costs. We propose an add-on solution to the current system, which equips a train with a multifunctional pilot vehicle in the front: the vehicle pilots its mother train, warning it of impending danger, and stopping it if required. Specifically, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a wireless communication device to converse with the mother train, a ranging device for measuring the real-time distance from the mother train, a camera to capture the railway conditions ahead and recognize anomaly situations, and other sensors (e.g., collision detector and tiltmeter) to monitor its own conditions. Based on the above equipment, an efficient autonomous driving method is designed for the pilot vehicle to adjust the distance from the train. The autonomous driving problem can be formulated into a multi-objective functional optimization, where the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption and the experienced jerk of the pilot vehicle, and the decision is a continuous-time function that represents the traction or braking force imposed on the pilot vehicle. Additionally, a vision-based deep learning method is devised to automatically detect the mentioned railway anomalies using the ego-view camera of the pilot vehicle. To control the operational and maintenance costs, we propose to deploy pilot vehicles only for trains running in potentially dangerous environments, e.g., mountainous areas during rainy days. By implementing the proposed scheme, we anticipate a reduction in accident rates within railway systems.},

Motivated by the above, this paper proposes an aerial-ground integrated vehicular networking architecture, based on which a UAV-vehicle collaboration perspective is proposed. Specifically, an emerging vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collaboration framework is first presented to facilitate diverse vehicular applications. Next, we investigate the coverage radius maximization problem by optimizing the UAV-BS altitude. Meanwhile, by taking the channel state information (CSI) feedback delay into account, we formulate a V2U communication sum rate maximization problem by optimizing the power control and spectrum allocation, which is constrained by the capacity and reliability requirements. Then, we derive the closed-form expression of optimal UAV-BS altitude. Afterwards, we decouple the formulated sum rate maximization problem, and devise an efficient algorithm with polynomial complexity, where the optimal power control and spectrum sharing are solved. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the maximum coverage radius and optimal UAV-BS altitude can be achieved by our proposed scheme in different urban environments. In addition, our designed scheme can effectively improve the V2U communication sum rate in comparison with the current works.},

  abstract     = {Train delays have been a serious persisting problem in the UK and also many other countries. Due to increasing demand, rail networks are running close to their full capacity. As a consequence, an initial delay can cause many knock-on delays to other trains, and this is the main reason for the overall deterioration in the performance of the rail networks. Therefore, it is really useful to have an AI-based method that can predict delays accurately and reliably, to help train controllers to make and apply alternative plans in time to reduce or prevent further delays, when a delay occurs. However, existing machine learning models are not only inaccurate but more importantly unreliable. In this study, we have proposed a new approach to build heterogeneous ensembles with two novel model selection methods based on accuracy and diversity. We tested our heterogeneous ensembles using the real-world data and the results indicated that they are more accurate and robust than single models and state-of-the-art homogeneous ensembles, e.g. Random Forest and XGBoost. We then verified their performances with an independent dataset from a different train operating company and found that they achieved the consistent and accurate results.},

An encoder-decoder network structure is adopted. The encoder, which has shared convolution layer parameters and private batch normalization layer parameters (parameter sharing scheme), is used to extract features from RGB and thermal images. The extracted features are then fused by spatial and channel attention. The output of each residual block is fused, and the self-learning weight is used to integrate the fusion information of all residual blocks of the same levels. Subsequently, the fused features are integrated through a feature integration (FI) module in the decoder. Cross-entropy supervision of segmentation and edge is performed on the outputs of the decoders. Our proposed method is evaluated and compared with 17 state-of-the-art image segmentation methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively on the MFNet dataset which includes various objects in urban scenes. The results show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods by at least 0.3% and 1.8% in MRecall and MIoU, respectively, providing foundations for the development of autonomous driving technologies for safety enhancement.},

  abstract     = {The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) enables life-like motion in simulators resembling real driving. Regenerated motions must adhere to workspace constraints. Vehicle motion signals (linear acceleration, angular velocity) are generated in a simulated vehicle environment utilised in MCA for motion cues. These signals are categorised into levels (slow, medium, fast) based on frequency and amplitude. The commonly used MCA, the classical washout filter, is typically fine-tuned using worst-case (fast-driving) scenarios to meet the simulator’s requirements across various situations. However, this approach reduces the MCA’s effectiveness in handling slower driving scenarios, resulting in conservatism in platform workspace usage for slow and medium driving. Consequently, a noticeable motion sensation error arises between real vehicle drivers and motion simulator users. To rectify this issue, a novel neural network-based MCA is developed in this study. Three distinct classical washout filters are meticulously tuned to cater to slow, medium, and fast driving scenarios. These filters generate precise motion cues for simulator users at corresponding levels of driving scenarios. The neural network-based MCA is constructed using the synthesised signals from these classical washout filters. This proposed method is thoroughly validated through the utilisation of MATLAB software. In direct comparison with the standard classical washout filter, the proposed MCA significantly reduces the motion sensation error, enriches motion fidelity, and optimises the utilisation of the simulator’s workspace.},

GoA4 requires trains to autonomously adapt their behaviour to the different driving conditions occurring in real-world trips and involving a wide range of possible maneuvers, even in the presence of unexpected events forcing ETCS interventions. To ensure this high automation level, we propose a hierarchical, modular and scalable control architecture, named Autonomous Driving Function (ADF). It embeds the main ATO functionalities, i.e., optimization of the recommended speed profile and train speed tracking, both nontrivial tasks due to train nonlinear dynamics and complex external environment, while being still compliant with railway standards. Hence, ADF is devoted to the real-time trajectory planning, considering the actual data acquired and the current driving situation along with the related on-line constraints, and to the trajectory tracking which, realized via different classes of controllers, ensures a safe and efficient train motion, also compliant with the railway standard. ADF is designed according to the Model Based Control Design (MBCD) approach which fully covers the V-Cycle development process and supports automatic C code generation compliant to standard EN50128, early design validation, testing, simulation and run-time verification. Finally, thanks to the experimental validation, carried out on an inspection high speed prototype vehicle, ADF has the prospect of becoming an inherent architecture for guaranteeing the GoA4 autonomous diving for HST over ETCS.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have shown their remarkable effectiveness in learning navigation policy for the mobile robot navigating in a human crowded environment. Moreover, attention mechanisms coupled with DRL allows the robot to identify neighbors with different level of influence and incorporate them into the robot’s decision. However, as the crowd density increases, attention mechanisms may fail to identify critical neighbors which can lead to significant drops in navigation efficiency. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by encoding both human-human and human-robot interaction using a special class of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) known as Message-Passing GCN (MP-GCN). In contrast to existing methods, where attention between robot and humans are encoded uniformly, the proposed approach named MP-GatedGCN-RL encodes asymmetric interactions using the combination of novel message-passing function and edge-wise gating mechanisms. We evaluate our approach on the simulated environments of ETH/UCY pedestrians datasets consisting of different scenarios like collision avoidance, group forming, diverging, crossing, and so on. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional benchmark dynamic avoidance method ORCA with a 20.6% increase in success rate and a 9.1% reduction in navigation time. Moreover, we also achieve a 5.5% enhancement in success rate compared to other state-of-the-art DRL-based methods without any additional labeled expert data nor prior supervised learning.},

The car-following behaviors of HDV are statistically calibrated using the Next Generation Simulation dataset. In a typical single-lane car-following scenario where AVs and HDVs share the road, the longitudinal speed control of AVs can substantially reduce the energy consumption of the following HDV by avoiding unnecessary acceleration and braking. Moreover, apart from the objectives including car-following safety and traffic efficiency, the energy efficiencies of both AV and HDV are incorporated into the reward function of reinforcement learning (RL). The specific driving pattern of the following HDV is learned in real-time from historical speed information to predict its acceleration and power consumption in the optimization horizon. A comprehensive simulation is conducted to statistically verify the positive impacts of AV on the holistic energy efficiency of the mixed traffic flow with uncertain and diverse human driving behaviors. In freeway driving scenarios, simulation results indicate that the holistic energy efficiency is improved by an average of 6.03% and 6.41% compared to the reference control algorithms, specifically, RL without HDV consideration and model predictive control.

  abstract     = {Rail corrugation is a type of track geometry irregularity that induces sharp noise and reduces the service life of track components. The traditional manual inspection method of corrugation detection requires high labor costs. In general, the rail corrugation status of subway lines can be divided into three types according to wavelength: short wave, medium wave and healthy. Corrugation with different degrees of deterioration has different values of wave depth. To achieve more efficient and intelligent inspection, this study proposes a multitask learning method to detect metro rail corrugation by using in-vehicle responses and noise data. To this end, we develop a portable vehicle-mounted device to collect car body acceleration and vehicle interior noise. Second, we propose a data fusion method based on a 1/3 octave general vibration level of acceleration and noise data. Third, we develop a multitask learning model based on convolution and attention techniques that have two task towers: corrugation wavelength classification and wave depth regression. Finally, we apply the real-world data to the proposed framework. The results show that compared with single-task learning, the proposed multitask learning has a better performance in corrugation detection tasks. The $F_{1}$ score of wavelength classification increased from 0.762 to 0.971, an increase of 27%; the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of wave depth regression decreased from 12% to 4.96%, a decrease of 59%. In addition, the training time consumption can be reduced by up to 66%.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a platoon access authentication system for initial access process in autonomous vehicle platoons (AVPs) in which post-quantum encryption and signal processing techniques are employed to protect against both active and passive cyber-physical attacks. To avoid passive quantum cyber attacks, a quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check code is used to encode and decode AVP messages. Moreover, an independent component analysis-based signal separation technique is employed to eliminate the effect of high-power active cyber attacks on AVP messages. To measure the reliability of the system, we derive an analytical expression for the system failure probability, taking into account the influence of both the cyber and physical planes. The simulations show that the proposed system is effective against attacks and can help reduce system failures caused by intentional and unintentional adverse cyber-physical effects. The proposed system offers a potential solution to the challenge of protecting initial access while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications between AVPs and the infrastructure.},

In this paper, we propose a Two-Stage Coordination (TSC) strategy, which consists of a high-level leader module and a low-level action executor. The former provides the robots with the topology and geometry of the environment, which are crucial for robots to learn “where” they should go and avoid invalid coverage. Based on the observed information and the environmental topology, the latter module takes primitive action to reach the sub-goal. To facilitate cooperation among the robots, we aggregate local perception information of neighbors from different hops based on graph neural networks. We compare our method with state-of-the-art multi-robot coverage approaches. Experiments and supporting ablation studies show the superior efficiency, scalability, and generalization of our algorithm especially in unseen style and scale of scenes, and an unseen number of robots.},

In the past, swept path analysis was used to analyze the trajectory of the vehicle’s movement. It is, however, a very time-consuming process. Additionally, these analysis tools do not support omnidirectional vehicles, such as the self-propelled modular transporters, which transport oversize loads. The purpose of this research is to develop a simple simulator for an omnidirectional body and a simulation-based automated feasibility evaluation system to address these problems. The DQN agent moves the vehicle and then labels the training data of the binary classifier. DQN is trained quickly and effectively using curriculum learning and a conditional reward function. Through these auto-generated labels, a binary classifier can be trained with an AUC up to 0.9606. DQN agent-based automated labeling sometimes compensates for human manual labeling errors, which is one of the most compelling findings. Furthermore, binary classifiers are about 1000 times faster than conventional swept path analysis methods. This study introduces a system for determining the transportation feasibility of oversize loads efficiently and quickly.},

We propose a new approach based on group authentication to handle authentication of several units simultaneously while protecting privacy in an IoV environment. The proposed protocol is designed to perform an authentication and handover process of multiple users within a predefined group. The group authentication based approach ensures privacy of users as the group members’ identification is systematically redefined after each group exchange process. Thus, the proposed scheme is designed to offer a promising solution to security challenges within the IoV environment by simultaneously addressing scalability and protecting the privacy of user data. Additionally, our scheme is resistant to various types of attacks, including offline ID attacks, replay attacks, location spoofing attacks, and replay attacks. Comprehensive tests have been conducted and the results are presented in the analysis section, both in terms of the computational cost and the running times, which reveal that the proposed method demonstrates remarkable practicality when compared to the existing approaches.},

Given its recent advent, we still need to understand its actual operation and efficiency, and the corresponding result from users. This work contributes to this aim, providing a novel metric, the time-based utilization rate of the fleet, to measure the performance of e-scooter services. Its time-based nature implies a novel approach in the field, separating from traditional approaches that use the number of trips as the basic variable. We will mathematically demonstrate that these metrics are approximations of the exact value we provide as they intrinsically depend on the time interval they select for the calculation. In order to feed our method, we have retrieved e-scooter data from an operator (Helbiz) in Atlanta (USA) and Rome (Italy), corresponding to February 2021. These data include the state of each e-scooter in time, which allows us to precisely know whether they were used, out of service, or parked. Results show utilization rates of the fleet of 0.2021 % and 0.3310 %, respectively and high percentages of out of service vehicles that exceed 25 %. However, this inefficiency was not reflected in the profitability of the business. The economic analysis we conducted shows revenues close to 1 million euros in Rome, which may detach profitability from efficiency.},

  abstract     = {It is essential to quantitatively evaluate road safety compliance through the modeling of three-dimensional geometric information of in-service roads to automatically guide the determination of driving speeds in intelligent transportation. A novel methodology is presented for reliably estimating 3D geometric elements and assessing geometry-related safety. A point-octree-normal-vector (PONV) network is developed to cope with the heterogeneous density of point clouds from mobile and terrestrial laser scanning and reduce possible failures caused by the disordered rotation of points. The points on road surfaces are adaptively segmented into stripes without data loss. Road horizontal elements, cross-sectional slopes and longitudinal slopes are estimated independent of alignment variations based on a concave hull algorithm, a cubic B-spline algorithm and a total least-squares method. A road safety compliance assessment related to the radius of curvature, average gradient, rate of curvature changes and side friction factors is conducted. Warning and suggested driving speeds are thus provided. Experiments show that the PONV network achieved superior performance in extracting road surfaces, with accuracy, precision, recall, and mean intersection-over-union scores of 98.1%, 89.7%, 89.3% and 82.5%, respectively. The geometric elements with neighboring distances in meters were basically consistent with those in traditional surveys and raw point clouds. Through comparison with safety guidelines, suitable vehicle operation speeds were suggested in road sections with unreasonable rates of curvature changes and side friction factors. This work can be applied for constructing road information models and automatically guiding driving speeds with high-definition maps on autonomous vehicles.},

We develop a control scheme such that under certain conditions, the regulation of the intervehicle distances in desired values can be guaranteed. Specifically, we rigorously show that if the probability of receiving the required data for each vehicle is not zero, then under the proposed control strategy, the intervehicle distances almost surely converge to the desired values. Accurate performance of radars is a key assumption in the existing results in the literature on cooperative adaptive cruise control. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is that under the proposed control strategy, the robustness of the platoon against stochastic data loss in both communication network and vehicles radars is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Wind speed forecasting provides the upcoming wind information and is important to the safe operation of High-Speed Railway (HSR). However, it remains a challenge due to the stochastic and highly varying characteristics of wind. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based method for short-term wind speed forecasting, named WindTrans. Two major cruxes are addressed. First, the task is performed on fine-grained wind speed gathered from multiple sensors. These data present dynamic intra-series and inter-series correlations, which are hard for previous methods to recover. We advance a Transformer-based deep learning model, which has two distinctive characteristics: (1) a graph encoder, which captures the dynamic spatial correlation among wind speeds at different locations, and (2) a temporal decoder to model long sequence wind speed time series, which is resistant to noise in time series. Second, wind speed patterns gradually evolve in long-term periods, thus deactivating prediction models trained on historical data. To tackle this bottleneck, we put forward an experience replay-based scheme to renew the model regularly. To ensure that the renewed model still dominates historical wind patterns, we store and replay only a small portion of historical data named episodic memory. A simple but efficient strategy is designed to constitute episodic memory and thus relieve the computation burden. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches. Particularly, WindTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to 36.7%, 29.3% and 13.3% improvement in MAPE measure for 1 hour ahead prediction on 10-minute, 5-minute, and 1-minute-based tasks, respectively. Furthermore, via our continual learning scheme, the model retains competitive performance with only 6.9% datum stored and retrained on.},

The experiments indicate that decisions concerning cable installation could influence data signal to noise by up to ~10 dB.

  abstract     = {The common-line operation of trains with different speed levels can significantly reduce the transport capacity of the line, so improving the transport capacity of the mixed running line has become a continuous research topic. China has successfully solved the problem of mixed running of passenger trains (fast) and freight trains (slow) on the same line affecting transportation capacity through the use of signal three-aspect and four-aspect technologies on the ordinary speed railway. This manuscript aims to reduce the impact of mixed running of trains at different speed levels on the transportation capacity of high-speed lines by changing the railway signaling system. A novel Incremental Track Circuit Adaptive Dynamic Coding method (I-TCADC) is proposed. This method adds Object-oriented Track Circuit Coding (OTCC) function, using different codes for trains with speed levels of 350km/h and 250km/h. OTCC can effectively shorten the tracking interval distance of mixed trains and improve the transportation capacity of mixed running lines. This manuscript explains the principle of improving the transport capacity of the mixed running line and verifies efficiency by establishing the cellular automata model of train tracking operation. Taking Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway as an example, compare the transport capacity before and after adopting this method by the deduction coefficient method.},

  abstract     = {A serious concern in high-speed railways’ operation and maintenance is crack initiation and propagation in welded rail joints. Piezoelectric sensors, which emit and receive ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs), can be useful in a real time intelligent monitoring of these critical spots. However, such smart sensors are highly sensitive to environmental and operational conditions. Herein, the impact of static and cyclic loads on guided waves propagating in a welded rail specimen was experimentally investigated, and the difference between damage and loading effects was discussed. Twelve PZTs were mounted on different parts of the rail section, including the rail web and top and bottom of the rail foot to generate or receive UGW signals. Time-frequency analysis and time-domain signal processing were used to demonstrate the signal changes under loading conditions. The group velocity of various parts of the rail section remained almost constant for frequencies above 300 kHz. The time of flight (TOF) of the second wave packet measured by the straight transducer pair was a reliable indicator of damage to the rail edge. According to signal processing results, the short-time temporal coherence feature extracted from the oblique transducer pair was effective in discriminating structural damage from various loading conditions.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative sensing and heterogeneous information fusion are critical to realize vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs). This paper makes the first attempt to quantitatively measure the quality of VCPS by designing a new metric called Age of View (AoV). Specifically, we first present the system architecture where heterogeneous information can be cooperatively sensed and uploaded via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in vehicular edge computing (VEC). Logical views are constructed by fusing the heterogeneous information at edge nodes. Further, we formulate the problem by deriving a cooperative sensing model based on the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue, and defining the AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness and consistency of the logical views. On this basis, a multi-agent difference reward based actor-critic with V2I bandwidth allocation (MDRAC-VBA) solution is proposed. In particular, the system state includes vehicle sensed information, edge cached information and view requirements. The vehicle action space consists of the sensing frequencies and uploading priorities of information. A difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed to divide the system reward, which is defined as the VCPS quality, into the difference reward for vehicles. Edge node allocates V2I bandwidth to vehicles based on predicted vehicle trajectories and view requirements. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the superiority of MDRAC-VBA.},

It is much significant for platoon of electric vehicles (EVs) powered by hybrid energy storage system (HESS). HESS which is composed of battery and supercapacitor (SC), has been implemented to improve energy efficiency by regulating the distribution of internal energy sources. Different from most existing works on energy management for EVs, this paper is concerned with a bi-level control strategy for platoon’s velocity planning and HESS management. The upper layer focuses on the cooperative velocity planning for platoon to guarantee internal stability of individual vehicle and platoon robust string stability. The optimal velocities for each vehicle in the platoon could be determined by using distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method. The safety condition and the constraint on communication delay are considered. In the lower layer, a rolling horizon optimization method is proposed to optimize the power of HESS with the assistance of planned velocities in the upper layer.

  abstract     = {Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) technology has been widely used for real-time path travel time estimation. For a study path equipped with AVI sensors at both ends, the difference between the timestamps of vehicles entering and leaving the path is AVI data. In urban areas, there can be several alternative routes and vehicle entry/exit points for the study path. Consequently, invalid AVI data occur that fall outside the scope of the travel time of the study path. Some AVI technologies based on identification information of vehicles can match vehicles precisely. However, for cities like Hong Kong with concerns of privacy issues, only commercial vehicle data can be collected. Under this scenario, the resultant AVI data are accurate but with few valid samples in a relatively short time interval due to the unavailability of private car data. The estimation accuracy of path travel times on a real-time basis will then be affected significantly by the existence of invalid AVI data. In this paper, a novel unsupervised algorithm is proposed to filter out real-time invalid AVI data efficiently although there is no ground truth available for training purposes. It is tested and compared with other benchmark algorithms on two selected paths in the Hong Kong urban road network. It is found that the proposed unsupervised algorithm can still filter limited but accurate AVI data with satisfactory performance. Sensitivity tests with ground truth are also conducted with different sampling rates. Some insightful findings are given for filtering AVI data under various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {An emerging public health application of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies is to reduce response times of emergency medical service (EMS) by indirectly coordinating traffic. Therefore, in this work we study the CAV-assisted corridor clearance for EMS vehicles from a short term deployment perspective. Existing research on this topic often overlooks the impact of EMS vehicle disruptions on regular traffic, assumes 100% CAV penetration, relies on real-time traffic signal timing data and queue lengths at intersections, and makes various assumptions about traffic settings when deriving optimal model-based CAV control strategies. However, these assumptions pose significant challenges for near-term deployment and limit the real-world applicability of such methods. To overcome these challenges and enhance real-world applicability in near-term, we propose a model-free approach employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for designing CAV control strategies, showing its reduced overhead in designing and greater scalability and performance compared to model-based methods. Our qualitative analysis highlights the complexities of designing scalable EMS corridor clearance controllers for diverse traffic settings in which DRL controller provides ease of design compared to the model-based methods. In numerical evaluations, the model-free DRL controller outperforms the model-based counterpart by improving traffic flow and even improving EMS travel times in scenarios when a single CAV is present. Across 19 considered settings, the learned DRL controller excels by 25% in reducing the travel time in six instances, achieving an average improvement of 9%. These findings underscore the potential and promise of model-free DRL strategies in advancing EMS response and traffic flow coordination, with a focus on practical near-term deployment.},

  abstract     = {Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is critical for the further popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). However, overlooking physical limits of LIBs may cause quick health degradation or even catastrophic safety issues. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a hybrid multi-physics-constrained charging strategy for LIBs combining an active set method (ASM)-based model predictive control (MPC) and a rule-based method. A general form of the optimal charging problem is constructed as a constrained quadratic program (QP) to balance the charging rapidity, thermal safety, and battery degradation. Enabled by this formulation, the cost-efficient ASM is proposed to solve the optimization problem, which virtually gives a safety- and health-aware fast charging strategy. Comparative results suggest that the proposed strategy outperforms the traditional MPC solutions remarkably in terms of the computational tractability. Long-term cycling experiments validate the superiority of the proposed strategy in the optimal balance among the charging rapidity, thermal safety, and life extension.},

In this paper, by incorporating the random characteristic of traffic flow, we formulate the problem of perimeter traffic flow control for a multi-region traffic network as a Markov decision process with adaptive state definition. Based on stochastic macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFD) of regions, a state transition probability model is proposed to describe the state changes of the multi-region traffic network under different perimeter control policies. With the stochastic MFD-based state transition probabilities rather than counting from the historical data, a policy iteration algorithm with perturbation analysis is introduced to get the optimal perimeter control policy in real-time without the requirement of online or offline learning. The proposed method is compared with the classic perimeter control methods by simulation, which indicates its effectiveness in mitigating the congestion and improving the network throughput, as well as the promising implementation prospect.},

  abstract     = {During navigation, people may deviate from an already planned path. Possible reasons include traffic congestion, difficulty in following instructions, or personal preferences, as evidenced by studies in human spatial cognition and transportation. Most path planning methods provide users with a single path, for example the shortest one, while a few give the user a set of paths to choose from. In the latter case, once a path from the given set is chosen, the rest are discarded. If the user were to deviate from the planned path, alternatives may not exist or may cause a significant delay to the user. Services such as Google Maps continuously monitor possible alternatives, but they may offer a path with no alternatives or few and lengthy ones. Taking a proactive approach to finding alternatives, we introduce the most flexible path – a path that maximises the number of alternatives the user has along a given path. This way, users may choose to take a different path midway and be more likely to have alternative paths available to them. Straightforward approaches to obtaining such a path have a prohibitive computational complexity. We introduce a set of algorithms that yield exact and approximate solutions to this problem. We then showcase the most flexible path’s time-saving reroutes in a traffic congestion scenario.},

A wind-sensorless solution, i.e. a solution not using direct wind measures, is proposed. More precisely, by modeling the wind disturbance as a fully unknown input signal, an input-state observer is derived using only information about the vehicle’s longitudinal speed and lateral pose relative to the road. The observer is characterized by a simple structure, explicit closed-form, direct implementability on a micro-controller, and dead-beat property, i.e. it ensures the convergence of the estimation error in a finite time. Moreover, leveraging on the reconstructed wind data, a backstepping wind-compensation controller is also proposed, allowing asymptotic tracking of a path with desired curvature and providing the end-user with a free control parameter specifying the desired tracking speed. Formal proofs of the estimation error and tracking error convergence are given. Performance evaluation of the proposed solution is obtained in simulation by closing in the loop the full nonlinear model of a real racecar, the Robocar system, with the proposed estimation and control method. Both the estimator and the controller are shown to outperform existing solutions, even in the presence of noisy measurements.},

Recently, many studies of ride-hailing planning that leverage machine learning techniques have emerged. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview on latest developments of machine learning-based ride-hailing planning. To offer a clear and structured review, we introduce a taxonomy into which we carefully fit the different categories of related works according to the types of their planning tasks and solution schemes, which include collective matching, distributed matching, collective repositioning, distributed repositioning, and joint matching and repositioning. We further shed light on many real-world data sets and simulators that are indispensable for empirical studies on machine learning-based ride-hailing planning strategies.

  abstract     = {With the continuous growth of the global economy and markets, resource imbalance has risen to be one of the central issues in real logistic scenarios. In marine transportation, this trade imbalance leads to Empty Container Repositioning (ECR) problems. Once the freight has been delivered from an exporting country to an importing one, the laden will turn into empty containers that need to be repositioned to satisfy new goods requests in exporting countries. In such problems, the performance that any cooperative repositioning policy can achieve strictly depends on the routes that vessels will follow (i.e., fleet deployment). Historically, Operation Research (OR) approaches were proposed to jointly optimize the repositioning policy along with the fleet of vessels. However, the stochasticity of future supply and demand of containers, together with black-box and non-linear constraints that are present within the environment, make these approaches unsuitable for these scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Configurable Semi-POMDPs, to model this type of problems. Furthermore, we provide a two-stage learning algorithm, “Configure &amp; Conquer” (CC), that first configures the environment by finding an approximation of the optimal fleet deployment strategy, and then “conquers” it by learning an ECR policy in this tuned environmental setting. We validate our approach in large and real-world instances of the problem. Our experiments highlight that CC avoids the pitfalls of OR methods and that it is successful at optimizing both the ECR policy and the fleet of vessels, leading to superior performance in world trade environments.},

  abstract     = {Due to the significance of air traffic delay propagation in the operational robustness of air transport systems, it has recently received increased attention from both industry and academia. The purpose of delay propagation analysis is to capture the dynamic traveling trajectories of root delays in air traffic networks. Few studies have investigated delay propagation while taking consideration of temporal context information, leading to incomplete traveling trajectories of root delays. In this paper, a novel systematic framework based on temporal causal inference is proposed to model delay propagation in airport networks. More specifically, considering the lagged nature caused by the transition time in delay propagation, a fully-connected delay propagation network based on transfer entropy is developed. Additionally, a causal biased random walk is embedded to explore the temporal cascading effect of root delays in air transport systems and to generate delay propagation trees for each airport. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset indicate that our framework is able to effectively model the dynamic evolution of air traffic delays in an airport network with acceptable performance. This paper also presents a real-world case study of the Chinese airport network, which reveals that the traveling trajectories of air traffic delays differ significantly at various daily delay levels and airport throughput.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the shareability and spatial-temporal imbalance of free-floating bike-sharing (FFBS), the users may fail to pick up the bike at the desired location (i.e., the demand is truncated). Consequently, the demand partially migrates to nearby areas or is lost. Thus, the observed demand recorded in the system is not the underlying real demand. To address this issue, a framework for Demand Recovery considering demand Truncation, Migration, and spatial Correlation (DRTMC) was proposed. In detail, the real demand recovery is first modeled as a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) problem. Then, the prior term and conditional term in MAP are formulated to jointly consider the demand truncation, migration, and spatial correlation. Finally, a tailored simulated annealing approach is applied to estimate the real demand. We then present the results using simulation data for validation and real-world data for empirical analysis. The validation results indicate that the demand recovered by the DRTMC model is much closer to the real demand value than the observed demand, and it performs better than all the benchmarks. For the case study, the FFBS data from Shanghai City in a prosperous area is chosen. It shows the distribution of observed demand is significantly different from that of real demand, emphasizing the importance of real demand recovery. The proposed DRTMC model enables researchers to capture the underlying real demand for FFBS and develop more effective rebalance strategies to improve FFBS service levels.},

  abstract     = {As delivery companies continue to explore the use of drones, the need for efficient and safe operation in urban environments becomes increasingly critical. Market-wide versions of drone delivery services will necessarily spread many drones, especially in big cities. In this scenario, avoiding collisions with other drones or typical obstacles in urban spaces is fundamental. This paper proposes and evaluates, via simulation and analytical modeling, an aerial delivery service scenario and three autonomous geometric approaches for collision avoidance. We compare our approaches with three simple methods – DoNothing (not detouring), Random, and aviation-like Rightward – and two state-of-the-art geometric approaches. Simulation experiments consider different fleet sizes with constant and Poisson drone arrival rates and drones randomly choosing one of different altitudes for the cruise flight. Contrary to our expectations, the Random and Rightward approaches increase the collisions compared with DoNothing, making the latter our baseline. Our approaches significantly reduce collisions in all experiments and deal with more drones within the detection radius, showing that collisions are more complex to avoid. Comparing the collision rate, successful trips, and the number of flying drones reveals that the efficiency in avoiding collisions reduces the number of successful trips by increasing the number of active drones. Regardless of the expected reduction in collisions, more altitudes do not eliminate them. These results indicate the need for more sophisticated approaches to reduce or eliminate collisions. The analytical modeling using Markov Chains corroborates the simulation results by shedding some light on and helping explain the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a sequential clustering quadratic programming (SCQP) method for the energy management strategies of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this method, the clustering algorithm is introduced to gather up the points with a smaller iteration step size in the iteration process. The clustering results are utilized to design the termination criterion based on the distance between the cluster centers of various iteration domains. In the case that the distance varies within the preset range, it indicates that the current iteration point is sufficiently close to the optimal point. So that the criterion turns to terminate the computation to reduce unnecessary iteration steps. To analyze the convergence of the method with the designed criterion, the mathematical illustrations are proposed. In the mathematical illustrations, the monotonicity of the clustering objective function is firstly given. Then, the theorem of feasibility for the solution obtained by the designed criterion is proved. On the basis of aforementioned conclusions, the convergence of the SCQP method is obtained. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is validated both in simulation test and hardware-in-loop (HIL) test. The simulation results reveal that the PHEV achieves 8.81% and 7.74% less fuel consumption under two driving cycles. And the average iteration number of the proposed method is obviously reduced compared with the conventional SQP. The HIL results reveal that the proposed strategy exhibits similar performance in both real controller and simulation. The energy saving and real-time performance can be verified.},

  abstract     = {Lane changing is a complex, yet extremely common driving manoeuvre. Studying lane changes can provide insight into how long drivers wait after activating their turn signal before changing lanes - a time that we call time-to-lane-change-initiation (TTLCI). TTLCI can offer valuable insights into driver behaviour prior to changing lanes. However, a better understanding of TTLCI, particularly in real-world settings, is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated TTLCI using driving data collected on public roads in Gothenburg, Sweden. We used the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method and the mixed-effect Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model (statistical techniques from survival analysis) to comprehensively analyze TTLCI and identify factors that significantly influence it. The results of the K-M method indicate that most lane changes were initiated within two seconds of activating the turn signal. The mixed-effect CPH model showed that the speed of the lane-changing vehicle, the type and direction of the lane change, the presence of lead and lag vehicles, and the lag gap were all significant factors. These findings provide new insights into pre-lane-change behaviour and pave the way for future studies, in part by improving current lane change models. Moreover, the findings have implications for future regulations concerning turn-signal usage by human drivers. Additionally, our results can contribute to the development of algorithms for autonomous vehicles by improving their ability to detect imminent lane changes by surrounding vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Pavement performance prediction is the foundation of maintenance decisions, which is the key problem of infrastructure management. Most prediction methods focus on section-based and annual deterioration on pavement, while it is hardly supporting daily and preventive maintenance plans. To fill in gaps in pavement forecasting for refined maintenance, this paper introduces a prediction model which is fine-grained on both temporal and spatial scales. Due to the coupling effects and action delay of multiple environmental factors, it is difficult to fathom and model the detailed deterioration process of pavement. Another problem is there are rare refined pavement datasets opening to public for research. Therefore, we establish a high-frequency and real-world pavement dataset and causal discovery is brought in to explicate the inner mechanism of the process. The proposed model first applies Partial Mutual Information from Mixed Embedding (PMIME) method for causal discovery, obtaining a causal graph and impact delays between factors and pavement performance. Based on this, we use an advanced pavement performance prediction model called Causal-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (CTGCN), combining the Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) and the Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs) to capture causal features and temporal features simultaneously. We validate CTGCN model using collected datasets with two predictive time lengths. The experimental results prove that CTGCN model has better performance in both prediction accuracy and robustness than the state-of-art baseline.

Monocular-based 3D detection methods are more cost-effective and practical than stereo-based or LiDAR-based methods. Monocular image 3D detection methods have garnered considerable attention from researchers. However, the impact of occlusion scenarios of the objects on the keypoints prediction is often overlooked. To address this issue, the present paper proposes a novel 3D monocular object detection method named MonOAPC, which is equipped with occlusion-aware plane-constraints. This method can adaptively utilize partial keypoints to infer the plane location of the object based on the level of occlusion and highlights that the introduction of plane constraints is advantageous for the 3D detection task. First, the plane information of the object in 3D space is beneficial to optimize the keypoints regression, and considering that each plane holds different significance, an adaptive plane location inference module is proposed to enhance the keypoints location regression. Second, a novel co-depth estimation module is proposed to jointly estimate the object’s spatial location through various depth inference methods, thereby improving the generalization of the object depth estimation. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the accuracy of 3D object detection can be indirectly improved by introducing plane information to promote keypoints regression, and that plane information is effective for monocular 3D detection. The experimental outcomes show that the MonOAPC method can attain competitive results.},

To overcome this difficulty, this work aims to develop a dynamic OA system using an improved instance segmentation network for high-precision detection. To improve the segmentation accuracy of accessible paths for PSVI users, it proposes a new 2D convolution unit that couples multi-scale receptive fields of deep features. This unit focuses on the global context of an input image by constructing a hierarchical residual-like structure. To improve the efficiency of exploration, this work adopts a bidirectional A* algorithm with safety distance constraints to plan optimal paths for PSVI users, thus avoiding their trial-and-error path finding. To ensure safety, it proposes a collision avoidance algorithm based on regional safety analysis, which can generate and transmit timely vibration response to users.

  abstract     = {The accurate and efficient vessel draft reading (VDR) is an important component of intelligent maritime surveillance, which could be exploited to assist in judging whether the vessel is normally loaded or overloaded. The computer vision technique with an excellent price-to-performance ratio has become a popular medium to estimate vessel draft depth. However, the traditional estimation methods easily suffer from several limitations, such as sensitivity to low-quality images, high computational cost, etc. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning-enabled computational method (termed MTL-VDR) for generating highly reliable VDR. In particular, our MTL-VDR mainly consists of four components, i.e., draft mark detection, draft scale recognition, vessel/water segmentation, and final draft depth estimation. We first construct a benchmark dataset related to draft mark detection and employ a powerful and efficient convolutional neural network to accurately perform the detection task. The multi-task learning method is then proposed for simultaneous draft scale recognition and vessel/water segmentation. To obtain more robust VDR under complex conditions (e.g., damaged and stained scales, etc.), the accurate draft scales are generated by an automatic correction method, which is presented based on the spatial distribution rules of draft scales. Finally, an adaptive computational method is exploited to yield an accurate and robust draft depth. Extensive experiments have been implemented on the realistic dataset to compare our MTL-VDR with state-of-the-art methods. The results have demonstrated its superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The computational speed exceeds 40 FPS, which satisfies the requirements of real-time maritime surveillance to guarantee vessel traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {Model predictive control is a real-time energy management method for hybrid energy storage systems, whose performance is closely related to the prediction horizon. However, a longer prediction horizon also means a higher computation burden and more predictive uncertainties. This paper proposed a predictive energy management strategy with an optimized prediction horizon for the hybrid energy storage system of electric vehicles. Firstly, the receding horizon optimization problem is formulated to minimize the battery degradation cost and traction electricity cost for the electric vehicle operation. Then, the optimal control sequence is solved to obtain the power allocation between the battery and the supercapacitor. Furthermore, the effect of different horizons on the optimization results is analyzed under diverse operating conditions, determining the optimal horizon to balance the system costs and computation burden. Compared with the short horizon, the optimal horizon can achieve 5.2%~8.5% performance improvement with the acceptable computation time approaching 1s.},

  abstract     = {Preceding vehicles typically dominate the movement of following vehicles in traffic systems, thereby significantly influencing the efficacy of eco-driving control that concentrates on vehicle speed optimization. To potentially mitigate the negative effect of preceding vehicles on eco-driving control at the signalized intersection, this study proposes an overtaking-enabled eco-approach control (OEAC) strategy. It combines driving lane planning and speed optimization for connected and automated vehicles to relax the first-in-first-out queuing policy at the signalized intersection, minimizing the host vehicle’s energy consumption and travel delay. The OEAC adopts a two-stage receding horizon control framework to derive optimal driving trajectories for adapting to dynamic traffic conditions. In the first stage, the driving lane optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using dynamic programming, which takes into account the uncertain disturbance from preceding vehicles. In the second stage, the vehicle’s speed trajectory with the minimal driving cost is optimized rapidly using Pontryagin’s minimum principle to obtain the closed-form analytical optimal solution. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the OEAC. The results show that the OEAC is excellent in driving cost reduction over constant speed and regular eco-approach and departure strategies in various traffic scenarios, with an average improvement of 20.91% and 5.62%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Existing methods for video object segmentation (VOS) have achieved significant success by performing semantic guidance, spatial constraint, or temporal consistency. However, VOS still remains highly challenging because it is difficult to collaboratively leverage spatial constraint, temporal consistency, and semantic guidance while reducing redundant information. In this paper, we propose an efficient unified spatio-temporal dynamic routing (STDR) framework to address VOS by achieving a better spatio-temporal balance while avoiding redundancy. Specifically, our unified spatio-temporal modeling contains three paths: 1) short-term spatial path is employed to mine the spatial constraints from the previous frame; 2) long-term semantic path is used to capture semantic cues from the first reference frame with ground-truth labels; 3) memory queue path is designed to efficiently exploit the temporal consistency of middle frames with a compact memory bank of constant size. To enhance the input of each path, we introduce a progressive contextual memory enhancement module to exploit the contextualized memory with growing receptive fields by progressively aggregating spatial contextual information from adjacent frames for each memory frame. Furthermore, we design a dynamic memory-routed module to globally refine the outputs of our three paths for unified modeling. Enhanced by the proposed modules, our STDR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fast speed on the DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017 Val/Test, YouTube-VOS 2018/2019, and real-world long-video benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Under a premise of universal rigidity, the affine formation control method based on stress matrix can solve the formation maneuvering problem well. However, a failure of the agent in the system can easily destroy this condition of rigidity. Consequently, a fault-tolerant affine formation control problem for multi-agent systems (MASs) with partial loss-of-effectiveness (PLOE) and bias faults is investigated. In this paper, a neural network-based hierarchical fault-tolerant affine formation (NN-HFAF) control strategy is proposed for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs. Firstly, some virtual systems are built as a link between leaders and followers. The virtual systems affinely locate their target positions in the formation maneuvers through the real-time positions of leaders. Then, an adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed for followers to tracking the virtual systems. It can effectively prevents the impact of a few agent failures from spreading to the whole network. And the system dynamics of agents in the network are considered to be heterogeneous. Moreover, radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NNs) are introduced to approximate the nonlinear functions of dynamic systems, the computational burden is reduced by adopting the single parameter learning mechanism. Finally, the numerical simulations are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of autonomous driving and SLAM technology, the perception system of a vehicle heavily relies on laser and image sensors to capture the real-world scenario and avoid obstacles autonomously. To achieve accurate and robust multi-sensor fusion computation, high-precision extrinsic calibration of camera and laser scanner is a necessary requirement. Traditional multi-sensor calibration methods based on manual features rely on specific scenarios and may not provide feature information over long distances. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly calibrating the extrinsic parameters of a solid-state(SS) lidar-camera system in a natural environment. Our proposed method begins with obtaining robust line feature information. we first innovatively employ a super-voxel clustering method to extract global 3D line features from the complete point cloud and then back-project these 3D line features into 2D space. Afterward, a transformer-based edge detection network, EDTER, is used to detect the edge features and estimate the probability pixel-by-pixel. To consider the uncertainty of two-dimensional line features and the inconsistency of residuals at different distances, we construct a line feature weight model for line feature residual calculation. Finally, we minimize the residual errors using least squares optimization to recover the relative pose of the camera and the lidar sensor. We conducted a performance study to compare our proposed method against existing targetless calibration methods on various natural scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher robustness, accuracy, and consistency, making it suitable for real-world applications.},

This study models driving intentions and future driving speeds at urban intersections and improves model prediction performance by considering traffic environment characteristics. Key feature parameters including environmental characteristics are first extracted through driving behavior analysis and existing research experience. Then models with different input combinations are constructed to explore the effectiveness of different factors in predicting driving intention and future speed. In particular, in vehicle speed modeling, a target detection algorithm is used to identify traffic participants. Based on the identified traffic participant and vehicle position information, a new method for speed prediction that can reflect the dynamic interaction characteristics between the driver and the traffic environment is proposed. Models are trained and tested using natural driving data from China. Finally, the models with the simplest input and the best effect are determined. The driving intention recognition model can accurately predict the driving maneuvers of straight-ahead, stopping, turning left and right 4 seconds before reaching the intersection. The speed prediction model can significantly improve the speed prediction accuracy, and shows stronger robustness and adaptability than existing models.

First, a novel predictive spacing strategy (PSS) is proposed for vehicles that are described by a third-order heterogeneous dynamics model. The PSS utilizes the current velocity information of each vehicle to predict its travel distance forward, thereby enhancing the control performance of the vehicle platoon. Second, the vehicle platooning problem is equivalently transformed into a leader-following consensus (LFC) for multi-vehicle system by introducing new variables, and in this way a distributed linear control protocol with a generalized structure is proposed. Then, we cleverly employ a linear transformation based on a directed spanning tree (DST) to further convert the consensus problem into an asymptotic stability problem with partial variables of the equivalent system. On this basis, the conditions for achieving platoon control in the multi-vehicle system are derived in conjunction with the partial stability theory, and the conditions for the system to satisfy string stability are further deduced. In addition, a method for solving the gain matrix in the control protocol is elaborated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed PSS and the designed protocol is verified by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining future traffic state evolution information is critical to traffic control algorithms design and further to intelligent transportation systems. However, accurately predicting traffic state evolution is not an easy task, although the traffic prediction-related study attracted a lot of attention. This study develops a macroscopic traffic flow model-integrated deep learning framework (MTFD) for the high-resolution temporal-spatial traffic state dynamic propagation on a road network, integrating temporal-spatial traffic dependency, traffic flow theory, and data analysis techniques. First, traffic state propagation on every road Section is mathematically described by the CTM model given traffic initial and boundary conditions. Next, a temporal-spatial traffic dependency attention (TSTD) recurrent neural network is developed to predict boundary conditions factoring the traffic temporal-spatial dependency. Also, this paper develops a graph theory-based method to capture the temporal-spatial traffic dependency among the traffic on neighboring road sections. Last, the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is introduced to adjust the predicted traffic state at an intersection to satisfy the conservation law. The numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed method predicts the traffic state evolution in a freeway network within 30 minutes with accuracy varying from 75%-95%. It has a better performance compared to the tested baseline models (APTN, Graph CNN-LSTM, and so on). The experimental results also illustrate that factoring traffic dependency and integrating data assimilation techniques can improve prediction accuracy.},

These models are typically trained to minimize error on averaged test cases and produce a single-point prediction, such as a scalar value for traffic speed or travel time. However, single-point predictions fail to account for prediction uncertainty that is critical for many transportation management scenarios, such as determining the best- or worst-case arrival time. We present QuanTraffic, a generic framework to enhance the capability of an arbitrary DNN model for uncertainty modeling. QuanTraffic requires little human involvement and does not change the base DNN architecture during deployment. Instead, it automatically learns a standard quantile function during the DNN model training to produce a prediction interval for the single-point prediction. The prediction interval defines a range where the true value of the traffic prediction is likely to fall. Furthermore, QuanTraffic develops an adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts the prediction interval based on the location and prediction window of the test input. We evaluated QuanTraffic by applying it to five representative DNN models for traffic forecasting across seven public datasets. We then compared QuanTraffic against six uncertainty quantification methods. Compared to the baseline uncertainty modeling techniques, QuanTraffic with base DNN architectures delivers consistently better and more robust performance than the existing ones on the reported datasets.},

  abstract     = {Due to the small radar cross Section (RCS), pedestrians are typical low-observable traffic participants for radar-based automotive perception systems. The early detection and understanding of pedestrians’ activities are of great significance to automotive safety. To this end, this paper presents an end-to-end joint tracking and activity estimation (RETA) system based on 4D automotive radar, which deals in particular with pedestrian activity identification under cluttered real-world scenes. Firstly, a novel integrated detection and tracking algorithm is proposed to guarantee positioning accuracy, in which all unthresholded 4D radar measurements are incorporated to explore the spatial coherent information across multiple frames, avoiding weak target information loss. After that, to discriminate continuous activities with varying durations in sequential trajectories, this paper innovatively presents a decomposed connectionist recurrent convolutional neural network, which facilitates fused temporal-spatial motion feature extraction. Especially, the labor-consuming activity pre-segmentation problem is circumvented with the help of a connectionist temporal classification algorithm in the proposed neural network. At last, RETA can be implemented for real end-to-end perception applications. Extensive experiment results highlight its superiority and effectiveness by attaining a continuous recognition accuracy of 94.8%.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the joint optimization problem of multistage pricing and seat allocation integrating pre-sale period division in high-speed railways (HSRs), taking the fluctuation of daily demand and the interaction between pricing and seat allocation into account. To maximize railway revenue, we establish an elastic demand function for each day, and then formulate a non-linear mixed integer optimization model, which considers real-life constraints, including price time and space relationships. The complex capacity sharing in HSRs and multistage pricing increase the scale of the optimization problem; the inclusion of pre-sale period division further complicates this. Therefore, we propose a multi-level comprehensive optimization method that decomposes the joint problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem optimizes multistage pricing and seat allocation under the given pre-sale period division scheme obtained from the second subproblem, while the second subproblem optimizes the pre-sale period division scheme by adjusting the period boundary between two adjacent periods to generate a new pre-sale period division scheme. Then, three algorithms are designed. Algorithm 1 optimizes the first subproblem based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Algorithm 2 optimizes the pre-sale period division scheme, with a high-quality initial solution given by Algorithm 3 . Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the high quality and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithms, which could provide decision support for railway ticket pricing. When there are five periods, the total revenue increases by 3.11% and 2.59% for small and large-scale instances, respectively; the total passenger kilometers increase by 21.21% and 19.42%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous ego localization and surrounding object motion awareness are significant issues for the navigation capability of unmanned systems and virtual-real interaction applications. Robust and accurate data association at object and feature levels is one of the key factors in solving this problem. However, currently available solutions ignore the complementarity among different cues in the front-end object association and the negative effects of poorly tracked features on the back-end optimization. It makes them not robust enough in practical applications. Motivated by these observations, we make up rigid environment as a unified whole to assist state decoupling by integrating high-level semantic information, ultimately enabling simultaneous multi-states estimation. A filter-based multi-cues fusion object tracker is proposed for establishing more stable object-level data association. Combined with the object’s motion priors, the motion-aided feature tracking algorithm is proposed to improve the feature-level data association performance. Furthermore, a novel state estimation factor graph is designed which integrates a specific feature observation uncertainty model and the intrinsic priors of tracked object, and solved through sliding-window optimization. Our system is evaluated using the KITTI dataset and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art object pose estimation systems both quantitatively and qualitatively. We have also validated our system on simulation environment and a real-world dataset to confirm the potential application value in different practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Complex vehicle-track coupling relationship with respect to time and space, leads to underlying challenge for the reliable evaluation of vehicle dynamic characteristics in superconducting electrodynamic suspension (EDS) train, especially for the track fitted with propulsion, levitation and guidance (PLG) coils. To calculate the electromagnetic interactions considering different cross-connections, an analytical method is deduced and synthetically verified via finite element simulation and experiment data in this paper. Secondly, multi-body dynamic mathematical model with 66-degree of freedom (DOF) is established to simulate a more realistic operating condition of the train, and its reliability is validated by Universal Mechanism (UM). Afterward, resorting to back-propagation (BP) neural networks algorithm, the mapping relationship is predicted among the spatial attitude of magnetic unit and electromagnetic interactions, to improve the efficiency of variable stiffness dynamic model. Finally, the electromagnetic interactions and track irregularities are input into the dynamic model as external disturbances to investigate the vehicle dynamic characteristics of diverse cross-connections for PLG coils. The results indicate that, the decrease of cross-connection cables can shorten the construction cost of track, but it comes at the expense of lateral stability for head and tail cars. Hence, it is imperative to carefully consider the trade-off between track cost and train stability during the design and layout process.},

Although Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches have achieved dramatic success in the motion planning of a large number of AMRs, the available RL-based motion planning approaches cannot provide a safety guarantee for the remaining functional AMRs if some of the AMRs are out of control. To this end, this paper develops a scalable Multi-agent RL (MARL) with Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based shields algorithm. The MARL with CBF-based shields algorithm can address complex high-level tasks by MARL and deal with the safety issue of every single functional AMR by a low-level CBF-based shield. A CBF-based shield is designed for every single functional AMR to ensure that the action of the functional AMR is safe, even if an uncontrollable AMR is pursuing the functional AMR. Experiments are conducted based on simulated warehouse environments to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of a safe RL-based motion planning approach (The safe RL-based motion planning approach developed in this study is demonstrated in a video: https://youtu.be/I7ja5nFVpY4 ). developed according to the MARL with CBF-based shields algorithm.},

However, current approaches have yet to demonstrate sufficient scenario generality and observation generality, hindering their wider utilization. To address these limitations, we propose a unified benchmark simulator for RL algorithms (called IDSim) to facilitate decision and control for high-level autonomous driving, with emphasis on diverse scenarios and a unified observation interface. IDSim is composed of a scenario library and a simulation engine, and is designed with execution efficiency and determinism in mind. The scenario library covers common urban scenarios, with automated random generation of road structure and traffic flow, and the simulation engine operates on the generated scenarios with dynamic interaction support. We conduct four groups of benchmark experiments with five common RL algorithms and focus on challenging signalized intersection scenarios with varying conditions. The results showcase the reliability of the simulator and reveal its potential to improve the generality of RL algorithms. Our analysis suggests that multi-task learning and observation design are potential areas for further algorithm improvement.},

This study introduced a novel framework for traffic density estimation using Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for time series data. The study used two datasets collected from a three-leg intersection in Greece and a four-leg intersection in Germany. The model was built to predict the density in an approach of the signalized intersection using features extracted from the other approaches. The results showed that the highest accuracy was achieved when only probe vehicle data was used. This implies that relying solely on probe vehicle data from two approaches can effectively predict traffic density in the third approach, even when the Market Penetration Rate (MPR) is low. The results also indicated that having Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information may not be necessary for high accuracy in traffic estimation and that as the MPR increases, the model becomes more predictable.},

  abstract     = {Optimal planning of power distribution systems with local resources is crucial to meet energy demand and avoid disruptions in energy supply for consumers. This requires the system operators to manage available resources and utilize suitable risk management tools to control and study uncertainties and their potential consequences. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based optimization framework based on the robust optimization and scenario methodology for optimal sizing and siting of electrical vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the flexibility introduced by EVCSs and gain financial profit for the operator of the power distribution system through reducing power losses and offering services to electricity markets. To handle the uncertainties posed by different resources, two risk measures are employed simultaneously. The uncertainty originating from the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is addressed through stochastic programming, while the robust optimization method (ROM) enables the operator of the power distribution system to be informed of the consequences of uncertainty in electricity load. Therefore, appropriate strategies can be taken to tackle the uncertainties while keeping the system operation stable and gaining financial profit. Thus, three strategies are studied in the proposed model as follows: risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-taker. In addition, the non-linear terms in power flow modeling were linearized through a set of linear functions which transforms the proposed model to a MILP problem. The IEEE 33-bus test system under different levels of load uncertainty and considering the uncertainty in SOC of EVs is utilized to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results highlight the efficiency of the proposed model in considering uncertainties and taking advantage of the consideration of different risk attitudes by the decision-maker that ROM provides for the optimal operation of the power distribution system.},

  abstract     = {Automation in the area of ship navigation and course planning is adversely affected by oceanic conditions. It leads to deviation from the set course, damages the ship structure, and reduces overall efficiency. Autopilot in ships can keep the ship on course but is unable to choose an efficient path in real-time. Varying wave height is one of the most prominent causes that lead to this inefficiency in the ship’s autopilot system. Current state-of-the-art methods in the domain include building machine and deep learning-based models to estimate wave height. However, the existing systems have several limitations, such as difficulty in handling abrupt non-linear and chaotic variations present in the data, low generalizability, noise sensitivity, and many more. To resolve this issue, the current study proposes a hybrid approach involving a combination of Variable Mode Decomposition and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model (VMD - BiLSTM) and its integration to the ship’s autopilot system. The VMD-based data decomposition enables deep learning models to smoothly and accurately capture observed variational components present in the data, contributing to improved accuracy. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art prediction models validates the efficiency and reliability of the proposed prediction approach.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles and robots require increasingly more robustness and reliability to meet the demands of modern tasks. These requirements specially apply to cameras onboard such vehicles because they are the predominant sensors to acquire information about the environment and support actions. Cameras must maintain proper functionality and take automatic countermeasures if necessary. Existing solutions are typically tailored to specific problems or detached from the downstream computer vision tasks of the machines, which, however, determine the requirements on the quality of the produced camera images. We propose a generic and task-oriented self-health-maintenance framework for cameras based on data- and physically-grounded models. To this end, we determine two reliable, real-time capable estimators for typical image effects of a camera in poor condition (blur, noise phenomena and most common combinations) by evaluating traditional and customized machine learning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Furthermore, we implement the framework on a real-world ground vehicle and demonstrate how a camera can adjust its parameters to counter an identified poor condition to achieve optimal application capability based on experimental (non-linear and non-monotonic) input-output performance curves. Object detection is chosen as target application, and the image effects motion blur and sensor noise as conditioning examples. Our framework not only provides a practical ready-to-use solution to monitor and maintain the health of cameras, but can also serve as a basis for extensions to tackle more sophisticated problems that combine additional data sources (e.g., sensor or environment parameters) empirically in order to attain fully reliable and robust machines.},

  abstract     = {Absolute pose regression has shown great potential in LiDAR localization, which learns to regress 6-DoF LiDAR poses through deep networks. However, recent regression methods suffer from scene ambiguities in challenging scenarios, leading to inaccurate and unstable localization. Inspired by neurobiological localization mechanisms, i.e., the firing mechanism of place cells, head-direction cells, and grid cells in mammalian brains, we propose a novel LiDAR localization framework called NIDALoc to achieve more robust and accurate results. First, we propose a Hebbian memory module, motivated by place cells, to preserve historical information, which helps refine local view features to reduce scene ambiguities. Specifically, the memory module stores scene information and then recalls it when revisiting an old place. Second, we propose a novel pose constrained framework, consisting of an orientation classification task and a grid center regression task, to regularize orientation and position estimation, respectively. The framework based on head-direction cells and grid cells constrains the absolute pose regression to reduce wrong predictions. Extensive experiments on two outdoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NIDALoc, which outperforms state-of-the-art localization methods, especially in large-scale challenging scenes.

In the dynamic modeling stage, the separate models of system components including the load and vehicle carriers are firstly established at the lower level. Then the internal and external constraints corresponding to the system topology and the transportation task are designed to integrate separate models at a higher level. In the system control stage, a distributed collaborative control law is proposed based on the closed-form constraint forces, with which the load can follow the external constraints actively and the carriers can maintain the internal constraints passively. In order to overcome the influence of time-varying multi-source uncertainties of the system on control effectiveness and stability, an adaptive robust control term is designed based on the Lyapunov min-max approach. Both uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the constraint-following error are guaranteed. Comprehensive validations show that our propose scheme can significantly reduce the modeling complexity despite the strongly coupled topology and nonlinearity of the system, as well as achieving more precise and robust trajectory following control compared with the baseline methods.},

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem utilizes sensors and interconnected devices to transmit essential information, facilitating effective real-time application deployment. The collected information of sensors is required to be encrypted before uploading to the cloud to protect IoV users’ privacy. However, after achieving data confidentiality and authenticity, existing data encryption schemes in IoV have not considered data sharing and data search in the multi-receiver scenarios, such as with various devices in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Retrieval of the needed data accurately from large masses of encrypted data in IoV and then sharing the ciphertext with a group of devices is a challenge that should be solved with priority. To address challenges, this paper makes the first attempt to achieve data sharing and data retrieval at the same time and proposes an efficient multi-receiver data authorization with data search (MR-DADS) scheme in this article. In our MR-DADS, when facing data sharing in IoV, the data owner is able to search the needed encrypted data and then share retrieval results with several IoV devices securely in batches. Furthermore, our scheme utilizes the technique of no pairing encryption technology to reduce the overhead. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure against the Type-I and Type-II adversaries in the random oracle. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with related works from aspects and the analysis shows our scheme is efficient and practical.},

This paper focuses on real-time train scheduling for urban rail transit networks considering uncertain time-dependent passenger origin-destination demands. First, a macroscopic passenger flow model we proposed before is extended to include rolling stock availability. Then, a distributed-knowledgeable-reduced-horizon (DKRH) algorithm is developed to deal with the computational burden and the communication restrictions of the train scheduling problem in urban rail transit networks. For the DKRH algorithm, a cost-to-go function is designed to reduce the prediction horizon of the original model predictive control approach while taking into account the control performance. By applying a scenario reduction approach, a scenario-based distributed-knowledgeable-reduced-horizon (S-DKRH) algorithm is proposed to handle the uncertain passenger flows with an acceptable increase in computation time. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed DKRH and S-DKRH algorithms based on real-life data from the Beijing urban rail transit network. The simulation results indicate that DKRH can be used to achieve real-time train scheduling for the urban rail transit network, while S-DKRH can handle the uncertainty in the passenger flows with an acceptable sacrifice in computation time.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the potential of improving the overall traffic and energy efficiency by properly controlling a proportion of controllable connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed traffic corridor. Specifically, we develop a control framework that optimizes controllable CAV trajectories taking into account other vehicles for simultaneously improving traffic throughput and reducing the total energy consumption of all vehicles. The property of the control framework is firstly analytically examined in a simplified and tractable scenario where a human-driven vehicle (HV) follows a CAV. We found that the optimal acceleration is larger if one emphasizes more on improving travel distance within the optimization horizon, or smaller when one emphasizes more on saving energy. The continuous-time optimization model formulation is then discretized, which is solved for real-time application in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion. In numerical studies, the proposed method is tested in various scenarios, e.g., with/without an intersection, under different proportions of controllable CAVs, possible vehicle permutations, and varying overall traffic intensities. Numerical results show that the normalized energy consumption can be reduced by up to 45% and the average travel time reduced by 65%, showing a significant improvement in the road throughput. Notably, even with a limited number of controllable CAVs, the proposed method can achieve a promising performance, e.g., about 20% controllable CAVs can achieve half the benefits of a fully controllable CAV environment.},

  abstract     = {Motion Prediction (MP) of multiple surroundings agents is a crucial task in arbitrarily complex environments, from simple robots to Autonomous Driving Stacks (ADS). Current techniques tackle this problem using end-to-end pipelines, where the input data is usually a rendered top-view of the physical information and the past trajectories of the most relevant agents; leveraging this information is a must to obtain optimal performance. In that sense, a reliable ADS must produce reasonable predictions on time. However, despite many approaches use simple ConvNets and LSTMs to obtain the social latent features, State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models might be too complex for real-time applications when using both sources of information (map and past trajectories) as well as little interpretable, specifically considering the physical information. Moreover, the performance of such models highly depends on the number of available inputs for each particular traffic scenario, which are expensive to obtain, particularly, annotated High-Definition (HD) maps. In this work, we propose several efficient baselines for the well-known Argoverse 1 Motion Forecasting Benchmark. We aim to develop compact models using SOTA techniques for MP, including attention mechanisms and GNNs. Our lightweight models use standard social information and interpretable map information such as points from the driveable area and plausible centerlines by means of a novel physics-based heuristic step based on kinematic constraints, in opposition to black-box CNN-based or too-complex graphs methods for map encoding, to generate plausible multi-modal trajectories achieving up-to-pair accuracy with less operations and parameters than other SOTA methods.

In view of the abundant renewable energy resources and hydrogen equipment in the ports, a multi-source output hydrogen storage coordination system in the ports is built to achieve the purpose of carbon reduction. From the perspective of multi-energy and low-carbon economic operation in the ports, an optimal operation method of multi-source output in the ports based on the optimal carbon emission flow(CEF) is proposed to take into account both carbon emission and economy. Based on the calculation method of the nodal carbon intensity of the power system, the calculation model of the carbon potential of the electric energy storage device and the electric hydrogen conversion device under the new power system is defined; Then, a multi-objective function with the lowest carbon emission and the maximum system economic benefit is established considering the influence of the charging and discharging depth and the number of cycles of the energy storage device; Finally, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to analyze a ports scenario integrated with new energy, electric energy storage equipment, and electric hydrogen conversion equipment. The results show that the proposed optimal operation method can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of the ports and improve the economy of the power system in the ports.},

Several unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are proposed previously in the literature; however, lack of proper ground truth labels for traffic data has been always a substantial barrier to deploy and evaluate them. In this paper, we introduce a concept named Temporal Positioning of Flow-Density Samples (TP-FDS) that can be used by domain experts for fast and reliable traffic data labeling. We mathematically show that deviations in two-dimensional TP-FDS completely reflect point and subsequence anomalies previously defined in the literature of time series data. Furthermore, benefiting from this concept, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework with the help of Fast Angle Based Outlier Detection (Fast-ABOD) to be used for traffic data. Extensive data labeling experiments are conducted with the opinions of 20 different experts. Implementation of several machine learning algorithms, like KNN, OC-SVM, iForest, and LOF, is also adapted with two different setups of hyper-parameters to be used in the proposed framework. Results indicate that our framework integrated with Fast-ABOD is able to detect anomalies in traffic data better than other machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms with more than 72% and 96% of F1 score and AUC.},

We propose a multimodality cross-guided compensation coordination network (MC3Net) for accurate red–green–blue and thermal (RGB-T) crowd counting. The network includes modules of intricate interactive fusion, feature difference compensation, and complementary attention enhancement. We use ConvNext as the backbone and process the three streams from RGB, thermal, and spliced RGB-T inputs. The multimodality data are sequentially guided and fused hierarchically, fully combining features extracted from the RGB and thermal images. Thereafter, difference compensation is applied to compress fusion and splicing features. Redundant information is removed. Then, feature mismatch is mitigated to enhance complementary information, reduce the loss of details, and finally obtain crowd statistics. Results from extensive experiments on the RGBT-CC dataset indicate the robustness and effectiveness of MC3Net, which also achieves high performance on the DroneRGBT dataset and ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset, outperforming existing crowd counting methods.

At first, the traction control mechanism of the DMCS on a bisectional road was analyzed, and the configuration superiority to improve vehicle trafficability was proved. Then, a new online self-seeking optimal traction control strategy with variable- $\beta $ sliding mode extreme value search algorithm ( $\beta $ _SES) was proposed. At last, the feasibility and superiority of the DMCS on improving the vehicle dynamics performance under the proposed control strategy are verified by the simulation and test. The results also show that, without considering the influence of tire parameters, the proposed traction control strategy can effectively suppress the steady-state fluctuations of the sliding mode extreme value search algorithm (SES) and improve the search speed.

To our best knowledge, this is the first study to model the driver decision behavior of the cut-in process. Cut-in experiments are conducted to collect the decision and control data of drivers under one- and two-target-vehicle scenarios, which both include sixty sub-scenarios with different initial velocities, accelerations, or positions of the vehicles. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in simulating the driver decision behavior of the cut-in process by comparing the experimental and simulation results under various scenarios over different subjects. Besides, we analyze the effects of some model parameters on the model performance to show their ability to represent different driving styles.},

  abstract     = {Parking semi-trailer train in extremely narrow environments pose challenges due to high nonholonomic constraints, unstable reversing dynamics, and non-convex obstacle avoidance constraints. This paper presents the APTEN (Autonomous Parking of semi-Trailer train in Extremely Narrow environments) with a three-layer framework to address these challenges. In the first layer, we employ a linearized gain scheduling method to create a stable Cl-RRT planner tailored for simplifying unstable reverse dynamics. This planner is adept at promptly warm starting the following homotopy problems. In the second layer, we introduce a novel “dynamics–full dimensional obstacle avoidance” progressive constraint approach. Modifying the constraints of nonlinear programming in separate homotopy problems not only protects the solver from falling into unfeasible local optima but also significantly enhances computational efficiency. In the third layer, a differentiable approach based on convex set separation is employed to establish full-dimensional obstacle avoidance constraints for semi-trailer train. Leveraging the warm start solutions obtained from the previous two layers, the algorithm identifies the optimal solution that strictly adheres to the obstacle avoidance constraints in an extremely narrow environment. The simulation results demonstrate that APTEN excels in parking motion planning within extremely narrow environments, exhibiting the shortest solution time, the highest trajectory quality, and exceptional adaptability to diverse working conditions.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic target tracking technology has a broad application prospect in marine transportation, intelligent marine monitoring, border and coastal defense, etc. However, most target tracking guidance systems designed for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) lack automatic obstacle avoidance capabilities, which limits their tracking performance. To address this challenge, this paper investigates target tracking guidance for USVs in the presence of obstacles. In order to track the target, the sensors fixed on the bow of the USVs need to be oriented toward the target, especially when the USV is sufficiently close to the target. For this purpose, a bias proportional navigation guidance law with look angle constraints is presented for guiding the follower USVs to orient and approach the moving target. In order to navigate the USVs along a safe route to avoid obstacles, the obstacle profile angle constraint is formulated into the guidance law by solving the bias function with final angle boundary conditions. The field experimentation takes place in a 40-meter-wide and 80-meter-long section of the Huchuntang River. Here, a USV equipped with the proposed guidance law effectively tracks a moving target while navigating around obstacles. Results indicate that the proposed guidance law is capable of tracking the object, avoiding obstacles, and orienting the USV to the target at the final time.

  abstract     = {Traffic management and sustainable mobility are the central topics for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). By means of modern technologies, it is possible to collect real-time traffic flow data to extract useful information to monitor and control vehicular traffic. On the other hand, costs to obtain this piece of information are high. It requires either direct measures in the network road by installing large number of sensors (more precise data) or acquiring data from international providers supplying data coming from onboard units, mobile app, navigators, etc. In current paper, this problem has been addressed providing a solution granting traffic flow data in each road segment of the whole network by reconstructing the computation by means of data from few scattered traffic sensors in fixed positions of the road network. The proposed approach combines the solution of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with machine learning for improving the state-of-the-art solutions of PDE. The result has been a higher precision with respect to PDE-based solutions, and a strongly reduced execution time. Several different machine learning models have been compared for such a purpose, demonstrating the general viability of the hybrid architecture proposed. The research result has been obtained in the framework of both the Sii-Mobility national project on transport systems, and MOST, the National Center on Sustainable mobility (both funded by the Italian Ministry of Research), by exploiting the Snap4City platform.},

  abstract     = {The Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is considered to be a promising technology to improve the traffic congestion. However, to realize its expected benefits, the real-time, accurate and forward-looking guidance message are required. Based on this, considering various practical constraints and the characteristics of the CAVs fully, multiple distributed edge computing servers are deployed at the network edge to provide the real-time storage and computation support in our paper. Furtherly, based on the fruitful deployment for edge computing servers, an efficient traffic flow online prediction model is constructed, which can adaptively modify according to the dynamic changes of the actual road traffic state, thus providing more accurate and forward-looking results. The simulation results based on MATLAB platform show the proposed deployment scheme for edge computing servers only needs more cost than the enumeration method. Moreover, compared with other baseline methods, the online prediction model proposed can improve 37.5%–76.9% in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, content-centric network has been evolved as one of the most popular technologies of the modern era, facilitating cache content-based data sharing, especially in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks. However, to get benefits from content-based caching services, it is essential to match the service providers with service requesters optimally during high mobility vehicles scenarios. Most of the existing literature proposals for this problem are based upon the centralized architecture, which may be vulnerable to congestion matching operations, with a lack of trustworthiness among nodes. Also, a content holder may spread fake information about content availability to requesters, which may affect the performance of any implemented solution in this environment. In this paper, we model the two-sided preferences of both parties (service providers and requesters) to maximize the cache content sharing using content centric network (CCN) communications. Then, we formulated a decentralized matching problem with joint transmit power of both the content providers and requesters. The framed matching game involves aspiration level and agreement functions for both the parties. Finally, a distributed blind matching algorithm (BLMA) is also proposed, which is executed by deploying a smart contract on the Ethereum network without involving an intermediate authority. Moreover, we provide the theoretical analysis on the number of successive iterations for convergence of the proposed BLMA algorithm. To verify and validate the effectiveness of the proposal, we compare it with three benchmark schemes and evaluated its performance with respect to average individual utility, latency, and energy consumption on the benchmark data sets. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is superior in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art solutions with respect to various performance evaluation metrics.},

The information between vehicles interacts over a wireless network. In order to further reduce the amount of data transmission, a novel adaptive memory-event-triggered mechanism (METM) is developed, in which historical information is utilized. In addition, the proposed METM threshold is designed to vary with the system state of each autonomous vehicle to adjust the data-releasing rate adaptively. Under the adaptive METM, a distributed tracking controller with historical information is put forward to guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability using the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique.

However, existing multimodal demand forecasting methods often require direct sharing of raw data, which can be infeasible or at least very difficult, due to privacy concerns or practical constraints posed by ownership of data from different institutions. This study proposes a Multimodal Transport Demand Forecasting model via Federated Learning (FL) to improve forecasting accuracy without the need for direct data sharing. In the model, a processing center is introduced to handle parameters of forecasting models trained by each private dataset, where the exact dataset does not have to be shared and sensitive private information cannot be identified. Specifically, a Fine-grained Graph Convolution Recurrent Network (F-GCRN) is designed to capture spatiotemporal correlations of each dataset, with stronger capabilities to handle dynamic latent dependencies among different demand patterns than existing multimodal demand forecasting models. The processing center distinguishes the importance of parameters sent by different modes based on the Attentive Federated Learning mechanism and returns the processing parameters to each institution. Each institution predicts the demand with the returned parameters. Evaluations on three real-world transport datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art models. Overall, this study addresses the research gap of enhancing multimodal demand forecasting without the dependence on direct data sharing and illustrates that knowledge sharing via parameters sharing by FL can improve multimodal transport demand prediction.},

  abstract     = {Given that transportation contributes to 23% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, the electrification of the transport sector is an inevitable trend. This paper presents a hybrid energy management method that utilizes the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. To enhance its exploration capability and balance exploration and exploitation, the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm and Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) algorithm are introduced. DDPG, being a deterministic strategy, typically explores the environment by adding noise to the action space, which lacks effective exploration capability. Therefore, the LSH algorithm is employed for approximate counting of state variables in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. This encourages agents to explore less frequently occurring state variables, thereby improving the algorithm’s exploration ability. Additionally, the integration of the PER algorithm enables more efficient utilization of limited sample data during experience replay, leading to improved learning efficiency and stability. In addition, periodic updates are used to compensate for the additional computational consumption caused by counting. Simulation results on driving cycles from the typical road conditions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has stronger exploration ability and better management performance comparing with EMSs based on DDPG, DQN and Q-Learning. The LSH-PER-DDPG based EMS achieves a significant 8.5% reduction in lithium battery power consumption, a 6.25% increase in supercapacitor recovery, and a substantial 15.7% reduction in instantaneous fluctuation of lithium battery output current.},

In this paper, a robust adaptive event-triggered control strategy is presented for the underactuated surface vessel-unmanned aerial vehicles (USV-UAVs) cooperative system to implement the maritime parallel search mission. The proposed scheme is comprised of two parts, i.e., the three-dimensional (3D) search guidance principle and the cooperative formation control law. The developed guidance principle can generate the reference signals for the USV and UAVs, which the maneuvering characteristics of the heterogeneous agents are considered at the waypoints. Linked with the guidance term, a robust adaptive event-triggered control algorithm is designed for the cooperative system by fusing the dynamic event-triggered mechanism and sensor-tolerant technique. The dynamic triggered threshold is constructed on basis of the state error rather than the predefined parameters. Besides, the constrains of the sensor faults and the model uncertainties are tackled by constructing the adaptive parameter and robust neural damping term. Through the Lyapunov theorem, the semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability is guaranteed for all state variables. Finally, the advantages of the proposed scheme are evaluated on simulation platform, exhibiting the good tracking accuracy and tolerant performance in presence of the external disturbances.},

In this paper, an innovative real-time high-precision lightweight approach is proposed to estimate the wear of the slider. It allows complete monitoring of all sliders of the pantograph. In the first stage, a method based on image processing and object detection by deep learning is proposed to locate the region of the slider. It takes into account the large aspect ratio on the pantograph slider and the inclined angle. In the second stage, the neural network for wear estimation of pantograph slider (WEPSNet) is proposed. It realizes end-to-end contour extraction of the slider. The residual thickness of the slider is calculated by counting the number of pixels and the error is analyzed. Furthermore, the error arising from the perspective projection transformation in the monocular image is discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that, with the similar model size, the proposed WEPSNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 1.08% mIoU and 4.63% IMP. Moreover, the accuracy of residual thickness is tested on 120 pantograph slider images, achieving up to 95.91% within the allowable 1mm error, which is 6.68% higher than the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {As an important device for high-speed railway (HSR) to obtain electrical energy from outside, the structure of pantograph will directly affect the safety and stability of HSR operation. The current pantograph structure detection algorithm has a low accuracy rate, which cannot effectively cope with various complex scenarios and external disturbances during the actual operation of HSR and is difficult to achieve real-time detection of the pantograph structure. In order to solve the current problems in pantograph structure detection, the rigid target subregion longest common sub-sequence (RTS-LCSS) is proposed, which is a new method for real-time pantograph structure detection. This paper realizes the positioning of pantograph region by you only look once (YOLO) V7, then the pantograph characteristic curve is fitted according to the pantograph feature points, and finally compares the fitted pantograph characteristic curve with the normal pantograph characteristic curve to achieve the accurate evaluation of the pantograph structure. Meanwhile, in order to improve the accuracy of YOLO, this paper adopts deep convolution generative adversarial nets (DCGAN) to expand the training samples in conjunction with the real situation of HSR. The method proposed in this paper can realize the real-time detection of pantograph structure in addition to the specific localization of structural abnormal regions. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher robustness and stronger environmental adaptation. The algorithm accuracy and real-time performance meet the actual operation requirements of HSR, and it continues to function well under the influence of complex scenes and external environment interference.},

Subsequently, the predicted acceleration sequence of the leading HDV is integrated into the DMPC-based platoon control model for the following CAVs. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct simulation experiments using real-world driving data. The results demonstrate that, with a time headway of 1 s, the maximum speed error and maximum spacing error of the heterogeneous vehicle platoon using the proposed LSTM-based DMPC are reduced by at least 5.8% and 5.9%, respectively, compared to the traditional DMPC method. Furthermore, the LSTM-based DMPC outperforms the Transformer-based DMPC method, resulting in a 1.0% reduction in maximum speed error and a 0.7% reduction in maximum spacing error.

  abstract     = {UAVs have a broad application prospect in the field of railway inspection due to their excellent mobility and flexibility. However, it still faces challenges, such as high human labor costs and low intelligence levels. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a real-time intelligent rail recognition algorithm that can be deployed on the onboard computing device to guide the UAV’s camera to follow the target rail area and complete the inspection automatically. However, a significant issue is that rails from the perspective of UAVs may appear with changing pixel widths and various inclination angles. Concerning the issue, a general and adaptive rail representation method based on projection length discrimination (RRM-PLD) is proposed. It can always select the optimal representation direction, horizontal or vertical, to represent any kind of rails. With the RRM-PLD, a novel architecture (Real-Time Rail Recognition Network, TriRNet) is proposed. In TriRNet, a designed inter-rail attention (IRA) mechanism is presented to fuse local features of single rails and global features of other rails to accurately discriminate the geometric distribution of all rails in the image in a regressive way and thus improve the final recognition accuracy. Further, one-to-one mapping from anchor points to final feature maps is established. It greatly simplifies the model design process and improves the model’s interpretability. Besides, detailed model training strategies are also presented. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed formulation in terms of both network reasoning latency and recognition accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of traffic conditions, including speed, flow, and travel time, poses a critical challenge in urbanization that significantly impacts car owners and road administrators. However, in certain scenarios with restricted road data availability (e.g. lack of traffic light status and signal control strategies, cooperation between road administrators and third parties, etc.), it is imperative to make effective use of basic road information (e.g. historical traffic data and road connectivity) to improve both prediction accuracy and scalability on various arterial road networks against state-of-art deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal learning framework TPGraph for an accurate prediction of arterial roads’ traffic data by effectively utilizing upstream and downstream road information. TPGraph is composed of three major parts: 1) A multi-scale temporal feature fusion module that utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to integrate recently-periodic features, daily-periodic features, and weekly-periodic features; 2) A multi-graph convolution module that employs graph fusion and graph convolution networks to capture richer spatial semantics, and 3) A dynamic spatial-temporal prediction module that leverages a spatial-temporal transformer for single or multiple traffic-state predictions. Our proposed framework, TPGraph, leverages just multi-scale historical traffic conditions and readily accessible spatial factors as input to generate accurate predictions of future traffic conditions. We mainly evaluate the performance of our approach through multi-step prediction experiments conducted at hourly intervals, forecasting travel time or travel speed for each road at 15 mins, 30 mins, and 1 hour. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world arterial road datasets to demonstrate the superior predictive performance of TPGraph compared to existing methods.},

Specifically, the method is developed to plan motions for reconfigurable vehicles with the knowledge of a 3-D terrain model that has limited accuracy. The overall motion planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) that employs a constraint in the form of a bound on the probability of rollover under terrain-induced vehicle orientation uncertainty. To increase the computational efficiency of the NOCP with nonlinear chance constraint, a geometric interpretation of the chance constraint is derived based on the characteristics of SO(3), the 3-D rotation group. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the geometric interpretation through comparisons with other methods. Experimental data gathered from driving a mobile robot through real forests are also used to validate the proposed model. Finally, path and trajectory generation results obtained with the proposed planning method for a feller-buncher machine traversing through uncertain 3-D terrain are presented to showcase the method’s overall performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the maturity of 5G and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies and the prospect of Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G technologies, the limited lifetime and computing of mobile devices pose significant challenges to Quality of Service (QoS). In addition, the problem of inefficient use of computing, storage, communication, and other resources still exists in communication systems. In response to the above issues, Multi-tier Computing Networks (MTCNs) migrate computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, fog, or edge with sufficient resources, thereby realizing energy-efficient collaborative computing and multi-dimensional resource sharing. However, in the MTCN environment with complex heterogeneity, and high-intensity dynamics, how to provide sustainable solutions for resource scheduling strategies is a meaningful issue. Inspired by Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) to decouple physical network configuration, we propose a multi-target-aware dynamic resource scheduling algorithm for MTCN to improve resource flexibility, which is the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we consider differentiated QoS requirements like computing, storage, bandwidth, delay, etc., and establish multi-target-aware embedded constraints. Additionally, we present a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based scheduling network that can interact scientifically and efficiently with the MTCN environment. It extracts environmental information as state input to better focus on dynamic characteristics as well as calculates candidate nodes and links using a three-layer network architecture and related constraints. Furthermore, the learning process is optimized through the combination of the reward mechanism and the gradient descent mechanism. Finally, comparison experiments on three widely used evaluation indicators (long-term average revenue, long-term average revenue-cost ratio, and VNR acceptance rate) verify that the proposed algorithm has made an average improvement of 19.042%, 2.563%, and 3.932% respectively compared with all baselines.},

  abstract     = {At present, mobile charging stations (MCSs) are taken as an important complement of fixed charging stations. Currently, the strategy of MCSs is to move towards the electric vehicles to be charged (EVCs) only after being requested. To shorten the charging delay of EVCs and enhance the proportion of charged EVCs, idle MCSs should actively move to the areas with large potential charging demand rather than remaining stationary. The distribution of idle MCSs in different areas should be taken into account to prevent excessive idle MCSs from moving into the same areas simultaneously. To this end, we introduce the concept of charging demand force to depict the potential charging demand of EVCs, and then propose the Placement Strategy for Idle Mobile Charging Stations (PS-IMCS). In PS-IMCS, each idle MCS can measure the potential charging demand in neighboring areas through obtaining the resultant force composed of attraction force and repulsion force, and an MDP model is specially designed to make placement decisions for idle MCSs. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate the performance superiority of PS-IMCS, i.e., the charging delay of EVCs can be significantly shortened, and the proportion of charged EVCs can be effectively enhanced.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is a fundamental problem and challenge for autonomous vehicles. Early works mainly focused on designing complicated architectures for deep-learning-based prediction models in normal-illumination environments, which fail in dealing with low-light conditions. The paper proposes a novel approach for trajectory prediction in low-illumination scenarios by leveraging multi-stream information fusion, which integrates image, optical flow, and object trajectory information. This is achieved by applying Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal information from the image channel, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) to model relative motion between adjacent camera frames through the optical flow channel, and recognizing high-level interactions between vehicles in the trajectory channel. Further, to investigate the reliability of the model in low-illumination scenarios, epistemic uncertainty estimation is conducted by applying Monte Carlo Dropout. The proposed approach is validated on HEV-I and newly generated Dark-HEV-I datasets focusing on graph-based interaction understanding and low illumination conditions. The experimental results show improved performance compared to baselines in both standard and low-illumination scenarios. Importantly, our approach is generic and applicable to scenarios with different types of perception data. The source code is available at https://github.com/TommyGong08/MSIF .},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), drivers now have access to convenient features such as lane-keeping, cruise control, and more. The electronic control units (ECUs) equipped within vehicles communicate with each other through the controller area network (CAN). However, since the CAN does not possess any security mechanisms, it becomes a target for adversaries to attack. In light of this, a significant amount of research regarding intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has focused on detecting such maliciously injected CAN packets. Nevertheless, most existing machine learning-based IDSs neither calculate the exact time intervals of the CAN packets nor utilize the counter information. Precise timing intervals are a crucial feature for detecting spoofing, fuzzing, and replay attacks, and counter information is also a significant feature that can detect fuzzing and replay attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting two detection features that are aware of CAN frame characteristics: the interframe space (IFS) between two consecutive CAN packets, and the counter information of a CAN data payload (i.e., data field). Using these features, we introduce decision tree-based IDS. We evaluate the proposed features with popular decision tree-based models such as random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results show that our proposed IDS can detect maliciously injected CAN packets with an F1 score of 99.54% in binary classification and 97.99% in multi-class classification, which are higher scores than what existing machine/deep learning-based IDSs achieve. Additionally, we measure the detection time of our proposed IDS in both online and offline testing environments.},

We solve the CSP using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for heterogeneous communications. The MC runs the algorithm based on vehicle density to select an optimal controller (OC) in both highway and city scenarios. After this selection, the OC is responsible for selecting a stable path to deliver packets from source to destination. This machine-learning-based SDVN scheme selects the minimum link duration ( $LD$ ) for communication between nodes, but selects the path with the maximum path time between source and destination. The protocol has two phases: OC selection and path selection. The OC is also responsible for distributing the load equally to the other LCs. The two-phase selection scheme improves the network performance in terms of delivery ratio (maximum value of 94.2%), end-to-end delay (minimum value of 0.11 ms), and routing overhead ratio (maximum incurred is 10%), which is proved by our simulation results in comparison to an existing scheme.},

However, the existing work has ignored the impact of crowd motion chaos which is a fundamental factor determining the effective evacuation. To assist the crowd evacuation more efficiently and reduce the intervention costs, robots need to identify destructive individuals based on the randomly evolved chaos and intervene in them specifically. To this end, we propose a stochastic optimal intervention method to provide the optimal strategies for robot-assisted crowd evacuation. First, the definition of chaos is introduced to quantify the chaotic degree of crowd movement. Then, we study the stochastic evolution of chaos by exploring the chaos state transition with marked temporal point process (MTPP) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Next, the robot-assisted intervention is formulated as a stochastic optimal intervention problem that seeks to maximize the intervention utility. Fortunately, a closed-form solution is obtained by using the Bellman’s principle of optimality and solving the derived Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. At last, we develop an event-driven crowd motion system to simulate crowd evacuation process. The simulation results show that our method can prevent the occurrence of chaos effectively, and improve the efficiency of crowd evacuation significantly. The proposed method is expected to provide guidance for emergency management.},

How to dynamically model the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of passenger flow is the main issue in achieving accurate passenger flow prediction during the epidemic. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a brand-new transformer-based architecture called COVID-19 Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (COV-STFormer) under the encoder-decoder framework specifically for COVID-19. Concretely, a modified self-attention mechanism named Causal-Convolution ProbSparse Self-Attention (CPSA) is developed to model the complex temporal dependencies of passenger flow. A novel Adaptive Multi-Graph Convolution Network (AMGCN) is introduced to capture the complex and dynamic spatial dependencies by leveraging multiple graphs in a self-adaptive manner. Additionally, the Multi-source Data Fusion block fuses the passenger flow data, COVID-19 confirmed case data, and the relevant social media data to study the impact of COVID-19 to passenger flow. Experiments on real-world passenger flow datasets demonstrate the superiority of COV-STFormer over the other thirteen state-of-the-art methods. Several ablation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness and reliability of our model structure. Results can provide critical insights for the operation of URT systems.},

For the SCGR algorithm, the spectral clustering (SC) scheme is first utilized to group the V2V links for the suitable RBs. Then, the optimal power is distributed to each V2V link by the greedy (GR) algorithm. For the DRL algorithm, a decentralized model-free network, improved multi-agent deep Q fully connected neural network (IDQFN), is developed to simultaneously find the best power allocation (PA) and RB assignment (RBA). Moreover, the SM technology is exploited to convey the information through the V2I and V2V links and improve the system capacity. Numerical results reveal that the proposed SCGR and IDQFN RA schemes outperform the typical RA algorithms, and the IDQFN scheme achieves better EE than the SCGR scheme, while the SCGR algorithm obtains the optimal average bit error rate (ABER) performance.},

These electronic units generate a huge amount of data that can be leveraged to identify the current driver and adapt to their behavior. For example, driver identification can improve the accuracy of range estimation in battery electric vehicles. This study focuses on identifying drivers based on their behaviour by using multivariate time series data acquired by the sensors available in the vehicle. We propose two different classifiers: one based on Bi-directional stacked Long Short-Term Memory with Attention mechanism (BiLSTM-A) and another based on a Modified Time Series Transformer (MTST). We perform driver identification in two different ways: 1) by applying a classifier on a single time segment; and 2) by using our proposed time-shift ensembles to combine predictions made from multiple time segments. We experimentally evaluate the proposed techniques on a publicly available dataset that comprises 10 drivers. By using all appropriate features, the proposed BiLSTM-A and MTST classifiers identify the driver with an accuracy of 55% and 73%, respectively, from a single time segment of 60 seconds duration. Time-shift ensembles increase the accuracy substantially, to 92% for BiLSTM-A and 97% for MTST when a 460-second time period is used for each prediction. We conclude that the proposed MTST classifier outperforms BiLSTM-A and existing classifiers in the driver identification task, and time-shift ensembles substantially improve the accuracy.},

Traffic spatial-temporal model is an essential method in this research field, primarily focusing on capturing the spatial-temporal features among nodes and their neighboring nodes. However, existing methods lack comprehensive consideration of directional and hierarchical features among traffic nodes. They are mostly applicable to scenarios with random uniform distribution of nodes, but not suitable for more complex small-scale aggregation distribution scenarios. Therefore, this study proposes the Tree Convolutional Network (TreeCN), a tree-based structure. The data design and model design of TreeCN focus on capturing the directional and hierarchical features among nodes. The directional and hierarchical relationships among nodes are represented by the plane tree matrix and constructed as the spatial tree matrix. The TreeCN, with a full convolution network, performs a bottom-up convolution structure on the tree matrix to complete the task of node feature capturing. In this study, TreeCN is thoroughly compared with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods in traffic time series prediction. The experimental results show that TreeCN not only performs well in scenarios with random uniform distribution but also exhibits outstanding effect in more complex small-scale aggregation distribution. Moreover, TreeCN adheres to the design principles of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in capturing the spatial features of traffic nodes and can further capture directional and hierarchical features among them. This is expected to make TreeCN a new method to handle complex traffic scenarios and improve prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral pedestrian detection has achieved great success in past years, which can be used in autonomous driving for intelligent transportation system. Most existing multispectral pedestrian detection approaches are developed on the assumption that training and test data belong to an identical distribution, which does not guarantee a good generalization to cross-domain (unseen) data. In this paper, we aim to develop a generalizable multispectral pedestrian detector, which achieves a favorable performance on both intra-dataset evaluation and cross-dataset evaluation. To achieve this goal, we conduct intra-dataset and cross-dataset experiments using single-modal and multi-modal data. By deep analysis, we find that, compared to visible or multi-modal data, thermal data not only has a best cross-dataset generalization, but also generates high-quality proposals on intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Inspired by this, we propose a novel thermal-first and fusion-second network (called TFNet) for multispectral pedestrian detection. In our TFNet, we first employ a thermal-based proposal network to extract candidate pedestrian proposals. After that, we design a transformer fusion based head network to further classify/regress these proposals. Experiments are performed on three public datasets. The comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TFNet on both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. We hope that our simple design can promote the future study on generalizable multispectral pedestrian detection.},

  abstract     = {Online safety monitoring is the key technology to realize the safe operation of the automatic train protection (ATP) system. So, based on the probabilistic model checking and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithms, an intelligent quantitative safety monitoring method is proposed to monitor the operational safety of ATP online. To begin with, the dynamic fault tree (DFT) model and continuous-time Markov Chains (CTMC) model of ATP are established based on the fault-tolerant structure of ATP. Then, the reliability and safety performance of DFT are evaluated by the hierarchical iterative evaluation method when considering the imperfect fault characteristics of the critical sub-equipment. Furthermore, continuous stochastic logic (CSL) is introduced to represent the temporal quantitative safety property. For the defined CSL property, the CTMC model will be verified by probabilistic model checking off-line, and the verification data set will be obtained. The distribution regularities of maximum reachable probability about the failure rate parameters of sub-equipment will be achieved by training the obtained verification data set with the LSSVM model. Finally, the quantitative safety boundaries (QSBs) of the corresponding quantitative safety levels are computed by the designed algorithm. The obtained QSBs can be used for monitoring the operational status of ATP online.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the safety-critical tracking control problem of uncertain nonlinear systems with arbitrary relative degree constraints is addressed. Firstly, an integral concurrent learning high order control barrier function (ICL-HOCBF) is constructed from deriving a class $\mathcal {K}$ function with time-varying coefficient that depends on the recorded data. On the one hand, it can accommodate unknown parameters in the control vector field and ensure the convergence of parameter estimation errors under finite excitation condition. On the other hand, the proposed ICL-HOCBF by directly enforcing forward invariance of the system containing parameter estimates can approach the boundary of the safety set when CBF constraints are active. In addition, an ICL control Lyapunov function (ICL-CLF) is proposed by using recorded data and online data concurrently, which allows the tracking errors and parameter estimation errors to converge exponentially due to the generation of a negative definite estimation error term in the stability analysis. Meanwhile, this research not only theoretically proves that the developed ICL-CLFs and ICL-HOCBFs can overcome the difficulty of converting state constraints to control constraints caused by uncertainty in the control vector field, and provide strict safety guarantee for uncertain nonlinear safety-critical systems, but also demonstrates the applicability of this method by solving the adaptive cruise control problem of vehicle systems with unknown control coefficients.},

In this work, we address the challenges of training an adaptive learning model which can be deployed on distributed energy-limited UAVs for making highly-reliable low-latency vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) computation offloading. Firstly, we formulate a two-objective mixed integer programming (MIP) problem for optimizing the energy consumption and offloading utility under the robust reliability constraints. The generalized Chebyshev inequality is applied to transform the chance constraints, and then, the minimum transmission power which satisfies the reliability threshold under the worst case is derived. Then, we decompose the primal problem into the IP subproblem while guaranteeing the Pareto optimality. An adaptive Q-value adjustment based deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) model is proposed, which calculates the expected return in theoretic via the heuristic algorithm, and uses it to replace the Q-value from the target network. The replacement is conducted at an adaptive frequency for saving training time and improving learning results. Comprehensive studies demonstrate the advantages of the proposed ADRL in improving the offloading utility, energy efficiency and convergence rate, when comparing with other classical DRL models and optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the future driverless scenario, pedestrian-vehicle conflict is an unavoidable traffic problem at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks. Autonomous vehicles are obviously impossible to make eye contact with pedestrians the way a human driver can. Therefore, there is an urgent need for autonomous vehicles to achieve accurate predictions of pedestrian crossing behavior. In order to better solve the problem of high uncertainty of pedestrian crossing behavior, in this paper, a modeling framework combines Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Deep MEIRL) and reinforcement learning is employed to predict pedestrian crossing behaviors. The dataset of drone-based video footage is collected in Xi’an (China) to train and validate the model. The trajectory dataset, extracted by computer vision algorithm, is implemented to derive state features of pedestrian behavior, including pedestrian to target area distance, vehicle type, vehicle speed, lateral/longitudinal distances, pedestrian lateral/longitudinal velocities. The results reveal that Deep MEIRL performs better than a baseline model MEIRL at micro-scales such as predicting pedestrian trajectories and evasive actions. Specifically, in predicting pedestrian trajectories, the Deep MEIRL outperforms the MEIRL by 33.09% and 15.16% on the basis of the MAE and HD, respectively. Meanwhile, the Deep MEIRL is 28.7% and 17.6% respectively more accurate than the MEIRL in predicting pedestrian evasive actions on lateral and longitudinal directions. Furthermore, we also found that there is heterogeneity in pedestrian crossing behavior when interacting with different vehicles. This research can contribute to a critical step toward addressing the safe and efficient movement at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks for autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The secure transmission of instructions among vehicles in a platoon is one of the most essential needs for a vehicle platoon. Despite the existence of cryptographic methods to securely share instructions, instruction sharing is still subject to forgery, tampering, and denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, it is urgent to find a solution to perform data source identification to filter out irrelevant information (not instructions) while ensuring the authenticity of encrypted instructions is urgent to address. In addition, immediate revocation of credentials is also a crucial requirement for a vehicle platoon when an authorized vehicle member misbehaves. In this paper, we propose the first Secure Source Identification Scheme for Revocable Instruction Sharing (SI-RIS) to securely simultaneously achieve bilateral fine-grained access control, data source identification, immediate vehicle user revocation, and efficient encryption in vehicle platoons. Specifically, our SI-RIS solution supports fine-grained access control for both the sender and receiver over the encrypted instructions. As a result, only authorized correspondents are able to access the commands. Furthermore, upon identification of malicious members in the platoon, our SI-RIS provides an efficient direct vehicle user revocation mechanism capable of immediate revocation credentials without affecting other vehicles. We prove the security of our SI-RIS via rigorous mathematical security proof. Moreover, performance evaluation and comparisons illustrate the feasibility and practicability of SI-RIS for vehicle platoon.},

  abstract     = {The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather information about their environment by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In this work, we design an information-sharing-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. The safe actor-critic algorithm we propose has two new techniques: the truncated $\mathcal {Q}$ -function and safe action mapping. The truncated $\mathcal {Q}$ -function utilizes the shared information from neighboring CAVs such that the joint state and action spaces of the $\mathcal {Q}$ -function do not grow in our algorithm for a large-scale CAV system. We prove the bound of the approximation error between the truncated- $\mathcal {Q}$ and global $Q$ -functions. The safe action mapping provides a provable safety guarantee for both the training and execution based on control barrier functions. Using the CARLA simulator for experiments, we show that our approach improves the CAV system’s efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid traffic jams.

  abstract     = {For bike sharing systems, demand prediction is crucial to ensure the timely re-balancing of available bikes according to predicted demand. Existing methods for bike sharing demand prediction are mostly based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding it as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different transportation modes. This is particularly important for bike sharing because it is often used to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent progress, no existing method is capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from multiple modes and explicitly considers the distribution discrepancy between them, which can easily lead to negative transfer. To address these challenges, this study proposes a domain-adversarial multi-relational graph neural network (DA-MRGNN) for bike sharing demand prediction with multimodal historical data as input. A spatiotemporal adversarial adaptation network is introduced to extract shareable features from demand patterns of different modes. To capture correlations between spatial units across modes, we adapt a multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) considering both geographical proximity and mobility pattern similarity. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing, subway and ride-hailing data from New York City. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods and the effectiveness of different model components.},

  abstract     = {Accurate tracking control of autonomous cooperative transportation systems (CTS) remains challenging owing to the complexity of the mechanisms and the high requirements of coordination between carriers. In this paper, the trajectory tracking control of a CTS with a pair of autonomous vehicles serving as carriers is investigated. A novel constraint-oriented hierarchical modeling method is proposed to describe the dynamics of the system. By dividing the system dynamics into two portions: the lower-level individual modeling and the upper-level constraints abstraction, the modeling process is significantly simplified. Then an innovative constraint-following control law is designed to address the tracking control problem under the special system topology, based on the internal and external constraints designed in the modeling process. The asymptotic convergence of the tracking error is theoretically guaranteed. To reduce potential damage of the payload during transportation, a payload force optimization method is creatively proposed. It relies on the closed-form relationship between the control input and payload forces established by the constraint-oriented modeling. The normal and shear stress on the payload is successfully limited, without affecting the trajectory tracking performance. Simulation results show that the proposed control method and the payload force optimization strategy can help achieve accurate and safe autonomous cooperative transportation simultaneously.},

In this study, this problem is novelly treated as a video captioning task, and a Guidance Attention Captioning Network (GAC-Network) structure is proposed for describing the incidents in a concise single sentence. In GAC-Network, an Attention based Encoder-Decoder Net (AED-Net) is built as the main network; with the temporal spatial attention mechanisms, the AED-Net make it possible to effectively reject the unimportant traffic behaviors and redundant backgrounds. Considering various driving scenarios, the Spatio-Temporal Layer Normalization is used to improve the generalization ability. To generate captions for incidents in driving, the novel Guidance Module is proposed to boost the encoder-decoder model to generate words in a caption, which have better relationship to the past and future words. Because there is no public dataset for captioning of driving scenarios, the Traffic Video Captioning (TVC) dataset is released for the video captioning task in driving scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can fulfill the captioning task for complex driving scenarios, and achieve higher performance than the methods for comparison, including at least 2.5%, 1.8%, 3.6%, and 13.1% better results on BLEU_1, METEOR, ROUGE_L and CIDEr, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Real-time semantic segmentation of street scenes is an essential and challenging task for autonomous driving systems, which needs to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, numerous objects and stuff at different scales in street scenes further increase the difficulty of this task. To address this challenge, we develop a lightweight and high-accuracy network termed Scale-Aware Network (SANet), which aims to selectively aggregate multi-scale features while maintaining high efficiency. In SANet, we first design a Selective Context Encoding (SCE) module, which considers the intrinsic differences of various pixels to selectively encode private contexts for each pixel, thus learning more desirable contextual features while reducing redundancy. With the context embedding in hand, we then design a Selective Feature Fusion (SFF) module to recursively fuses them with multiple features at different levels or scales to generate scale-aware features, where each feature map contains scale-specific information. Extensive experiments on challenging street scene datasets, i.e., Cityscapes and CamVid, illustrate that our SANet achieves a leading trade-off between segmentation accuracy and speed. Concretely, our method yields 78.1% mIoU at 109.0 FPS on the Cityscapes test set and 77.2% mIoU at 250.4 FPS on the CamVid test set. Code will be available at https://github.com/kaigelee/SANet .},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction, which aims at predicting the future positions of all pedestrians in a crowd scene given their past trajectories, is the cornerstone of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Accurate prediction and fast inference are both indispensable for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer-based multi-modal trajectory prediction model to address the two challenges. Specifically, a novel graph attention module dedicated to joint learning of social and temporal interaction is proposed to explore the complex interaction among pedestrians while integrating sparse attention mechanism, pedestrian identity, and temporal order contained in the trajectory data. By doing so, the interaction across temporal and social dimensions can be simultaneously processed to extract abundant context features for prediction. Besides, to accelerate inference speed, we put forward a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer model with multi-modal prediction capability where each future trajectory can be inferred in a parallel fashion, therefore, resulting in diverse trajectory predictions and less computational cost. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed to evaluate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model not only produces high prediction accuracy but also infers with fast speed. The code of the proposed method will be publicly available at https://github.com/xbchen82/SNARTF .},

  abstract     = {Ridesharing service, as a sustainable transportation mode, has gained great interest in both industry and academic fields. Existing TNC ridesharing services provide prescriptive solutions without coordinating riders’ interactions and intentions on route choices. As a result, ridesharing services often end with ride-hailing services, and they are still under a relatively low usage rate. Motivated by this view, this study developed a real-time coordinated ridesharing route choice mechanism (CSM) for guiding riders’ ridesharing route choices to fill this research and application gap. Specifically, this study modeled this CSM as a pure-strategy atomic fare-sharing game based on the assumption that every rider is selfish and tries to choose the best route to minimize his/her travel fare among multiple feasible candidate routes. An existing tree-generation algorithm was used to find the candidate routes for each rider. This study proved the existence of a Nash Equilibrium in this game by constructing a potential function and proving this game is a potential game. This study further developed a sequential updated distributed algorithm and proved its convergence to explore an equilibrium solution of the CSM. To address the scalability issue, this study created a coalition formation approach based on ridesharing potential, to separate riders into ridesharing coalitions and then independently implement the CSM for each ridesharing coalition. Our experiments illustrate that the coalition approach scales down the problem size of each CSM and dramatically improves the computation efficiency while maintaining the same level of system performance. More importantly, the CSM can significantly promote riders’ usage of the ridesharing service by greatly saving their travel fares while satisfying their trip requirements.},

  abstract     = {Traffic and the movement of people are inextricably associated with the potential spread of COVID-19. In Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Deep Learning (DL) traffic detection approaches driven by transportation big data have significant application values in monitoring, counting and classifying traffic vehicle information during the COVID-19 epidemic blockade, while DL COVID-19 medical diagnostic technology is also very important. However, due to concerns about data privacy and security, traditional data-centralized DL techniques that require uploading training data from multiple cameras or hospitals are no longer suitable. Federated Learning (FL) as a novel collaborative privacy-preserving DL paradigm could address this issue well. Nevertheless, in FL, most existing works train learning models with full-precision weights and communicate them over multiple iterations, which may incur massive additional communication costs and disclose the privacy implied in the trained local models. To tackle these issues, we first propose a novel multi-modal tensor ring decomposition TR-TSVD that not only achieves efficient data reduction but also keeps the correlations among multi-modes. Afterward, applying TR-TSVD to the training process of a convolutional neural network under the FL framework to achieve the goal of reducing communication overhead while ensuring model performance. Additionally, since the weight parameters are transmitted with the TR-TSVD format, attackers cannot infer the data privacy without knowing the specific restoration method. Besides, the additively homomorphic encryption is leveraged to further preserve model security. Extensive experimental results on MNIST, BIT-Vehicle and COVID-CT datasets show that the proposed approach could achieve a better performance.},

Secondly, different from the existing literature that only the sufficient condition is obtained, the necessary and sufficient conditions in sense of the mean-square consensus are derived in this paper. The obtained results not only reveal an explicit relation among the system matrices, noise variance and time delay via an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), but also amount the optimal control design problem to solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). Furthermore, considering time delay and perturbations simultaneously, the necessary and sufficient conditions of string stability are further derived. Such conditions only depend on the controller parameters and the network weight. Finally, the validity of derived results is verified by some simulations.},

In this paper, we propose a quantum cryptographic protocol for secure vehicular communication for foggy highways, which is unconditionally secure against outside and participant attacks. The outside attacks include intercept, intercept-resend, entangle-measure, man-in-the-middle, collective, Trojan horse, and coherent attacks; whereas, the participant attacks include the collusion, forgery, and collision attacks. In this protocol, the traffic control system broadcasts the information regularly so that the vehicles can take appropriate action and avoid traffic chaos, congestion, and accidents. This protocol can be used on busy and foggy highways such as the interstate-75 highway in the United States, M4 motorway in England, Tohoku Expressway in Japan, and Yamuna Expressway in India to prevent vehicle collisions. Quantum cryptographic protocol for secure vehicular communication is important because they provide a highly secure method of communication that is immune to eavesdropping and interception. The motivation for developing the quantum cryptographic protocol for secure vehicular communication comes from the growing need for secure communication in the digital age.},

  abstract     = {Crowd counting is very important in many fields such as public safety, urban planning, and is essential for the intelligent transportation systems. Due to the complexity and diversity of traffic scenes, point-level annotations for pedestrians would cost much human labor. Weakly supervised crowd counting methods are more suitable for these scenes, considering they only require count-level annotations. However, ignoring the uneven distribution of cross-distance crowd region density and multi-scale pedestrian head, existing weakly supervised methods can not achieve similar counting performance as fully supervised crowd counting methods. To solve these issues, we propose a novel multi-level dynamic graph convolutional networks for weakly supervised crowd counting. Within this network, a multi-level region dynamic graph convolutional module is designed to mine the cross-distance intrinsic relationship between crowd regions. A feature enhancement module is used to enhance crowd semantic information. In addition, we design a coarse grained multi-level feature fusion module to aggregate multi-scale pedestrian information. Experiments are conducted on five well-known benchmark crowd counting datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing weakly supervised methods and competitive results compared to fully supervised methods.},

In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving data-enabled predictive control scheme for CAVs in a mixed traffic environment, where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs coexist. We tackle external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious central unit eavesdroppers who wiretap the communication channel of the mixed traffic system and intend to infer the CAVs’ state and input information. An affine masking-based privacy protection method is designed to conceal the true state and input signals, and an extended form of the data-enabled predictive leading cruise control under different data matrix structures is derived to achieve privacy-preserving optimal control for CAVs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can protect the privacy of CAVs against attackers without affecting control performance or incurring heavy computations.},

  abstract     = {Road cracks on highways and main roads are among the most prominent defects. Given the inherent inaccuracy, time-consuming nature, and labor intensiveness of manual road crack detection, there’s a compelling need for automated solutions. The irregular shape of cracks, along with complex background conditions encompassing varying lighting, tree shadows, and dark stains, poses a significant challenge for computer vision-based approaches. Most cracks exhibit irregular edge patterns, which are pivotal features for accurate detection. In response to recent advancements in deep learning within the realm of computer vision, this paper introduces an innovative neural network architecture termed the ‘Selective Feature Fusion and Irregular-Aware Network (SFIAN)’ designed specifically for crack detection on pavements. The proposed network selectively integrates features from multiple levels, enhancing and controlling the flow of valuable information at each stage while effectively modeling irregular crack objects. In an extensive evaluation, this paper conducts experiments on five distinct crack datasets and compares the results with twelve state-of-the-art crack detection methods, including the latest edge detection and semantic segmentation techniques. The experimental findings demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, surpassing baseline methods by a notable margin, with an increase of approximately 13.3% in the F1-score, all without introducing additional time complexity. Furthermore, the model achieves real-time processing, achieving a remarkable speed of 35 frames per second (FPS) on images at $320\times 480$ pixels, facilitated by NVIDIA 3090 hardware.},

  abstract     = {Without tedious and time-consuming labeling processes, virtual datasets have recently shown their superiority for vehicle re-identification (re-ID). Existing virtual to real vehicle re-ID methods employ only a single virtual dataset for model training, while datasets from different generative sources are not jointly exploited. Multiple source virtual datasets contain more data diversity that can boost model performance. We thus propose a multi-source virtual to real vehicle re-ID pipeline, where multiple source virtual datasets are used during training. However, the multi-source virtual dataset suffers from more data redundancy than the single virtual dataset, which can affect the training efficiency. Intuitively, it can be mitigated by virtual data search. Unlike a single virtual dataset, a performance gap exists between multiple source virtual datasets, indicating their different contributions to model learning. Accordingly, we propose to split the multi-source virtual dataset into the main training set and the auxiliary training set, and then design the sampling strategy separately. For the main training set, the Consistent Attribute Distribution-FEature distance Trade-off (CAD-FET) strategy is designed to search for representative data. For the auxiliary training set, a cluster-based sampling strategy is further proposed to search for the most diverse subset. Besides, a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy is proposed to utilize these subsets reasonably. Extensive virtual-to-real vehicle re-ID experiments show that our data sampling method can reduce the volume of the multi-source virtual dataset by around 77%/96% and boost the model performance when tested on the VeRi776/VehicleID.},

  abstract     = {Crowd counting in congested urban transport systems is a highly challenging task for computer vision and deep learning due to several factors such as mutual occlusion, perspective change, and large-scale variations. In this paper, a novel perspective-embedded scale-selection multi-column network named PESSNet is proposed for crowd counting and high-quality density maps generation. The proposed method aligns the branches to various scales by leveraging different receptive fields, and utilizes perspective parameters to adjust the sensitivity of each branch to different perspective areas in the scene. Specifically, the PESSNet consists of four key components: 1) feature pyramid network (FPN) fuses multi-stage features extracted from the backbone network; 2) scale-selection dilated layer (SSDL) extracts features by using different dilated convolution kernels for each stage; 3) perspective-embedded fusion layer (PEFL) encodes the spatial perspective relationships across all feature levels into the network and provides a more effective fine-grained weight map; and 4) density maps generator (DMG) employs deconvolution layer as a decoder to generate high-quality density maps. The above strategies maximizes the ability of multi-column network to extract the features of instances with various scales. Extensive experiments on seven crowd counting benchmark datasets, JHU-CROWD, ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, ShanghaiTechRGBD, WorldEXPO’10, TRANCOS, and NWPU-Crowd indicate that PESSNet achieves reliable recognition performance and high robustness in difference crowd counting.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic yielding is a commonly observed behavior at permissive left-turn signalized intersections in some developing countries, which has been studied in the past to reveal its effect on traffic capacity. However, the effect on left-turn traffic delay is still unrevealed and requires further investigation. Different from the method established for investigating traffic capacity, the most challenging issue in studying traffic delay is the recognition of queued and non-queued left-turn vehicles. Based on queuing theory, an analytical delay estimation model was developed in this paper, wherein the probabilistic yielding behavior at a permissive left-turn intersection was put into consideration. To estimate left-turn traffic delay by the M/G2/1 queuing model, the service time distributions for both queued and non-queued left-turn vehicles were derived. Then, stochastic simulations were performed to validate the established analytical model in case of various combinations of left-turn yielding rates, volume-to-capacity ratios (v/c ratios) of left-turn traffic, and through traffic flow rates. Considering that the traffic scenario is consistent with the traffic situation of a permissive left-turn signalized intersection described in HCM when the yielding rate equals 1, the proposed estimation model and simulation results were also validated by the HCM method. It was found that the proposed left-turn traffic delay estimation model is a cost-effective alternative to the microscopic simulation and HCM method. Through sensitivity tests, this research found that left-turn traffic delay increased rapidly with the left-turn yielding rate, the through traffic flow rate, and the left-turn v/c ratio, among which the through traffic flow rate is the most critical factor. Furthermore, it was found that the effect of the left-turn yielding rate on left-turn traffic delay appeared to be more prominent when the left-turn yielding rate was between 0 and 0.2. The results of this study can contribute to the guidance of traffic signal warrants for permissive left-turn phases.},

  abstract     = {To improve the positioning accuracy without reference stations, in this paper, we propose a multi-antenna and geometry based differential GNSS positioning system. Multiple independent antennas which simultaneously track the same satellites are connected to the receiver by cables and form a given geometry. Carrier phases of the signals received by those antennas are measured and differenced at the receiver. The single differences of phase cycle integer ambiguities are solved by exploiting the geometry formed by the antennas. Then the positions of multiple antennas are estimated firstly by using the differenced phase measurements and the geometric relationship between antennas. To further improve the antenna position accuracy, with multiple antennas and satellites available, the matrix of single differences of phase cycle integers is considered as a fingerprint to search and identify the final antenna positions. Taking advantage of the firstly estimated positions of antennas being in a regular geometric shape, the searching space for the antenna positions will be compressed and the searching process is simplified. Regularization method is employed to solve the ill-conditioned problem. Positioning error performance is evaluated by simulations. The proposed system can achieve lane level positioning accuracy without extra facilities. When the standard deviation of phase measurement error is less than 0.025 cycles, the proposed system can achieve high positioning accuracy. If the receiver can track satellites of more GNSS systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) simultaneously, with eight or more satellites visible, the robustness of this system will be improved.},

  abstract     = {Considering the rapid urbanization and the road congestion, the development of smart parking solutions becomes more crucial, especially in terms of economic interests. Thanks to IoT-connectivity and the cloud-integrated platforms, drivers can easily find a vacant parking lot with smart parking services. This paper intervenes in the profit of parking management systems. The paper proposes a new technique “paging technique” which increases the utilization factor of parking slots. The proposed method takes advantage of the idle time that exists between two successful parking services in the same slot. Besides, it investigates the possibility of using the idle times from different parking slots to provide a continuous parking time for an additional car. The paging technique is optimally implemented using mixed-integer linear programming that maximizes the utilization factor for the parking slots with minimum car transitions. Moreover, a data model for the parking management system has been constructed while considering the three major customers, namely, regular, prepaid, and walk-in customers. The difference between fixed and dynamic pricing for parking has been investigated. The technique has been validated using GAMS optimization software and hardware using DSP with Coin-or branch and cut solver (CBC) under real-life conditions. The statistical results prove that the revenue for the proposed parking system has increased significantly. Finally, a comparative analysis is performed, benchmarking our proposed method against recent competing algorithms in real world applications to demonstrate its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular cloud networking (VCN) is a new study area that combines vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and information-centric networking. By utilizing VCC technologies, it is effectively use in road security and traffic control. The benefits of VCC in VCN are superior, including faster turnover times, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, greater collaborations, advanced security, the prevention of data loss, data security, minimal maintenance, limitless storage capacity, traffic information aggregation, etc. VCN is an intelligent networking system that manages autonomous traffic, system security, privacy, and vehicle control capabilities. During communication, various adversary types have the potential to compromise the security and privacy of these networks. To preserve their security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity, such systems require an authentication framework. The paper presents an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and biometrics-based secure authenticated framework for VCN. The suggested protocol accomplishes all security, privacy, and other criteria for secure communications against active and passive attackers. It is also demonstrated, both formally and informally, that the proposed framework is secure, correct and efficient. The study further establishes, using the simulation tool AVISPA, that the proposed protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Additionally, the study uses BAN logic to demonstrate how the mutual authentication property is proven. In VCN, the proposed protocol efficacy is evaluated and compared to other similar protocols within the study. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads. Consequently, the proposed protocol will be advantageous for VCN.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vessels have been identified as a promising innovation in advancing marine transportation, providing an effective means to mitigate the risk of accidents, pollution incidents, and carbon dioxide emissions. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) plays a critical role in facilitating onboard decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency for autonomous ships. Traditional SSE approaches relying on external sensors, such as wave buoys and wave radars, are limited by cost considerations. Model-based methods are highly relying on the understanding of human knowledge to ships. Data-driven models also provide promising solutions, but their generalization is low. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised transfer learning approach for SSE (SAFENESS) is proposed. The model is trained using sufficient data in the source ship and limited data from the target ship and finally applied to the target ship. A data alignment algorithm is utilized to use the limited data of the target ship. To enhance the learning capability of the framework, two attention mechanisms are proposed, and a multi-class adversarial discriminator is introduced that can align the distributions of different domains. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through comprehensive comparisons with eleven established transfer learning methods, demonstrating the superiority of our model. The competitiveness of the proposed attention modules is verified by comparing them with state-of-the-art attention modules. The significance of each component and the influence of key parameters have been thoroughly explored in the ablation and sensitivity analysis. Our method has potential applications in maritime safety, navigation, and operation optimization.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of the Internet of Things-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (IoT-MTS) provides a sturdy data cornerstone for efficient maritime traffic scheduling and management. However, due to task heterogeneity and the limited computing power of individual vessels or stakeholders, although third-party clouds could provide powerful computing support for MTS, directly aggregating data from vessels to the cloud may cause privacy leakage and security concerns. Crowdsourcing as a newly distributed problem-solving paradigm could provide new solutions for conducting maritime big data computing, deep learning and sensing tasks by leveraging the crowd intelligence and computing power of vessels, but strong incentives are required to stimulate vessels to participate because of their selfishness and rationality. Nevertheless, existing incentives rarely consider the security problems caused by the man-in-the-middle attacks, honest-but-curious platform attacks and inference attacks simultaneously, and ignore the redundant winners and multi-attribute characteristics of participants. Toward this end, this paper proposes a tensor-based secure truthful incentive for IoT-MTS dubbed CrowdTensor to maximize the social welfare by eliminating redundant winners and meanwhile guaranteeing the desired economic properties, where the multi-attribute features and the complex association relationships of crowdsourcing systems are characterized by utilizing the tensor tool. A two-phase bid-preserving mechanism based on the cryptographic hash function and digital signature is introduced against malicious attacks. Both the rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that CrowdTensor outperforms other compared incentives and the desired properties can be achieved simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection from surveillance videos is of great significance for various Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. However, existing deep learning methods oftentimes fail under nighttime conditions on account of the lack of sufficient labeled nighttime data. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for all-day vehicle detection, by introducing an illumination-adjustable GAN (IA-GAN). The IA-GAN transforms labeled daytime images into multiple nighttime images with diverse illumination, using an adjustable illumination vector as input. Notably, we utilize gray histogram distributions to automatically generate illumination labels, by which IA-GAN gains the knowledge of simulating lights. Following that, we construct a large dataset containing both labeled daytime images and all generated synthetic nighttime images with bounding box labels. Finally, a detector named Day-Night Balanced EfficientDet (DNBED) is developed for all-day vehicle detection. The experiments show that the proposed framework yields promising performance for all-day vehicle detection and competitive results for nighttime vehicle detection compared to existing GANs, indicating the effectiveness of proposed framework.

The aim is to present the past, current and future research on CAVs running into roundabouts within the Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) framework. Both microscopic traffic simulations and virtual reality simulations by dynamic driving simulators will be considered. The paper is divided into five parts. At first, the literature is analysed using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology based on Scopus database. Secondly, the influence of CAVs on roundabout-specific design features and configuration is analysed. Gap-acceptance models used to define the capacity of the roundabout, one of its most important key performance indicators, are also presented. Third, the most common simulation software are described and analysed in terms of traffic demand implementation. Then the communication approaches and path management algorithms are studied. An example is proposed on the integration of microscopic traffic simulations and dynamic driving simulators virtual reality simulations. Finally, car following models suitable for roundabout traffic are discussed. There is still a gap between simulations and actual experience. There are reasonable doubts on how modelling and optimizing CAVs’ behaviour into roundabouts in view of CCAM. It seems that Cooperative, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CCAVs), more than simply Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), could optimise traffic flow, safety and driving comfort within the roundabout.

Moreover, in the presence of mobile wireless communications, the privacy and security of vehicle information are at constant risk.

We conduct a comprehensive survey of the latest developments in FL for ITS. Specifically, we initially research the prevalent challenges in ITS and elucidate the motivations for applying FL from various perspectives. Subsequently, we review existing deployments of FL in ITS across various scenarios, and discuss specific potential issues in object recognition, traffic management, and service providing scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct a further analysis of the new challenges introduced by FL deployment and the inherent limitations that FL alone cannot fully address, including uneven data distribution, limited storage and computing power, and potential privacy and security concerns. We then examine the existing collaborative technologies that can help mitigate these challenges. Lastly, we discuss the open challenges that remain to be addressed in applying FL in ITS and propose several future research directions.},

Advancements in automated driving technology play a significant role in the intelligent transportation system. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on sensor technologies as they are responsible for navigating safely through their environment and avoiding obstacles. This paper aims to outline the vital role of sensor fusion in intelligent transportation systems. Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to obtain more comprehensive measurements and greater cognitive abilities than a single sensor could achieve. By merging data from different sensors, it ensures that driving decisions are based on reliable data, with improved accuracy, reliability, and robustness in AVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of AV capacity, impacts, planning, technological challenges, and omitted concerns. We used state-of-the-art evaluation tools to check the performance of different sensor fusion algorithms in AVs. This paper will help us to determine our position, direction, the impacts of AVs on society, the need for smart city mobility outcomes, and the way to solve the auto industry challenges in the future.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles offer many benefits to driving, including safety, comfort, and efficiency. The significant extended benefit of autonomy in traffic comes from the connectivity through communications among vehicles, vehicle and infrastructure, and vehicle and other road users (also known as V2V, V2I, and V2X.) Connected Autonomous Vehicles or CAVs connectivity allows automated trajectories, plans, and coordinated speed adaptations that are safer, enhance traffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. CAVs will have more comprehensive situational awareness in the vehicle’s vicinity for safety assurance. Driving tasks like lane changing, merging, navigating automated intersections, and various collision avoidance scenarios benefit significantly from the connectivity and the enhanced collective perception of the surrounding areas. Appropriate algorithms based on CAVs’ connectivity data can also improve driving task decision-making and navigation plans within the traffic. This talk presents a few examples of advanced methods and algorithms that demonstrate various benefits and challenges of CAVS through simulation and laboratory experiments. It serves as an overview referring to reference co-authored articles by the presenter.},

This ultimately advances our goals as infrastructure-owner-operators (IOOs) to promote equity, accessibility, sustainability, economic well-being and quality of life. Advancing CAV that meets community-identified needs requires interoperable, reliable, and consistent infrastructure, a cohesive national vision, collaborative partnerships, funding, and clear policy. Many unknowns remain for CAVs, including the pathway and timeline to deployment, and the CAV industry continues to evolve, consolidate, and change. What is known is that one sector cannot do it alone.

  abstract     = {Protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) has always been a top priority in intelligent transportation research. Safety-oriented pre-collision systems have been developed and implemented for vehicles with lower automation levels to protect vulnerable road users via kinematics-based crash calculations. Many research efforts, including naturalistic driving study and standardized system evaluation, have been made to ensure the performance of such safety functionalities. Although the warnings and automatic emergency braking systems can efficiently reduce crash injuries, they cannot support higher-level autonomous vehicles interacting with VRUs and driving efficiently without human interventions in urban settings. Numerous algorithms predicting pedestrian trajectories and future actions have been developed in the past several years, which still cannot fully solve the VRU interaction dilemma. In this presentation, we discuss the importance of social intelligence for autonomous vehicles, emphasizing the capability to estimate and negotiate intentions with VRUs for effective and safe interactions. We will highlight the differences between intention and existing behavior predictions, especially regarding autonomous vehicles’ motion planning during vehicle-VRU interactions. A series of research efforts conducted in the Transportation &amp; Autonomous Systems Institute (TASI) at IUPUI will be presented related to developing intention prediction algorithms and benchmark datasets for all types of VRUs.

Improved safety, increased comfort, and time saving potential are among the most anticipated positive impacts of automated and connected vehicles. With much easier access to information, increased processing power, and precision control, automated and connected vehicles also offer unprecedented opportunities for energy efficient movement of people and goods and enable more efficient road use. This talk takes a closer look at the energy saving and traffic efficiency potentials of automated and connected vehicles based on first principles of motion, optimal control theory, and practical examples from our past and ongoing research. For instance, the talk shows through experiments on streets of San Francisco, that considerable energy can be saved by coordinated movement at traffic lights. In highway driving, our optimal motion planning algorithms that adjust the speed and select the best lane via mixed integer optimization, save energy by anticipating the motion of human drivers or by wirelessly receiving the intentions of neighboring automated vehicles. Energy efficient motion of these automated vehicles has a harmonizing effect on mixed traffic, leading to additional benefits for upstream human-driven vehicles. Opportunities for cooperative driving further increases efficiency of a group of vehicles by allowing them to move in a coordinated manner. In this talk, these benefits are shown in mixed traffic microsimulations, as well as shown in a novel cyber-physical experiment with virtual traffic surrounding real automated vehicles on a test track. Throughout the talk the gaps and future research directions are also highlighted.},

  abstract     = {A large number of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications are being designed, developed, and deployed in order to greatly improve our transportation systems in terms of safety, mobility, and reducing environmental impacts. These benefits can be quantified by a variety of performance measures that are often cited in the literature. However, most of these CAV applications are typically designed to improve transportation systems only in a particular dimension, usually focusing on either safety, mobility, or the environment. Very few research papers have considered a wider range or combination of performance measures across multiple dimensions, examining potential co-benefits or tradeoffs between these measures. For example, you can design a CAV application that greatly improves safety, but it might come at the cost of reducing traffic throughput. Further, the design of the CAV applications is often static and limited to specific traffic scenarios and conditions. CAVs that can adapt to different conditions, and be “tunable” for different societal needs will have much greater impact and versatility. In this presentation, we examine various co-benefits and tradeoffs of current CAV applications and consider how we can design these systems to have greater flexibility when it comes to deployment. We cite not only different CAV applications evaluated in simulation, but also real-world CAV deployments that operate on various testbeds, such as the Innovation Corridor located in Riverside, California. Based on this analysis, we can consider several new research directions for future CAV deployments.},

It is known that the formation of platoons presents relevant advantages for the involved vehicles, first of all in terms of fuel consumption. Besides this, in this presentation, the concept of platoon is further developed by investigating the possibility of exploiting the presence of platoons also for relieving congestion for the whole traffic stream. In this sense, each platoon can be considered as a moving bottleneck that affects the surrounding traffic conditions depending on its size (i.e., the number of vehicles composing it), the position of vehicles, and its speed. By appropriately acting on these aspects, each platoon can be adopted as an actuator of traffic management strategies. Several control schemes have been proposed in the literature, from simple feedback regulators to model predictive control schemes, both in centralized architectures and in decentralized ones. The different schemes are presented and their effectiveness, analyzed by means of simulations, is discussed. The main open issues, related to modelling aspects, to information management requirements and to the practical applicability of the ideas behind the research work, are also introduced in order to evaluate opportunities and challenges.},

However, challenges remain toward safe and efficient vehicle platooning since its performance could be degraded due to uncertainty from vehicle dynamics, environmental disturbances, and communication delays, among others. In this talk, I will introduce one recent work on a new control method that combines distributed stochastic model predictive control (DSMPC) with Taguchi’s robustness (TR-DSMPC) for vehicle platooning. The proposed method inherits the advantages of both Taguchi’s robustness (maximizing the mean performance and minimizing the performance variation due to uncertainty) and stochastic model predictive control (ensuring a specific reliability level). The proposed method was compared with two other MPC-based methods in terms of safety (spacing error) and efficiency (relative velocity). The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the performance variation and maintain the mean performance compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Advances in technologies such as sensors, communications, robotics, computer software and hardware are paving the way of imagining the future of transportation system as well as the roadblocks and challenges that need to be overcome. While there have been considerable technology advancements on the vehicle level the objectives of these successes is driver comfort and marketing rather than solving the problem of congestion and mobility on the system level in general. Vehicle automation is attractive to a small group of users, it opens the way to re-imagine the ownership and use of vehicles but also raises safety concerns and doubts as to whether it will have any benefit to alleviating congestion. On the infrastructure level the traffic network system operates as an open loop system with limited feedback and control leading to a highly unbalanced system in space and time. As a result hidden capacities cannot be utilized by planning in a centralized manner. In order to achieve effective management and control of the transportation system information and data are necessary and can only be generated by connecting the infrastructure with transportation users. In this talk we present examples how this connectivity can be achieved, what is the benefit of making decisions in a centralized coordinated manner versus decentralized approaches involving individual greedy users. These examples will identify the potential benefits in moving from the current system to a more coordinated system where connectivity can be used to improve mobility, reduce costs and the impact on the environment.},

  abstract     = {There has been a growing interest and continuous investment in advanced surface transportation technologies for more than two decades, especially areas related to connected and automated vehicles (CAV). Interest escalated when Google entered the domain in early 2010s, followed by establishment of multiple vehicle technology companies. Toward the end of 2010s, it looked like vehicles with advanced technologies were on the verge of becoming a widespread reality in our daily commute. Waymo indicated that individuals would be able to ride in self-driving cars in multiple locations. Uber were developing and testing a robo-taxi service. Automated shuttles and highly automated trucks were being deployed at various places for demonstration and data collection. As of today, many envisioned CAV applications that could dramatically change the ways we utilize our transportation systems have yet been realized. ‘Safety’ is likely one of the primary reasons for delayed adoption of CAV technologies. To maximize CAV’s safety benefits, these technologies need to be designed by considering their users – drivers and others who also use and share the surface transportation systems. This presentation will discuss a handful of research studies that examine people’s attitudes and understanding of CAV technologies in relationship to safety. Additionally, findings on the impact of education and training in relation to user interactions with them and their safety implications will be presented. This presentation will conclude with research needs in the safety and human factors domains of CAV.},

  abstract     = {The developments of advanced sensing, communication and vehicle technologies in the past two decades have significantly changed the technological composition of road vehicles. It has become an expectation that automated vehicle technologies, including driver assistance system that are already in use on the roads and future automated driving systems at their mature state will have the potential to reduce crashes, prevent injuries, and save lives. To fulfill the promise of eliminating most crashes, automated vehicles must be designed safe. While the industry has been working diligently to ensure functional safety of automated vehicle functions, questions remain -- how should safety of automated vehicles be defined, quantified and measured? As the safety operation of automated vehicles must interact with nested transportation systems including infrastructures, human drivers, pedestrians, how would the automated vehicles impact the safety and efficiency of the future transportation systems? This talk addresses implications and gaps in defining safety of automated vehicles, intending to foster a discussion among the workshop participants.},

We provide recommendations on the use of the proposed framework, including the pillar diagram, to facilitate the brainstorming process involved in using and complementing existing AMS tools to better conduct CAV evaluation. Using this framework, users can evaluate which AMS tools to use and how to augment them with programming and scripting when needed.

In the experimental stage, the UAV picks up the damage image of the aircraft, and the texture feature data is output by using the GLCM algorithm. The introduction of the cloud model evaluation system makes the skin damage type be quickly judged. The results show that the proposed method has good recognition ability for aircraft skin damage, and the identification accuracy of the verification image set reaches 85%. In the validation image set, 50 % of the corrosion spalling images were judged to be normal, which may be due to the similarity of the two types of texture features, and also indicates that the initial stage of skin damage starts from pitting. When evaluating the damage image, 59 % of the cloud droplets fall in the normal level, indicating that the damage is not serious, and the damage maintenance of the aircraft can be delayed according to the usage.},

With the VEC and C-V2X, we proposed a new high-precision obstacle detection strategy for MELs (MEL-YOLO). Firstly, we investigated the convolutional attention mechanism integrated into the path aggregation network of the Neck layer to strengthen the feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, we added a small-object oriented prediction layer in the Head to form the multi-scale feature prediction. Thirdly, we introduced a more efficient loss function to alleviate the gradient explosion problem in the feature transfer. Finally, we utilized the K-means++ optimization to derive the anchor boxes matchable with the dataset, which was collected and created by featuring different scenes to train validate the model. The MEL-YOLO was compressed by BN layer pruning and implemented on the edge device in a 6G/B5G based-V2X environment. Experimental results verify that the MEL-YOLO can effectively detect obstacles and significantly improve detection accuracy for small obstacles, computationally increasing mAP by 3.3% to original model, while maintaining detection speed and model size nearly unchanged.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicle Platooning (AVP) presents a promising approach to reducing energy expenses, improving traffic safety, and enhancing capacity. In multi-platoon vehicular networks, platoons can collaborate to ensure better data transfer reliability. However, the existing secure information-sharing methods between platoons face efficiency and security challenges. These challenges arise from (1) a lack of an efficient method to simultaneously ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the transmitted information; (2) difficulty in cross-domain dynamically sharing ciphertexts to multiple recipients is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Flexible Cross-domain Data Access Control (FC-DAC) system in this paper. Our FC-DAC system ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of transmitted information while enabling high-efficiency ciphertext sharing between various platoons. Additionally, the FC-DAC solution allows vehicles with valid authorizations to access signcrypted information quickly and efficiently, even if they belong to different platoons. Our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that the FC-DAC scheme is resistant to various common attacks and is applicable to multi-platoon vehicular networks.},

This paper proposes an optimization strategy for commercial vehicle AEB system based on unsafe control behavior to improve the safety and reliability of the AEB system. Firstly, the communication delay law of vehicle-to-vehicle communication under different working conditions is obtained through real vehicle tests. The delay is then used to compensate and correct parameters such as speed, displacement, and coordinates of the environmental vehicle, in order to account for the impact of communication delay on system decision-making. Next, an AEB strategy for commercial vehicles at the intersection Section is formulated. When two vehicles are about to collide, the braking system of the test vehicle is controlled to automatically emergency brake with the maximum braking deceleration to avoid collision. The AEB system strategy is optimized based on the analysis of unsafe control behavior. Then, an improved Antenna historical optimum-based Beetle Antenna Search (ABAS) algorithm is proposed based on the Beetle Antenna Search (BAS) and Beetle Swarm Antenna Search (BSAS) algorithm, which improves the optimization performance of the algorithm under the known constraint space, such as vehicle motion modeling and collision avoidance. Finally, the simulation result show that our proposed method can effectively prevent the collision of two vehicles at the intersection, and has high safety and reliability.},

However, the missing information in the traffic data will directly affect the final performance, and it has evolved into a challenge in data analysis based intelligent transportation system applications. Recently, Nuclear Norm-based Tensor Completion algorithm can recover the missing multidimensional information in traffic data recovery by truncated nuclear norm minimization. However, the existing Truncated Nuclear Norm threshold may result in excessive punishment of large singular values, and therefore leading the accurate data missing. To overcome this problem, we present a new Nuclear Norm-based Tensor Completion method, which considers the prior rank information and retains large singular values to approximate the rank of the matrix better. Firstly, to achieve optimized rank parameter, a similar block matrix method is proposed, which takes advantage of the nonlocal similarity to the separate of data and noise. Moreover, an optimal rank estimation algorithm is proposed, which can automatically achieve the truncated threshold parameter through the iterative optimization algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to verify our proposal, and the results show that our method can get better performance in terms of recovery accuracy.},

  abstract     = {By taking into account the social behaviors of renewable distributed generations (RDGs) and electric vehicles (EVs), the multi-operator AC/DC hybrid distribution system (HDS) has evolved into a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS), necessitating an appropriate architecture. In this paper, a distributed CPSS architecture is proposed for the multi-operator AC/DC HDS using a cloud-edge-device cooperation. The architecture incorporates a model that distinguishes different types of EVs, enabling the demonstration of the interaction among the cyber, physical, and social systems. To address issues of transmission delay and noisy, a Non-ideal Communication Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers is employed. The proposed framework consists of three stages: day-ahead economic dispatch, intra-day security dispatch, and real-time adjustment. This enables efficient dispatching of EVs based on economic and node voltage considerations while optimizing the performance of renewable distributed generators for each operator. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPSS structure in achieving distributed dispatching the HDS.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years, but the robustness of loopback detection in complex environments such as dynamic and weak textures needs to be improved. A semantic loopback detection method is proposed based on instance segmentation and visual SLAM to make sufficient use of semantic information in autonomous driving. The proposed method combines image segmentation and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to construct a semantic SLAM system. What’s more, a data association method that combines semantic and geometric information is proposed to improve the traditional loopback detection method by using semantic information to increase the accuracy of loopback detection. The result of experiment on the TUM public dataset shows that the loopback detection accuracy of the improved loopback detection method is higher than that of the bag-of-words method in all four datasets, and our proposed algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of loopback detection of the SLAM system in general.},

In this paper, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Optimal Scheduling Algorithm (MARLHOSA) is proposed to solve the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles. We model the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles as an infinite Markov decision process and set constraints to simulate the actual operating environment. To solve the Markov decision process corresponding to the economic scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles, this paper uses the close-range strategy optimization algorithm, and uses multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on the clipping mechanism to improve the loss function of the short-range strategy optimization algorithm. In addition, a distributed training architecture was designed for the training process of the close-range strategy optimization algorithm, so as to improve the speed of data collection and training speed and quality. According to a demand order put forward by the company, a path-loading collaborative optimization model was established. After solving the model, the number of vehicles dispatched by each vehicle type according to the optimal path-loading scheme of each vehicle type was determined. The simulation results show that the proposed improved distributed proximity strategy optimization algorithm can achieve the same economic performance as the numerical optimization method. Compared with the traditional algorithm, MARLHOSA can reduce the total vehicle mileage by 34.5% and increase the average loading rate of the carriage by 28.6%. The optimization effect is significant.},

On this basis, through the analysis and processing of the motion state data, an intelligent identification model of the moving trajectory of autonomous vehicles is established to realize the intelligent prediction and control of the driving trajectory of vehicles. Therefore, a large number of vehicle movement state data is collected, and the data are preprocessed and feature extracted, and an intelligent recognition model of vehicle movement trajectory is constructed by machine learning method.

The results show that the intelligent identification method of autonomous vehicle trajectory based on friction nano-generator has high accuracy and practicability. In the field verification environment, the lateral position deviation, heading angle deviation and minimum radius of curvature of the trajectory recognition algorithm for autonomous vehicles are 0.2193m, 10deg and 5.9m, respectively. The lateral deviation of the real vehicle test is kept within 0.5m, and the lateral acceleration is infinitely close to zero. This autonomous path identification is extremely stable.

Moreover, to address the issue of target drift, this algorithm employs a twin Network and a model update mechanism to process the filtered target information. Experimental results with measured data demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms traditional detection methods in characterizing local features of the target. Moreover, it successfully solves the challenges of classification decision and target drift in pedestrian recognition, offering improved stability and accuracy.

  abstract     = {Multi-copy routing is a way that creates and forwards copies to the nodes without the copies so that increases the message delivery probability in the Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN). The cost of generating many copies is potential congestion. To solve this problem, a feasible approach is to limit the number of copies generated. However, when the mobility of nodes is not sufficient and when the density of nodes near the source node is relatively high, the inappropriate process of copy distribution may result in copies remaining in a small area and too high local density of copies. Consequently, the overall performance is reduced due to low destination encountering probability in the whole area caused by too many local copies distribution. In this paper, by using node encounter rate to describe the activity and density of nodes, an effective Q-learning based VDTN multi-copy routing algorithm is proposed. The Q-learning reward factor is determined by the node encounter rate so that the distribution of message copies is controlled and the too high local density of copies can be alleviated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the related algorithms, and offers better delivery rate, negligible message latency and network overhead under different network node speeds, node density, and load conditions.},

However, incentivizing FHVs to participate in sensing tasks remains a fundamental challenge for FHV-enabled VCS systems: for one thing, the distribution diversity of orders and tasks limits FHVs from participating in VCS; for another, FHVs’ operating states determine whether they are free to execute sensing tasks. To address the above issues, this article proposes SHIP, a State-aware Hybrid Incentive Program for FHV-enabled VCS systems. Our proposal finely categorizes FHVs’ operating states and provides a hybrid incentive scheme that incorporates both opportunistic and participatory approaches. We also introduce coverage diversity to reflect the distribution of FHVs and sensing tasks. By combining coverage diversity with vehicle revenue, we establish a dynamic multi-objective optimization model to select appropriate FHVs for sensing to achieve a multi-win situation. Experiments based on real-world datasets show that our proposal can effectively utilize FHVs with different operating states to improve the quality of sensing tasks while increasing FHVs’ revenue.},

Most of the research uses a specific penetration rate of CAVs. The contribution of this study is to fill that gap by testing a new real-time traffic management method, named SWSCAV (utilization of shockwave-speed information and connected autonomous vehicles for traffic management in case of congestion or incident) in case of a traffic incident in an uninterrupted traffic flow environment with a very limited number of CAVs to improve conditions of the traffic flow conditions. By changing the lane and duration of the simulated incident and adjusting the arrival frequency of the CAVs and the position where the CAVs reduce their speeds, 189 different scenarios are tested. Mean flow, density, and speed values are selected as measures of effectiveness. These metrics are inspected both network-wide and locally using a Simulation of the Urban Mobility (SUMO) environment. A maximum of 12 CAVs are used. The results show that introducing SWSCAV with a limited number of CAVs means speed and flow values can increase up to 20.35% and 2.45%, respectively. Additionally, a decrease in mean density up to 32.54% can also be observed with this management approach. Density heat maps are used to inspect the influence of the incident.},

The utilization of visual saliency detection in these tasks has garnered considerable attention, owing to its inherent advantages. However, current research on traffic saliency detection primarily focuses on emulating the human visual system for attention allocation in traffic scenes, neglecting the detection of complete salient objects. In this paper, we propose the Traffic Salient Object Detection Using a Feature Deep Interaction and Guidance Fusion Network (TFGNet). Different from previous methods, our method detects the complete objects that attract human attention in natural traffic scenes, rather than a certain point without object semantic information, which can provide assistance for target recognition tasks in the domain of intelligent driving. Moreover, we propose a traffic salient object detection framework based on feature interaction and guidance fusion, enabling the detection of salient objects across varying scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method exhibits superior performance in terms of precision, recall, and error rate.},

Due to the long-distance transmission and detrimental effects from the transmission environment, the latency can be extremely high, especially in the presence of backhaul congestion. Therefore, we formulate an optimisation problem with the aim of minimising the total network latency. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, it is divided into three sub-problems, namely, clustering ground users associated with UAVs, cache placement in UAVs (to support the network in avoiding backhaul congestion), and power allocation for satellites and UAVs. We propose a distributed optimisation method consisting of: a non-cooperative game is designed to obtain the solution to the clustering problem; a genetic algorithm, which is powerful in the scenario of many variables, is employed to obtain the optimal solution to the high-complexity caching problem; and a quick estimation technique is used for power allocation. Additionally, a centralised optimisation method is presented as a benchmark. Simulation results show that although the distributed method leads to network latency of approximately 30% higher than the centralised method, it takes significantly less time to execute and is suitable for systems requiring strict real-time computing constraints. Furthermore, the numerical results prove the efficiency of our methods compared with other conventional ones.},

Computational experiments were conducted to evaluate various multiple objectives and verified the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm through different scale data, as well as provided a sensitivity analysis of the quantitative relationship between the three types of equipment in terms of operation efficiency and equipment utilization in the system. Finally, this paper discusses the impact of the partial joint storage yard strategy on the railway operation area and yard operations. To implement the solution to meet the requirements of efficient equipment utilization and seamless container transshipment operations in a multimodal port, it is imperative to have fast and accurate data sharing among the railway, highway, and port systems. We envisioned that 6G communication would enable that.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic flow prediction, a hotspot for intelligent transportation research, is the prerequisite for traffic flow prediction for making travel plans. The speed of traffic flow can be affected by roads condition, weather, holidays, etc. Moreover, sensors to catch the information about traffic flow will be interfered with by environmental factors such as illumination, collection time, occlusion, etc. Therefore, the traffic flow in the practical transportation system is complicated, uncertain, and challenging to predict accurately. Motivated from the aforementioned issues and challenges, in this paper, we propose a deep encoder-decoder prediction framework based on variational Bayesian inference. A Bayesian neural network is designed by combining variational inference with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) which is used as the deep neural network unit of the encoder-decoder framework to mine the intrinsic dynamics of traffic flow. Then, the variational inference is introduced into the multi-head attention mechanism to avoid noise-induced deterioration of prediction accuracy. The proposed model achieves superior prediction performance on the Guangzhou urban traffic flow dataset over the benchmarks, particularly when the long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging field of communication, Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) can reduce traffic congestion while enhancing road safety by sharing data among groups of commuters. In VSNs, Vehicular Cloud Server (VCS) based data sharing technology with encrypted primitives allows local users to outsource encrypted data for reducing the storage burden on the user side and sharing data without location restrictions. However, existing data encryption solutions that have been applied in VSNs environments still encounter weaknesses in efficiency, security, or privacy due to the following problems: (1) lack of effective access policies for flexible authorizing ciphertext to multiple data users; (2) data breaches caused by malicious data publishers; (3) necessity in hiding the private information of receivers. To date, no such solution has been available that securely enables one-to-many user authorization with privacy protection, while greatly resisting malicious data publishers. We propose a Sanitizable Access Control System with Policy-protection (SASP) for VSNs in this paper. Our SASP enables a sanitizer to test and sanitize encrypted data to defend against malicious data publishers, ensuring that the plaintext can only be recovered if an authorized user has a valid key. Furthermore, in our SASP system, the access policy is separated into attribute names and attribute values. Wherein, the attribute values contain a lot of private information, which is hidden in the ciphertext to guarantee data users’ privacy. Rigorous security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate the practicality of SASP for VSNs.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of intelligent connected technologies and cellular vehicle-to-everything communication (C-V2X) provide new opportunities to solve the connected automated vehicle (CAV) traffic problem for eco-driving at continuous signalized intersections. With C-V2X, a hierarchical velocity optimization design based on hybrid model predictive control technique (HVO-HMPC) is presented to reduce the fuel consumption and pollution emission. First, a distance–domain velocity optimization problem, with distance as the independent variable, was constructed. Second, a hybrid MPC scheme was developed by combining the multiple shooting method and MPC technique to calculate the optimal velocity profile of a high-level controller, which acts as the reference velocity in a low-level controller. Then, a car-following model was built, the low-level controller tracked the reference velocity with the predictive control as the backbone, and the optimal velocity was calculated while ensuring that the safety velocity constraint is satisfied. Next, the proposed HVO-HMPC was tested in Prescan, and the effect comparisons with different control methods in terms of fuel consumption, pollution emission, braking time, and number of braking applications were studied under different driving scenarios. Results show that once the maximal speed is limited to 40 km/h under short-period signals and 20 km/h under long-period signals, the HVO-HMPC effectively reduces fuel consumption by 27.21%, 25.89%, and pollution emissions by 25.3%, 25.97%, respectively, while achieving best performance. Finally, an experimental prototype is built to confirm the validity of the HVO-HMPC.},

However, the detection accuracy usually decreases sharply when the pedestrians are merged into the background with very similar colors or textures. In this paper, a camouflaged object detection method is proposed to detect the pedestrians or vehicles from the highly similar background. Specifically, we design a guide-learning-based multi-scale detection network (GLNet) to distinguish the weak semantic distinction between the pedestrian and its similar background, and output an accurate segmentation map to the autonomous driving system. The proposed GLNet mainly consists of a backbone network for basic feature extraction, a guide-learning module (GLM) to generate the principal prediction map, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) for prediction map refinement. Based on the guide learning and coarse-to-fine strategy, the final prediction map can be obtained with the proposed GLNet which precisely describes the position and contour information of the pedestrians or vehicles. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, e.g., CHAMELEON, CAMO, COD10K, and NC4K, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GLNet compared with several existing state-of-the-art methods.},

With the introduction of massive sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) fusion applications, IATS is needed to support data transmission rates up to 10 Gb/s. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has attracted extensive attention owing to abundant spectrum resources, which can support the timely transmission of massive data. However, performance degradation of mmWave due to signal blockage has become one of the critical technical challenges. Road bridges as one of the common obstacles in urban scenarios, which has severe blockage effects on communication links. Therefore, this paper comprehensively studies the impact of road bridge blockage effects on mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and proposes an empirical model that can accurately characterize the bridge blockage effect. First, we use a self-developed mmWave channel sounder to carry out channel measurements on typical urban roads. Measurement results indicate that a maximum extra propagation loss of up to 23 dB is caused by road bridges. In addition, to address the deficiencies of existing propagation prediction models, the Single Road Bridge (SRB) model is proposed in this work. This model reveals for the first time the extra propagation loss caused by the road bridge to the channel. Compared with existing models, the SRB model can make the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) within 5 dB. The proposed SRB model is of great value for accurately simulating real-world road bridge blockage events when designing future IATS.},

Specifically, a cooperative jammer is placed in the system to deliberately disrupt the eavesdropper without affecting the legitimate receiver. In order to characterize the performance of the proposed scheme, new approximate closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived by adopting the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. Additionally, the asymptotic behavior of SOP at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is also studied to provide more insights into the system design. We also derive the asymptotic SOP, when the number of transmit antennas tends to infinity. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of our analytical results and to show that 1) the secrecy performance can be significantly improved by allocating part of the transmit power to perform cooperative jamming and 2) the optimal power allocation factor is related to the total transmit power.},

With the support of 5G networks, real-time transmission and storage of traffic data of shared bikes have become reality. We then use these data to train the GANEM model to have better generalization performance. The GANEM model first uses GAN to learn the data features of existing shared bikes demand to generate new training samples. We borrow the idea of ensemble learning, three benchmark predictors are integrated to fully exploit the association between explicit features, which can improve the robustness of the model. Excellent prediction results are achieved on two real datasets. The experimental results of our proposed GANEM model on two datasets are as follows, the values of MAE are 0.120 and 0.144, the values of MSE are 0.027 and 0.032, the values of RMSE are 0.164 and 0.181.},

First, the models do not take into account the impact of the importance of features on the forecast ability. Secondly, single feature data cannot reflect the complex buying and selling logic of the passenger car market, and the previous models have not been able to explore the combination effects between different features well. Therefore, in this work, we propose a passenger car sales forecast model based on the convolutional neural network and attention mechanism (PCSFCA). Its innovation lies firstly in the use of the attention mechanism to calculate the importance of features, which enables the model to value important features and ignore unimportant ones. The second is the use of convolutional neural networks to extract the higher-order information of features, which facilitates the model to capture complex data distribution. Besides, we use the 5G network to build a cloud platform for real-time collection of passenger car sales records. The collected sales data are input to the model, and then the model can be learned in real-time. The comparison of experimental results with several benchmark models illustrates the effectiveness of the PCSFCA model.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years. Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can help unmanned vehicles accurately explore the environment at a lower cost, and the readability of the map can be improved by integrating target detection algorithms. However, the location and 3D shape of the object in the map were not obtained. The method of RGBD-SLAM based on object detection with two-stream YOLOv4-MobileNetv3 convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper. RGBD SLAM algorithm and target detection algorithm are combined to build an algorithm model that can generate the global sparse map and build target dense map quickly. The two-stream network is integrated to obtain 2D information about the target, and further combined with the camera pose after the front-end key frame detection of the SLAM algorithm in this paper, and the dense 3D point cloud of the target and the center point position of the object is obtained. Then, the sparse point cloud of the SLAM system and the dense point cloud of the target can be obtained. The experimental results show that the number of point clouds decreases by about 50% and the time for mapping accounts for about 60% of the global dense mapping time. The method of this paper can efficiently decrease the computational space and improve the speed of semantic mapping, which verifies its feasibility and superiority. It can be used to achieve large-area mapping and the ability to update maps during autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {As increasingly prevalent technologies in autonomous driving, 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of autonomous vehicle (IoAV) technology is recognized as a technique that is capable of disruptively changing the way people travel and greatly improving the travel experience. In the IoAV scenarios, information dissemination is inseparable from the interaction between autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure. However, existing efforts rarely focus on the secrecy, authenticity of interactive data and flexible one-to-many communication between autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a tamper-resistant broadcasting (TRBS) scheme for secure communication, which handles the inefficiencies and insecurity of existing identity-based broadcast signcryption solutions. Not only can our TRBS protect communication data from being illegally accessed, forged, or tampered with by malicious vehicles, but it can also enable efficient and flexible secure information dissemination between autonomous vehicles. We also exhibit strict security proofs and experimental evaluations to demonstrate our TRBS is secure and efficient for real-world applications.},

However, the stringent latency and bandwidth requirements of most machine vision applications pose significant challenges to the existing infrastructure. Hence, there is a dearth of prior research examining whether the latency of real applications in ICS aligns with the needs of machine vision scenarios, let alone any performance evaluations conducted in this regard. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review and proposed a novel machine vision architecture that can analyze traffic data in real-time in the V2X scenario within ICS. Furthermore, based on the end-to-end latency assessment of the system, we outline a plan to optimize the latency as per the requirements of the machine vision application. Our findings show that with appropriate algorithms and architecture, the ICS system can meet the stringent needs of machine vision applications. Our research can provide valuable insights as a guideline on ICS with high latency requirements and therefore pave the way for future explorations in this field.},

  abstract     = {More robust intelligent transportation systems including autonomous driving systems are in full flourish with the revolution of deep learning and the 6G wireless communication network. Vehicle Re-Identification, an indispensable branch of the intelligent transportation system, aims to retrieve specific vehicles captured from non-overlapping cameras. However, this is fundamentally challenging with the substantial inter-class similarity and substantial intra-class divergence. Embedding semantic information into vehicle re- identification task has gained ample interest, but the performance needs to be further improved. This work proposes a semantic-oriented feature coupling transformer (SOFCT) for vehicle re- identification as a solution. Specifically, the knowledge-based transformer is first embedded to model images with discriminative attributes. Second, original patches are divided into five semantic groups via semantics-patches coupling, and the feature extractions for different semantics are performed in the semantic feature extraction (SFE) transformer. Third, patch features are weighted via semantics-patches coupling in the patch feature weighting (PFW) transformer, the weighted feature is fed into subsequent encoders to excavate information. Finally, two groups of learnable semantics are embedded to automatically learn semantic features in the learnable semantic extraction (LSE) transformer. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SOFCT method surpasses other state-of-the-arts with the mAP/Rank-1 of 80.7%/96.6%, 89.8%/84.5%, 86.4%/80.9%, and 84.3%/78.7% on VeRi776 and VehicleID.},

Intelligent anti- collision control via inter-vehicle communication technology can facilitate vehicles adhering to spacing speed standards and improve road utilization and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we apply a deep learning image estimation model based on joint attention mechanism. The network framework uses a deep estimation network Yolov5 and a location based VANET information fast transmission strategy to work together. This paper mainly considers vehicle distance measurement technology as a point of entry to study multi-sensor information fusion for vehicle collision prevention technology based on the self-organizing vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). This paper also proposes a solution based on the strategy of one-way transmission of shared information and dynamic valuation of a cluster distance threshold with vehicle density. The proposed vehicle anti-collision control algorithm is designed to realize dynamic vehicle control via inter-vehicle communication. In this paper, the two-way coupling of traffic flow and network simulator is used to randomly generate vehicle nodes on the road, and the behavior of the anti-collision system is simulated. The experimental results show that the predetermined control goal is achieved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for real-time traffic volume prediction on urban links that incorporates vehicle travel trajectories extracted from recorded license plate recognition data using Radio Frequency Identification. A Recurrent Neural Network is used to identify route patterns and predict future routes, and link traffic volume is estimated by aggregating all predicted vehicle trajectories that pass through each base station. Our approach achieves a high prediction accuracy with a mean value of 85.19% and a standard deviation of 5.29%. Comparing our approach with a traditional Recurrent Neural Network based on historical traffic volume data, the vehicle trajectory-based approach yields an average accuracy improvement of 39.70%. These results highlight the superiority of our approach for predicting traffic volume in real-time and demonstrate its potential as a valuable tool for traffic control and road guidance.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based time series classification in 6G-supported Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) helps transport decision-making. Deep learning classifier training necessitates a large amount of labeled data for feature extraction. Labeling time series data in 6G-supported ITS is tough. Meta-learning can be used to train deep classifiers with limited data. However, in meta-learning, the tasks are frequently modeled by a low-complexity base learner. It is unable to use more complicate and powerful structures. The meta-learning-pretrained classifier can only perform new classification problems with the same number of classes. Most pre-training strategies do not prioritize enhancing the pre-training phase’s convergence rate and lowering the computational cost. Most research work aims to improve classification performance by increasing the complexity of the classification model. However, this raises computing costs. In this paper, we propose a one-dimensional Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution Neural Network time series classifier (MSDCNN). MSDCNN combines multi-scale CNN and dilated CNN. It can extract multi-scale characteristics from time series and reduce the complexity of the classifier. Furthermore, we propose a pre-training strategy, called Meta-transfer metric Learning using Scale function (MLS). MLS allows the classifier to gain experience from different tasks with various numbers of classes. Experiments show that MLS reduces pre-training computation costs during the pre-training phase. The pre-trained classifier, without using any fine tuning techniques, achieves the highest accuracy by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we present a case study of applying MSDCNN and MLS to detect road accidents in 6G-supported transportation systems.},

To build a wide range of positioning network based on large-scale wireless networks, it is of great challenge to simultaneously solve the problem of unacceptable delay and bandwidth requirements caused by a large number of channel state information (CSI) data transmission. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm, named PAOFIT, where a projection transformation aided CSI curve fitting compression algorithm is firstly proposed to decrease data distortions by improving the orthogonality of signal subspace and noise subspace, and an adaptive weighted average fitting order judgment algorithm is proposed to calculate the fitting order needed in the curve fitting process. Then, localization parameter, time of flight (ToF) are estimated by CSI reconstruction and parameter estimation. Finally, the location of the target is obtained by substituting these parameters into time difference of arrival (TDoA) wireless localization technology. Extensive experimental results verify that, compared with the existing compression algorithms, the proposed PAOFIT has a better performance in terms of compression ratio, median positioning error, residual and execution time.},

  abstract     = {Computation and memory resource management strategies are the backbone of continuous object tracking in intelligent vehicle orchestration. Multi-object tracking generates enormous measurements of targets and extended object positions using light detection and ranging (Lidar) sensors. Designing an adequate object-tracking system is a global challenge because of dynamic object detection and data association uncertainties during scene understanding. In this regard, we develop an intelligent multi-objective tracking (IMOT) system with a novel measurement model, called the box data association inflate (BDAI) model, to assess each target’s object state and trajectory without noise by using the Bayesian approach. The box object filter method filters ambiguous detection responses during data association. The theoretical proof of the box object filter is derived based on binomial expansion. Prognosticating a lower-dimension object than the original point object reduces the computational complexity of vehicle orchestration. Two datasets (NuScenes dataset and our lab dataset) are considered during the simulations, and our approach measures the kinematic states adequately with reduced computation complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. The simulation outcomes show that our proposed method is effective and works well to detect and track objects. The NuScenes dataset contains 28130 samples for training, 6019 examples for validation and 6008 samples for testing. IMOT achieves 58.09% tracking accuracy and 71% mAP with 5 ms pre-processing time. The Jetson Xavier NX consumes 49.63% GPU and 9.37% average power and exhibits 25.32 ms latency compared to other approaches. Our system trains a single pair frame in 169.71 ms with affinity estimation time of 12.19 ms, track association time of 0.19 ms and mATE of 0.245 compared to state-of-the-art approaches},

An optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average achievable rate is formulated to jointly design the communication scheduling, the RIS’s phase shift, and the three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory. To solve such a non-convex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain its suboptimal solution.

  abstract     = {With significant advances in manufacturing technology, multiple sensors such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) devices, inertial measurement units (IMU) and cameras have become affordable in intelligent vehicle systems and are generally integrated for motion estimation and environmental perception. In such integrated systems, accurate and flexible sensor calibration is a basic foundation for optimal information fusion. However, traditional calibration methods are generally labor-intensive or only applicable to handheld platforms. To address this issue, we propose an accurate and plug-and-play self-calibration method for in-vehicle GNSS/inertial navigation system (INS)/Vision system. Without relying on specially-designed targets and initial guess of sensor setups, all involved sensing parameters, including GNSS-IMU and Camera-IMU spatial-temporal extrinsics, are properly initialized and estimated online via a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Besides, an observability constrained module is also developed to address degradation cases through detailed observability analysis. The results in both Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments indicate that the proposed method enables accurate online calibration of all spatiotemporal parameters involved in GNSS/INS/Vision systems and shows superior calibration performance over the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, for the first time, we prove the superiority of using raw GNSS observations to enhance camera-IMU calibration than using processed GNSS positions or not using any GNSS information.},

  abstract     = {Public electric transport grids tend to be oversized and underutilized. Therefore, they can become sustainable and multi-functional backbones to the city AC grid by integrating smart grid elements into their infrastructures. However, integrating smart grid loads and renewables requires a large array of wirelessly communicating sensors across the traction substations, the smart grid components, and each vehicle of the transport fleet. This can be both costly and technically complex. This paper proposes an analytical state estimator that can predict vehicle traffic count and spare power capacity under a traction substation without the use of any additional sensors. The estimator uses existing, locally available measurements at any power node on the traction section to inform the decision-making of the power management scheme at that node. Validating the results with up to 100000 stochastic test simulations of a verified traction grid model, up to 76% of the monitored conditions were detected, with no false positives, and without the need for additional sensors and wireless communication.},

As the essential factors to implement transport sustainability, a referred energy-efficient trajectory and an energy-saving infrastructure for train operations could guide trains running through with conquering complicated environmental impacts and help to control the energy flows in traction processes. Thus, we attempt to discover the optimal way of adapting to the track changes and resistances in train running and evaluate the energy exchanges with Energy Storage System (ESS) in an extended power supply network. In this study, we firstly optimize a train trajectory with consideration of air and track resistances by using a modified Q-Learning (QL) method. Secondly, for coordinated application between ESS and trains, an integration module is designed by implanting train trajectories. Specifically, based on the working properties of ESS, a deceleration-acceleration time separation is matched for supplementing the charging/discharging times of the devices. The space-time presentation is introduced to portray train running phases for connections with control processes of ESS. Then, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed for minimizing deceleration-acceleration overlaps. A Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is introduced to solve such complex problems. Finally, a numerical test is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the model in Beijing, China.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the optimal resource allocation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless-powered two-way communications. The communication process considered here consists of two steps. First, the UAV transmits a control signal over wireless links while ground terminals (GTs) receive information and harvest energy simultaneously, with each GT then using the harvested energy to send data to the UAV. We aim to maximize the minimum uplink throughput among GTs while ensuring the minimum requirement of the downlink throughput for each GT by optimizing the time allocation, the transmit power and the trajectory of the UAV along with the energy harvesting ratio of GTs. First, we propose an effective optimization-based approach to address the non-convexity of the formulated problem, which is difficult to solve. Specifically, we apply a successive convex optimization technique to approximate the convex problem for each optimization variable and find the optimal resource management strategy through a block coordinate descent algorithm. To reduce the high computational complexity of the optimization-based approach, we also develop a deep learning (DL)-based approach consisting of an efficient deep neural network framework and a novel training methodology. Simulation results confirm that the proposed schemes show significant performance improvements over existing baseline schemes. We also confirm that the DL-based scheme achieves performance comparable to the optimization-based scheme with a much shorter computation time.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers promising solutions for various delay-sensitive vehicular applications by providing high-speed computing services for a large number of user vehicles simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted secure offloading for vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks in the presence of multiple malicious eavesdropper vehicles. To secure the wireless offloading from the user vehicles to the MEC server at the base station, the physical layer security (PLS) technology is leveraged, where a group of jammer vehicles is scheduled to form a NOMA cluster with each user vehicle for providing jamming signals to the eavesdropper vehicles while not interfering with the legitimate offloading of the user vehicle. We formulate a joint optimization of the transmit power, the computation resource allocation and the selection of jammer vehicles in each NOMA cluster, with the objective of minimizing the system energy consumption while subjecting to the computation delay constraint. Due to the dynamic characteristics of the wireless fading channel and the high mobility of the vehicles, the joint optimization is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Therefore, we propose an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) learning algorithm-based energy-efficiency secure offloading (EESO) scheme to solve the MDP problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the agent adopting the A3C-based EESO scheme can rapidly adapt to the highly dynamic VEC networks and improve the system energy efficiency on the premise of ensuring offloading information security and low computation delay.},

  abstract     = {The importance of Maritime transportation energy conservation and emission reduction has been increasingly recognized. A novel bio-inspired method utilizing the favorable hydrodynamic interaction in ship convoys is introduced in this paper to achieve an energy bonus for the whole formation system or/and the members. Firstly, grid convergence analysis and virtual captive model tests are conducted to verify the grid discretization method and validate the adopted numerical method. Following this, simulations based on STAR CCM+ are performed in different configurations at low speeds ( $Fr = 0.0479 \sim 0.0958$ ) to reveal how sailing in formation affects energy consumption. Then, the speed effects on ship convoy resistance are investigated with two specific speeds ( $Fr=0.0958, 0.2$ ). A generalized model based on support vector regression (SVR) is established to evaluate the resistance characteristics of ships in different layouts and velocities to find the optimal configuration for ships in different scenarios. Furthermore, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results of model-scale ships, based on the VOF (Volume of Fluid) method, are extrapolated to full-scale ships. The results show that the fuel savings and emission reduction could reach up to 5.09% at $Fr$ =0.2 when the longitudinal distance between the ships equals to 1.125 of the ship length. The conclusions of this work could provide theoretical support for utilizing the bonus of sailing in formation.},

However, the vulnerability of the deployed model to adversarial attacks has raised security concerns. Previous studies have mainly explored adversarial attacks in the digital domain. While physical attacks have posed a more serious threat to UAVs. In this paper, we have explored a novel R obust P hysical A ttack against U AVs named RPAU, which directly threatens the flight safety of UAVs. Specifically, three attacks are proposed in RPAU: Hiding Attack (HA), Yaw Attack (YA), and Obstacle Attack (OA). To launch the attacks, we overcome three domain-design challenges, including continuous perturbation, digital-physical domain gap, and optimum perturbation generation. For continuous perturbation, we have introduced a nested patch that realizes attacks at any distance. Further, a series of transformations are considered to narrow the gap between the digital and physical domains. Then, we proposed a time-dependent mechanism for generating optimum perturbation. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the digital domain, simulation environment, and physical domain. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed framework. In the digital domain, RPAU outperforms the baseline by 54.9% average attack success rate (ASR). More importantly, RPAU is still effective in both the simulation environment and the physical domain, achieving an average ASR of 100%.},

Considering the complexity of the target problem, we propose parameter adjustment algorithm based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). Experiments on the classical dataset show high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Most studies regarding traffic data recovery either assume that the original data are clean or complete, while such two issues often coexist in reality due to inevitable data measurement errors like detector malfunctions. In this paper, we fully exploit the algebraically low-rank property of traffic spatiotemporal data and develop an innovative tensor completion approach (termed SCPN) based on the tensor Schatten capped $p $ norm, a unified representation of tensor norms with a high flexibility. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to a robust form (termed RSCPN) by leveraging the sparsity of unstructured outliers, with the aim to reconstruct ground-truth values from corrupted and incomplete observations. Finally, associated optimization solutions based on the alternating direction multiplier method are derived. Extensive experiments on four datasets substantiate the significant superiority of our proposed models over other state-of-the-art methods on both missing data imputation and corrupted data recovery tasks with miscellaneous simulated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Heavy-haul transportation plays a significant role in railway freight. Limited by the complex topography and resource distribution, China’s heavy-haul railways contain a great number of long downward slopes, which is the main challenge for heavy-haul combined trains. Constrained by the pneumatic brake system of the train, cyclic pneumatic brake needs to be applied to provide adequate braking capability, when the train is running on a long and steep downward slope. The subject of this work is 20,000-tonne heavy-haul combined trains, consisting of 1 locomotive +105 wagons + 1 locomotive + 105 wagons with end of train device (abbreviated as 1+1+ EOT). The test data show that the switching process from service lap to brake release is quite dangerous when applying cyclic pneumatic brake. During the brake release process, the asymmetric forces on the front and rear vehicles can result in the exacerbation of longitudinal forces. This paper establishes a simulation model of the heavy-haul combined trains’ cyclic braking process. Meanwhile, we focus on the release process of the cyclic pneumatic brake, and investigate the effect of the initial speed of dynamic braking adjustment, value and time of dynamic braking application, and differentiated collaborative control of leader and follower locomotives on the longitudinal train dynamics (LTD). The comparison of these simulation results reveals how differentiated collaborative control strategy works on the longitudinal dynamics of heavy-haul combined trains, laying the foundation for the optimization of longitudinal dynamic performance during cyclic pneumatic brake.},

  abstract     = {Transportation big data generated from various Internet of Things devices have the feature of muti-source and heterogeneous. To efficiently represent and analyze these ubiquitous transportation big data, tensor and tensor-based data analysis methods have been widely adopted in recent years. As a tensor-based machine learning method, high-order dominant Z-eigen decomposition (HODZED) in multivariate multi-order Markov model is suitable for multi-modal transportation prediction. However, massive transportation data are usually generated in a streaming way and the transportation system requires frequent updates. To avoid recalculating the history data and provide immediate prediction, we propose a tensor train (TT) based incremental HODZED (TT-IHODZED) method. Concretely, we first present an incremental HODZED (IHODZED) method to update the dominant Z-eigentensor in multivariate multi-order Markov model. Then, TT-based tensor operations are adopted to IHODZED to speed up calculations, especially the repeated Einstein products. Furthermore, to solve the TT-based high-order linear equations in TT-IHODZED method, we also propose a TT-based biconjugate gradient stabilized (TT-HOBiCGS) algorithm. Experimental results based on real-world and synthetic datasets show that, compared to HODZED method, TT-IHODZED significantly improves computation efficiency up to 10 times while keeping the same or even better prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The continuous evolution of cellular networks has resulted in the rapid increase in both mobile applications and devices in the Internet of Vehicles. The introduction of the multi-access edge computing method makes it possible for vehicles in remote areas to offload their computational tasks, which can effectively relieve the computing pressure of local devices and reduce the computational delay as well. Tasks offloading for multi-user is a resource competition problem, especially in dynamic environments, which is difficult to be solved by traditional algorithms. In this article, we propose a two-layer hybrid system with local and edge computing, providing convenient computing and offloading services for vehicle users in dual dynamic scenarios of task generation and vehicle mobility. The delay and queuing situations are considered comprehensively in the formulated optimization problem, which can be solved by the proposed deep deterministic policy gradient-based computation offloading algorithm. The offloading process of the vehicle tasks in dynamic scenarios is transformed into a Markov decision process to obtain the offloading strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of two-tier computing architecture. Compared with random offloading, deep Q network-based offloading, and local computing, the algorithm proposed in this article gains the highest average reward of tasks. Besides that, numerical results also prove that our algorithm has the lowest average delay under different computing capabilities of edge servers.},

  abstract     = {In an intelligent transportation system, accurate traffic flow prediction can provide significant help for travel planning. Even though some methods are proposed to do so, they focus on either algorithm or data level studies. This work focuses on both by proposing a Community-based dandelion algorithm-enabled Feature selection and Broad learning system (CFB). Specifically, a feature selection method is adopted to choose suitable features aiming to avoid redundant ones affecting prediction accuracy, and a neural network-based learning algorithm, namely a Broad Learning System (BLS), is used to predict traffic flow. In order to further boost its prediction performance, a Community-based Dandelion Algorithm (CDA) is proposed by considering an individual and its multiple offspring as a community and adopting a learning strategy for different communities. The proposed CDA is used to a) choose the suitable features as a feature selection method; and b) optimize the parameters and network structure of BLS. CDA’s superiority over its competitive peers is first verified on CEC2013’s benchmark functions, and then the proposed CFB is applied to handle the traffic flow prediction problems. The results indicate that it can improve the prediction accuracy by 5%-16% compared to the updated traffic flow prediction methods.},

To achieve safe navigation in uncertain working environments containing obstacles, the proposed algorithm applies a modified probabilistic roadmap to generating a connected search graph considering the risk of collision with the obstacles. Furthermore, a recursive node and link generation scheme determines a more efficient search graph without extra complexity to reduce the computational burden during the planning procedure. An optimal three-dimensional trajectory generation is then suggested to connect the optimal discrete path generated by the planning algorithm, and the robust control policy is designed based on the cascade $NLH_{\infty} $ framework. The integrated framework is capable of compensating for the effects of uncertainties and disturbances while accomplishing the area coverage mission.

  abstract     = {Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs), have developed rapidly towards information networking, and they are destined to become an important carrier of future travel. However, they also face some challenges like cyber-security. Controller Area Network (CAN), as a typical communication medium of ICVs, is very vulnerable to cyber-attacks since they lack identity authentication and message encryption. Therefore, how to pinpoint the source of abnormal messages, also namely Electronic Control Unit (ECU) source mapping scheme, is of significance to the in-vehicle communication. However, most existing studies that utilize learning algorithms consider little on the stability of training features. To this end, this paper develops a hybrid-feature-extraction based ECU mapping scheme derived from physical features of network signals. In detail, more stable bit-block groups and mode value of high-level voltages are extracted as training features. On this basis, single-layer Softmax classifier is formulated to accurately identify ECU sources. Finally, the proposed scheme is experimentally validated with eight ECUs in a real-world vehicle. Results show that the average identification accuracy of all ECUs is close to 98%, which has been improved by more than 6% compared with other typical methods. The present study effectively addresses the deficiency of identity authentication in CAN.},

  abstract     = {Increasing attention has been drawn to computational pedestrian behavior models aimed at understanding the interaction mechanisms between pedestrians and vehicles. Nevertheless, existing research lacks exploration of the underlying behavioral mechanisms of pedestrian crossing decisions, which leads to unrealistic modeling results. In particular, when dealing with continuous traffic flow scenarios, the concept of waiting time is frequently used to account for all intricate traffic flow effects. Moreover, very few studies considered the time-dynamic nature of crossing decisions. To address these research limitations, this study deconstructs pedestrian crossing decisions at uncontrolled intersections with continuous traffic flow through a cognitive process and proposes an anthropomorphic crossing decision model. Specifically, we propose a novel visual collision cue-based crossing decision-initiation model to characterize time-dynamic crossing decisions. In light of the risk-aversion theory, a traffic gap comparison strategy is put forward to explain and model pedestrian waiting behavior in traffic flow. Two datasets collected from a CAVE-based immersive pedestrian simulator are applied to calibrate and validate the model. The proposed model accurately predicts pedestrian crossing decisions across all traffic scenarios. The modeling performance is significantly enhanced by considering the proposed traffic gap comparison strategy. Moreover, the model accurately captures the timing of crossing decisions. This work concisely demonstrates how pedestrians dynamically adapt their crossings in continuous traffic based on visual collision cues, potentially offering insights into modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions or serving as a tool to realize anthropomorphic pedestrian crossing decisions in simulators.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in the presence of Human-driven vehicles (HVs) is challenging, as HVs continuously update their policies in response to AVs. In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents’ behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV’s decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {To autonomous systems (ASs) equipped with single-frequency GNSS chipsets, it is hard to fully use the high-precision carrier phase to assist positioning as the inherent integer ambiguity cannot be reliably obtained using only single-frequency observations, especially in obstructed environments. Although the time difference can be done to eliminate the integer ambiguity to form accurate constraint in graph based fusion, cycle slip is not properly handled in current methods, leading to degraded performance. In this paper, a performance enhancement of tightly coupled GNSS/IMU integration based on factor graph with robust time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) loop closure is proposed. Different from traditional methods, cycle slip detection is firstly performed, and the effect of cycle slip can be eliminated in the formation of loop closure, which can bring about better robustness. Doppler frequency shift is used to detect cycle slip and carrier phase measurements at corresponding epochs are then selected to build TDCP loop closure. The proposed robust TDCP loop closure is fused with pseudorange, Doppler frequency shift and IMU via factor graph, which can make the full use of the absolute and relative measurements to enhance the performance of tightly coupled GNSS/IMU integration. Simulation and field tests are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can improve the positioning performance with robust TDCP loop closure.

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving systems, the monocular 3D object detection algorithm is a crucial component. The safety of autonomous vehicles heavily depends on a well-designed detection system. Therefore, developing a robust and efficient 3D object detection algorithm is a major goal for institutes and researchers. Having a 3D sense is essential in autonomous vehicles and robotics, as it allows the system to understand its surroundings and react accordingly. Compared with stereo-based and Lidar-based methods, monocular 3D Object detection is a challenging task as it only utilizes 2D information to generate complex 3D features, making it low-cost, less computationally intensive, and with great potential. However, the performance of monocular methods is impaired due to the lack of depth information. In this paper, we propose a simple, end-to-end, and effective network for monocular 3D object detection without the use of external training data. Our work is inspired by auxiliary learning, in which we use a robust feature extractor as our backbone and multiple regression heads to learn auxiliary knowledge. These auxiliary regression heads will be discarded after training for improved inference efficiency, allowing us to take advantage of auxiliary learning and enabling the model to learn critical information more conceptually. The proposed method achieves 17.28% and 20.10% for the moderate level of the Car category on the KITTI benchmark test set and validation set, respectively, which outperforms the previous monocular 3D object detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {Driving at night is more challenging and dangerous than driving during the day. Modeling driver eye movement and attention allocation during night driving can help guide unmanned intelligent vehicles and improve safety during similar situations. However, until now, few studies have modeled a drivers’ true fixations and attention allocation in specific night circumstance. Therefore, we collected an eye tracking dataset from 30 experienced drivers while they viewed night driving videos under a hypothetical driving condition, termed Driver Fixation Dataset in night (DrFixD(night)). Based on DrFixD(night) which includes multiple drivers’ attention allocation, we proposed a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network model, named as STDE-Net, to improve saliency detection in night driving condition. The model includes three modules: i) spatio-temporal dual encoding module, ii) fusion module based on attention mechanism, and iii) decoding module. A convolutional LSTM is employed to learn the time connection of video sequences, and a convolution neural network combined pyramid dilated convolution is adopted to extract spatial features in the spatio-temporal dual encoding module. The attention mechanism is exploited to fuse the temporal and spatial features together and selectively highlight the significant features in night traffic scene. We compared the proposed model with other traditional methods and deep learning models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and found that the proposed model can predict driver’s fixation more accurately. Specifically, the proposed model not only predicts the main goals, but also predicts the important sub goals, such as pedestrians, bicycles and so on, showing excellent prediction of dimly lit targets at night.},

  abstract     = {Human drivers are requested by the Automated Vehicle (AV) to perform takeover actions if needed. Existing research mainly focuses on predicting the takeover quality due to distraction using wearable sensor data. It is unrealistic, unnatural, and inapplicable to require human drivers to wear these sensors when driving an AV so that their situational awareness for takeover actions can be continuously monitored. Moreover, traffic conflicts can be observed even if drivers take over as requested. Current practice mainly develops conflict-actuated collision avoidance systems that alert drivers once the traffic conflict reaches a certain threshold. There is a research need to anticipate conflicts other than by measuring them. Besides, drivers are still responsible for responding to the alerts, which leaves the possibility of resulting in human error-related safety issues. This research aims at developing a Non-intrusive, Ultra-advanced Collision Avoidance System (NIUCAS) under automated driving. NIUCAS applies the brake pedal for drivers if it predicts the absence of takeover actions due to distraction or predicts traffic conflicts before they can be measured. The NIUCAS prototype was implemented in a driving simulator. An experiment was conducted by recruiting sixty participants to drive a vehicle under Level 3 automation, going through jaywalking scenarios, and being requested to take over. Participants’ demographics were collected to predict the takeover actions, while vehicle-related performance was collected to predict the traffic conflicts. Three machine learning-based modeling techniques were chosen as candidates for predictions. Additionally, an empirical equation is formulated to quantify the safety benefits of implementing NIUCAS.},

  abstract     = {Origin-Destination demand prediction is a fundamental and important task in the urban transportation system. It is more challenging and complex than region demand prediction since it needs to predict traffic demand for each pair of regions rather than a single region, which means $N^{2}$ time series need to be predicted given $N$ stations. Most existing works are mainly proposed for the region (or station) demand prediction. On the other hand, previous Origin-Destination demand prediction methods only follow a single discrete-time setting while the input data are continuous-time OD orders, which means these methods have not sufficiently leveraged the rich information for demand prediction. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel framework consisting of both continuous-time and discrete-time representation learning modules for Origin-Destination demand prediction. Firstly, we construct memorable representations of all nodes and design a continuous-time learning module to update the nodes’ representations once a time-stamped OD transaction is observed. Then, a discrete-time representation learning module is proposed to generate discrete-time messages containing information across a fixed time interval from a macro perspective. Next, a co-updater module is designed to fuse messages from both continuous-time and discrete-time channels into node memory. Last, a graph attention module is developed, which generates final node embeddings using updated node memory and predicts the forthcoming OD demand matrix based on them. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method leads to significant and consistent improvements compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) helps improve the road safety and traffic efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Accurately predicting the trajectories of traffic participants is essential to the decision-making and motion planning of AVs in interactive scenarios. Recently, learning-based trajectory predictors have shown state-of-the-art performance in highway or urban areas. However, most existing learning-based models trained with fixed datasets may perform poorly in continuously changing scenarios. Specifically, they may not perform well in learned scenarios after learning the new one. This phenomenon is called “catastrophic forgetting”. Few studies investigate trajectory predictions in continuous scenarios, where catastrophic forgetting may happen. To handle this problem, first, a novel continual learning (CL) approach for vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed in this paper. Then, inspired by brain science, a dynamic memory mechanism is developed by utilizing the measurement of traffic divergence between scenarios, which balances the performance and training efficiency of the proposed CL approach. Finally, datasets collected from different locations are used to design continual training and testing methods in experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves consistently high prediction accuracy in continuous scenarios without re-training, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting compared to non-CL approaches. The implementation of the proposed approach is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/D-GSM .},

We then illustrate that smart charging and minor modifications to flight schedules can substantially reduce peak power demands, and in turn the needs for grid infrastructure upgrade. Motivated by our data analysis, we next formulate an optimization problem for flight rescheduling that incorporates HEA charging considerations. This problem jointly decides flight schedules and charging profiles to manage airport congestion and peak power demands. We further consider mechanisms via which airlines and airports can negotiate HEA assignments using said optimization problem.

To this end, the finite airspace is partitioned into keep-in and keep-out subspaces with keep-out subspace(s) or zone(s) enclosing buildings and restricted no-fly regions. The keep-in subspace is divided into navigable channels that safely wrap keep-out zone(s). We define the airspace planning problem with a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation in which states are defined based on spatial and temporal airspace features and actions denote transitions between safe navigable channels.

Evaluating the performance of the system requires the design of a diverse set of tests which spans the targeted working scenarios and conditions. These tests can then undergo a process of evaluation using a set of adapted performance metrics. This work addresses the problem of performance evaluation for an autonomous vehicle in a shared space with pedestrians. The methodology for designing the test simulations is discussed. Moreover, a group of performance metrics is proposed to evaluate the different aspects of the navigation: the motion safety, the quality of the generated trajectory and the comfort of the pedestrians surrounding the vehicle. Furthermore, the success/fail criterion for each metric is discussed. The implementation of the proposed evaluation method is illustrated by evaluating the performance of a pre-designed proactive navigation system using a shared space crowd simulator under Robot Operating System (ROS).},

A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of vehicles is approximated to a “global” linear model by the Koopman operator theory. A synchronous distributed predictive control scheme of vehicle platoons is proposed as an upper-level controller, where both the linear vehicle model and a linear parametric-varying lane-keeping model are adopted to predict the dynamic of vehicles, and keep vehicles in the designated lane. Thus, it can avoid the solution of nonlinear optimization problems and reduce the computational burden accordingly. A lower-level controller is designed, where the desired longitudinal control force determined by the upper-level controller is transformed into the desired throttle angle and brake pressure through an inverse longitudinal dynamics model of vehicles. The joint simulation results by PreScan, CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink show that when the leader vehicle accelerates or decelerates, the following vehicles in the platoon can keep the same velocity as the leader vehicle, and maintain the desired safety distance between the front and rear vehicles. In addition, joint simulation in the curved road scenario show that the performance of lane keeping can be guaranteed for vehicle platoons with the proposed control strategy.},

In this scheme, the superiority of MPC in handling constraints is retained in acquiring time-varying control gains. Compared with trial and error, the efficiency of searching for proper control gains can be improved dramatically while considering optimization. Specifically, by binding the ship rolling angle to the original state variables of shipboard cranes, a coordination transformation is first carried out to facilitate the controller design by excluding the specific expression of ship rollings. Then an energy-based nonlinear controller is proposed, and the system stability can be rigorously guaranteed based on the Lyapunov theory and LaSalle’s invariance principle. To improve the performance of the energy-based controller with gains derived through trial and error tuning, a novel MPC-based auto-tuning mechanism is further established so the optimal and time-varying control gains can be determined more effectively. The other merit of the proposed scheme lying in the state constraints and input saturation are taken into account to enhance the safe operation of shipboard cranes. Finally, numerical simulations are elaborately made, and comparison results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme, especially in optimality, coordination control performance, and dealing with constraints.},

This article presents a case study of the optimization of congestion pricing policy design using the Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), an open-sourced transportation planning and decision support system (DSS) that uses an agent-based simulation (ABS) and optimization framework to evaluate transportation system interventions. The study exemplifies how the granularity offered by activity-based travel demand models and ABS can be leveraged to enhance the interpretability of multi-objective transportation policy optimization through rich analyses of the effects of policy design on both individual- and system-level outcomes. The location and size of a circular charging zone with two different pricing schemes (a cordon fee and a cordoned mileage fee) are encoded as inputs to an ABS with an activity-based travel model of 15,000 travelers. Through an analysis of the effects of various weighting schemes across congestion-, social-, and revenue-based objectives, we present a method for interpretation of the inherent trade-offs in transportation policy optimization and demonstrate the importance of cultivating transparency in policy DSS that use black-box optimization in order to produce explainable, defensible policy strategies. We find that cordoned mileage fees Pareto-dominate cordon tolls, enabling greater improvements across all objectives studied. However, the prioritization of congestion reduction poses a challenge for pricing optimization in that it may result in unnecessarily large mode shifts away from driving which significantly worsens travel cost burden. We explore the role of weighting schemes in shifting the priority of optimal pricing schemes to social equity while mitigating congestion and maintaining toll revenue.},

In these applications, deep learning is widely used as a key artificial intelligence technology. However, most ITS providers fail to collect enough labeled traffic data for model training. As a complement to deep learning, transfer learning is an effective way to solve the scarcity of labeled data, which can transfer knowledge from labeled datasets to unlabeled datasets, thus improving the accuracy of prediction and classification. Nevertheless, when the labeled dataset and the unlabeled dataset are held by different entities, it is still unrealistic for two mutually distrustful entities to cooperate in transfer learning regarding data security and privacy preservation. Although some existing works provide privacy-preserving transfer learning methods, such methods fail to apply to traffic data with high sample dimensions due to their high computational cost and round complexity. To address this problem, we design an efficient privacy-preserving distributed transfer learning protocol, which is appropriate for traffic data. Compared to existing works, our protocol addresses the privacy-preserving problem of transfer learning for traffic data with high sample dimensions. In addition, our protocol has fewer interaction rounds and can be proved in the semi-honest model. Finally, we validate the effectiveness, efficiency and security of the proposed protocol via experiments. Furthermore, we show the application of the proposed protocol in intelligent transportation systems.},

Aiming at addressing security concerns in future AVs, in this paper, we develop SPAD, a secured framework to forbid free-riders and promote trustworthy data dissemination in collaborative autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a publish/subscribe framework for inter-vehicle data transmissions. To defend against free-riding attacks, we formulate the interactions between publisher AVs and subscriber AVs as a vehicular publish/subscribe game, and incentivize AVs to deliver high-quality data by analyzing the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. We also design a reputation evaluation mechanism in the game to identify malicious AVs in disseminating fake information. Furthermore, for lack of sufficient knowledge on parameters of the network model and the user cost model in dynamic game scenarios, a reinforcement learning based algorithm with hotbooting is developed to obtain the optimal strategies of subscriber AVs and publisher AVs with free-rider prevention. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results validate that our SPAD can effectively prevent free-riders and enhance the dependability of disseminated contents, compared with conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {Drivers initiate a discretionary lane change when they perceive an anticipated improvement in their own driving condition from moving to another lane. However, such a lane change can slow down other vehicles on the target lane, and even worse initiate a disturbance. In this work, we argue that the blocking effect triggered by individual lane changes results from the heterogeneity in the desired speeds of vehicles, and thus using desired speed information of vehicles when regulating lane-changing decisions can improve traffic efficiency. In doing so, our work also exemplifies the usefulness of incorporating user preferences into control decisions. The proposed lane guidance system uses an optimization-based approach to update the target range of desired speeds on each lane in real time, and accordingly recommends individual lane changes. The control system coordinates the lane-changing decisions at the link level, for which the road stretch is subdivided into multiple sections that are controlled independently. We evaluate the performance of the lane guidance system in micro-simulation, for different network demands and desired speed distributions. The results highlight that the proposed approach utilizing the desired speed preferences of drivers results in positive efficiency gains for most traffic compositions in free flow. Moreover, the highest gains are expected in medium to high demand, and when the traffic composition includes a higher proportion of vehicles desiring higher speeds. The gains also increase when the desired speeds of vehicles that want to drive fast and those that want to drive slower are more separated.},

  abstract     = {Urban Rail Transit Systems (URTS) have increasingly become the backbone of modern public transportation, attributed to their unparalleled convenience, high efficiency, and commitment to sustainable green energy. As we witness a global resurgence of urban rail transit, it becomes evident that most existing URTS still operate on a level of suboptimal intelligence, with their operation and maintenance methods lagging behind other advanced urban transit systems. URTS generate considerable data, offering substantial opportunities for service quality enhancements. Machine Learning (ML), with its demonstrated proficiency in extracting valuable insights from vast data, hold significant promise in the quest to empower URTS. This survey presents a comprehensive exploration of the potential application of ML in URTS. Initially, we delve into the existing challenges of URTS, thereby elucidating the compelling motivation behind the integration of ML into these systems. We then propose a taxonomy of ML paradigms and techniques, discussing in-depth their potential applications in URTS, encompassing perception, prediction, and optimization tasks. Subsequently, we scrutinize a plethora of ML-empowered URTS application scenarios, including but not limited to obstacle perception, infrastructure perception, communication and cybersecurity perception, passenger flow prediction, train delay prediction, fault prediction, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, train operation and control optimization, train dispatch optimization, and train ground communication optimization. Finally, we present an insightful discussion on the challenges and future directions for URTS, aiming to harness the full potential of ML techniques to deliver superior service and performance.},

Nonetheless, enormous efforts formulate collaborative perception as LiDAR-only 3D detection paradigm, neglecting the significance and complementary of dense image. In this work, we construct the first multi-modal vehicle-to-vehicle cooperative perception framework dubbed as V2VFormer++, where individual camera-LiDAR representation is incorporated with dynamic channel fusion (DCF) at bird’s-eye-view (BEV) space and ego-centric BEV maps from adjacent vehicles are aggregated by global-local transformer module. Specifically, channel-token mixer (CTM) with MLP design is developed to capture global response among neighboring CAVs, and position-aware fusion (PAF) further investigate the spatial correlation between each ego-networked map in a local perspective. In this manner, we could strategically determine which CAVs are desirable for collaboration and how to aggregate the foremost information from them. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on both publicly-available OPV2V and V2X-Sim 2.0 benchmarks, and our proposed V2VFormer++ reports the state-of-the-art cooperative perception performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement. Moreover, ablation study and visualization analysis further suggest the strong robustness against diverse disturbances from real-world scenarios.},

Although numerous sequential modeling based methods (e.g., recurrent neural networks) have been proposed for human mobility prediction, accurately modeling individuals’ high-order travel preferences and the influence of social neighbors on their travel decisions remains challenging. In this paper, we construct a novel multi-context aware model for next location prediction, which aggregates multi-dimensional contextual features, including individual preferences, social relations, and activity-location associations. First, we define activity prediction as an auxiliary task and propose an activity-location association pruning method to mitigate the impact of data sparsity on model prediction. Second, we present a novel motif-preserving individual travel preference learning method that leverages a motif-induced hypergraph convolutional network to capture high-order travel preference features explicitly. Third, we identify virtual social neighbors with similar preferences based on individual travel preference learning results, and design a new social gated fusion structure to model the influence of social neighbors on individual travel choices. Finally, experimental results on two real-world travel datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over baseline models. Our proposed universal method can be seamlessly integrated with other sequential prediction models to improve the accuracy and stability of human mobility prediction.},

  abstract     = {The technology of autonomous vehicle (AV) is critical in nowadays Intelligent Transportation Systems. To achieve the fully automated operation for AVs, one important prerequisite is the accurate and reliable seamless localization covering complex outdoor-indoor scenarios. Although many solutions have been proposed to support AV localization, it is still challenging in achieving reliable drift-free positioning in seamless urban environments. With the current on-board sensors such as GNSS, IMU, LiDAR and cameras, it is difficult to achieve accurate drift-free indoor positioning due to the lack of GNSS indoors. Meanwhile, challenges remain in reliable navigation under obscured conditions. In this paper, we propose a tightly coupled integration algorithm of GNSS RTK, Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to enhance the accuracy and reliability for AVs seamless localization in challenging environments. The UWB technique is innovatively incorporated into the AVs navigation system to extend absolute positioning indoors. The stereo cameras are utilized to improve positioning continuity and enhance GNSS/UWB usability in outdoor-indoor obscured environments. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over real-world datasets in complex seamless environments. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 0.411m and 0.077m horizontal positioning accuracy in obscured outdoor and indoor environments, yielding 71.2% and 18.1% improvements compared with the traditional LC integration schemes, respectively.},

Many large-scale company-built electric bus charging stations have been established to facilitate public transportation, while these electric bus charging stations are not accessible to private vehicles. The motivation for this work comes from the possibility of opening surplus resources in electric bus charging stations to alleviate the charging resource shortage and gain extra profit for the electric bus charging station. The operation facing private vehicles, however, also encounters obstacles including serious congestion induced by absorbing private vehicles and delays of bus lines due to private vehicles occupying charging points. To jointly solve these challenges, we propose a real-time control mechanism to maximize the long-term net profit of an electric bus charging station based on Lyapunov optimization theory and generalized benders decomposition, while maintaining the congestion level and ensuring timetables of buses. We demonstrate through rigorous theoretical proof that the proposed mechanism can be arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. Comprehensive evaluation experiments with real-world data sets have been conducted to show the credibility of the mechanism in reducing congestion, ensuring bus timetables, and maximizing the long-term net profit.},

Compared with the vision image data, the human skeleton data are deemed to be robust to unconstrained surroundings and illumination. However, the skeleton graph-based approaches are mainly used for the action recognition. It is challenging to directly apply them to the eye detection task, which is momentary and dynamic given the complex wild environment. This paper proposes a Bi-stream Spatial Attention Graph Convolution Network (SA-BiGCN) for eye contact detection in the wild. We design a directed, nose-centric skeleton graph to capture relevant and hierarchical information and their interactions. We also propose a Bi-stream graph convolution network model with spatial attention to dynamically extract and fuse skeleton joints and bones information. The model was validated by comparing with state-of-art models on three large-scale public datasets, including JAAD, PIE, and LOOK. The results highlight the accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed SA-BiGCN model in detecting the eye contact in the wild environment. The ablation analysis validates the importance of the skeleton graph design, the spatial attention mechanism in the feature fusion process, as well as the model robustness against noisy skeleton data in terms of part occlusions, block occlusions, random occlusions, and random deviations.},

There are numerous small targets in URS image due to a large shooting field of view. However, the existing learning-based real-time image segmentation methods are not strong enough to handle small target and edge segmentation problems well, resulting in small targets that are easy to be missed, and blurred target edges. To segment the small targets and edges more accurately in real time, we propose a fast URS image segmentation method based on a multi-layer pixel attention mechanism (MPAM). We improve the performance and efficiency of the URS image segmentation from two perspectives: model and data. Specifically, to enhance semantic detailed information such as small targets and edges, we design mask-guided edge and small target feature enhancement modules in the real-time segmentation network. In addition, we propose a small target data enhancement method which uses an interpolation algorithm to amplify small targets in URS images, in order to improve the efficiency of existing URS data. The experimental results on Vaihingen, Potsdam, and DLRSD datasets show that the segmentation accuracy of our method reaches 86.74% mIoU, which is better than the state-of-the-art algorithms STDC, CFNet, and UNetFormer.},

A centralized controller optimizes the state and input trajectories of all vehicles in the site such that collisions are avoided in cross-intersections, narrow roads, merge crossings, and charging stations, while also considering the charging process. Specifically, the controller consists of two optimization-based components. The first component is tasked with solving the combinatorial part of the problem, which corresponds to the order in which the vehicles pass the crossings, by solving a Mixed Integer Quadratic Problem (MIQP). The found combinatorial solution is then utilized for calculating the optimal state and input trajectories that are obtained by solving a Nonlinear Program (NLP). The control algorithm is compared with respect to alternative optimization-based approaches in simulation scenarios. For the presented scenario, our method achieves improved energy efficiency by up to 7.6% while slightly improving the average mission end time, and furthermore, it is capable of avoiding deadlocks.},

  abstract     = {Optimization-based methods are commonly applied in autonomous driving trajectory planners, which transform the continuous-time trajectory planning problem into a finite nonlinear program with constraints imposed at finite collocation points. However, potential violations between adjacent collocation points can occur. To address this issue thoroughly, we propose a safety-guaranteed collision-avoidance model to mitigate collision risks within optimization-based trajectory planners. This model introduces an “embodied footprint”, an enlarged representation of the vehicle’s nominal footprint. If the embodied footprints do not collide with obstacles at finite collocation points, then the ego vehicle’s nominal footprint is guaranteed to be collision-free at any of the infinite moments between adjacent collocation points. According to our theoretical analysis, we define the geometric size of an embodied footprint as a simple function of vehicle velocity and curvature. Particularly, we propose a trajectory optimizer with the embodied footprints that can theoretically set an appropriate number of collocation points prior to the optimization process. We conduct this research to enhance the foundation of optimization-based planners in robotics. Comparative simulations and field tests validate the completeness, solution speed, and solution quality of our proposal.},

Existing studies mainly focus on classifying varied distracted driving behaviors, which depend heavily on the scale and quality of datasets and only detect the discrete distraction categories. Therefore, most data-driven approaches have limited capability of recognizing unseen driving activities and cannot provide a reasonable solution for downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper develops a vision Transformer-enabled weakly supervised contrastive (W-SupCon) learning framework, in which distracted behaviors are quantified by calculating their distances from the normal driving representation set. The Gaussian mixed model (GMM) is employed for the representation clustering, which centralizes the distribution of the normal driving representation set to better identify distracted behaviors. A novel driver behavior dataset and the other three ones are employed for the evaluation, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach has more accurate and robust performance than existing methods in the recognition of unknown driver activities. Furthermore, the rationality of distraction levels for different driving behaviors is evaluated through driver skeleton poses.

  abstract     = {With the rapid technological advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we witness exponential growth of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, these integrations of IoV with other technologies make the IoV network and its interaction between different network components highly complex. Therefore, ensuring the correct functioning of the firmware and software running on these next-generation vehicles becomes an essential requirement. A feasible method to address the aforementioned security issues is Remote Attestation (RA). However, the advancement in the attackers’ approaches and the increased complexity, large network size, and vehicle mobility allow the attacks to bypass these security solutions, making RA less effective. In this paper, we propose LHASIoV, an attestation and healing protocol for IoV. LHASIoV has many features such as competent-wise (treats different entities of the system differently), geographical location-aware (traces forensics of security breaches and eases healing compromised vehicles), gradual healing (via slicing the healing software) of compromised vehicles, and resistance to single-point-of-failure. We provide proof-of-concept implementation and formal operational and security analysis for LHASIoV. To show its practical feasibility and effectiveness, we provide performance analysis by implementing it on the Omnetpp simulator. The simulation results show that for an IoV system that has 100 vehicles moving with a speed range of 15–25 mph, LHASIoV needed only 5.27 seconds to complete the vehicle’s attestation. For this number of vehicles and compared to the existing protocols, LHASIoV reduced the communication and storage costs on average by 54.46% and 43.92%, respectively.},

However, dynamic and efficient radio access network (RAN) slicing adapting to the dynamics of vehicular networks remains challenging. The diverse applications make multi-dimensional resource requirements, which will result in the resource allocation more complicated. In addition, the system needs to frequently adjust the resources of slices, which will cause additional slicing overhead. Thus, to solve the above problems, we propose a resource allocation strategy by using multi-agent reinforcement learning to allocate resources in vehicular networks. Firstly, the cost composition of RAN slicing is analyzed, and the optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term system cost. Then, we transform the resource allocation problem into a partially observable Markov decision process. Finally, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient based resource allocation algorithm to solve it. All base stations are treated as independent agents, and they cooperatively allocate spectrum and computing resources. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy reduces the system cost effectively compared to the benchmarks, and the average QoS satisfaction rate achieves 96.5%.},

  abstract     = {Multiple object tracking plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Due to the varying size, fast motion, and occlusion of traffic objects, multiple object tracking in complex traffic scenes is prone to low tracking accuracy and tracking fragmentation. To solve these problems, numerous tracking methods have been proposed based on object discrimination feature. However, these methods neglect the guiding prior role of historical tracking information for detection, making them not applicable to more complex scenes, such as extremely small, fast-moving, and severely obscured objects. In this paper, we propose an Interactively Motion-assisted Network (IMANet) for multiple object tracking in complex traffic scenes. First, to capture the object motion patterns from historical frames, an object motion modeling module considering camera movement is proposed, which particularly has prominent advantages on videos obtained by moving cameras. Next, a multi-scale fusion detection and embedding module is designed to incorporate historical motion information, thereby improving detection performance. Finally, multiple object tracking can be achieved by associating objects detected in different frames based on detection and embedding results. The proposed method combines the detection and tracking in an interactive way, where detection performance is facilitated using historical information provided by the tracking module, and better detection in turn enhances the tracking. Several real-world traffic examples are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method in both detecting and tracking traffic objects. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in complex surveillance videos with varying sizes and occlusions.},

  abstract     = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with large battery packs have significant advantages in improving fuel efficiency and lowering harmful emissions. However, battery charging and discharging performance degrades dramatically at low temperatures, resulting in increasing vehicle operating expenses, which hinders the deployment of PHEVs in severe cold regions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) that combines a battery preheating strategy to preheat the battery to a battery-friendly temperature before vehicle operation. This study provides three specific contributions. First, a high-precision electro-thermal-aging coupled model for a wide temperature range is developed, considering the effect of temperature on the battery’s available capacity. Second, the grid- and battery-powered preheating strategies are established using a flexible polyimide heating film to preheat the batteries. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to determine the preheating time, while Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) is employed to solve the multi-objective energy management problem. The efficacy of the proposed method in low-temperature driving scenarios is validated, and the link between preheating needs, cost savings, driving mileage, and changes in the price of energy carriers is also explored. Simulation results indicate that at a −20 °C ambient temperature, grid- and battery-powered preheating solutions could cut energy usage by 48.30% and 44.89%, respectively, compared to the non-preheating option.},

  abstract     = {Pavement distress classification is crucial for the maintenance of highways. Although many methods for classifying pavement distress are available, they all assume that training and testing datasets are drawn from the same distribution. When we introduce a new unlabeled dataset with a different distribution, the performance of existing methods decreases considerably due to domain shift, motivating us to look beyond the supervised setting to utilize unlabeled datasets directly in training a model. Therefore, we develop a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework, namely, the Self-supervised Adversarial Network (SSAN) for the first time in this study to conduct multi-category pavement distress classification on an unlabeled target domain. In particular, SSAN leverages adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) thoughts to align the features of different domains. However, distress typically occupies a small Section of high-resolution pavement images. Consequently, aligning features directly is unreasonable because the aligning procedure is still dominated by background features instead of foreground features, which are the most useful information for classification. Therefore, we design a pretext module, called Self-supervised Learning for the Target domain (SLT), to mine foreground information. To validate our method, we use two challenging pavement crack datasets, namely, the Chonqing University Bituminous Pavement Disease Detection (CQU-BPDD) and the Chongqing University Bituminous Pavement Multi-label Disease Detection (CQU-BPMDD) datasets. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that SSAN outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to learn discriminative representations for person retrieval from unlabeled data. Recent research accomplishes this task with pseudo-labels and a center-level memory, but the pseudo-labels are inherently noisy and the update status of central features in memory is inconsistent, thus reducing the accuracy of Re-ID. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial and Temporal Dual-Attention (STDA) framework to solve the above two problems. Firstly, to overcome the noisy label problem, we design an Intra-class Neighbor-based Spatial Attention (INSA) module to refine pseudo-labels by mining the spatial-level connections of positive instances. Specifically, we design a neighbor agreement as the similarity between central features and positive instance features in feature space to exploit the reliable complementary relationship. Based on the neighbor agreement, we aggregate the predictions of positive instances, thus jointly mitigating the noise in single instance feature clustering. Secondly, the central features in memory cannot be updated simultaneously, which leads to an inter-class update inconsistency problem. We introduce an Inter-class Sequence-based Temporal Attention (ISTA) module to alleviate this problem by computing a memory update factor based on the temporal-level update sequence of centrals. The weights are larger for newer updated centrals than for older updated centrals and non-updated centrals to mitigate the inter-class inconsistent update status. Finally, we combine the INSA and ISTA modules with contrastive learning for training. Extensive experimental results on Market-1501, MSMT17, and VeRi-776 show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art performance.

As such, the disturbance of diffuse scattering and random fading on SPAO will be alleviated via scattering channel equalization. In addition, SPAO is non-convex in nature, and hence brute-force application of conventional optimization methods will lead to a poor SPAO solution. To address this issue, we devise a majorization minimization (MM)-based SPAO algorithm, where hidden convex structure of the non-convex SPAO problem is exploited, which renders an efficient closed-form iteration rule for joint SPAO and diffuse channel estimation. Due to the cross-layer cooperation between “VLC” and “ranging”, a robust SPAO solution against diffuse scattering and small-scale fading is achieved. It is corroborated by our simulations that the proposed MM-based SPAO algorithm achieves a large performance gain over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification is a crucial task that matches images of the same vehicle across different camera viewpoints. Many previous attention-based studies have approached this problem by exploring the regions of interest in vehicles. However, the generated attention in these models is susceptible to noisy data, as they are unable to provide powerful supervision to distinguish biased and unbiased clues during the attention learning process. To address the problems mentioned above, we aim to design a robust vehicle re-ID network that utilizes the causal effect to effectively transfer attention from biased to unbiased clues. In this paper, we propose an unbiased feature-enhanced network (UnbiasNet), which consists of an unbiased feature-aware block (UFAB) and a novel causal effect-based joint constraint (CEC). In particular, we propose an unbiased feature-aware block as an attention module to extract rich and discriminative information. We conduct a counterfactual intervention on our attention module to generate biased feature representations. Moreover, we propose a novel causal effect-based joint constraint that consists of original prediction constraint and total indirect effect constraint. The original prediction constraint ensures that unbiased feature-aware block converges correctly. The total indirect effect constraint utilizes the generated biased features as supervisory information to motivate unbiased feature-aware block to explore a greater number of unbiased features during the training process. Our approach had an inference time of 1.39 ms per image, which introduces only a few parameters during the training phase and none during the testing phase. We carry out comprehensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the UnbiasNet on three challenging datasets.},

However, the real-world application of DAS is hindered by challenges such as noise contamination and interference among closely traveling cars. In response, we introduce a self-supervised U-Net model that can suppress background noise and compress car-induced DAS signals into high-resolution pulses through spatial deconvolution. Our work extends recent research by introducing three key advancements. Firstly, we perform a comprehensive resolution analysis of DAS-recorded traffic signals, laying a theoretical foundation for our approach. Secondly, we incorporate space-domain vehicle wavelets into our U-Net model, enabling consistent high-resolution outputs regardless of vehicle speed variations. Finally, we employ L-2 norm regularization in the loss function, enhancing our model’s sensitivity to weaker signals from vehicles in remote traffic lanes. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through field recordings under different traffic conditions and various driving speeds. Our results show that our method can enhance the spatial-temporal resolution and better resolve closely traveling cars. The spatial deconvolution U-Net model also enables the characterization of large-size vehicles to identify axle numbers and estimate the vehicle length.

  abstract     = {Intensive interactions among vehicles at freeway on-ramp merging areas lead to congestion and accidents. The emergence of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) has shown great potential to improve this issue. In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed and solved for the task of a cooperative merging of two traffic streams at a freeway on-ramp merging section. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes multiple vehicles’ trajectories and their merging sequence to improve traffic efficiency and ensure safety. Unlike conventional treatments, which match one mainline facilitating vehicle with one merging vehicle, the proposed model determines the optimal number of facilitating vehicles and which mainline vehicles should serve as the facilitating vehicles to cooperatively minimize disruption from ramps. The safety and feasibility of the planned vehicle trajectories are guaranteed at any time. We propose an integrated solution algorithm that incorporates an iterative linear programming method into a novel search process based on a necessary condition for optimality that we identify and prove. The algorithm is highly efficient because it enjoys a significantly reduced search space. The proposed approach, consisting of the MINLP model and the solution algorithm, is evaluated under different traffic demands and mainline-ramp demand ratios and real vehicle arrival patterns from the NGSIM dataset. The performance of the proposed method outperforms benchmark CAV control algorithms, and the computational efficiency is promising for real-time automated merging tasks.},

  abstract     = {Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is a new transport model that combines multiple transport modes in a single platform. Dynamic passenger behavior based on past experiences requires reinforcement-based optimization of MaaS services. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may improve passenger satisfaction by offering the most appropriate transport services based on individual passenger experiences and preferences. However, this produces a new privacy risk to the MaaS platform using the centralized DRL method. Information leakage will occur if the platform is not carefully designed with privacy-preserving mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a federated deep deterministic policy gradient (FDDPG) that maximizes passenger satisfaction and MaaS long-term profit while preserving privacy. We enforce an equally weighted experience sampling mechanism to prevent sampling bias such that the solution quality of FDDPG is statistically equivalent to the centralized algorithm. During the model training and inference, information is processed locally, and only the gradients are shared, which prevents information leakage to any semi-honest participants and eavesdroppers. Secure aggregation protocol in line with the dynamic property of the mobile agent is also used in the gradient sharing step to ensure that the algorithm is prevented from inference attacks. We perform experiments on New York City-based real-world and synthetic scenarios. The results show that the proposed FDDPG can improve the MaaS profit and passenger satisfaction by about 90% and 15%, respectively, and maintain stable training against agent dropout. Our approach and findings could enhance MaaS utility as well as facilitate passenger trust and participation in MaaS and other data-driven transportation systems.},

An echo state network-based (ESN-based) transient-reinforced tunnel coordinated control method is proposed for underactuated MSVs with prescribed performance metrics. Specifically, a graph-based trajectory generator is designed to generate reference signals for various application scenarios. In the guidance loop, a tunnel prescribed performance (TPP) is established to characterize the position and heading coordination metrics of underactuated MSVs. With the TPP-based equivalent transformation, the tunnel guidance laws are devised by an underactuation guidance principle. In the control loop, an ESN-based neural estimator is constructed to identify unknown kinetics consisting of internal uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator faults. Utilizing the estimated information, the ESN-based surge and yaw control laws are presented. The proposed closed-loop system is proven to be input-to-state stable via the theoretical analysis, and position and heading tracking errors can evolve within TPP constraints regardless of actuator faults. Finally, comparison simulation results are employed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In the adversarial RL, the RL model is trained to maximize the network throughput, while the adversarial network, which produces disturbances to observed traffic states, is trained based on the opposite reward of the RL model. The proposed control strategy is tested using the microscopic traffic simulation software, SUMO. To reproduce the difference between an offline-training environment and the real traffic process, two different traffic models in SUMO are used for offline-training and online-testing purposes, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in reducing total time spent than the original MA2C approach, as well as a conventional feedback based controller.},

To account for both, we propose a lookahead repositioning policy in this paper, which is a novel approach to repositioning idle vehicles from both a dynamic system and a long-term performance perspective. Our method consists of two parts; the first part utilizes linear programming (LP) to formulate the nonstationary system as a time-varying, $T$ -step lookahead optimization problem and explicitly models the fraction of drivers who follow repositioning recommendations (called the repositioning rate). The second step is to incorporate a reinforcement learning (RL) method to maximize long-term return based on learned value functions after the $T$ time slots. Extensive studies utilizing a real-world dataset on both small-scale and large-scale simulators show that our method outperforms previous baseline methods and is robust to prediction errors.},

  abstract     = {Despite some successful applications of goal-driven navigation, existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches notoriously suffers from poor data efficiency issue. One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled from the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of decision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene representation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light of this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement learning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of the scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal information and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically, we propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the perception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with expert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the goal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating decision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation to concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances the data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation performance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the superiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance, robustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

As a result, manufacturers and regulators are both increasingly challenged to ensure the reliability, safety, and intended behavior of these systems. With current methodologies, it is difficult to address the various interactions between vehicle components and environmental factors. However, model-based engineering offers a solution by allowing to abstract reality and enhancing communication among engineers and stakeholders. Applying this method requires a model format that is machine-processable, human-understandable, and mathematically sound. In addition, the model format needs to support probabilistic reasoning to account for incomplete data and knowledge about a problem domain. We propose structural causal models as a suitable framework for addressing these demands. In this article, we show how to combine data from different sources into an inferable causal model for an advanced driver-assistance system. We then consider the developed causal model for scenario-based testing to illustrate how a model-based approach can improve industrial system development processes. We conclude this paper by discussing the ongoing challenges to our approach and provide pointers for future work.},

This paper focuses on efficient and spatial-temporal optimal trajectory optimization in unstructured environments using compact convex approximations of vehicle shapes. Conventional approaches typically model the task as an optimal control problem by discretizing the motion process in state configuration space. However, this often results in a tradeoff between optimality and efficiency since generating high-quality motion trajectories often requires high-precision discretization of the dynamic process, which imposes a substantial computational burden. To address this issue, we leverage the differential flatness property of car-like robots to simplify the trajectory representation and analytically formulate the spatial-temporal joint optimization problem with flat outputs in a compact manner, while ensuring the feasibility of nonholonomic dynamics. Moreover, we achieve efficient obstacle avoidance with a collision-free driving corridor for unmodelled obstacles and signed distance approximations for dynamic moving objects. We present comprehensive benchmarks with State-of-the-Art methods, demonstrating the significance of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and trajectory quality. Real-world experiments verify the practicality of our algorithm. We will release our codes for the research community.},

GraKD distills the latent knowledge from the teacher model to a lightweight student model in an adversarial manner. The discriminator of GraKD comprises a representation identifier and a logit identifier. The former effectively distinguishes between the node representations of the student and the teacher by discerning the local affinity of connected node patch-patch pairs and the global affinity represented by the patch-global pairs. The latter employs a residual multi-layer perceptron block to differentiate between the logits of the student and the teacher. The effectiveness of GraKD is validated using data collected from test rigs of bogies. A series of experiments substantiate the broad applicability of GraKD in compressing various GNN-based models.},

When vehicles go to pick up passengers, they need to frequently change lanes to stop to pick up and leave, resulting in a high collision risk and congestion at pick-up areas. This study aims to investigate safety and efficiency of airport pick-up areas and extract traffic conflicts based on video data. The video data are collected from Changsha Airport in China, and vehicle trajectory data are extracted using Baidu API. The transformation between pixel coordinates and real coordinates is realized through homography transformation, and a GIS tool is used to match the lane data. At the same time, the trajectory is smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filtering. Safety risk indicators: time-to-collision (TTC), modified time-to-collision (MTTC), post-encroachment time (PET), and deceleration rate to avoid collision (DRAC) are utilized to evaluate vehicle collision risks. Modified CUSBoost algorithm is applied for imbalanced trajectory data classification based on four risk indicators and spatial distribution and features of different classes are detected. The results demonstrate that traffic conflicts at pick-up areas are caused by frequent lane changes that lead to overlapping vehicle trajectories and short following distances. It is expected that the findings from this study could help engineers and airport ground transportation managers design and implement effective solutions to enhance safety and efficiency at airport pick-up areas.},

  abstract     = {Safety performance evaluation is critical for developing and deploying connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). One prevailing way is to design testing scenarios using prior knowledge of CAVs, test CAVs in these scenarios, and then evaluate their safety performances. However, significant differences between CAVs and prior knowledge could severely reduce the evaluation efficiency. Towards addressing this issue, most existing studies focus on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process, but so far they cannot be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the adaptive safety performance evaluation by leveraging the testing results, after the CAV testing process. It can significantly improve the evaluation efficiency and be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. Specifically, instead of directly evaluating the unknown quantity (e.g., crash rates) of CAV safety performances, we evaluate the differences between the unknown quantity and known quantity (i.e., control variates). By leveraging the testing results, the control variates could be well-designed and optimized such that the differences are close to zero, so the evaluation variance could be dramatically reduced for different CAVs. To handle the high-dimensional scenarios, we propose the sparse control variates method, where the control variates are designed only for the sparse and critical variables of scenarios. According to the number of critical variables in each scenario, the control variates are stratified into strata and optimized within each stratum using multiple linear regression techniques. We justify the proposed method’s effectiveness by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical study of high-dimensional overtaking scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is essential for helping traffic managers take control measures and drivers to choose the optimal travel routes. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used in traffic flow prediction owing to their powerful ability to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. However, designing the spatial-temporal graph adjacency matrix, which is essential to the success of GCNs remains an open question. This paper proposes a GCN-based traffic flow forecasting method that reconstructs the binary adjacency matrix via tensor decomposition. We first reformulate the spatial-temporal fusion graph adjacency matrix into a three-way adjacency tensor. Then, we use Tucker decomposition to reconstruct the adjacency tensor, encoding more informative and global spatial-temporal dependencies. Finally, we propose multiple Spatial-temporal Tensor Graph Convolution layers that assemble a Spatial-temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional module for localized spatial-temporal correlations learning and a Dilated Convolution module for global correlations learning in parallel. This enables the comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies of the road network to be aggregated and learned. Experimental results on four open-access datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction performances.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes the distance- and velocity-based simultaneous obstacle avoidance and target tracking (DV-SOATT) method for the trajectory tracking problem of multiple wheeled mobile robots (MWMRs) operating in a shared workspace based on the relative positions and velocities of the wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) and their encountered obstacles. Compared to the previous arts considered only their relative positions, the DV-SOATT method that adds an auxiliary velocity vector lessens needless activation of the collision avoidance maneuvers, where the DV-SOATT introduces radial bounds for forecasting a collision. We provide two decision criteria for the addition of the auxiliary velocity term and compare the DV-SOATT method with the original method proposed by Li et al. (2021). The problem of the WMRs pause from the path conflict is addressed. Bound constraints on MWMRs’ velocities are considered to restrict the movement speed of the robot so as to ensure smoothness. The control law is built on Lagrange multipliers on basis of constructing a quadratic programming problem. Slack variables are discarded. Bound constraints on optimization variables are included in the piecewise-linear projection function. The stability of the control law, together with the efficiency of the DV-SOATT method, is discussed based on the Lyapunov function. The efficiency is tested on multiple omnidirectional Mecanum-wheeled mobile robots and validated through physical experiments and simulation.},

  abstract     = {An emerging evacuation path planning technique that uses Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) to enable real-time danger prediction and user-oriented path planning can ensure the safe and timely navigation of evacuees in complex scenarios such as cruise ships. However, most existing LPWAN-based evacuation models assume pedestrians’ walking speed remains constant and ignore crowd congestion in corridors before exits, which is not appropriate for rocking ships. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a congestion-relived guiding framework with dedicated path planning for emergency evacuation on passenger ships. The basic idea is to averagely minimize the total evacuation time while meeting the deadline for ship capsizing under all circumstances by selecting uncrowded paths for each passenger individually. First, we use probability distributions rather than constant numbers to represent walking time (also called delay) along passageways. A worst-case delay bound with a high level of trustworthiness is also estimated for each passageway under the boundary condition of ship capsizing. Next, we predict the congestion of corridors by modeling the spatiotemporal movement of passengers, and then distribute evacuation loads evenly among corridors to alleviate the congestion. The total expected evacuation time of all corridors is finally minimized based on the delay probability distribution and estimated congestion, and the deadline for ship evacuation under all circumstances is met with the worst-case delay bound. Simulation results show that our approach significantly reduces the total escaping time of crowd evacuation by 45% and 34% while improving the navigation success ratio by more than 20% and 80% compared with the state-of-the-art emergency evacuation systems, namely the look-up table guiding scheme and the group-based guiding evacuation scheme, respectively.},

Home health care (HHC) is regarded as an alternative answer to hospitalization, while it plays an important role in reducing healthcare cost and improving service satisfaction. This work addresses a service resource routing and scheduling problem with sharing strategy among multiple HHC centers for given customers. Two objective functions are involved: minimizing the total operation cost including the fixed usage cost of centers, caregiver usage cost and service cost, and minimizing the total tardiness caused by delay service. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is formulated to describe the concerned problem. Secondly, a multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm with problem-specific knowledge (MABC-PK) is proposed. Three problem-specific knowledge-based heuristics are designed to initialize population. A crossover operation and a self-learning neighborhood selection method are developed to prompt collaborative search of population and external archive. Furthermore, two knowledge-based local search methods are proposed for refining solutions in the external archive via employing some observations and priority properties derived from the problem characteristics. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted by comparing the proposed approach with four widely-acknowledged multi-objective optimization methods and a mathematical programming solver CPLEX. The comparative results and statistical analysis confirm the strong competitiveness of MABC-PK for solving the concerned problem.},

  abstract     = {While a variety of innovative travel modes, such as taxi service and ridesourcing service, have been launched to improve the transportation efficiency, people still encounter travel problems in real life. The major cause is the imbalance between transportation supply and demand. To strike a balance, it is well-recognized that an accurate and timely passenger demand prediction model is the foundation to enable high-level human intelligence (i.e., taxi drivers) or machine intelligence (i.e., ride-hailing platforms) to allocate resources in advance. Although quite a lot of deep models have been designed to model the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies in a data-driven way, they focus on the demand prediction of a single mode and ignore the fact that passengers may shift between different modes, especially between taxis and ridesourcing cars. In this paper, we target a co-prediction problem that considers the prediction of taxi and ridesourcing as two coupled and associated tasks, and propose a novel Temporal and Spatial Intertwined Network (TSIN) that consists of two twin components and an intertwined component. Each twin in the TSIN model is able to extract spatial and temporal dependencies from its corresponding travel mode separately (i.e., intra-mode features), and the in-between intertwined component is designed to bridge the twins and allow them to exchange information (i.e., inter-mode features), thus enabling better prediction. We first evaluate our model on four real-world datasets. Results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model and the necessity to take into account the influence between modes. Based on an additional demand data from bike in NYC, we then discuss the generalizability in coupling more transportation modes. Further results demonstrate that our proposed intertwined neural network is highly flexible and extendable, and can yield better prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to tackle two issues in hit-and-run crash analysis: The first one is the missing label issue, as the hit-and-run label information has been ignored by many crash datasets. Another one is the class imbalance problem, as the number of hit-and-run crashes is usually much smaller than that of non-hit-and-run crashes. The semi-supervised learning by manually labelling a few hit-and-run labels and the cost-sensitive learning that assigns unequal cost values to class-imbalanced crashes are adopted in this paper. Specifically, we develop a cost-sensitive graph convolutional network with self-paced learning (CSGCNsp) for hit-and-run analysis, which takes the proposed $k$ -nearest neighbour anchor graph as input to extract the local clustering structure hidden among crashes for more effective convolutions. The proposed method performs semi-supervised learning with an ‘easy-to-hard’ manner, which can help infer more accurate hit-and-run labels for unsupervised crashes with imbalanced data distribution. The road traffic collision database of Victoria State of Australia is selected for hit-and-run analysis. Compared to fifteen other models, the proposed CSGCNsp can significantly improve the prediction performance in terms of AUC, G-mean, F-measure, and total misclassification cost. The significant contributing factors analysis shows that 53.33% of true contributing factors, which is at least 20.00% higher than that of the state-of-the-art hit-and-run models, can be found by CSGCNsp when only 1% of hit-and-run crashes are manually labelled.},

Firstly, we design a self-motivated feature extraction attention network (FEAN) to adaptively produce effective decoupled features for detection and tracking tasks in different scenarios. Secondly, we build a spatial-temporal data association (STDA) framework to achieve more accurate and robust tracking by considering the historical features of trajectory through different times.

To provide city planners with decision-making support, a multi-objective optimization model is built to optimize the deployment of RSUs under a limited budget. Two objective functions are proposed to maximize the number of communication tasks served and minimize the total task-weighted delay. Through a simple transformation of the delay matrix, we transform the proposed multi-objective model into a p-median problem. Then, we design a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm in a multi-objective framework to solve the model. Moreover, simulation examples are presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed model and solution algorithm.

To capture different characteristics of physical parameters, multiple LSTM and HPLR models are specifically designed to predict various measurements. In addition, the attention mechanism is applied to help exact the key information of features. Then, a steady-state model is derived for a priori evaluation of WT2GCN measurement prediction with non-delayed electric measurements. A detailed implementation illustration of the proposed methodology is also presented.

  abstract     = {Humans are experts at making decisions for challenging driving tasks with uncertainties. Many efforts have been made to model the decision-making process of human drivers at the behavior level. However, limited studies explain how human drivers actively make trustworthy sequential decisions to complete interactive driving tasks in an uncertain environment. This paper argues that human drivers intently search for actions to reduce the uncertainty of their perception of the environment, i.e., perceptual uncertainty, to a low level that allows them to make a trustworthy decision easily. This paper provides a proof-of-concept framework to empirically reveal that human drivers’ perceptual uncertainty decreases when executing interactive tasks with uncertainties. We first introduce an explainable-artificial intelligence approach (i.e., SHapley Additive exPlanation, SHAP) to determine the salient features on which human drivers base decisions. Then, we use entropy-based measures to quantify the drivers’ perceptual changes in these ranked salient features across the decision-making process, reflecting the changes in uncertainties. The validation and verification of our proposed method are conducted in the highway on-ramp merging scenario with congested traffic using the INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results support that human drivers intentionally seek information to reduce their perceptual uncertainties in the number and rank of salient features of their perception of environments to make a trustworthy decision.},

This paper proposes a novel hybrid TSE approach called Observer-Informed Deep Learning (OIDL), which integrates a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) observer and deep learning paradigm to estimate spatial-temporal traffic states from boundary sensing data. The proposed OIDL consists of two modules, an Observer-Uninformed Neural Network (OUNN) to generate preliminary traffic state estimation, and an Observer-Informed Neural Network (OINN) constructed from a boundary observer with theoretical convergence guarantee to regularize the estimation. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive OIDL (aOIDL) to simultaneously estimate traffic states and model parameters. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that the proposed OIDL reduces the estimation error by up to 30 percent compared to the model-based observer, data-driven neural networks, and some hybrid TSE approaches. The OIDL also has smaller variance of the estimation error and presents more accurate pattern for congested traffic.},

In this way, the encoder better exploits the global contexts of the input and expands the receptive fields. In the U-shape decoder, the feature maps are upsampled through the proposed feature enhancement upsampling module (FE_Up).

Finally, a novel evaluation metric is designed to comprehensively assess the accuracy, speed, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and parameters of real-time segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and self-collected images have evaluated the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a two-stage multi-lane unsignalized intersection cooperative control strategy based on mixed platoons (MICS-PF) in the mixed traffic environment of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs). In the first stage, we propose a 0–1 integer programming model based on vehicles’ intersection movements and potential car-following costs to organize vehicles into mixed platoons led by CAVs. Meanwhile, we design a rule-based algorithm to coordinate the relative distribution of platoons. Then, the lane-changing and car-following models are integrated to ensure that the platoons organization plan can be completed in the limited functional zone. In the second stage, we design an improved minimum covering clique algorithm to generate a conflict-free passing order of platoons by considering the platoon-level conflict relation and the potential yield delay. The proposed strategy couples the process of organizing vehicles into mixed platoons to pass through the intersection. The optimal platoon organization enables CHVs to receive accurate guidance when entering the intersection and avoids the disorderly lane change at the upstream road sections. The mixed platoon control also allows vehicles to avoid stop-and-go, improve the capacity of approach roads, and prevent the intersection capacity from being restricted by the inefficient traffic at the approach road. The conflict-free coordination method of mixed platoons optimizes the throughput of intersections and broadens the usage conditions of unsignalized intersections. A series of simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the strategy, and the applicable boundary conditions are obtained.},

This can result in imprecise predictions and inaccurate decision-making in data-driven models. To address these challenges, our study presents a comprehensive framework for traffic disruption segmentation from traffic speed data (obtained from Caltrans Performance Measurements system) in the time-space proximity of reported accidents (from Countrywide Traffic Accident dataset). Furthermore, we evaluate multiple machine learning models on reported, estimated, and manually marked disruption intervals, and demonstrate that our enhanced modelling approach reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) of traffic accident duration prediction while providing higher similarity with disruptions observed in traffic speed. Our algorithm yields higher disruption detection precision than reported accident timelines. Although using multiple segments offers a slight decrease in the quality of results, it highlights more disruptions. Future research could explore expanding the algorithm’s complexity and applying it to improve traffic incident impact predictions.},

The SOTIF risk is reflected not only intuitively in the collision risk with objects outside the autonomous vehicles, but also inherently in the performance limitation risk of the implemented algorithms. How to minimize the SOTIF risk for autonomous driving is currently a critical, difficult, and unresolved issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the “Self-Surveillance and Self-Adaption System” as a systematic approach to online minimize the SOTIF risk, which aims to provide a systematic solution for monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of inherent and external risks. As a demonstration of the system, the risk monitoring of the perception algorithm is highlighted. Moreover, the inherent perception algorithm risk and external collision risk are jointly quantified via SOTIF entropy, which is then propagated downstream to the decision-making module and mitigated. Finally, Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. The results demonstrate that the system enables dependable online monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of SOTIF risk in real-time critical traffic environments.},

  abstract     = {A fall is an abnormal behavior that rarely occurs, however, once it occurs in a crowded scenario, it is prone to cause local disturbance, density-velocity fluctuations, and crowd instability even leading to a stampede accident. Currently, research on fall behavior mainly depends on single-point detection approach but lacks investigation on disturbing mechanism in a crowd flow. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a pressure dynamics model based on limb-level contact to analyze pedestrian behavioral characteristics. Then, based on the random Brownian motion, the disturbance distribution of fall behavior was determined theoretically. Using two parameters (a pressure coefficient and disturbance intensity), the pressure term of the fluid dynamics Aw-Rascle model was improved, and the internal disturbance propagation model (DPM) of fall behavior was established, as a primary contribution of this study. Further, to eliminate the disturbance propagation in a crowd, damping motion theory was employed. The disturbance elimination mechanism of abnormal behavior was discussed to suppress disturbance propagation caused by a pedestrian fall behavior. To validate the proposed model, both field experiment and numerical simulation were conducted respectively. The stability performance of the proposed DPM was evaluated with standard deviation (less than 0.1631) based on 50 repetitive experiments. Results showed that this study could help discover the disturbance propagation dynamics and elimination mechanisms of pedestrian fall behavior in a crowded scenario.},

  abstract     = {The connected environment provides information on surrounding traffic and areas beyond the visual range traffic to improve driving behavior and avoid dangerous incidents. However, due to the novelty of the connected environment, there is a lack of studies on driver lane-changing intention (LCI). Therefore, this study builds a connected lane-changing scenario based on a driving simulator. The differences of the LCI feature parameters are analyzed, and a driver LCI recognition model is developed. The results show that there is a significant difference in vehicle motion parameters, driver operation parameters, and driver’s eye and head movement parameters during the lane-changing left, lane-keeping, and lane-changing right stages. In addition, the length of the intention time window with connected information (6.6 s) is longer than that of the non-connected information (4.1 s). A driver LCI recognition model is developed using Stacking ensemble learning and then compared with traditional algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the LCI recognition model using Stacking ensemble learning is higher than that of the traditional algorithms when it is recognized 0.5 s and 3 s before the lane-changing maneuver, which are 98.24% and 92.23%, respectively. The driver LCI is sent to the macro-traffic system or surrounding vehicles through connected communication, which not only helps the macro-traffic system to coordinate and control the traffic flow but also helps surrounding vehicles plan the motion trajectory in advance. In addition, the accurate recognition of driver LCI is beneficial to the transfer and distribution of the human-machine co-driving system control rights.},

The challenges mainly lie in modeling the stochastic characteristics of mixed-traffic flow and developing less-conservative algorithm to deal with the uncertainties. To tackle the problem, we propose a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO). First, a stochastic mixed-traffic model, extended from cell transmission model, is proposed to describe the traffic dynamics. Then, utilizing historical traffic data, an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) based method is given to construct ambiguity set and incorporate generalized moment information of uncertainties. Based on the above predictive model and ambiguity set, a DRO-based MPC problem is formulated and further converted into an equivalent dual form for efficient solutions, i.e., ramp metering and variable speed limit control. Finally, simulation results based on real data collected in Shanghai, China, demonstrate that our proposed strategy can significantly reduce traffic congestion, achieving 5.74 % total travel time reduction compared to robust MPC.},

Our approach starts with a filter-based scheme to localize the unknown UWB anchor in the local world frame. In particular, a novel surface-based particle filter is proposed to localize the UWB anchors efficiently. When the initialization is complete, the UWB location information is utilized to support the subsequent long-term robot positioning. An observability-constrained optimization approach is developed to combine the visual, inertial, and UWB range measurements. Such a framework takes advantage of both VIO and UWB measurements and is feasible even when the number of observed UWB anchors is below four.

Despite its importance for transportation research and engineering, most TS diagrams that have already existed or are being produced are too coarse to exhibit detailed traffic dynamics due to the difficulty of collecting high-fidelity traffic data. To increase the resolution of a TS diagram and enable it to present ample traffic details, this paper introduces the TS diagram refinement problem and proposes a multiple linear regression-based solution. Data collected at different times, in different locations and even in different countries are employed to thoroughly evaluate the accuracy and transferability of the proposed model. Two tests, which attempt to increase the resolution of a TS diagram 4 and 16 times, are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In the increase-4-times test, the errors represented by Mean Absolute Percentage Error are all less than 0.1, and in the increase-16-times test all less than 0.17. Model comparison demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms the classic adaptive smoothing method in refining TS diagrams. All the strict tests with diverse data show that the proposed model, despite its simplicity, is able to refine a TS diagram with promising accuracy and reliable transferability. The proposed refinement model will “save” widely existing TS diagrams from their blurry “faces” and enable TS diagrams to show more traffic details.},

A virtual spring coordination system (VSCS) is established to force the movements of conflicting CAVs in terms of spring characteristics. Inspired by the properties of springs with dampers, a distributed control protocol is designed to regulate CAVs to reach a desired state of motion when crossing intersections. For ensuring the convergence of the VSCS, i.e., the total elastic potential energy approaches to zero, sufficient conditions for the internal stability are derived subject to the input saturation. To further improve the anti-disturbance capability of the VSCS, we ensure the upper bound of the disturbance propagation, which is characterized by an $H_{\infty }$ performance index. The proposed strategy is developed in a receding horizon framework and tested under the two scenarios in simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.},

Among them, how to extract people’s travel trajectories and reconstruct them accurately is crucial to explain people’s mobility. Due to its spatio-temporal uncertainty and sparsity, however, map matching based on mobile phone signaling data (MSD) remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce an innovative and precise Map Matching Method tailored for MSD, leveraging an incremental Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm. A series of effective modules are put forward to address several critical challenges associated with MSD, including handling drifting data, ping-pong sequences, spatio-temporal sparsity, location uncertainty, back-and-forth movements, and U-turn errors. Then Incremental HMM is applied to provide the optimal path on the digital map. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conducted a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art methods and conducted ablation experiments. The results highlight that our model outperforms existing approaches, achieving 82.9%, 93.6%, and 0.88 in precision, recall and F1 based on the distance measurement, respectively. The proposed method makes it possible to work on real-time map matching based on large-scale MSD. In the future, we will conduct the exploration of human mobility based on MSD in cities and congestion detection of network traffic states.},

  abstract     = {Transportation contributes a substantial fraction of all greenhouse gas emissions. One approach for reducing such emissions is to modify vehicles’ route choices to minimize their fuel consumption or emission, which is known as eco-routing. Most eco-routing is based on vehicles choosing routes that minimize their individual fuel consumption or emissions. The Braess paradox demonstrates that when vehicles choose routes to minimize their individual goals, the aggregate effect may paradoxically result in the opposite net effect due to changes in congestion patterns. We construct a multiclass user equilibrium model in which some vehicles use eco-routing and others seek to minimize their individual travel times. Using this model, we show that the Braess paradox exists for eco-routing. If a large number of vehicles is trying to minimize their fuel consumption or emissions, the total fuel consumption or emissions may increase. We then solve the multiclass user equilibrium on publicly available city network data, and find that eco-routing results in increases in fuel consumption and emissions on some city networks as well.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian crossing intention prediction could effectively prevent traffic injuries and improve pedestrian safety. This paper focuses on pedestrian crossing intention prediction from surveillance cameras, which could provide over-the-horizon safety warnings and has the potential to better ensure pedestrian safety, compared with that from on-board cameras. However, most prediction-based methods are designed with a fundamental assumption that the visual data is collected from an on-board camera rather than a bird-eye-view one, thus the prevalent methods in this research domain do not match surveillance scenarios. To deal with this issue, an automated learning framework is proposed, in which a pedestrian-centric environment graph is primarily constructed to reflect visual variations and spatiotemporal relationships between pedestrians and their surroundings. After that, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based environment encoder and a pedestrian-state encoder are designed to extract prominent environment features and pedestrian behavior features, respectively. Finally, an intention prediction decoder is developed to extrapolate the probability of crossing intention. Experimental results demonstrate that each component in the framework contributes to performance improvement and their combination obtains state-of-the-art performance, suggesting the effectiveness and superiority of our framework.},

  abstract     = {Variable Speed Limit (VSL) is a commonly applied active traffic management measure for urban motorways. In recent years, model-based and model-free approaches have been extensively adopted to solve VSL optimization problems. However, the success of model-based VSL relies heavily on the nature of the environmental model adopted (e.g., traffic flow model). Implicit environment models may result in inappropriate control actions. Although model-free approaches are able to directly map raw measurements to control actions without a need for an environment model, they usually require large amounts of training data. In order to address these issues, we propose an Imagination-Augmented Agent (I2A) for VSL control. The I2A consists an imagination path and a model-free path, which work together to generate appropriate control actions. The simulation results show that the proposed I2A agent outperforms other tested Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in terms of Total Time Spent and bottleneck volume.},

  abstract     = {In order to make the optimization of evacuation efficient enough for application, a Matrix Translation Model (MTM) has been developed. In MTM, a building is represented by using a network and the matrices attached to the network, and the crowd movement is simulated by translating matrices along the network. The performance of MTM was evaluated by comparison with a widely used commercial evacuation simulator, Pathfinder. The results showed that with accurate reproduction of the evacuation processes, MTM ran 10–15 times and 29–37 times faster than Pathfinder’s flow-based (SFPE) and agent-based (Steering) modes, respectively. Furthermore, an evacuation path optimization method based on MTM is proposed by balancing the use of different exits. When run on a laptop, the path optimization of a building with 21 rooms and 944 occupants took less than 3 s. The optimized path was verified by Pathfinder, showing that approximately 50 s of the evacuation time was saved. MTM provides a new framework for evacuation simulation, i.e., the network defines the path connection, the matrix represents the spatial state, the macroscopic rules drive the matrix translation, and the microscopic rules limit the element transfer between the matrices. The path optimization algorithm developed based on the new framework offers new possibilities for real-time evacuation optimization of large buildings.},

  abstract     = {The way in which autonomous transport will be adopted is likely to determine the net social benefits delivered by the technology and the sustainability of the transport system. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will change travel behavior due to reduction in the effort needed for humans to drive a vehicle, the need for them to find a parking space, and the costs related to vehicle operation. The AVs’ benefits are likely to increase their adoption compared to conventional human-driven vehicles, possibly leading to more vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT) and consequently weakening their benefits in large cities particularly if they are used in competition with public transport (PT). This paper evaluates the interplay between AVs and PT, and how road network pricing can be used to influence behavioral changes when personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) are highly available. An agent-based demand model framework is proposed to estimate the mode share of PAVs and PT based on their perceived travelling costs on a real transport network in Melbourne, Australia. The modelling results suggest that convenient and affordable PAVs could compete with traditional PT and reduce overall PT patronage by up to 10%. However, through considering road network pricing schemes, the role of PAVs could be shifted from competing with PT to a complementary first-and-last-mile service that increases PT share by almost 17%. The results also show that road pricing policies can be used as effective interventions to manage PAV operations by reducing empty vehicle trips by 20%.},

Note that the source task can introduce false detection during task-consistency learning, which implies noisy rewards or supervision. The target network can be trained in a reinforcement learning setting by appropriately designing the reward mechanism upon semantic consistency. We also introduce a novel symmetric constraint to detect corrupted samples and reduce the effect of noisy rewards. Unlike conventional corrupted learning methods that use only training losses to identify corrupted samples, our symmetric constraint also explores the relationship among training samples to improve performance. Compared with conventional supervised detection methods, the main contribution of our work is the ability to learn a vacant space detector via semantic consistency rather than supervised labels. The dynamic learning property allows the proposed detector to be easily deployed and updated in various lots without heavy human loads. Experiments demonstrate that our noisy task consistency mechanism can be successfully applied to train a vacant space detector from scratch.},

We propose a coarse-to-fine multiscale localization method that relies solely on vision sensors for underground parking lot localization based on a preconstructed lightweight node map. In coarse localization, we propose a semantic keyframe topological localization method to predict the localization range (candidate set of nodes). In node-level localization, we extract features by learning-based neural networks and construct a hybrid k-nearest neighbor (H-KNN) model to search for the closest node within the coarse localization results. In metric localization, we construct plane homography and perspective-n-point (PnP) models, allowing the vehicle’s pose (rotation and translation relative to the closest node) to be computed for refined localization. The proposed method has been tested in two underground parking lots of an office building and a shopping mall with different characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.38 m and the proposed method exhibits strong robustness in various scenarios.},

Traditional machine learning models cannot directly accept time series data of variables as inputs, and therefore, artificially constructed statistical variables are required. The driving style recognition model proposed in this paper can directly input the raw time-series data, which can more fully preserve the driving information. On the basis of three driving styles recognition, a style factor model was designed to make the driving style continuous, and the forgetting factor was introduced to synthesize the style factor under the most recent data and the style factor under the historical data. The implementation of personalized AEB strategies involved three steps: First, using the emergency factor as an indicator, the aggressive braking strategy line was obtained statistically. Then, according to the data from calm drivers and moderate drivers, the corresponding encoder-decoder models were established to predict the longitudinal relative distance and longitudinal relative velocity. Finally, based on the aggressive braking strategy line and the encoder-decoder models, the calm braking strategy and the moderate braking strategy were designed. The proposed AEB strategies achieved a higher rate of collision avoidance than the classic Mazda, Honda, and Berkeley strategies. When the risk of collision is eliminated from test samples, on average, compared with the aggressive strategy, the calm strategy is 1.05 s earlier, while the moderate strategy is 0.58 s earlier. Such results are more in line with the expectations of different drivers, and the personalized AEB system can improve driver acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Long-term visual place recognition (VPR) has recently become a popular research topic in the field of autonomous driving. In urban scenarios, variations in scene appearance due to the change in seasons and illumination bring great challenges for scene description. Several learning-based VPR techniques can learn latent invariant descriptors for appearance variations and show excellent performance in long-term VPR tasks. However, these methods require huge datasets and computational resources (e.g., GPUs) for training and inference. Mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles often cannot provide sufficient computing power. To address this issue, in this paper, a training-free lightweight global image descriptor named SSR-VLAD is proposed for VPR. This descriptor is able to work accurately in real-time without GPUs, even on embedded platforms. The contribution of this work has two aspects. (1) A novel semantic skeleton representation (SSR) is proposed to describe the semantic spatial distribution of scenes by using the semantic spatial context; (2) Inspired by the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), a spatial-temporal aggregation framework for SSR features is constructed to aggregate all SSR features into one SSR-VLAD descriptor, which encodes the spatial and temporal information into a fixed-size global descriptor. SSR-VLAD shows robust performance towards the appearance variations of scenes. Specifically, on three public datasets with challenging urban scenes, experimental results show that SSR-VLAD has competitive VPR performance compared to several state-of-the-art (SoTA) VPR methods. Additionally, SSR-VLAD achieves SoTA real-time computational performance with lower RAM consumption in computationally constrained scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation (SS) aims to classify each pixel into one of the pre-defined classes. This task plays an important role in self-driving cars and autonomous drones. In SS, many works have shown that most misclassified pixels are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space, thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss (HyperUL), which dynamically highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on Cityscapes, UAVid, and ACDC datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of existing SS models can be consistently improved. Additionally, reliable measurement of model uncertainty plays a key role in real-world applications such as autonomous controls of vehicles and drones. To meet this requirement, we propose the Hyperbolic Uncertainty Estimation method, which is easily implemented by only post-processing the generated Hyperbolic embeddings. By this approach, we can calculate the uncertainty values almost for free. Quantitative and qualitative results on Cityscapes, UAVid, and ACDC datasets verify that our proposed uncertainty estimation method usually outputs more meaningful results compared with popular MC-dropout and ensembling methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (ReID) is the task of identifying the same vehicle across numerous cameras. This is a complex classification task, and the fine-grained information and strong discrimination features have proven to be effective in handling the re-identification classification task. However, most existing methods focuses on extracting local area features in combination with global features, while exploring subtle distinguishing features, which is a difficult task, remains an open problem and unsolved. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch enhanced discriminative network (MED) to better extract subtle distinguishing features that have high discriminative power to improve the ReID performance. In the proposed MED method, each feature map obtained by convolutional neural network (CNN) is divided into 4 spatial sub-maps, on each of which, the vertical and the horizontal branches are used to extract the subtle distinguishing features intrinsically contained in sub-areas. The vertical and the horizontal branches are combined with the global branch to perform the ReID task. Moreover, our proposed method is capable of extracting rich fine-grained features without the need of extra manual annotation while maintaining a simple design structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the vehicle ReID datasets (VehicleID and VeRi-776), showing that the proposed MED method outperforms most existing methods. Further, we directly apply the MED method to the pedestrian ReID problem on the Market-1501, DUKEMTMC, and MSMT17 datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance as well. This demonstrates that the proposed method has good generality and can be flexibly applied to the ReID tasks.},

  abstract     = {Each freeway stretch’s traffic states are indispensable in freeway traffic modeling, surveillance, and control. However, the unmeasured ramp pairs always exist in real-world freeway systems, and how to estimate the flows of those ramps is a longstanding and tricky issue. Set the stretch with intact traffic states as Source Stretch while the stretch with the unmeasured ramp pair as Target Stretch; existing work tries to train the non-transfer machine learning model like Random Forest by Source Stretch and act on Target Stretch. However, the estimation accuracy of non-transfer machine learning models could not be guaranteed because the mainstream traffic state distributions of the above two stretches are not the same, and the model structure is too simple to capture traffic flow’s temporal dependencies. Note the great success of transfer learning in distribution-changed situations; this paper addresses this issue via transfer learning and deep learning. First, the Gated Recurrent Unit-Based Ramp Flow Estimator is designed to establish the relationship between the mainstream traffic states and ramp flows in Source Stretch. Then, taking the trained estimator as the backbone, we propose the Deep Domain Adaptation to match the marginal distribution difference between Source Stretch and Target Stretch; design the Model Transfer to reduce the conditional distribution difference (i.e., estimator difference) between Source Stretch and Target Stretch. The two approaches both improve the performance of the Source Stretch’s estimator in Target Stretch. Finally, we evaluate the processed approach in two real-world freeway traffic datasets and observe satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian and evacuation dynamics provide valuable insights into the understanding of human collective motion and have important implications for architectural design, safety management, and transportation science. In social and biological systems, the macroscopic patterns are displayed at the group level, whereas the microscopic behaviors are presented at the individual level. As an intermediate layer, subgroups play a crucial role in linking these two distinct levels of observation and have become one of the important research topics in this field. However, a comprehensive review is still lacking for summarizing current advancements around this topic. Therefore, this paper proposes a survey framework to conduct a systematic review of subgroup research from the following four aspects: data collection and extraction, analysis of phenomena and behaviors, modeling and simulations, and applications and solutions. More critically, a series of research gaps in each aspect are explicitly determined to help researchers grasp unsolved problems. Finally, we present future avenues to narrow the research gaps, which are expected to bring inspiration and guidance for subsequent studies.},

  abstract     = {One of the challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is jamming attacks. These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental operation for automated driving and its formulation traditionally originates from robotics and decision making control fields. Given the high complexity required to compute an obstacle-free trajectory, this operation is usually demanded to a lower frequency planning layer that provides then a trajectory reference to be followed by a higher frequency control layer. As a result, whenever replanning is needed (for example, due to a new detected obstacle), the control layer must wait for a new planned trajectory to be generated. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to approach obstacle avoidance already in the control layer, which allows a prompter response. In particular, we show how obstacle avoidance and reference tracking can be integrated, thus with no need to switch among different controllers, based on a null-space based behavioral control approach, implemented in a (possibly nonlinear) model predictive control scheme. We demonstrate practical implementation of the proposed methodology employing two different vehicle dynamic models and in four different (urban and highway) scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a sensitivity analysis to understand how parameters choice affects the automated vehicle behavior.},

  abstract     = {Real-time detection of oncoming vehicle maneuvers at intersections is essential for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to plan safe paths and driving strategies. Most existing methods use supervised learning methods to construct behavior detection models and assume that most data have labels. Real data collected by the onboard sensor as a data stream is unstable, and there are outliers, concept drift, and evolution problems, potentially decreasing the detection accuracy. To this end, we propose a micro-cluster-based online adaptable (MCOA) approach. The framework consists of four parts: initial model construction, new class detection, classification using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and online update. First, k-means clustering is performed on the maneuvering behavior data, and cluster features are derived to obtain a set of micro-clusters (MCs) to establish the initial model. Second, we analyze the instances stored in the data block to detect new classes and use the k-NN to classify the incoming instances. Finally, the model is updated online using an update strategy based on error-driven representative learning, a time-effect function, and a local decision boundary. A driving simulator is used to collect experimental data consisting of left turns (LT), right turns (RT), and going straight (GS) to establish and evaluate the model. The results show that the proposed model achieves higher detection accuracy for early-stage intersection maneuvers and has stronger adaptability to new classes than benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In maritime traffic surveillance, detecting illegal activities, such as illegal fishing or transshipment of illicit products is a crucial task of the coastal administration. In the open sea, one has to rely on Automatic Identification System (AIS) message transmitted by on-board transponders, which are captured by surveillance satellites. However, insincere vessels often intentionally shut down their AIS transponders to hide illegal activities. In the open sea, it is very challenging to differentiate intentional AIS shutdowns from missing reception due to protocol limitations, bad weather conditions or restricting satellite positions. This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of abnormal AIS missing reception based on self-supervised deep learning techniques and transformer models. Using historical data, the trained model predicts if a message should be received in the upcoming minute or not. Afterwards, the model reports on detected anomalies by comparing the prediction with what actually happens. Our method can process AIS messages in real-time, in particular, more than 500 Millions AIS messages per month, corresponding to the trajectories of more than 60 000 ships. The method is evaluated on 1-year of real-world data coming from four Norwegian surveillance satellites. Using related research results, we validated our method by rediscovering already detected intentional AIS shutdowns.},

  abstract     = {As the use of combustion engine vehicles plays a deciding role in global warming, we can observe a trend to replace them with electric vehicles (EV) driven by new environmentally conscious policies and increasing technological capabilities. With improvements in driving range and reduction in prices come new challenges that may hamper the progress towards complete battery driven transportation. A major challenge for the increasing EV adoption is the planning of extensions to existing infrastructure or the inclusion of new infrastructure components in the planning process. This demands increasingly complex planning tools that can simulate the interplay between different stakeholders in modern transportation scenarios such as EVs, charging stations, energy providers, and general transportation participants. Simulation platforms for agent-based modeling in transportation have been developed as effective interactive tools that allow planners to explore different trade-offs across different scenarios with the ability to simulate the impact of policy or infrastructure decisions on the different stakeholders in the simulation. This article surveys several of the major simulation platforms that include modern EV-based forms of transportation and allow the simulation of relevant infrastructure components alongside the well established transportation simulations. These tools allow researchers to analyze expected traffic flow, identify possible charging station locations based on area demand, predict electrical grid demand, and more. This survey intends to make it easier for researchers to identify and apply a simulation platform in the context of supporting the increasing electrification of the transportation sector, enabling more efficient simulation and planning capabilities in this domain.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving systems (ADSs) aim to improve the safety, efficiency and comfort of future vehicles. To achieve this, ADSs use sensors to collect raw data from their environment. This data is then processed by a perception subsystem to create semantic knowledge of the world around the vehicle. State-of-the-art ADSs’ perception systems often use deep neural networks for object detection and classification, thanks to their superior performance compared to classical computer vision techniques. However, deep neural network-based perception systems are susceptible to errors, e.g., failing to correctly detect other road users such as pedestrians. For a safety-critical system such as ADS, these errors can result in accidents leading to injury or even death to occupants and road users. Introspection of perception systems in ADS refers to detecting such perception errors to avoid system failures and accidents. Such safety mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of ADSs. Motivated by the growing importance of the subject in the field of autonomous and automated vehicles, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the techniques that have been proposed in the literature as potential solutions for the introspection of perception errors in ADSs. We classify such techniques based on their main focus, e.g., on object detection, classification and localisation problems.

With rising concern towards healthy living and clean environment, the demand to replace internal combustion engine vehicles is gathering momentum. Hence, currently the focus is shifting towards use of battery based electric vehicles with hybrid energy storage system combining two or more energy sources. The combination of different energy sources brings in the best properties of individual source types resulting in increase of lifetime and efficiency of electric vehicles. Energy management system is the control strategy to distribute energy and power among different energy sources judiciously to improve battery performance. Efficient energy management techniques also help in increasing the electric vehicle’s driving range and reducing battery size. In this paper a comprehensive review of battery based electric vehicle technologies based on energy sources, hybrid energy storage system topologies and energy management systems is presented. A comparative analysis is made about these techniques on the basis of performance indices like average battery current, peak battery current and battery power loss. This paper focuses on the combination of battery and supercapacitor because this combination provides high power and energy density to electric vehicles thereby improving their performance and dynamic power regulation. This review paper summarizes the research work carried out in the field of battery based electric vehicles utilizing the combination of battery and supercapacitor to assist researchers in developing new and sustained technologies in the area.},

To improve the real-time performance of TBD flow scheduling, a scheme for Time-Triggered (TT) flow scheduling and Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) flow scheduling is proposed. First, an online scheduling method for TT flows (RFSD) is proposed, which uses Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) algorithm for priority assignment and dynamic queues to adjust the scheduling order in real time. It ensures fairness in scheduling and effectively improves the utilization of time slot resources. Furthermore, an online scheduling method for AVB flows (RFSU) is proposed, which uses the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to construct the utility function for evaluating the scheduling value of AVB flows, effectively increasing the throughput of AVB flows. Finally, extensive experiments show that RFSD increases successful scheduling by 22% over the PAS algorithm. Compared to the TTA algorithm, RFSU achieves a 24% reduction in average delay and a 27% reduction in jitter.},

This kind of chain with complexity and uncertainty evolution brought great challenges to the safety management of the system. Thus, the coupling effects of emergencies and then its relationship with the chain evolution is necessary to analyze emphatically. A Graph Evaluation and Review Technique Simulation (GERTS) evolution network is firstly constructed to describe the coupling effect and chain evolution of emergencies. Then, considering the internal and external influencing factors of the emergency chain, a dynamic evolution model of the emergency chain based on Coupled Map Lattice (CML) is proposed. This paper takes fire chain of URT as an example to simulate the evolution process of emergency chain, and analyze the impact of different coupling effects and various influencing factors on the evolution of emergency chain. The results of numerical simulation show that the AND-coupling can significantly inhibit the evolution of emergency events, while the OR-coupling and CO-coupling can expand the impact scope of emergency events. In addition, the evolution speed of emergency events can be controlled by increasing the coupling action time and improving the URT repair ability. When an emergency event occurs, the analysis of coupling effect and the accompanied chain evolution will help managers to make scientific judgment on the development trend of the emergency events and make targeted emergency defense measures.},

  abstract     = {As a research hotspot across logistics, operations research, and artificial intelligence, route planning has become a key technology for intelligent transportation systems. Recently, data-driven machine learning heuristics, including learning construction methods and learning improvement methods, have achieved remarkable success in solving single-objective route planning problems. However, many practical route planning scenarios must simultaneously consider multiple conflict objectives. For example, modern logistics companies often need to simultaneously minimize time budget, transportation cost, and vehicle pollution. Several learning construction methods are proposed for solving classical multi-objective route planning (MORP) problems, yet no learning improvement heuristics have been developed so far, even though they are acknowledged to be more efficient in narrowing the optimality gap. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a learning improvement MORP method, Pareto Improver (PI). PI employs a population-based mechanism to approximate the Pareto front with a single deep reinforcement learning model. The experimental results on various MORP problems show that PI can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {An architecture for vehicle position estimation is introduced in this paper to tackle the issue of vehicles positioning in traffic congestion of intelligent transportation system (ITS). The introduced architecture is related to three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), ITS center and the terminal of position estimation, in which the UAV collect data from the ULA, the ITS center store data and the terminal is responsible for executing the corresponding direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm to estimate the vehicle position. In the introduced architecture, DOA estimation is the crucial issue, hence a robust sparse recovery framework based on the optimal weighted subspace fitting is put forward for DOA estimation in the presence of direction-dependent unknown mutual coupling. Firstly, a data model can be obtained by a new transformation approach. Then, a sparse recovery algorithm based on the weighted subspace fitting is used to estimate the desired DOAs. The proposed DOA estimation algorithm can achieve superior performance in both coherent and incoherent signals in the environment of direction-dependent mutual coupling, and this environment often occurs in traffic congestion. Based on the DOA estimation results obtained from the proposed efficient regularized sparse recovery algorithm, the position of vehicles is final estimated by a weighted three-points cross-positioning method. The results of various simulation experiments fully demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed architecture and algorithm.},

Current transportation systems resort to cloud computing to deploy their applications but face two bottlenecks, lack of real-time processing and under-utilization of intelligent roadside devices. We observe that dispersed computing—an emerging paradigm of cloud computing—well fits the requirements of modern transportation systems. It provides real-time response by alleviating data transmission between data sources and cloud servers and fully utilizes smart devices by exploring their computing capacity. Therefore, we design RIDIC, an intelligent transportation system with dispersed computing to provide a real-time response when processing transportation big data. RIDIC abstracts all the heterogeneous smart roadside devices as actors, and its workflow consists of three stages, Actor Registration, Resource Application and Task Execution. We conduct experiments on two real-life traffic scenarios—road vehicle detection and traffic signal recognition—and the results show that RIDIC can utilize edge devices to process transportation big data faster while reducing the demand for device computing resources.},

  abstract     = {In the community of automotive millimeter wave radar, the recently developed concept of four-dimensional (4D) radar can provide high-resolution point clouds image with enhanced imaging performance. Currently, the density of point clouds for single-frame image is usually too sparse to satisfy the demands of target classification and recognition due to the limitation of Doppler and angle resolutions. To address the aforementioned issues, a novel algorithm is proposed for 4D high-resolution imagery generation of point clouds with extremely high Doppler and angle resolutions in this paper. For high Doppler resolution with high-dynamic, a novel velocity ambiguity resolution algorithm is proposed using a dual pulse repetition frequency (dual-PRF) waveform design embedded in an innovative time-division multiplexing &amp; Doppler-division multiplexing MIMO (TDM-DDM-MIMO) framework. Meanwhile, an attractive complex-valued deep convolutional network (CV-DCN) of super-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is proposed only using single-frame data. To be specific, a spatial smoothing operator on array data is applied as input of the network, and a CV-DCN is designed to learn the transformation of the spatial spectrum from the end-to-end to effectively protect the spectrum extraction. Furthermore, experimental analysis is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed super-resolution DOA estimation algorithm. Finally, the 4D high-resolution imagery of point clouds is obtained by experiments in the parking lot.},

  abstract     = {Over the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has advanced significantly in a variety of fields. As a pivotal application of IoT, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have harvested great attention from the research community. Radio frequency identification (RFID) which is an essential technology in IoT plays a key role in ITS to identify tagged vehicles. Unknown tag identification which aims at identifying the existing unknown tags is crucial to monitor the newly entering vehicles in the RFID-assisted intelligent transportation systems. However, the COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) RFID tags that harvest energy from the reader can not support the hash function in reality, which hinders the widespread deployment of hash-enabled unknown tag identification protocols. To conquer this tough issue, we propose two approaches to efficiently identify unknown COTS RFID tags. We first propose a Single-Point Selective unknown tag identification approach called SPS, where an analog hash pattern using the EPC (Electronic Product Code) segments is deployed to exclusively identify unknown tags. An unknown tag will be identified when it selects a singleton slot to reply. To improve the time efficiency of SPS, we further propose a Multi-Point Selective unknown tag identification approach called MPS. In MPS, two techniques of batch identification and batch division are developed to reduce the number of empty slots and avoid tag collisions, respectively. Then the parameters are theoretically analyzed to maximize the identification efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated via both the simulations and COTS RFID device based experiments.},

Although some defense methods have been proposed, they have strong pertinence to attacks. Thus, new attack methods are needed to improve the defense performance of the model. In this work, we improve the existing attack methods and propose a double level attack method. By constructing the dynamic iterative step size and analyzing the class characteristics of the signals, this method can use the adversarial losses of feature layer and decision layer to generate adversarial examples with stronger attack performance. In order to improve the robustness of the recognition model, we use adversarial examples to train the model, and transfer the knowledge learned from the model to the jamming recognition models in other wireless communication environments by transfer learning.

  abstract     = {Transportation big data (TBD) are increasingly combined with artificial intelligence to mine novel patterns and information due to the powerful representational capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially for anti-COVID19 applications. The distributed cloud-edge-vehicle training architecture has been applied to accelerate DNNs training while ensuring low latency and high privacy for TBD processing. However, multiple intelligent devices (e.g., intelligent vehicles, edge computing chips at base stations) and different networks in intelligent transportation systems lead to computing power and communication heterogeneity among distributed nodes. Existing parallel training mechanisms perform poorly on heterogeneous cloud-edge-vehicle clusters. The synchronous parallel mechanism may force fast workers to wait for the slowest worker for synchronization, thus wasting their computing power. The asynchronous mechanism has communication bottlenecks and can exacerbate the straggler problem, causing increased training iterations and even incorrect convergence. In this paper, we introduce a distributed training framework, Heter-Train. First, a communication-efficient semi-asynchronous parallel mechanism (SAP-SGD) is proposed, which can take full advantage of acceleration effect of asynchronous strategy on heterogeneous training and constrain the straggler problem by using global interval synchronization. Second, Considering the difference in node bandwidth, we design a solution for heterogeneous communication. Moreover, a novel weighted aggregation strategy is proposed to aggregate the model parameters with different versions. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed strategy can achieve up to $6.74 \times $ speedups on training time, with almost no accuracy decrease.},

In response to tackle the problem, we model the mission planning problem in the uncertain dynamic environment as a dynamic multi-constraint and multi-objective optimization problems (DMCMOP) and propose the dynamic constrained two-archive evolutionary algorithm (DCTAEA) to realize the efficient mission planning. The proposed method can reconstruct the convergence archive (CA) and the diversity archive (DA) adaptively, and introduce the dynamic self-adaptive penalty mechanism into the CA updating, DA updating and the mating selection, which utilizes valuable infeasible solutions and promote population convergence. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can balance convergence, diversity and feasibility simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments on the real scenes and benchmark problem demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the superiority and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In the case of COVID-19, which requires stable and reliable tracking of personnel movement, aircraft identification by specific emitter identification (SEI) is a hot-button issue. It refers to the process of identifying individual aircraft by comparing features extracted from the Radio Frequency (RF) signal of a given aircraft. Deep learning (DL) has been widely used in SEI research due to its excellent feature extraction capability, but in the actual low-resource reception scenario, the aircraft signal data acquired for training are long-tailed in distribution, and the imbalance of the signal data increases the challenge of training the network. In this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed specific emitter identification (LT-SEI) method using decoupled representation (DR) learning. Specifically, we separate the learning process into two stages: representation learning and classification, which includes unbalanced training and balanced classifier learning. The proposed DR-based LT-SEI approach is assessed using aircraft Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data collected in the real world and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiment results show that the method has better long-tail recognition performance than the existing methods. When the data imbalance factor is 0.01, the F1 score of the model for the recognition result can reach 71.2%, which is 9% higher than that of the baseline model.},

However, hindered by the high dimensionality of OD flow and the lack of supportive information reflecting the real-time passenger flow changes, study in this area is at the beginning stage. A novel model consisting of two stages is proposed for OD flow prediction. The first stage predicts the inflows of all stations by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in real time, where the dimension is reduced compared with predicting OD flows directly. In the second stage, the notion of separation rate, namely, the proportion of inbound passengers bounding for another station, is estimated. Finally, The OD flow is predicted by multiplying the inflow and separation rate. Experiments based on Hangzhou Metro dataset show the proposed model outperforms the contrast model in weighted mean average error (WMAE) and weighted mean square error (WMSE). Results also suggest that the proposed prediction model performs better on weekdays than on weekends, and with greater accuracy on larger OD flows.},

With the rapid development of VANETs, various services have generated a great deal of data that can be used for transportation planning and safe driving. Especially, with the advent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transportation system has been impacted, thus novel modes of transportation planning and intelligent applications are necessary. Digital twins can provide powerful support for artificial intelligence applications in Transportation Big Data (TBD). The features of VANETs are varying, which arises the main challenge of digital twins applying in TBD. Network traffic prediction, as part of digital twins, is useful for network management and security in VANETs, such as network planning and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a network traffic prediction algorithm aiming at time-varying traffic flows with a large number of fluctuations. This algorithm combines Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for network traffic feature extraction. DQN is leveraged to carry out network traffic prediction, in which GAN is involved to represent Q-network. Meanwhile, the generative network can increase the number of samples to improve the prediction error. We evaluate the performance of our method by implementing it on three real network traffic data sets. Finally, we compare the two state-of-the-art competing methods with our method.},

  abstract     = {Many transportation system problems can be formulated as high-dimensional expensive multi-objective problems. They are challenging for Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization methods to find the Pareto fronts due to the curse of dimensionality and the boundary issue in the acquisition function optimization. This paper presents a multi-objective Bayesian optimization method with block coordinate updates, Block-MOBO, to solve high-dimensional expensive multi-objective problems. Block-MOBO first partitions the decision variable space into different blocks, each of which includes a low-dimensional multi-objective problem. At each iteration, one block is considered and the decision variables not in this block are approximated by context-vector generation embedded with the Pareto prior knowledge thus promoting convergence. To tackle the boundary issue, we present $\epsilon $ -greedy acquisition function in a Bayesian and multi-objective fashion, which recommends candidates either from the exploitation-exploration trade-off perspective or with probability $\epsilon $ from the Pareto dominance relationship perspective. We verify the effectiveness of Block-MOBO by comparing it with other multi-objective Bayesian methods on two real-world optimization problems in transportation system and three multi-objective synthetic test suites. The experimental results show that Block-MOBO can find more evenly distributed and non-dominated solutions in the whole search space with lower complexity compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Our analyses illustrate that block coordinate updates and $\epsilon $ -greedy acquisition function contribute to computational complexity reduction and convergence-diversity trade-offs, respectively.},

  abstract     = {With the spread of COVID-19 in recent years, wearing masks has increased the difficulty of driver mental fatigue recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal has become an important physiological signal index to reflect the driver’s mental state. However, the drivers’ EEG data is plagued by inadequate labels and multi-view data, which makes classification difficult. To solve this problem, this study proposes a s emi-supervised m ulti-view s parse regularization and g raph embedding learning (SMSG) model. To obtain discriminative feature representations of semi-supervised EEG data, SMSG fully mines diverse information from multiple views based on sparse regularization embedding and graph embedding technology. SMSG employs the graph embedding to capture the discriminative structure and local manifold structure on multi-view data. Furthermore, SMSG learns the common shared regularization embedding and private regularization embedding factors to preserve the consistency and diversity of the multi-view data. Through self-adaptive learning, the weights of each view can be directly solved adaptively. This works also introduces kernel trick to project the SMSG model into the nonlinear reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which can obtain more approximate EEG feature representation. Experiments on the real dataset verify the effectiveness of the SMSG model for EEG-based driver mental fatigue recognition.},

The main differences of this research from the others, which use drones in literature, are as: First, the regions are divided into grids and different importance values are assigned according to the number of buildings that are likely to be damaged and are vital for the response stage, such as hospitals, schools, and fire stations. Second, these importance levels are updated based on the day and time, which helps ordering the grids in a more realistic manner. Third, the depots are selected among the pre-determined candidate locations in accordance with the purpose of objective function. Fourth, detection times at grids are considered as uncertain. Fifth, two versions of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are developed as alternatives to exact solution tools. Last, sensitivity analyzes are performed by reducing the number of sorties, reducing the number of drones, and comparing day and night importance values for each instance. According to the results, only for very small-scale instances, exact solution tool was able to reach the optimal while both versions of ACO reached to similar results within a very less CPU times. Additionally, these ACO algorithms also found good results for the larger scaled problems. Then the performance of these ACO algorithms and the exact solution method are compared based on the CPU time and solution quality.},

At present, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is an emerging paradigm to integrate resources from vehicles, road-site units, base stations, and cloud center to promote the performance of TBD tasks scheduling and running. In this paper, we design a three-layered TBD task processing architecture with a federated learning mechanism for credit priority-based task scheduling and running.

We propose a vehicular federated learning framework combined with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) credit measurement, which can preserve the privacy of vehicles and obtain the related features for vehicular credit prediction. We also propose a task offloading algorithm to solve the optimization problem for credit priority task offloading between edge computing servers and vehicles. The proposed solution can prioritize tasks and assign sufficient resources for reliable and active task requesters.

In this paper, we present a novel large-scale resource scheduling algorithm of WSNs based on differential ion coevolution and multi-objective decomposition (DIC-MOD) to optimize the performance of WSNs. We first introduce a certain number of mobile nodes with higher configuration into WSNs and consider them as relay nodes to strengthen the balance of energy consumption in the entire WSNs. Subsequently, we build a multi-index service quality evaluation model, including coverage, connectivity, energy efficiency and the number of nodes required to work, to characterize the comprehensive performance of WSNs. Afterward, to optimize the above complex model effectively, we propose a multi-objective resource scheduling algorithm, in which a differential ion coevolution strategy and a fast individual selection strategy based on multi-objective decomposition optimization are proposed in specific. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the experimental results finally show that the performance of WSNs on multiple indicators obtained by the proposed algorithm has been improved considerably.},

  abstract     = {As the safety problems and economic losses caused by traffic accidents are becoming more and more serious, intelligent transportation system (ITS) came into being. After the outbreak of COVID-19, how to achieve effective traffic scheduling and macro command under less contact has attracted more attention. Therefore, the location estimation of traffic objectives is a key issue. In the developed framework, for the target parameter estimation in traffic, frequency diversity array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar is introduced into ITS, and tensor decomposition is used to process transportation big data (TBD) to improve the real-time performance of target location estimation. Unfortunately, spatial colored noise and array gain-phase error will affect the performance of FDA-MIMO radar in ITS. An algorithm that can solve the angle-range estimation problem of FDA-MIMO radar in the co-existence of array gain-phase error and spatial colored noise is proposed. Firstly, the four-dimensional tensor is constructed by using the temporal un-correlation of colored noise. Therefore, the influence of colored noise in ITS is removed. Secondly, the direction matrix containing target information is obtained by parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. For the array gain-phase error, the optimization problem is constructed, and the Lagrange multiplier is employed to calculate the optimal solution. The effect of gain-phase error is eliminated by utilizing the optimal solution and the direction matrices. Finally, the location information of motor vehicle is achieved by calculating the solution of least square (LS) fitting. The developed scheme can achieve the location information of motor vehicles in the co-existence of array gain-phase error and spatial colored noise. Comprehensive numerical experiments illustrate that the developed scheme in ITS can efficiently obtain the location information of motor vehicles.},

Dynamic spectrum access enables the CIoV to choose the best possible spectrum for communications based on the outcomes of spectrum data sensing, which can improve the spectrum access performance effectively. In this paper, we enable the CIoV to adapt to various spectrum states through: a) a collaborative big spectrum data sensing scheme to sense a massive amount of spectrum data; and b) a reinforcement learning (RL) based dynamic spectrum access scheme to optimize spectrum selection strategies. Q-learning, which is a popular RL approach, is proposed for underlay, overlay, and collaborative spectrum access modes to allocate spectrum resources to the CIoV intelligently. The Q-learning models, which include the spectrum state vector, the action vector of CIoV, and the spectrum access reward received in different spectrum situations, are defined for the spectrum access modes. A Q-learning based spectrum access algorithm is proposed to improve the communication performance of the CIoV in different spectrum access modes. Simulation results indicate that the collaborative spectrum access mode can achieve higher average throughput, lower interference power and lower communication outage compared with the underlay and overlay spectrum access modes.},

  abstract     = {The global positioning system (GPS), which provides ubiquitous location-awareness with a constellation of satellites, has become an instrumental function of multiple mass-market applications. Satellite signals, however, may not be capable of penetrating obstacles in harsh environments (e.g., urban canyons, tree canopies, and flyovers). Hence, GPS may not provide adequate localization accuracy for applications like autonomous vehicles. Resorting to data fusion of heterogeneous signals emanating from multiple anchors, we advocate a self-localization method that provides accurate estimates of the vehicle position. To be more specific, several heterogenous emitters whose positions are known are used as anchors to determine the vehicle’s position based on the weighted direct position determination (DPD) method that eliminates nonhomogeneity among different emitters. However, the weighted DPD method requires an exhaustive search of the parameter search space and is thus time-consuming. To reduce the computational burden, we propose a weighted cascade compensation estimator (WCCE) that is tailored for real-time tracking and self-localization. The proposed WCCE outperforms traditional DPD methods in terms of computational complexity while achieving nearly comparable localization accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated by extensive simulated examples.},

However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications.

In this paper, we propose an XGBoost-LSTM mixed framework that predicts the spread of infectious diseases in multiple cities and regions. According to big traffic data, it was found that population flow is closely related to the spread of infectious diseases. Clustering and dividing cities according to population flow can significantly improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, an XGBoost is used to predict the transmission trend based on the key features of infection. An LSTM is used to predict the transmission fluctuation based on infection-related multiple time series features. The mixed model combines transmission trends and fluctuations to predict infections accurately. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of highly pathogenic infectious disease transmission published by Baidu and compared with other advanced methods. The results show that the model has an excellent predictive effect and practical value for large-scale infectious disease prediction.},

  abstract     = {Effectively predicting the evolution of COVID-19 is of great significance to contain the pandemic. Extensive previous studies proposed a great number of SIR variants, which are efficient to capture the transmission characteristics of COVID-19. However, the parameter estimation methods in previous studies are based on data from epidemiological investigations, which inevitably have caused a large delay. The popularity of digital trajectory data world-wide makes it possible to understand epidemic spreading from human mobility perspective. The major advantage of digital trajectory data lies in that the co-location level of a population is reflected at every moment, making it possible to forecast the evolution in advance. We showed that the mobility data contributed by mobile phone users could be exploited to estimate the contact probability between individuals, thus revealing the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, we developed an estimation method to obtain human co-location levels and quantified the variations of human mobility during the epidemic. Then, we extended the infection rate with a real-time co-location level to further forecast the transmission of an epidemic, predicting the epidemic size much more accurately than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed method was applied to evaluate the quantitative effect of different non-pharmacological interventions by predicting the epidemic situations with various mobility characteristics. The empirical results and simulations corroborated our theoretical analysis, providing effective guidance to contain the pandemic.},

Considering that the practical mmWave MIMO channel is sparsity and the subcarrier multi-channels have the same sparse structure, we regard the channel estimation problem as the sparse channel recovery, and propose a multipath simultaneous matching tracking estimation method. It is assumed that the noise between the practical channels has a certain correlation, and the noise correlation has an impact on the selection of the optimal atomic support set in the process of channel recovery. Therefore, noise weighting is introduced in our proposed method. The simulation results prove the validity of this proposed method in frequency selective mmWave MIMO channel. Without increasing the complexity of the algorithm, the proposed method can achieve better local performance than the traditional classical methods.},

However, the variety of pavement distress types and forms makes it difficult to accurately classify and detect them. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel target detection model YOLO-SST based on YOLOv5 with the improvement in pavement distress features. First, a Shuffle Attention mechanism is introduced in the feature extraction backbone network to enhance the detection ability without significantly increasing the computational cost. Secondly, we add a detection layer and embed Swin-Transformer encoder blocks into the C3 module to capture global and contextual information. Finally, to improve the model’s detection ability, transfer learning is employed on a self-made dataset called RDDdect_2023, which consists of street view images captured via a DJI Action camera mounted on the car. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLO-SST model outperforms YOLOv5 and other target detection models in terms of accuracy, recall rate, and mAP@0.5 value for detecting pavement distresses. This confirms that the YOLO-SST model has stronger feature extraction and fusion capabilities, resulting in better detection performance.},

  abstract     = {It is inevitable to recognize objects in adverse weather conditions where the uncertainty of contour areas is increased. Although some multi-task learning frameworks have gained from the directional supervision between boundary detection and semantic segmentation, the interaction between those two tasks is poorly investigated. Moreover, the performance of the contour detection is expected to degrade under foggy scenarios, because the auxiliary task also has no benefits from the main task. To address the potential risk in intelligent transportation systems, this paper proposes a mutual learning framework, named CE-MGN (Confidence-Enhanced Mutual Graph Network), to propagate confidence through continuous interaction between different tasks rather than only focusing on the accuracy of the main task. The CE-MGN performs an end-to-end training paradigm and jointly learns two tasks, contour detection and semantic segmentation, through pairwise confidence-enhancement mechanism. Moreover, the task interaction is converted into graph space to further relieve the information loss during the feature aggregation in Euclidean space. Such a framework is capable to improve the robustness of respective tasks because of the encouragement from its peer task. Extensive experiments show that our CE-MGN achieved mean IoU scores of 79.35% and 79.03% on CityScapes and Foggy CityScapes datasets, respectively. Besides, our models have a stable performance on different weather severity, where the performance fluctuation is less than 1%.},

The main challenges of existing traffic sign detection method are inaccurate small object detection, difficult mobile deployment, and complex working environment. Based on these, a vehicle-mounted adaptive traffic sign detector (VATSD) for small-sized signs in multiple working conditions is proposed in this paper. First, the Backbone of the detector is optimized. A feature tight fusion structure is designed to constitute a new feature extraction module, DCSP, which improves the feature extraction capability and the detection accuracy of small objects with negligible additional parameters. Second, an image enhancement network IENet with an adaptive joint filtering strategy is proposed. The IENet enables the dynamic selection of filters and thus adaptively optimizes low-quality images under multiple conditions to improve the accuracy of subsequent detection tasks. The proposed method has experimented on three traffic sign datasets and the detection accuracy increased by up to 7.6% compared to the original. The proposed detector demonstrates superiority over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of small object detection accuracy, detection speed, and environmental adaptability. Further, we deployed VATSD to Jetson Xavier NX and achieved a detection speed of 21.6 FPS, meeting real-time requirements.},

By making full use of line-of-sight ranges and angles between neighbors, a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with unknown inertia masses, internal dynamics and external disturbances can cooperate with a manned surface vehicle (MSV), thereby emerging flexibly collective behaviors in GPS-denied environments. To endow MUSVs with individually flexible behaviors, the VSS mechanism renders velocity matching of USVs with the MSV executing human-intelligence intention. Meanwhile, barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to reliably maintain visibility and avoid collisions among individuals, simultaneously. Distributed neural approximators using reduced-dimension inputs are devised to estimate unknown dynamics of USVs, while residual uncertainties are thoroughly suppressed by robust adaptations, thereby contributing to a model-free VSS (MVSS) scheme. Eventually, together with projection-based adaptive laws, the MVSS-based controller ensures uniform boundedness of estimation parameters and asymptotic convergence of regulation errors.

  abstract     = {The icebreaker assistance is crucial to the safe navigation of low ice-class ships in ice-covered waters. Nevertheless, the major issues of the icebreaker assistance are the potential accidents due to the uncertain distance between ships. On one side, the close distance between ships could lead to a collision. On the other hand, the following ship may be stuck in the ice due to a large distance, as this distance may cause the broken ice channel to close again. To this end, we propose a new model of the ship navigation risk field for icebreaker convoy operations based on artificial potential field (APF) to describe interactions between ships as well as between ship and ice and to quantify the navigation risk for following ships in the fleet. The proposed model consists of two components: (i) the ship risk field, which describes the ship-ship collision risk; (ii) the sea ice risk field, which describes the ship stuck risk in ice. The risk indicators of ship-ship collision and ship stuck in ice channel for icebreaker convoy operations are established. Finally, a method for obtaining the safety following distance for the fleet is developed based on the proposed model. The proposed model is verified by a case study, has good agreement with safety distance model and empirical data, and its mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) with the minimum safe distance model is less than 1.3% overall and covers the actual maximum safe distance, which can be served as a theoretical guide for icebreaker assistance.},

In this article, we define Perception Error Models (PEM), a virtual simulation component that can enable the analysis of the impact of perception errors on AV safety, without the need to model the sensors themselves. We propose a generalized data-driven procedure towards parametric modeling and evaluate it using Apollo, an open-source driving software, and nuScenes, a public AV dataset. Additionally, we implement PEMs in SVL, an open-source vehicle simulator. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of PEM-based virtual tests, by evaluating camera, LiDAR, and camera-LiDAR setups. Our virtual tests highlight limitations in the current evaluation metrics, and the proposed approach can help study the impact of perception errors on AV safety.},

However, most existing approaches fail to perform good boundary extraction for prediction maps and cannot fully use high-level features. In addition, these methods simply fuse the features from RGB and thermal modalities but are unable to obtain comprehensive fused features. To address these problems, an edge-aware guidance fusion network (EGFNet) was developed in this study for RGB–thermal urban scene parsing. First, a prior edge map generated using the RGB and thermal images were introduced to capture detailed information in the prediction map and then embed the prior edge cues into the feature maps. To fuse the RGB and thermal information effectively, a multimodal fusion module was designed that guarantees adequate cross-modal fusion. Considering the importance of high-level semantic information, global and semantic information modules were proposed to extract rich semantic information from the high-level features. For decoding, simple elementwise addition was utilized for cascaded feature fusion. Finally, to improve the parsing accuracy, multitask deep supervision was applied to the semantic and boundary maps. Extensive experiments were performed on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGFNet and its superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Many previous studies used supervised algorithms to profile drivers. However, this cannot be applied to large-scale unlabeled driving data, which are increasingly prevalent in the ITS context. This paper proposes a framework that combines lateral and longitudinal accelerations to assess a driver’s driving style using an unsupervised approach. The framework first detects risky acceleration maneuvers using a statistical method based on the G-G diagram that shows combinations of lateral and longitudinal accelerations. Hierarchical clustering was used to classify the average driving behavior of drivers into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups. Further, a unique Gaussian mixture model is trained for each driver to score their driving style and decompose risky acceleration maneuvers into several risk components. Finally, the spatio-temporal characteristics are extracted to provide implicit factors on the risky behavior of drivers. The proposed method was applied to a large-scale dataset obtained by in-vehicle data recorders. The results demonstrate the necessity to combine the two axes of acceleration for driver behavior assessment. The proposed method can model individual driving styles effectively from the driver’s G-G diagram, enabling applicability to large-scale unlabeled data for driving style assessment. The extraction of spatio-temporal characteristics can improve the interpretability of the results obtained using machine learning algorithms. All these results can be used to create a driver’s risk profile and provide tailored feedback for improving driving safety.},

With the advantage of accuracy and robustness, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely employed in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been utilized to provide reliable positioning information. Compared with the experimental vehicles in the restricted laboratory driving circumstances, autonomous vehicles are devoted to actual roads and contain complicated activities, where closed loops can be noticed. In general, the accumulated error may be accumulated with the increasing of maneuver scope of SLAM. A distinct drift phenomenon may thus be incurred in the completed point cloud map and threaten the accuracy of positioning results. Focusing on this deficiency, a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry, named PDLC-LIO, is developed in this paper towards large-scale environments with close loops. A direct point cloud registration approach without extracting features has been introduced into this framework. Strategies including the pre-integration on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the direct scan match in local-scale, and an efficient fusion loop closure detection method with conditional detection are included to guarantee the precision. Also, the factor graph optimization is considered, and measurements from LiDAR odometry, IMU and loop closures can thus be integrated into the back-end optimization. The proposed method has been verified on both the public datasets and the test cases collected by our own autonomous driving experiment platform. Accurate experimental results can be obtained. Such results show that the performance including accumulated errors and the drift phenomenon outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms LeGO-LOAM/ LIO-SAM /FAST-LIO2, and the loop closure detection rate can be promoted up to 75%.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become one of the essential approaches to effectively resolve problems such as traffic safety, road congestion, and energy consumption. However, due to the spatial-temporal interaction of the mixed traffic environment, the driving behaviors of traffic participants are continuously transmitted in time and space. This makes it difficult for the existing decision-making system of CAVs to make accurate judgments and effective strategies. In this study, a rate graph convolution Q-learning network (Rate GQN) is proposed to train a discrete strategy that can improve the comprehensive performance of CAVs in scenarios with spatial-temporal interaction. Firstly, the Rate algorithm is proposed to impose a ratio on the estimates of Q-values from the previous learning process, which improves the stability and performance of the algorithm by reducing the approximate error variance of the target value. Secondly, the traffic Scenario is modeled as a graph structure. And graph convolutional networks are adopted to extract the features information of graph structure to help the CAVs grasp the dynamic traffic interaction information quickly and accurately. Additionally, an internal dynamic multi-objective reward function is presented to improve the comprehensive performance of CAVs, including safety, efficiency, energy saving, and comfort. Finally, comparison and ablation experiments are constructed in a task-based traffic scenario (station stop and traffic light passing). The simulation results show that our Rate GQN method has faster training speed, a more stable training process, and better overall performance than the deep Q-learning network (DQN) and algorithms of the comparison group.},

This paper presents an efficient self-evolution method for any given algorithm based on the combination of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Behavioral Cloning(BC). First, the states of the sample trajectory in the replay buffer are separated and input into the given algorithm (algorithm with fundamental performance) to get the output label of actions such that the SAC algorithm can be guided using BC to achieve fast iteration in the direction of optimization with existing basic performance. Then, the value iteration algorithm is combined to achieve the proportion allocation of mixed gradient feedback, in order to trade off exploitation and exploration. In addition, the proposed methodology is evaluated in simulation environment taking automated speed control as an example. Experiment results show that compared with SAC algorithm, the proposed method can realize more than three times of convergence efficiency improvement, while without destroying the exploration enhancement advantage of reinforcement learning algorithm, that is, the performance is improved by 20% compared with the given algorithm (Intelligent Driver Model, IDM). The proposed method can easily extended to improve any given model no matter it is model-based or learning-based algorithm.},

  abstract     = {High-definition (HD) map is one of the key assets for autonomous driving, which supports various modules such as behavior prediction and motion planning of autonomous vehicles by providing accurate and rich geometric and semantic information. However, at present, the scalability and computational efficiency of HD map generation cannot meet the needs of highly automated driving. Specifically, efficiently obtaining the optimal parameters of the road’s reference path is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust path reconstruction method, which compresses the dense points of a reference line into sparse parameters with minimal loss of information. The reconstructed path consists of segmented linear curvature contours, which are straight lines, circular arcs, and clothoids. The optimum result is obtained through linear programming for short-path reconstruction, and for the long paths, a fast progressive reconstruction approach is used to find a feasible solution. Experimental results on both randomly generated data and the GPS-collected trajectories show that compared with existing methods, the proposed method can generate more accurate path reconstruction, and the computational time is greatly reduced.},

  abstract     = {As 5-th Generation (5G) mobile communication and edge computing technologies mature, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) are gradually becoming a reality. In the 5G heterogeneous network, resources such as computing, storage, and communication are allocated to each Road Side Unit (RSU) to provide intelligent services for vehicles. However, the existing average allocation method based on historical experience can easily lead to over-concentration or insufficient resources, which causes waste and reduces the Quality of Service (QoS). To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-Objective Neural Time-series Prediction (M-ONTP) scheme for resource pre-allocation scenario in ITS. The scheme takes into account the complexity and diversity of service resource, innovatively treats the number of vehicles and communication power as joint optimization metrics, and proposes a multi-objective learning model. Benefiting from the vehicle data collected by RSUs in real time, we utilize historical traffic information to predict future road load and rely on Software Defined Network (SDN) to design a flexible resource pre-allocated architecture for ITS. To enhance the effectiveness of feature capture, M-ONTP also organically integrates various neural networks, which can appropriately handle large-scale time-series traffic flow. And we choose two layers of road data for fitting, which ensures that the model has a wide horizon to receive sufficient information. SUMO-based simulation experiments show that our scheme accurately realizes the prediction of joint objective and has significant performance advantage over other models. Meanwhile, our pre-allocation strategy reduces the total resource consumption by about 7%, increases the sufficiency rate by about 7%, and decreases the redundancy by about 12% while ensuring enough service resource to maintain normal QoS, which validates the effectiveness of M-ONTP.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) are typically employed to provide additional source of energy for a sensing system. However, studies show that a PEH can be also used as a sensor to acquire information about the source of vibration by analysing the produced voltage signal. This opens a possibility to create Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Sensing (SEHS) system, where a single piece of hardware, a PEH, acts as both, a harvester and as a sensor. This raises a question if it is possible to design a bi-functional PEH device with optimal harvesting and sensing performance. In this work, we propose a bi-objective PEH design optimisation framework and show that there is a trade-off between energy harvesting efficiency and sensing accuracy within a PEH design space. The proposed framework is based on an extensive vibration (strain and acceleration) dataset collected from a real-world operational cable-stayed bridge in New South Wales, Australia. The bridge acceleration data is used as an input for a PEH numerical model to simulate a voltage signal and estimate the amount of produced energy. The numerical PEH model is based on the Kirchhoff-Love plate and isogeometric analysis. For sensing, convolutional neural network AlexNet is trained to identify traffic speed labels from voltage CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) images. In order to improve computational efficiency of the approach, a kriging metamodel is built and genetic algorithm is used as an optimisation method. The results are presented in the form of Pareto fronts in three design spaces.},

However, the limited frequency bandwidth and the increasing number of equipped radar sensors would inevitably cause mutual interference, degrading target detection and producing safety hazards. In this paper, a deep learning-based interference mitigation (IM) approach is proposed for FMCW radars by using the dilated convolution for network construction and a designated contrast learning strategy for training. The dilated convolution enlarges the receptive field of the neural network, and the designated contrastive learning strategy enforces to distinguish better between interferences and desired signals. The results of numerical simulation and experimental data processing show that the dilated convolution-based IM network, compared to the traditional convolution-based ones, can achieve a higher Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and target detection rate. Moreover, the designated contrastive learning strategy enables a better and more stable IM performance without increasing the complexity of the network, which can facilitate faster signal processing.},

Recent advances in machine learning have achieved promising prediction results in the single-airport scenario. However, these works overlook the variational spatial interactions hidden among airports and show limited performances on the traffic flow prediction task for the aviation system which is composed of several airports. In this paper, we consider the multi-airport scenario and propose a novel spatio-temporal hybrid deep learning model to efficiently capture spatial correlations as well as temporal dependencies in a parallelized way. Specifically, we introduce the causal inference among airports to model their interactions and thus construct adaptive causality graphs in a data-driven manner to address the heterogeneity of airports. Furthermore, given that multi-source features are not applicable for all airports, a feature mask module is designated to adaptively select the features in spatial information mining. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-30 busiest airports in China. The results show that our spatio-temporal deep learning approach is superior to state-of-the-art methodologies and the improvement ratio is up to 4.7% against benchmarks. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed adaptive causality graph and the feature mask module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Yet, current monitoring methods, including weather stations and onboard environmental sensors, often fall short due to their high costs, significant latency, and limited dissemination. This paper presents the Edge-based Multi-task Safety-oriented Environmental (Edge-MuSE) sensing system, designed to address these traffic safety challenges associated with environmental factors. Edge-MuSE departs from traditional single-task sensing methods by performing multidimensional traffic environment perception tasks. It estimates key safety-related environmental factors exclusively through camera inputs and incorporates four innovative sensing tasks: visibility estimation, image dehazing, road segmentation, and road surface condition classification. The system is tailored to edge devices to transition computational loads from central servers to distributed nodes, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing latency. Additionally, Edge-MuSE integrates communication functions based on TCP/IP and Wi-Fi protocols, enabling rapid dissemination of sensing results and warning messages to local road users. System structures and data streaming have been optimized to accommodate the constraints of edge devices, ensuring high-efficiency edge computing. Field testing of Edge-MuSE in multiple testbeds in Bellevue (WA, US) and Oslo (Norway) has demonstrated its reliable and precise performance in perception tasks (92.15% accuracy in visibility estimation and 92.25% in road surface condition classification) as well as an impressive processing speed of 21.3 FPS. As such, Edge-MuSE presents a promising solution for enhancing roadway safety, efficiency, and resilience.},

Inspired by the contrast and comparison in perception of human beings, a contrastive learning method is introduced into license plate detection task and we propose an end-to-end Contrastive License Plate Detector (CLPD). In CLPD, a special contrastive triad for contrastive learning is designed which aims to decouple the foregrounds and backgrounds. Based on this triad, a contrastive learning branch is introduced into the license plate detection pipeline to prompt the feature expression ability of backbone and extracting more discriminative features for detection. This contrastive learning branch is jointly trained with supervised learning branch for detection and it is only used in training, keeping the efficiency in inference. The experiment results show that the proposed CLPD improves the detection accuracy compared to baselines and other license plate detectors significantly on three datasets. The ablation studies further explore the potential of CLPD. In addition, the proposed CLPD has generalization to improve the performance on different baselines. And the visualization results in latent space verify our proposed CLPD aggregates features tightly and extracts discriminative features effectively.},

Such errors are inevitable in real scenarios where GPS signals or some other drift-free exteroceptive measurements are not available, e.g., when an automobile goes through a tunnel. Using FMCW-based mmWave radars is an attractive metric localization technique with improved robustness as RF signals can traverse small particles in harsh weather conditions like snowing, foggy, and storming, but it faces a fundamental challenge of Doppler distortion. Existing works take spatial constraints to mitigate the Doppler distortion of point clouds from mechanical radars with limited accuracy. Modern single-chip mmWave radars that provide dynamic estimates, i.e., radial velocities, bring new opportunities to develop more accurate approaches. This paper presents DC-Loc++ , a robust metric localization framework by compensating Doppler distortions using a single-chip mmWave radar. It consists of an explicit velocity-assisted Doppler compensation module for each radar sub-map, an uncertainty-aware metric registration algorithm, and a failure recovery method that validates measurement constraints to generate a more confident pose graph for optimizing vehicle poses. Extensive experiments on both nuScenes dataset and a synthetic CARLA dataset show the effectiveness of DC-Loc++ , achieving 99.2% success rate and more than 20.0%, 30.2% error reductions in terms of translation and rotation estimates, respectively, compared with existing approaches.},

At first, the problem is transformed into a multi-stage decision process, and the decision agent is designed to predict dispatching rules. To enhance the training efficiency, we generate a small yet good-quality action set to reduce invalid explorations. Besides, we propose an action sampling strategy for action selection, which implements forward planning with consideration of evaluation uncertainty, thus improving search efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method.

However, in most works, the ACC system is studied under a simplifying and unrealistic assumption, or the ACC system modeled is inaccurate. This paper proposes a general hierarchical control system to model ACC systems with several assumptions based on the deficiencies above. Moreover, a field experiment was conducted, and the corresponding experimental data was used to verify the proposed hierarchical control system and assumptions. In addition, string stability is explored along with sensitivity analyses of control parameters based on an example under the constant time gap policy. The results show that different upper-level controller parameters have different delays, where the delay of the speed is negligible; the introduction of actuator delay and lag in the lower-level controller can significantly improve the model goodness of fit. Furthermore, optimizing the delay and lag in the lower-level controller can significantly enhance the string stability of ACCs than optimizing the control parameters.},

However, current traffic flow prediction models rely on human experience and only consider the advantages of single machine learning model. Therefore, in this work, we propose a multi-layer model based on transformer and deep learning for traffic flow prediction (MTDLTFP). The MTDLTFP model first draws on the idea of transformer model, which uses multiple encoders and decoders to perform feature extraction on the initial traffic data without human experience. In addition, in the prediction stage, the MTDLTFP model using deep learning technology, which input the hidden features into the convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-layer feedforward neural network (MFNN) to obtain the prediction score respectively. The CNN model can captures the correlation information between the hidden features, and the MFNN can captures the nonlinear relationship between the features. Finally, we use a linear model to combine the two prediction scores, which can make the final prediction value take into account the common advantages of both models. Multiple experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTDLTFP model. The experimental results on the $WorkDay$ dataset are as follows, with the RMSE value of 0.191, MAE value of 0.165. The experimental results on the $HoliDay$ dataset are as follows, with RMSE value of 0.227, MAE value of 0.192.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate deployment of autonomous-vehicle-dedicated lanes (AVDLs) is crucial for optimizing transportation system with mixed human-driven and autonomous vehicles. Existing studies mainly focus on matching the capacity and traffic flow volume to maximize throughput under different AV penetration rate, while lane changing scenarios and network geometry impacts were ignored. Therefore, the lateral locations in optimal deployment on expressway cannot be determined. This study developed an analysis framework to jointly optimize the longitudinal and lateral locations of AVDLs on expressways. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model. In the lower level, a lane-level multiclass equilibrium assignment model is built to predict traffic flow distribution among lanes on both longitudinal and lateral locations regarding AVDL deployment plan. In the upper level, a 0–1 integer programming model is established to obtain the optimal deployment plan of the AVDL with minimal total travel time (TTT). Additionally, a problem-specific heuristic-based adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The advantages of the proposed model are validated in North–South Elevated Expressway, Shanghai, China. Results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of TTT reduction. Finally, sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the developed method in reducing the TTT under different headways, demand levels, and OD distributions. The proposed framework enables the optimal deployment of AVDLs regarding both longitudinal and lateral locations in urban expressways containing multiple on- and off-ramps, which supports decision-making for managing expressway with mixed HV and AV traffic flow.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is an important task in the field of automatic driving. Since lane lines usually have complex topologies and exist in various complex scenes (e.g., damaged lanes, severe occlusion, etc.), lane detection remains challenging. In this work, we propose a Polynomial Global Attention Network (PGA-Net) for lane detection, which is an end-to-end model for mining global road information and predicting lanes shape parameter formulas simultaneously. We model lane shape with cubic polynomial function and use the transformer-based DETR model to introduce the context information of lanes and roads to better regress the lane parameters. For polynomial curve modeling, we propose Mean Curvature Loss (MCL) to constrain the curvature of the predicted lanes, thereby enhancing the quality of curve lanes prediction. In addition, we design an improved supervision strategy to eliminate information bias between our parametric prediction methods and the labeling methods of lane datasets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks (TuSimple and LLAMAS) and a most challenging benchmark (CULane), while exhibiting accelerated speed (&gt;140fps on 3090 GPU, 28.9% improvement in average) and lightweight model size (&lt;3M, an averaged 83.7% reduction).

Despite the growing importance of in-vehicle occupant monitoring systems, most existing systems focus on the face or head tracking of occupants, and only a few studies have attempted to detect their poses. In this paper, we present the first in-vehicle environment-specialized framework for the joint estimation of 3D human pose and shape from a single image. To this end, we introduce a new dataset called Human In VEhicles (HIVE), which contains a large collection of synthesized humans with different shapes and poses in vehicle images. HIVE provides RGB and NIR in-vehicle image pairs with ground-truth 2D and 3D pose and shape annotations, respectively. In addition, to exploit the different characteristics of humans in vehicles and unconstrained environments, we present a new pose prior penalizing poses that deviate from in-vehicle poses. The pose prior is derived using a variational autoencoder trained with in-vehicle human pose data. By using the proposed HIVE dataset and pose prior along with an elaborately designed two-stage training procedure, our method exhibits significantly improved pose and shape estimation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for real-world test images captured in vehicles under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction significantly affects the intelligent transportation for digitized urban transportation management and urban traffic control. Considering the complexity and strong non-linearity shown by traffic flow data, the establishment of model regarding spatial correlations as well as time dynamics can remarkably help to accurately predict traffic flow. A lot of current methods are mainly focused on using the historical time series information of observations to extract sequence features. Such forecasting will cause the lack of information and lead to poor accuracy of the forecast results. Although some studies applied spatial-temporal information, but they are not very accurate. In network-based problems, we would consider the constraint of road networks. Specifically, intersection flows, road speed and travel time are related to road networks. Also, they restrict the long-term prediction of traffic flow. For addressing above issues, a graph multi-head attention neural network (GMHANN) is proposed for the purpose of traffic flow prediction. In design, the GMHANN has an encoder-decoder structure. By the encoder, the data are compressed into a hidden space representation, which, relying on the decoder, is reconstructed as output. Furthermore, we put forward a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU) module (AGRU) based on multi-head attention for the effective extraction of the spatial and temporal features exhibited by traffic flow data. Other state-of-the-art methods are employed for evaluating four public datasets, which reveals that our proposed method outperforms others.},

In such environments, the security of initial authentication and handover authentication for moving trains are two important challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, a secure and efficient authentication key agreement scheme is proposed for the SDN-based space-ground integrated railway networks. Specifically, a lightweight mutual authentication mechanism based on the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) is proposed for the initial authentication process, which effectively prevents the unauthorized On-Board Unit (OBU) accessing networks. Then, according to the predictable path, we propose a key generation algorithm based on the hash chain and a fast key distribution mechanism based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which greatly reduce the calculation and communication burden of the key transmission process. On this basis, we adopt a hash-based message authentication code to achieve unified handover authentication in heterogeneous integrated railway networks. The Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic proof and informal security analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide several robust security properties, including forward/backward security, universality, traceability, and resistance against quantum attacks. The performance evaluations show that our scheme outperforms other related schemes in computation cost, communication overhead, and performance under unknown attacks while guaranteeing higher security.},

The proposed filter estimates the vehicle’s orientation, position, linear velocity, and noise covariance. The filter is designed to mimic the nonlinear navigation motion kinematics and is posed on a matrix Lie Group, the extended form of the Special Euclidean Group $\mathbb {SE}_{2}\left ({3}\right)$ . The Lie Group based structure of the proposed filter provides unique and global representation avoiding singularity (a common shortcoming of Euler angles) as well as non-uniqueness (a common limitation of unit-quaternion). Unlike Kalman-type filters, the proposed filter successfully addresses IMU measurement noise considering unknown upper-bounded covariance. Although the navigation estimator is proposed in a continuous form, the discrete version is also presented. Moreover, the unit-quaternion implementation has been provided in the Appendix.

  abstract     = {Retargeting aims to shrink a photo wherein the perceptually prominent regions are appropriately kept. In practice, optimally shrinking a high resolution (HR) aerial photo is a useful tool for smart navigation. Nowadays, vehicle drivers’ path planning is generally guided by an HR aerial photo recommended by a navigation App like Google Maps. Owing to the limited and various resolution of vehicle displays, we have to retarget each original HR aerial photo accordingly, wherein the navigation-aware regions can be well preserved. In practice, HR aerial photo retargeting is non-trivial due to three challenges: 1) the rich number of internal objects and their complex spatial layouts, 2) deriving the region-level semantics from potentially contaminated image labels, and 3) the inefficiency of retargeting each HR aerial photo with millions of pixels. To handle these problems, we propose a novel HR aerial photo retargeting pipeline that can intelligently avoid the negative effects from incorrect image labels. The key is a noise-tolerant hashing algorithm that converts image-level semantics into the hash codes corresponding to different regions, which guides the HR aerial photo shrinking. More specifically, for each HR aerial photo, we extract visually/semantically salient object patches inside it. To explicitly encode their spatial layout, we construct a graphlet by linking the spatially adjacent object patches into a small graph. Subsequently, a binary matrix factorization (MF) is designed to exploit the underlying semantics of these graphlets, wherein three attributes: i) binary hash codes learning, ii) noisy labels refinement, iii) deep image-level semantics, are collaboratively encoded. Such binary MF can be solved iteratively and each graphlet is subsequently converted into the binary hash codes. Finally, the hash codes corresponding to graphlets within each HR aerial photo are utilized to learn a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that optimizes the HR aerial photo retargeting. During the experimental validation, we compiled a smart navigation dataset including 132743 planned paths annotated from 10132 HR aerial photos, based on which comparative study has demonstrated the superiority of our method.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for domain adaptation to enhance the performance of pedestrian detection based solely on thermal images. Our proposed approach involves several stages. Firstly, we use both thermal and visible images as input during the training phase. Secondly, we leverage a thermal-to-visible hallucination network to generate feature maps that are similar to those generated by the visible branch. Finally, we design a transformer-based multi-modal fusion module to integrate the hallucinated visible and thermal information more effectively. The thermal-to-visible hallucination network acts as domain adaptation, allowing us to obtain pseudo-visual and thermal features using solely thermal input.

  abstract     = {Indoor navigation and positioning services for pedestrians are challenging because of the lack of satellite signals and the unpredictability of pedestrian motion. The inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm can provide continuous position estimation for individual pedestrians. However, the accumulation of errors leads to inaccurate pedestrian position results. Radio signals such as ultra-wideband (UWB) can range between pedestrians and anchors and provide high-precision positioning information; nonetheless, radio positioning requires infrastructure deployment and maintenance in indoor environments, thus limiting the popularization and implementation of these technologies. In this paper, a neural network aided factor graph optimization (NN-FGO) method was proposed for collaborative pedestrian navigation (CPN). It integrates IMU and UWB sensors to implement PDR for individual pedestrians and CPN for the Ad-Hoc network, and it is infrastructure-free since all the sensors are wearable. For a small or sparse network, ranging constraints will be insufficient to implement an acceptable CPN. A neural network model was suggested for human activity recognition and position loopback detection, which provide virtual constraints for pedestrians. For the heterogeneous problem caused by multiple collaborative signals and constraints, FGO was employed to solve the motion states of multi-pedestrians and multi-epochs. The real experimental results revealed that NN-FGO can provide 92% accuracy in activity classification. Compared with the extended Kalman filter based CPN, the average position error decreased by 19.6% and 16.0% with triangular and parallel straight geometries, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Flight safety is a key issue in the aviation industry. Recently, with the prevalence of flight data recording systems, some deep learning-based studies have been devoted to predicting safety incidents based on flight data. However, these studies, although they exhibit higher prediction accuracy, have largely neglected the interpretability analysis of safety incidents which is of great concern to airlines and pilots. To address this issue, we define flight safety prediction as a multiscale time series classification problem and propose an interpretable model named IMTCN to provide both accurate predictions and high interpretability of flight safety. First, multiple temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) are utilized to capture local representations and long effective histories from multivariate flight data. Because different flight parameters are collected with diverse sampling frequencies, multiple TCNs are used to handle these parameters separately. Then, we creatively adapt the class activation mapping (CAM) method, which has been used for interpretation in image classification, and combine it with the TCN to provide flight data interpretability. The established model can pinpoint key flight parameters and corresponding moments that contribute most to safety incidents. Experimental results on a real-world dataset with 37,943 Airbus A320 aircraft flights show that our model outperforms the baselines on the task of exceedance classification and prediction 2 seconds and 4 seconds in advance, and case studies demonstrate its superb interpretability for flight safety analysis.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent vehicles collect and distribute the data to other vehicles and Roadside Units (RSU), which ultimately strengthens the vehicular services in the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). In order to protect against a variety of potential security threats, the VANET system needs a proper authentication mechanism, which requires more computational overheads and cannot perform better, when a cluster of vehicles sends the messages simultaneously. This paper aims to design a decentralized blockchain-based batch authentication protocol using Elliptic Curve Cryptography, where RSU authenticates the group of vehicles together. Moreover. our protocol also supports the verification of both individual messages (signature) generated by the vehicle and batch signature. We have used the Scyther security tool to verify our protocol and found that the protocol is safe and secure. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves more functionality and security compared to relevant schemes. The security analysis confirms that the proposed scheme is secure against all applicable attacks. Moreover, the ethereum platform simulates the proposed scheme, showing its effectiveness and confirming that it is feasible to deploy and execute transactions in real networks.},

  abstract     = {Multi-intersection traffic signal control (TSC) is an active research field in multi-agent systems, where traffic signals for each intersection, controlled by an agent, must coordinate to optimize traffic flow. To encourage global coordination, previous work partitions the traffic network into several regions and learns policies for agents in a feudal structure. However, static network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which changes frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we partition the network into several regions according to the dynamic traffic flow over time. To do this, we propose two approaches: one is directly to use graphic neural network (GNN) to generate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we design a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given by the dynamic network partition. Finally, we use a feudal hierarchy to manage agents in each partition and promote global cooperation. By doing so, agents are able to adapt to the traffic flow as required in practice. We empirically evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, widely used in the literature. The experimental results confirm that our method achieved better performance both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, in terms of average travel time and queue length, than several leading TSC baselines.},

  abstract     = {This paper jointly optimizes the zoning, scheduling, and pricing of a zonal-based flexible bus service (ZBFBS). ZBFBS categorizes and groups the origin-destination (OD) pairs of ride requests by geographical zones to provide door-to-door transit services while considering dynamic stochastic elastic demand volume, stochastic ride request locations, and time window constraints. The integrated problem can be formulated in two ways, either by designing the bus service routing in response to the realized demand, referred to as the demand-responsive method, or by a stochastic programming approach that accounts for the demand distribution. The former first clusters the realized requests into zones through the k-means algorithm, and then solves the joint vehicle scheduling and passenger assignment problem. As for the latter, a bi-level framework is proposed: the upper level optimizes the zoning, and the lower level maximizes the profit by scheduling and pricing the ZBFBS service. For this purpose, hexagonal and rectangular zonings are considered, whose positions and dimensions are optimized by a line search algorithm, with a deterministic approximation approach to significantly reduce the solution time. This framework is applied to a scenario based on actual ride-hailing data in Chengdu, China. The results demonstrate the benefit of the bi-level framework in producing an optimal zonal design. Also, the proposed bi-level stochastic zonal design framework outperforms the demand-responsive method in a tight planning time.},

  abstract     = {Pixel-level road crack detection has always been a challenging task in intelligent transportation systems. Due to the external environments, such as weather, light, and other factors, pavement cracks often present low contrast, poor continuity, and different sizes in length and width. However, most of the existing studies pay less attention to crack data under different situations. Meanwhile, recent algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have promoted the development of cutting-edge models for crack detection. Nevertheless, they usually focus on complex models for good performance, but ignore detection efficiency in practical applications. In this article, to address the first issue, we collected two new databases (i.e. Rain365 and Sun520) captured on rainy and sunny days respectively, which enrich the data of the open source community. For the second issue, we reconsider how to improve detection efficiency with excellent performance, and then propose our lightweight encoder-decoder architecture termed CarNet. Specifically, we introduce a novel olive-shaped structure for the encoder network, a lightweight multi-scale block and a new up-sampling method in the decoder network. Numerous experiments show that our model can better balance detection performance and efficiency compared with previous models. Especially, on the Sun520 dataset, our CarNet significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance with ODS F-score from 0.488 to 0.514. Meanwhile, it does so with an improved detection speed (104 frames per second) which is orders of magnitude faster than some recent DCNNs-based algorithms specially designed for crack detection.},

A novel interpretable nonlinear decoupling and calibration approach to WFT is presented. A physical interpretable prime-error framework is developed such that the linear prime part accounts for most force-voltage responses while the nonlinear error part accounts for the gross error deviation. The conventional least-square decoupling is improved with the delicate nonlinear error modeling using a polynomial base module and a hyperbolic activation function. The developed framework is proved to be mathematically solvable and physically feasible by a two-step calibration scheme. A two-axis WFT is tested and compared with the proposed interpretable nonlinear decoupling model (IND), the least-square-based method (LSM), and the error-based neural network model (eNN). Results demonstrate that the proposed IND provides an accurate, practical, and effective scheme for modeling and calibrating WFTs and maintains a good balance among accuracy, generalization ability, and computational efficiency for real applications.},

With the introduction of novel neuromorphic vision sensors, it is now possible to accurately localize a vehicle even under complex environmental conditions, leading to an improved and safer driving experience. In this paper, we propose MA-VIED, a large-scale driving dataset that collects race track-like loops, maneuvers, and standard driving scenarios, all bundled in a rich sensory dataset. MA-VIED provides highly accurate IMU data, standard and event camera streams, and RTK position data from a dual GPS antenna, both of which are hardware-synchronized with all cameras and IMU data. In addition, we collect accurate wheel odometry data and other data from the vehicle’s CAN bus. The dataset contains 13 sequences collected in urban, suburban, and racetrack-like environments with varying lighting conditions and driving dynamics. We provide ground-truth RTK data for algorithms evaluation and the calibration sequences for both IMU and cameras. We then present three tests to demonstrate how MA-VIED can be suitable for monocular VIO applications, using state-of-the-art VIO algorithms and an EKF-based sensor fusion solution. The experimental results show that MA-VIED can support the development and prototyping of novel automotive-oriented frame and event-based monocular VIO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Situational awareness based on the data collected by the vehicle perception sensors (i.e. LiDAR, RADAR, camera and ultrasonic sensors) is key for achieving assisted and automated driving functions in a safe and reliable way. However, the data rates generated by the sensor suite are difficult to support over traditional wired data communication networks on the vehicle, hence there is an interest in techniques that reduce the amount of sensor data to be transmitted without losing key information or introducing unacceptable delays. These techniques must be analysed in combination with the consumer of the data, which will most likely be a machine learning algorithm based on deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper we demonstrate that by compression tuning the DNNs (i.e. transfer learning by re-training with compressed data) the DNN average precision and recall can significantly improve when uncompressed and compressed data are transmitted. This improvement is achieved independently from the compression standard used for compression-training (i.e. AVC and HEVC), and also when training and transmitted data use the same compression standard or different compression standards. Furthermore, the performance of the DNNs is stable when transmitting data with increasing lossy compression rate, up to a compression ratio of approximately 160:1; above this value the performance starts to degrade. This work paves the way for the use of compressed sensor data in automated driving in combination with the optimisation of compression-tuned DNNs.},

So far, deep learning-based methods have attained significant improvements on the TPD task, but oftentimes fail in urban mixed traffic due to the lack of relevant datasets and suitable detectors. In this study, we propose a large and detailed dataset named SEU_PML specialized for monitoring-based TPD in urban mixed traffic. This dataset contains a total of 270,684 objects annotated with 2D bounding box and covers 13 sub-categories, having (i) high-resolution images (from $1920\times 1080$ to $4096\times 2160$ pixels), (ii) high-quality annotation (annotation accuracy reaches 98%), and (iii) rich traffic scenarios covering diverse traffic scenes as well as different weather and illumination conditions. The mixed traffic along with high-quality annotation bring about a variety of small objects. To further address the issue on small object detection, we propose a novel detector named YOLO SOD, which embeds a super-resolution feature extraction module and uses knowledge distillation to learn the knowledge how the detector with high-resolution inputs perceives small objects. Moreover, a novel loss function named S-IoU is designed to enable YOLO SOD to focus more on small objects. Experimental results show that (1) the YOLO SOD detector has an increased mAP of 1.58% and operates approximately four times faster when compared to a state-of-art detector; (2) the detectors trained on the SEU_PML dataset have a strong transferability and could be well applied to traffic participant detection in urban mixed traffic.

Based on this CV technology, we propose a cooperative multiple EMV priority model in which the speed, acceleration, and lane changing actions of both the EMVs and surrounding ordinary vehicles (OVs) are set as decision variables. This proposed model is rigorously formulated in integer linear programming to maximize the EMV traffic efficiency and find a trade-off between the interference with normal traffic flows and the smoothness of the EMV driving trajectories. Two customized algorithms are developed to reduce the number of decision variables and constraints to obtain the better feasible solution in an acceptable computational time. A numerical experiment based on real-world data is proposed to further verify the utility and effectiveness of the aforementioned mathematical model. The customized algorithms achieve near-exact solutions with significantly faster computation compared to the benchmark solver.

According to well-known railway standards, namely IEEE 1474, IEC 61508, and EN 50128, CBTC systems should satisfy acceptable safety, security, and reliability levels. However, due to their inherent low-power features, prevalent CBTC systems cannot meet those levels perfectly in front of co-band interferences or attackers. Thus, a safety function is required which can be implemented without consuming much energy and restricted resources of CBTC systems. In this paper, the DSSS technique is based on a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). Comprehensive time-domain analysis shows how this safety function enhances the safety, security, and reliability of CBTC systems concerning the standards mentioned above. It is proved that any inauthentic signal turns into a Gaussian term with significantly mitigated power at the output of the CBTC receiver. It is also established how to determine appropriate communications parameters based on railway properties. The proposed scheme’s failure rate performance is compared with that of similar works. Additionally, computer simulations and experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed safety function.},

To ensure driving safety while using the level 2 automated driving systems in various traffic conditions, it is an essential issue to clarify the influences of the level 2 automated driving on driver behaviors. Previous studies normally focused on drivers’ reactions to emergency events while using level 2 automated driving. However, it is still unclear that how will drivers interact with the level 2 automated driving systems during the periods when no emergency event occurs. Therefore, a driving simulator experiment was performed, and the differences in driver behaviors, especially eye-gaze behaviors, under level 2 automated driving and manual driving were analyzed. Meanwhile, to simulate non-driving related tasks that may occur in real driving environment, a visual task, Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT), was applied in the experiment. It was observed that the percentage of gaze that fell within the road center area and speedometer significantly decreased, and the gaze time to the left and right mirrors, and the SuRT display significantly increased during level 2 automated driving. Meanwhile, the eyelid closure time were significant longer and the subjective evaluation scores of attention to front and surroundings were significant lower while applying level 2 automated driving. The results indicated that drivers’ attention levels, especially for the front areas, might be significantly reduced during level 2 automated driving, compared to that of manual driving.},

  abstract     = {Fast detection of fasteners is important to improve the efficiency of railroad maintenance. However, this task remains challenging due to the limited computing resources of inspection system. To solve the challenge, a new lightweight detection network Op-YOLOv4-tiny is proposed in this paper. The proposed network firstly uses ResBlock-N modules to replace the CSPBlock modules in YOLOv4-tiny to reduce the computation complexity. Then, a large scale feature map ( $52\times 52$ ) is added to obtain more features of fasteners to improve the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on the captured railway and subway track images and the results show that Op-YOLOv4-tiny has good performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed. In detail, the detection speed and accuracy reach 408 FPS and 96.8%, respectively. In addition, compared with other detection networks and state-of-the-arts, it achieves the better performance. Thus, our proposed Op-YOLOv4-tiny is with some potential industrial application value for fast detection of fasteners.},

  abstract     = {Navigating through roadworks represents one of the main sources of safety risk for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) due to the altered road layouts. The built-in base maps do not normally reflect these changes, causing CAVs to experience difficulties in sensing and trajectory generation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to evaluate different collision-free trajectory generation for CAVs at roadworks to improve safety and traffic performance. Trajectory generation algorithms using lane-level dynamic maps were examined for: 1) CAVs rely on data from in-vehicle sensor only; and 2) CAVs receive additional information via a Smart Traffic Cone (STC) in advance regarding roadwork configurations. Experiments were conducted at a controlled motorway facility operated by National Highways (England) using a vehicle instrumented with a suite of sensors. Schematics of the roadworks scenario were translated into an integrated simulation platform consisting of a traffic microsimulation (VISSIM) to simulate traffic dynamics and a sub-microscopic simulator (PreScan) capable of simulating vehicle autonomy and connectivity. Results indicate that traffic conflicts and delays decrease by 40% and 3% respectively when CAVs receive additional information in advance (i.e., Scenario 2) compared to the other scenario. These findings would assist road network operators in developing ‘CAV-enabled roadworks’ and vehicle manufacturers in designing a vehicle-based ‘roadworks assist’ system.},

  abstract     = {Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUs’ keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.},

  abstract     = {Single traffic image deraining technology based on deep learning is a vital branch of image preprocessing, which is of great help to intelligent monitoring systems and driving navigation system. It is well understood that established deraining methods are derived based on one specific imaging model, neglecting the underlying correlations between different weather models and thereby limiting the applicability of these standard methods in real scenarios. To ameliorate this issue, in this work, we first explore the inherent relationship between a rain model and the haze one established up to date. We discover that these two models experience similar degradations in the low-frequency components (i.e., similarity) but diverse degradations in the high-frequency areas (i.e., diversity). Based on these observations, we develop a Similarity-Diversity model to describe these characteristics. Afterwards, we introduce a novel deep neural network to restore the rain-free background embedding the similarity-diversity model, namely deep similarity-diversity network (DSDNet). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate our proposed method that outperforms the other state of the art deraining techniques. On the other hand, we deploy the proposed algorithm with Google Vision API for object recognition, which also obtains satisfactory results both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a distributed and extensible cross-region vehicle authentication scheme with the reputation for improving the security and efficiency of cross-region vehicle authentication. The existing authentication schemes demonstrate the following drawbacks: 1) Each vehicle is preloaded with the same system private key, which may be leaked so that the entire system would be destroyed; 2) Other schemes rely on trusted authority to aid in selecting some cluster head nodes; 3) The existing cross-region authentication schemes are not flexible and scalable since they depend on the infrastructure fixed on the roadside. With the proposed scheme, each vehicle stores a long-term private key that is different from those of other vehicles, thereby avoiding a system crash when destroying a vehicle. When the cross-region vehicle enters a new region, it can verify the reputation value of the surrounding vehicles to select the edge computing vehicle. The formal security proof shows that the proposed scheme has adequate security under the real-or-random model. The performance evaluation of our scheme with several related schemes reveals that it generates relatively low computation and communication overhead, is more robust, and achieves minimum packet loss ratio and delay.},

As automated driving technology continues to advance, vehicles are becoming increasingly capable of navigating driving environments with the assistance of optoelectronic sensing systems. Nevertheless, variable operating conditions, such as weather and driver behavior, can compromise driving safety by reducing the robustness of some systems. To improve the safety of automated vehicles, as well as the trust between humans and vehicle automation, this review discusses existing literature on the design and application of optoelectronic sensing in modern automobiles. Recent advancements in optoelectronics have been partly attributed to human ingenuity and the recent application of artificial intelligence to optimize sensor performance parameters. As a major contribution, we consider how artificial intelligence can be used to develop next-generation sensing systems for automated driving applications. Consideration is also given to research avenues with the potential to expand these applications. Based on a discussion of current challenges in optoelectronic sensor development, along with our recommendations to address these challenges, we draw conclusions on the state-of-the-art and the future of optoelectronic sensing.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are considered a promising solution for reducing emissions caused by the transportation sector. An energy management strategy (EMS) is undeniably essential in increasing hydrogen economy, component lifetime, and driving range. While the existing EMSs provide a range of performance levels, they suffer from significant shortcomings in robustness, durability, and adaptability, which prohibit the FCV from reaching its full potential in the vehicle industry. After introducing the fundamental EMS problem, this review article provides a detailed description of the FCV powertrain system modeling, including typical modeling, degradation modeling, and thermal modeling, for designing an EMS. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of various EMS evolutions, including rule-based and optimization-based, is carried out, along with a thorough review of the recent advances. Unlike similar studies, this paper mainly highlights the significance of the latest contributions, such as advanced control theories, optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), and multi-stack fuel cell systems (MFCSs). Afterward, the verification methods of EMSs are classified and summarized. Ultimately, this work illuminates future research directions and prospects from multi-disciplinary standpoints for the first time. The overarching goal of this work is to stimulate more innovative thoughts and solutions for improving the operational performance, efficiency, and safety of FCV powertrains.},
