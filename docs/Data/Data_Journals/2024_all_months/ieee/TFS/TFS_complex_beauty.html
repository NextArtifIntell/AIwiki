  abstract     = {The use of the Choquet integral in multicriteria decision making problems has gained attention in the last two decades. Despite of its usefulness, there is the issue of how to define the Choquet integral parameters, called capacity coefficients, specially the ones associated with coalitions of criteria. A possible approach to address this issue is based on unsupervised learning, which aims to define such parameters with the goal of mitigating undesirable effects provided by intercriteria relations. However, current unsupervised approaches present some drawbacks, as there is no guarantee that the parameters are equally prioritized in the learning procedure. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised capacity identification approach which ensures a fair learning for all parameters. Moreover, in comparison with the existing methods, our proposal is less complex in terms of optimization, as it is based on a linear formulation. Experimental results in both synthetic and real datasets attest the applicability of our proposal.},

Initially, a fuzzy model is introduced to capture the dynamics of the original nonlinear MASs. Subsequently, a full-order singularly perturbed system is developed to model the TTS phenomenon in the nonlinear MASs. Following this, the design of controllers to realize formation control of nonlinear MASs is converted into solving a set of discounted algebraic Riccati equations. To relax the restriction of system dynamic information, a novel off-policy integral reinforcement learning scheme is adopted to design the controllers online.

Therefore, a suitable filtering method is required to lessen the noise while preserving the image features (edges, corners, etc.). This article presents the efficient type-2 fuzzy weighted mean filter with an adaptive threshold to remove the impulse noise. The present filter has two primary steps. The first step categorizes images as lightly, medium, and heavily corrupted based on an adaptive threshold by comparing the maximum absolute luminance difference of processed pixels with the upper and lower membership function of the type-2 fuzzy identifier. The second step eliminates corrupted pixels by computing the appropriate weight using Gaussian membership functions with the mean and variance of the uncorrupted pixels in the filter window. The variance of detection and denoising steps are estimated using the kernel density estimate of the respective filter window. Simulation results vividly show that the obtained denoised images preserve image features, i.e., edges, corners, and other sharp structures, compared with different filtering methods.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent detection techniques for online spamming have been a hot concern in academia. Although much technical progress has been achieved in recent years, two aspects of challenges are still confronted by scholars. For one thing, spamming activities are accompanied by multisource attributes, such as behaviors and semantics. For another, spamming is a cross-platform activity, where multiple platforms are exploited simultaneously to expand the influential reach. The above circumstances actually make spamming detection tend to become a fuzzy detection task. Existing works typically consider one-sided attribute and lack cross-platform multifeature fusion, which limiting the effectiveness of detection. To handle the current challenges, this article proposes a cross-field deep learning-based fuzzy spamming detection approach via the collaboration of behavior modeling and sentiment analysis. First of all, a cross-field deep learning-based technical framework is put forward to implement multisource feature fusion from mixed context. It first extracts multisource features from single fields and then integrates them into a hybrid-field feature space. In addition, three cross-field datasets based on real-world social network datasets are constructed, and utilized in the evaluation of our proposed approach. The findings demonstrate that our proposal improves the detection accuracy by about 7% to 12%, in comparison to five other baseline approaches.},

By combining the properties of the product inference engine and set theory, we develop a membership function-dependent $H_{\infty }$ index, enhancing disturbance suppression by assigning diverse weights to various subsystem $H_{\infty }$ indices. An advanced event-triggered mechanism, utilizing dynamic memory variables, is proposed to expand the threshold and conserve resources, outperforming conventional dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (DETM). Theoretical analysis indicates that the dynamic memory event-triggered mechanism (DMETM) offers a more extensive event-triggered interval than the conventional memoryless DETM. Furthermore, in the proposed DMETM, a system-related dynamic variable is designed to replace the corresponding constant coefficient, increasing design flexibility and relaxing the design constraints of current state-of-the-art DETMs. Specifically, by constructing a monotonic nonincreasing bounded function, the system information is successfully integrated into the design of the dynamic coefficient. This design allows the threshold of the event-triggered condition to be adjusted more flexibly according to the system&#39;s operational status, thereby improving the practicality of the scheme in real-world applications. Besides, Zeno behavior is avoided. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme is verified by an example.},

This study introduces a novel concept of higher order fuzzy memberships that quantify the membership grades of motifs to crisp higher order communities, thereby revealing partial community affiliations. Furthermore, we utilize higher order fuzzy memberships to enhance HCD via a general framework called fuzzy memberships-assisted motif-based evolutionary modularity. On the one hand, a fuzzy membership-based neighbor community modification strategy is designed to correct misassigned bridge nodes, thereby improving partition quality. On the other hand, a fuzzy membership-based local community merging strategy is proposed to combine excessively fragmented communities, enhancing local search ability.

Specifically, we design a time series trend extraction and representation learning module based on the interval fuzzy granules and the Cramer decomposition theorem in the first phase. Next, we formulate the interval information granules&#39; time series forecasting as a DIFCM. In particular, we employ PM $_{2.5}$ as a benchmark to validate the performance of the proposed DE-DIFCM.

It is worth noting that the slope of the input dead zone is uncertain (time-varying/fuzzy). Therefore, a suitable hierarchical fuzzy logic system (HFLS) is designed to compensate for uncertain dead zones while significantly reducing the number of fuzzy rules. In addition, a dynamic event-based mechanism (DEBM) is proposed, which not only determines when to update the control law of the upper-level fuzzy system, but also when to update the parameters of the lower-level fuzzy controller. Moreover, this strategy can better tolerate interference while achieving the specified transient and steady-state performance of the system, and greatly save computing/communication resources. Furthermore, a Lyapunov function is designed to prove the stability of the system and eliminate the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, simulations are conducted using a quadcopter under two uncertain dead zone conditions to verify the effectiveness of the method.},

The stochastic intervals between samples are governed by a Markov chain, and the samples are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks during network transmission. Moreover, a novel SCP is developed utilizing sojourn probability and residence time information, enhancing communication efficiency. Subsequently, a suitable sliding mode control law is crafted based on the observed data, providing a sufficient condition for the mean square exponentially ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system.

Fuzzy granular rules, also to be a kind of fuzzy classification rules, can be induced by fuzzy information granules. It has been acknowledged that one of the important criteria for evaluating the quality of information granules comes from the principle of justifiable granularity. Unfortunately, the existing methods for extracting fuzzy granular rules fail to take into account the principle of justifiable granularity. In view of the advantages of the justifiable granularity principle in classifying knowledge, we propose in this article a new method of extracting fuzzy granular rules using the justifiable granularity principle and a fusion strategy and establish a fuzzy granular rule-based classifier (FGRBC). Specifically, the justifiability of fuzzy granules is first presented according to both coverage and specificity of fuzzy granules, on which a rule extraction method is formulated to obtain a set of fuzzy granular rules. Furthermore, a fusion strategy is put forward to generate a set of fused rules. Then, the two sets of rules are combined and attribute reduction is performed on the combined rule set. Finally, the reduced combined rule set is employed to construct FGRBC. Moreover, performance of FGRBC is evaluated by numerical experiments and the results show that FGRBC is of satisfactory classification ability.},

To address this issue, this article generalizes the concept of shear mapping to the PPC approach of stochastic MASs. Subsequently, a reference performance function is designed to guide the evolution trend of bipartite consensus errors, which effectively decreases the overshoot of bipartite consensus errors. Moreover, a scaling function is designed to remove the feasibility conditions in the existing PPC results. The proposed approach ensures that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobally ultimately uniformly bounded in probability.

  abstract     = {The perturbations in model parameters of hypersonic flight vehicles (HFVs) are highly likely to induce fluctuations in control error, which can potentially render the existing prescribed performance control (PPC) singular and pose a threat to flight safety. Therefore, our objective is to propose an adaptive fuzzy safety control protocol for HFVs that aims to achieve adaptable prescribed behaviors in the presence of parameter perturbations. To accomplish this, we initially develop a novel error-sensing system for timely detection and forecasting of error fluctuations. Building upon this foundation, we further define an adjustment mechanism that appropriately adjusts the upper envelope upward and the lower envelope downward at regular intervals. In contrast to existing fixed PPC approaches, the proposed sensing and adjustment mechanism enables both velocity and altitude tracking errors to satisfy a new type of adaptable prescribed qualities, thereby ensuring safe flight control of HFVs. In addition, we explore low-computational-burden fuzzy approximation techniques that minimize the required online adaptive parameters while guaranteeing excellent real-time control performance. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are directed graphs with multiple nodes, rendering them well-suited for tackling the challenges of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. However, the conventional FCMs encounter obstacles in long-term forecasting, primarily due to the cumulated errors arising from iterative one-step forecasting. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements on fuzzy information granulation, this article introduces a novel trend fuzzy granulation-based three-layer FCM model that operates at a granular level, effectively addressing abovementioned obstacles. This model leverages an optimization algorithm to determine the optimal number of granules for granulating an MTS into a granular time series (GTS), enabling the simultaneous consideration of trend information across various dimensions of the given MTS. Subsequently, viewing the obtained GTS as a complex structured MTS, a novel three-layer FCM architecture is devised. This FCM comprises a layer-3 FCM for extracting spatial relationships among parameters, a layer-2 FCM for extracting spatial relationships among variables, and a layer-1 FCM for capturing temporal relationships. By embedding the layer-3 FCM into the nodes of the layer-2 FCM and further embedding the layer-2 FCM into the nodes of the layer-1 FCM, the three-layer FCM can effectively capture and reflect temporal and spatial relationships while treating each complex element of the obtained GTS as a cohesive entity during forecasting. By constructing the three-layer FCM-based model at a granular level for MTS, the proposed approach mitigates accumulated errors and enhance the ability to forecast future trends with superior accuracy.},

To guarantee the clean data for training accuracy, various deep learning-based adversarial attack detection techniques have been proposed. These crisp set-based detection methods directly determine whether an image is clean or attacked, while, calculating the loss is nondifferentiable and hinders training through normal back-propagation. Motivated by the recent success in fuzzy systems, in this work, we present an attack detection method to further improve detection performance, which is suitable for any pretrained neural network classifier. Subsequently, the fuzzification network is used to obtain feature maps to produce fuzzy sets of difference degree between clean and attacked images. The fuzzy rules control the intelligence that determines the detection boundaries. Different from previous fuzzy systems, we propose a fuzzy mean-intelligence mechanism with new support and confidence functions to improve fuzzy rule&#39;s quality. In the defuzzification layer, the fuzzy prediction from the intelligence is mapped back into the crisp model predictions for images. The loss between the prediction and label controls the rules to train the fuzzy detector. We show that the fuzzy rule-based network learns rich feature information than binary outputs and offer to obtain an overall performance gain. Experiment results show that compared to various benchmark fuzzy systems and adversarial attack detection methods, our fuzzy detector achieves better detection performance over a wide range of images.},

  abstract     = {Causal discovery based on observational data is important for deciphering the causal mechanism behind complex systems. However, the effectiveness of existing causal discovery methods is limited due to inferior prior knowledge, domain inconsistencies, and the challenges of high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes. To address this gap, we propose a novel weakly supervised fuzzy knowledge and data co-driven causal discovery method named KEEL. KEEL introduces a fuzzy causal knowledge schema to encapsulate diverse types of fuzzy knowledge, and forms corresponding weakened constraints. This schema not only lessens the dependency on expertise but also allows various types of limited and error-prone fuzzy knowledge to guide causal discovery. It can enhance the generalization and robustness of causal discovery, especially in high-dimensional and small-sample scenarios. In addition, we integrate the extended linear causal model into KEEL for dealing with the multi-distribution and incomplete data. Extensive experiments with different datasets demonstrate the superiority of KEEL over several state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness and efficiency. The effectiveness of KEEL is also verified in limited real protein signal transduction process data, with the better performance than benchmark methods. In summary, KEEL is effective to tackle the causal discovery tasks with higher accuracy while alleviating the requirement for extensive domain expertise.},

Furthermore, event-triggered mechanism is introduced to update the fuzzy parameters of the ETM-PTFZNN orderly, which greatly alleviates the calculation burden of the ETM-PTFZNN.

The system dynamics are constructed to describe the nonlinear signed networks via the fuzzy logic and the short-memory performance. Notably, this article represents the first attempt to design the ETIC for fractional-order networks in the sense of exponential convergence. This approach avoids the constantly updating states of IC and the uninterrupted input of ETC. By employing the Lyapunov method, some sufficient conditions for the synchronization of the considered networks are obtained. In addition, the Zeno phenomenon is eliminated so that the infimum of interval length is positive, which ensures the feasibility of the designed controller. Finally, two numerical experiment examples of the fractional-order Chua&#39;s circuits model and the fractional-order power system without load disturbance are carried on to illustrate the effectiveness and practicability of our theoretical analysis.},

It considers concepts as the basic computing units, emphasizing the representation of knowledge through extent–intent pairs. Some studies explore CCL models on single view data, with a particular focus on fuzzy CCL models, demonstrating notable performance in classification tasks. However, data are always obtained from multiple views in reality, necessitating the crucial task of representing and integrating concepts across multiple views. Hence, this article proposes a novel multi-view fuzzy concept-cognitive learning (MVFCCL) model to address this issue. The process of multiview fuzzy concept cognition is first introduced to learn fuzzy concepts from each view. Specifically, the process provides an intraview fusion method to reconstruct fuzzy attributes by modeling both high-order information and correlation information, thereby enhancing the conceptual representation ability of fuzzy concepts. Then, the multiview fuzzy concept recognition process is established to predict new objects decision attributes by considering their similarity to the multiview fuzzy concept space. Finally, some experiments are conducted to examine the effectiveness of MVFCCL, including comparisons with other methods and ablation experiments for validating the contributions of each step. Experimental results show that the proposed MVFCCL can effectively represent and fuse knowledge from multiview data via fuzzy concepts.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many post hoc graph neural network (GNN) explanation methods have been explored to uncover GNNs&#39; predictive behaviors by analyzing the embeddings produced by the GNN models. However, these methods suffer from explanation ambiguity inherent in learned graph embeddings because aggregation-based embeddings can lead to the loss of unique identifiers for individual graph components and, thus, allow noncausal nodes that are adjacent to true causal patterns to unintentionally embody causal information in their embeddings, hindering the explanations from faithfully representing the true insights of GNNs&#39; predictive reasoning. In this article, we present an embedding ambiguity-sensitive GNN explanation framework (EAGX). EAGX can effectively mitigate the impact of embedding-induced explanation ambiguity by creating edges&#39; ambiguity feature extractor, exploring edges&#39; predictive relevance, and integrating them into the explanation process, thereby capturing each graph component&#39;s contribution to the predictions. Specifically, we first propose a centroid-constrained fuzzy c-means algorithm to construct an ambiguity feature extractor. Then, we leverage the ambiguity features for edges to develop the ambiguity-based edge attribution module for assigning a prediction relevance score to each edge. Finally, instead of focusing only on the edges with high influence to the GNN prediction, we introduce a joint optimization strategy to refine the learning process of our edge attribution module, empowering EAGX to capture the subtle interplay of both causal and noncausal subgraphs on model predictions, which further improve the explainability of GNN predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that EAGX outperforms the leading explainers on most evaluation metrics, underscoring its effectiveness in generating reliable and precise explanations for GNNs.},

First, the nonlinear part is approximated by a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model and the hybrid delay is divided into two regions, thus establishing a T–S fuzzy LFC model with hybrid delays. Then, based on switched system theory, a delay-dependent weighted $H_\infty$ performance analysis criterion for LFC system is proposed, giving the necessary conditions to achieve a certain robustness of the system against disturbances. On this basis, a controller design method is proposed to ensure the system have the optimal level of disturbance rejection under the designed controller. Finally, case studies based on single-area and three-area LFC demonstrate that, compared with previous methods, the proposed method can obtain a larger allowable upper bound of delays and better $H_\infty$ performance estimation. Based on this, the designed controller enhances the robust performance of LFC, thereby ensuring the stable operation of power systems under nonlinearities and hybrid delays.},

In addition, an enhanced triggering algorithm is further designed to eliminate continuous monitoring of neighbors&#39; and its own states. Consequently, different from the existing event-based control strategy, the IEBC algorithms proposed herein can further reduce communication energy consumption. To handle the nonlinear uncertainties in MASs, fuzzy logic systems are utilized, enhancing the algorithm to tackle more general problems. Considering the problem of unknown control directions, a controller employing Nussbaum-type functions is formulated. Moreover, the fixed-time consensus control algorithm is incorporated, and the estimation of the convergence time is not reliant on the initial states.

In control design, the stochastic Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation with unknown system dynamics is learned using the integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. Combining IRL algorithm and critic fuzzy logic systems, a distributed adaptive optimal consensus control strategy is designed based on dynamic event-triggered mechanism. By employing the topology-dependent Lyapunov function and the average dwell-time method in the stability analysis, it is proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, Zeno behavior can be avoided and the closed-loop system is in Nash equilibrium.

  abstract     = {This article considers the predefined-time composite adaptive attitude control problem for nonlinear multiple six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with external disturbance. The multiple six-rotor UAVs considered are regarded as nonlinear multiagent systems, and each subsystem has multiple inputs. Via the backstepping recursive algorithm, a valid adaptive predefined-time control method is proposed by combining fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and predefined-time theory. FLSs are utilized to handle unknown nonlinearity and unmodeled parts in attitude systems. By constructing a serial-parallel estimation model, the accuracy of approximating the unknown functions is ameliorated. Moreover, taking into account the prediction error of the serial-parallel estimation model, a novel composite adaptive fuzzy control scheme is developed. Unlike some existing control schemes for multi-UAVs, the developed control scheme allows one to shun the chattering phenomenon and ameliorate the approximation performance. The developed controller assures that all signals of the multiple six-rotor UAV attitude systems are bounded and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin within an expected settling time. Eventually, with the help of simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme was illustrated.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection serves as a fundamental technique in machine learning and data analysis, playing a crucial role in extracting valuable features from large-scale and high-dimensional datasets that may contain irrelevant features. To enhance the performance of feature selection, regularizers like ${\ell _{1}}$ -norm or ${\ell _{2,1}}$ -norm are commonly utilized to encourage sparsity. Nonetheless, these traditional regularization techniques encounter certain challenges. When correlations exist among features, the sparsity-driven regularization can unfairly diminish weights of correlated features to zero, thus ignoring the feature correlations and lacking group sparsity properties. While a straightforward combination of ${\ell _{1}}$ -norm and ${\ell _{2}}$ -norm can uncover feature correlations, it lacks adaptability and effectively balancing sparsity and correlation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel matrix-based regularization term, called a fuzzy elastic net, in the unsupervised feature selection model. Our model is founded on principal component analysis, a well-established dimensionality reduction technique adept at finding subspaces that retain most information from raw data. The model is enhanced by a fuzzy elastic net, which promotes group or sparsity properties through adaptive parameter tuning. The new regularization term introduces a flexible fuzzy weighted scheme combining the ${\ell _{2,2}}$ -norm and ${\ell _{2,p}}$ -norm ( $0&amp;lt; p\leq 1$ ). This approach allows adaptive adjustment based on data characteristics, offering a tunable balance between selecting discriminative features and identifying correlated ones. Consequently, this regularization term equips the model to handle diverse data analysis tasks flexibly, thereby enhancing adaptability and generalization performance. Furthermore, we propose an efficient optimization strategy to solve this model. Extensive experiments conducted on UCI datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

To surmount the difficulty caused by the infinite-dimensional spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics, a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy parabolic PDE model is first constructed to represent the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics, and then a fuzzy PID boundary output tracking control (BOTC) scheme is proposed via the obtained T–S fuzzy PDE model and the difference between the boundary measurement output and its desired constant reference signal to achieve the output tracking goal. Utilizing the Lyapunov technique combined with the inequality techniques, a systematic, conceptually simple yet effective parameter tuning method is developed for the fuzzy PID control scheme such that the suggested fuzzy PID-BOTC law drives the measurement output to asymptotically track the desired reference signal and ensures the boundedness of the resulting closed-loop system signals. Such parameter tuning is formulated as a feasibility problem subject to linear matrix inequality constraints. Moreover, two special cases of the proposed PID-BOTC design (i.e., fuzzy PI-BOTC scheme and fuzzy integral BOTC one) are also provided in this article. Extensive simulation results for a numerical example and a chemical axial dispersion tubular reactor are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy PID-BOTC scheme and its merit in the fast response of the preset reference signal and the less overshot is also illustrated by comparing with the fuzzy PI control law and the fuzzy integral one.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of observer-based fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control for a class of nonlinear systems subject to degraded measurements and randomly perturbed sampling periods (RPSPs). In the existing results, the degraded measurements and RPSPs are handled separately, where the sampling of different sensors is usually assumed to be synchronous. In our work, a comprehensive model is built to reflect the joint effects of degraded measurements and RPSPs by using a series of stochastic variable sequences and a set of Markov processes. In this model, the sampling periods of each sensor are allowed to be diverse, time-varying, and randomly perturbed, thereby fully capturing the environmental effects and device constraints. Different from the existing literature that uses proportional type controllers, an observer-based fuzzy PID controller with a modified structure is proposed, which fully utilizes the system information. To overcome the difficulties of the incomplete measurement information, some auxiliary variables related to the sampling periods are introduced under which the measurement output is transformed into a form delayed with stochastic delays. Subsequently, by using the special variable separation and inequality technique, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the exponentially ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system in the mean-square sense. The desired gains for the observer and PID controller are obtained through the solution of an optimization problem. Last, the effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Time-series clustering is a crucial unsupervised technique for analyzing data, commonly used in various fields, including medicine and stock analysis. However, in real-world scenarios, time-series data inevitably contain missing values, consequently reducing the efficiency of traditional clustering methods. In incomplete time series, existing clustering methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy, i.e., initially imputing missing values followed by clustering. However, this approach of separating imputation from clustering may lead to inconsistencies in the optimization objectives and increase the complexity of parameter tuning, potentially resulting in unsatisfactory clustering results. This article proposes an end-to-end deep fuzzy clustering (EEDFC) model for incomplete time series, which jointly optimizes imputation and clustering within a unified framework by integrating multiple losses. In the imputation part, an attention mechanism is integrated to tackle challenges associated with dependencies in extended sequences. In addition, an adversarial strategy is introduced to enhance the encoder&#39;s imputation and feature representation learning capability, thus reducing the error propagation from imputation to clustering. In the clustering part, EEDFC combines a feature weighting-based fuzzy clustering, which considers intracluster compactness and intercluster separateness. Furthermore, exponential distance is adopted, and feature and cluster weighting are also integrated into the Kullback–Leibler divergence loss to improve clustering performance. We conduct extensive experiments comparing our proposed model with eleven other methods across ten benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than eleven comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph data modeling is nontrivial due to the challenges to ensure model interpretability and handle data uncertainty. While methods derived from deep learning models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), are able to handle graph data, the interpretability is limited. Graph fuzzy systems (GFSs) based on the fuzzy rules and fuzzy inference have been proposed to improve interpretability, but the existing methods are developed for whole graph prediction only and cannot deal with node prediction, which is a more common task in graph data modeling. To tackle the challenges, a novel GFS for node prediction (GFS-node) is investigated in this study. For this purpose, the concepts, framework, and algorithms of GFS-node are systematically developed. First, several related concepts are defined, including the node fuzzy rule base, node fuzzy set, and node consequent processing module (NCPM). A general framework for GFS-node is then presented, where the construction of antecedents and the consequents of fuzzy rules are analyzed. Furthermore, a concrete implementation method of GFS-node is designed. In particular, the kernel K virtual central nodes clustering (KVCN) algorithm is proposed to develop the algorithm for antecedent generation, and the linear message passing network (LMPN) is adopted to develop the algorithm for consequent generation and learning. Experiments are carried out on multiple benchmark datasets, and the results show that GFS-node combines the advantages of both traditional fuzzy systems and classical GNNs for node prediction.},

Each Gaussian process model is instantiated utilizing granular data (or information granules) to enhance algorithmic efficiency and can be tailored to specific levels of precision (granularity). The overall design methodology emphasizes human centricity in system modeling by focusing on both the interpretability and accuracy of the resulting models. First, clustering algorithms are applied to construct information granules that provide a comprehensive overview of the experimental evidence. As the number of information granules grows, the existing knowledge imbedded within data could be perceived and described at increased levels of details. Information granules are built in an augmented feature space constructed by concatenating the input and output variables. Next, Gaussian process models are constructed on a basis of the information granules formed at different levels of abstraction. Subsequently, the confidence intervals are transformed to intervals and the reconciliation of the predictions produced by individual models, which offer different perspectives on the system, leads to the emergence of more abstract entities (such as type-2 intervals/fuzzy sets, etc.) rather than plain numbers. The efficacy of the comprehensive model is measured by the coverage and specificity criteria of the granular outputs. Experimental studies conducted on a synthetic dataset and a number of real-world datasets validated the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methodology.},

A novel Nussbaum function is employed to handle with partially unknown control directions. Consensus performance is derived based on fractional-order Lyapunov stability criteria. The proposed control strategy not only ensures asymptotic consensus of FOMASs, but also makes all closed-loop signals uniformly bounded. A chief merit is avoiding solving cumbersome linear programming hassles, which lightens the computational burden. Besides, the raised scheme is generalized to handle with the formation control of FOMASs. Finally, the authenticity of the theory is confirmed through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Deep fuzzy clustering employs neural networks to discover the low-dimensional embedding space of data, providing an effective solution to the clustering problem posed by high-dimensional data. Although some algorithms have achieved good results in application, the field still faces the following problems: the lack of clustering loss function limits the development of deep clustering, and most of them use the self-training strategy-based Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; some algorithms directly use conventional constrained clustering objective function as the loss function in deep models, and update network parameters alternately, the optimization process is cumbersome. Focusing on the issues mentioned above, this article first proposed an unconstrained fuzzy $c$ -means algorithm that can be solved using gradient descent and then used it as the clustering loss function to obtain a novel deep fuzzy clustering model named unsupervised deep embedding for fuzzy clustering. The proposed model simultaneously learns the low-dimensional representation of data and performs fuzzy clustering. It updates parameters through gradient descent and backpropagation, achieving end-to-end optimization. The proposed algorithm&#39;s effectiveness and competitiveness are fully demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on image and text datasets.},

By combining prescribed performance control method and introducing universal barrier functions, the transient and steady-state performances of the NMRSs are guaranteed, thereby further achieving collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance. On this basis, in order to achieve predefined-time convergence of formation errors and reduce the transmission frequency of control signals from controller to actuator for each robot with input dead-zones, a novel adaptive fuzzy robust PTET formation control strategy is further proposed by introducing predefined-time stability theory and designed trigger mechanism. It can avoid significant resource waste during rapid tracking processes, ensure the nonlinear NMRSs are predefined-time stable and all signals are bounded, which can be proved by constructing the barrier Lyapunov functions.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation leverages knowledge from source domain(s)/task(s) to facilitate learning in target task, particularly in unsatisfied and complex scenarios with data scarcity and distribution shifts. This approach helps reduce the high costs associated with collecting or labeling data for the target domain. However, it raises privacy concerns due to its matching techniques requiring access to source data, particularly in sensitive applications. In addition, most domain adaptation methods assume that source and target domains share the same label space, disregarding category shifts. In this article, we propose federated fuzzy transfer learning for category shifts (FdFTL) to address the before mentioned challenges-data privacy and category shifts. By combining a hybrid approach of fuzzy model and federated learning, a cloud model capable of performing across domains can be trained without the need for data sharing. This approach also results in a reduction of model parameters compared to traditional methods training individual models from multiple source domains. To eliminate domain and category shifts, we utilize a global clustering and a local semantic consensus clustering to effectively separate known target classes from out-of-distribution samples. Furthermore, we incorporate a confident score and the Silhouette analysis to elaborate the accuracy of categorizing target known classes. Experimental results on real-world visual tasks across universal, open-set, partial, and closed-set scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

First, this study investigates the variable convergence rate control issue for switched nonlinear systems. Combining the generalized pole placement idea and the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy technique, a novel $H_{\infty }$ control criterion is proposed, specifically focusing on convergence rate constraints. In addition, employing the persistent dwell-time switching to model two asynchronous scenarios in switched systems: time-delayed switching and mismatched switching, where the maximum asynchronous delay is permitted to exceed the subsystems dwell time. According to this new criterion, a novel $H_{\infty }$ fuzzy controller is designed for switched nonlinear systems with asynchronous characteristics. It cannot only guarantee the asymptotic stability of the target closed-loop system but also precisely adjust the convergence rate of the system states, while also having certain anti-interference ability. Finally, numerical simulation and the tunnel diode circuit system control example prove the effectiveness of the method provided in this article.},

However, ideally, we have AI systems which go beyond explainable AI (XAI), that is, systems which not only explain their behavior, but also communicate their “insights” with respect to the real world. This requires rules to capture causal relationships between variables. In this article, we argue that those systems where the rules reflect causal relationships between variables represent an important class of fuzzy rule-based systems with unique benefits. Specifically, such systems benefit from improved performance and robustness; facilitate global explainability and thus cater to a core ambition for AI: the ability to communicate important relationships among a system&#39;s real-world variables to the human users of AI. We establish two causal-rule focused approaches to design fuzzy systems, and show the distinctions in their respective application scenarios for the explanations of the rules obtained by these two methods. The results show that rules which reflect causal relationships are more suitable for XAI than rules which “only” reflect correlations, while also confirming that they offer robustness to over-fitting, in turn supporting strong performance.},

First, the order characteristics of object attributes are utilized to form a fuzzy dominating (dominated)-granularity structure (FDDGS). Then, we employ the characteristics of the FDDGS to illustrate relations among objects from various perspectives. Furthermore, an approach is proposed that uses a multicenter technique for better description of similarities within and across clusters, clustering data from diverse granularities, and mining clustering outcomes at different levels. Finally, fusion clustering of information purification is achieved based on the optimum results of different granularity clustering on each metric. Comparative results with advanced clustering algorithms on the UCI dataset demonstrate this proposed method&#39;s superiority in processing complex spatial structure data and its effectiveness and robustness in handling overlapping and noisy data.},

A novel adaptive memory event-triggered scheme is developed to slow down control command update under unexpected system dynamic fluctuation excited by abrupt trace disturbances by releasing less triggered times, as well as speed up update under large amplitude response but gentle variation around critical crest/trough situation by releasing more triggering times. To overcome the shortcomings of slower convergence and longer response time resulting from designed scheme for control command update, finite-time lane-keeping control with prescribed H∞ performance is employed to achieve expected convergence properties. Additionally, better tracking control quality requirements for designed control strategy are specifically achieved with considered roll prevention control for the sprung mass and front/rear solid axle by eliminating negative effects on yaw motion and decreasing dynamic load transfer rate. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee finite-time boundedness with prescribed H∞ performance and gain matrices for controller and trigger are codesigned and obtained by solving certain matrix inequalities. Benefiting from regulated control command update and roll prevention under an adaptive memory event-triggered scheme, the obtained results illustrating reasonable triggered times, less tracking error, smoother centroid trajectory, smaller roll angle, and decreased dynamic load transfer rate demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In traditional social network analysis-based group decision-making problems, decision makers (DMs) commonly establish trust relationships with unfamiliar DMs based on the transitivity of trust but always ignore the effectiveness of such indirect trust and the potential risks that may arise from excessive trust/distrust. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores a Bayesian framework to construct trust relationships among a group which can update the direct trusts between DMs by considering the trusts to the trustee from other DMs trusted by the original trustor. The Bayesian trust relationship can not only supplement the incomplete trust relationships based on known trust information, but also make reasonable adjustments to existing trusts before the decision process. And it has been proven to be effective in mitigating inaccuracies in decision outcomes resulting from either excessive trust or distrust, and in reducing information loss caused by excessively long paths during trust transition. Relatedly, after giving the algorithm of the Bayesian trust relationship, the rank discrepancy between DMs is defined in uncertain belief distribution environment to measure and constrain the trust decision indicator (TDI) in the Bayesian framework. Then, constrained by expected rank discrepancy, the stochastic TDI analysis is introduced to derive the confidence weight intervals of DMs. And an optimization model is provided to maximize the group consensus within the constraints of the generated interval weights. Finally, a case study of new energy vehicles selection is presented. Additionally, both comparative study and sensitivity analysis are provided.},

The intermediate observer proposed is designed with a higher degree of freedom due to the introduction of two auxiliary variables. Second, based on this novel intermediate observer, zonotopic analysis is utilized to give a range of the effects of unknown inputs and fault derivatives on state and fault estimation, thus interval estimation results for state and fault are obtained.

Extending arithmetic operations to $LR$ fuzzy numbers with different left and right shape functions offers several advantages, including a more realistic representation of uncertainty, enhanced expressiveness, flexibility in modeling, improved accuracy, compatibility with real data, and robustness in decision-making. These benefits make such extensions valuable in various applications where uncertainty plays an important role.

Compared with the conventional command filter technique, the main advantage is that the improved error-compensating signals are designed for each switched subsystem to remove the filtered errors and avoid an explosion of complexity and the singularity problem. Different from the traditional Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional method, design obstacles stemming from unknown time delays are overcome for the switched delayed systems by using appropriate multiple Lyapunov--Krasovskii functions and combining with the approximation capability of the fuzzy logic systems. Under a category of switching signals with mode-dependent average dwell time, all signals in the closed-loop switched system are semiglobally uniformly ultimate bounded under the output-feedback control; meanwhile, the tracking errors can remain in prespecified performance funnels.

Firstly, based on the compromised output signals and the FLSs, a new fuzzy state observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasured states. Then, the Nussbaum gain technique is utilized to address the issue of unknown control coefficients that arise due to unknown deception attacks. Furthermore, by combining the event-triggered control and backstepping recursive control principle, a novel event-triggered based finite-time resilient fuzzy adaptive output feedback control scheme is developed involving the attacked and estimated state variables. The results of the developed output feedback control show that all the signals of the overall system are semiglobal finite-time stability in probability. Contrary to the current state feedback resilient control results, the designed resilient control scheme not only handles the output feedback control problem, but also eliminates the assumption that the attack weight sign is positive. In addition, the growing assumptions of coexistence unknown nonlinear uncertainties are removed. Ultimately, a simulation example is used to illustrate the feasibility and the rationality of the designed controller.},

In this context, further consideration of the heterogeneous behavior of competitors and their impact on the evolution of conflicts deserves special attention. Usually, DMs’ evaluation thinking has certain ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are accustomed to giving qualitative evaluation information. Given the unique advantages of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS) in the fusion of decision domains and transformational linguistic expressions, this article constructs a theoretical framework for a graph model on TrIT2FS and proposes a method for calculating DMs preference ranking and a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function. First, the DMs will consider multiple factors in the decision evaluation process, and there are specific regret avoidance psychological behavior characteristics; thus, this article integrates Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and regret theory to solve the DM&#39;s preference ranking and expands on a new preference ranking method. Second, mixed stability definitions based on TrIT2FS are proposed to facilitate the description of different sanctioning behaviors of heterogeneous opponents. Subsequently, a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function is proposed to quickly obtain conflict evolution solutions in complex dynamic conflict problems based on the extended mixed stability definitions. Finally, to thoroughly test the correctness and practicality of the proposed theory, the conflict between inputs and outputs of the technological transformation of enterprises under the low-carbon strategy is used as a specific application scenario and example for validation.},

First, the NISMJSs undergo transformation through T–S fuzzy model into a class of Itô stochastic Markov jump fuzzy systems (ISMJFSs), which is a composite of a set of linear subsystems. Then, based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a sufficient condition is provided for establishing the mean-square stability of ISMJFSs. For solving the OCP, the most commonly used method is policy iteration (PI), but it requires an initial stabilizing control policy to be given, which relies on precise information about the system dynamics. To remove this limitation, we introduce hybrid iteration (HI) to design the optimal controller for the Itô stochastic systems for the first time without requiring the initial stabilizing control gain, and then the stability and convergence of the offline HI algorithm for the ISMJFSs are proven. Moreover, by incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, we develop an online HI algorithm to successfully solve the OCP for ISMJFSs with unknown system dynamics matrices, which initializes the algorithm without the need for a set of initial stabilizing control gain matrices. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated through simulation results using the RLC electric circuit.},

  abstract     = {This article analyzes the stability and stabilization of interval type-2 (IT-2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems by proposing novel time-dependent memory sampled-data control (TDMSDC) scheme based on the sampling-dependent functional approach. Unlike the existing studies, the novel TDMSDC, incorporates both conventional sampled-data control (SDC) and memory SDC schemes, along with the relation of sampling-time variable and time changes within the sampling period, is introduced. The novel TDMSDC overcomes the limitation of conventional SDC schemes, which only stays constant within the sampling period, thus enhancing control performance. Next, a sampling-dependent looped Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, integrating information on sampling periods with various degrees, fuzzy membership function (MF), sampling-dependent matrices, and signal transmission delay, is constructed. Leveraging this novel functional and constraint condition of MFs, the asymptotic stability conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities for IT-2 T–S fuzzy systems under the novel TDMSDC technique. Finally, the numerical examples demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of designed control method.},

Fuzzy information granularity is used as an effective tool to handle long-term forecasting of time series. On account of its good interpretability and effect, it has received the attention of more and more scholars. However, although the method has been universally used in univariate time series, its application for multivariate time series has received little attention. In order to utilize the advantages of fuzzy information granularity and fill its gap in solving multivariate time-series forecasting problems. In view of this purpose, we design a long-term multivariate time-series forecasting modeling framework in light of Gaussian fuzzy information granules. The model includes a granulation method of under multivariate time series, as well as a neural network model that combines the backpropagation neural network, long short-term memory neural network, and transformer for long-term prediction, in which there is a fuzzy information granule segmentation method with polynomials as the core line and a new representation method for fuzzy information granules. We carry out experimental evaluations using eight publicly available time-series data, and the results show that our model is able to perform long-term forecasting of multivariate time series with a high satisfactory accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has extensive applications for modeling nonlinear systems with multidimensional structured data. However, the traditional IT2FNN based on the structured topology struggles to identify nonlinear systems using semistructured and unstructured data. To tackle this issue, a multimodal learning-based IT2FNN (ML-IT2FNN) is developed for joint learning of the multimodal data. First, an encoding layer with a multimodal perception strategy is designed to identify the multimodal information. The parameterized modalities are utilized to map the features of the semistructured and unstructured data into the structured spaces. Second, a multimodal representation mechanism is introduced to extract the features of multiple modalities from the structured spaces. In this mechanism, type-2 fuzzy sets with soft boundaries are used to intricate coupling relationships among modalities by adapting to the nuances of multimodal data. Third, a constrained hybrid learning algorithm, combining parallel and sequential updating frameworks, is presented to optimize the parameters of ML-IT2FNN. The type-2 fuzzy parameters and the coupling parameters with constraints are updated adaptively to facilitate the intramodal identification performance and cross-modal interaction performance. Finally, a series of examples in nonlinear systems are introduced to verify ML-IT2FNN. Empirical results demonstrate that ML-IT2FNN surpasses the cutting-edge approaches with accuracy.},

Subsequently, a hybrid iteration (HI) approximation learning framework is constructed for approaching the solutions of the fuzzy game coupled algebraic Riccati equations. The HI eliminates initial admissible control dependencies and has a desirable learning iteration rate, in contrast to the traditional policy iteration and value iteration. We present a novel model-based HI scheme and further develop it to a model-free version. The model-free HI scheme uses only online data collected along the system trajectories for controller design, and it eliminates the traditional model-dependent issues, which is more suitable for practical applications.

  abstract     = {An event refers to an occurrence that occurs at a specific place, time, and event type and has a significant impact on our society or nature. Uncertain event knowledge also exists widely in the real world. Knowledge graph uses a resource description framework to describe deterministic and static knowledge in the real world. And knowledge graph embedding can embed the nodes and relations in the knowledge graph into vector space to represent more data features. However, real-world knowledge is often dynamic and uncertain, and these knowledge also changes with the state of events. Existing knowledge graph embedding models cannot solve the uncertainty and dynamically changing information of events in this embedding framework. To solve this problem, we study an embedding model for uncertain, dynamic state representation and propose a strongly adaptive fuzzy event embedding model (FERKE). Specifically, we first propose a fuzzy event embedding model that combines coarse-grained and fine-grained fuzziness, which provides an underlying representation framework for FERKE. Then, in the hyperbolic embedding space, the nodes and relations in the fuzzy event graph and the fine-grained fuzziness of each element are, respectively, embedded. FERKE utilizes the information aggregation and transmission of heterogeneous graph neural network to capture the rich interactions between fuzzy events and entity knowledge. We conduct an experimental evaluation of FERKE based on the constructed fuzzy event dataset. The results show that the FERKE proposed in this study is better than existing methods and can handle complex fuzzy event knowledge.},

A multiple-hierarchical structure is constructed to simultaneously describe both the mismatch of premise variables due to the introduction of the DETCS and the mode asynchronization between the filter and the plant, where the mode asynchronization is fully characterized by a hidden Markov model with generally hybrid transition probabilities and mode detection probabilities. By applying the double variables-based decoupling principle and variable substitution principle, a co-design criterion for DETCS and optimal $\mathscr {L}_{\infty }/\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ asynchronous reduced-order FD filter in the finite-frequency domain is derived and given by an exact expression. Besides, unlike the constant thresholds in existing FD works, an innovative zonotope-based dynamic threshold strategy is developed for residual evaluation.

Specifically, the linguistic connected membership functions that underlie the ANFIS are defined, focusing on symmetrical inputs/outputs and jointly optimized trapezoid membership functions to reduce the number of training parameters. Further optimizations for the ANFIS were derived based on design assumptions, including training the membership functions on closed or single-sided domains. The optimal output membership weights based on mean square error optimization were also symbolically obtained. The online training of the ANFIS&#39;s input/output membership functions was performed using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. A simulated skid-steered vehicle was used to validate the approach and performed waypoint-to-waypoint path following. Experimental results using the Clearpath Jackal demonstrated that the ANFIS model converged quickly, typically within 6 to 10 episodes of training, from an initial mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.88 and 1.02 m, respectively, to a final MAE and RMSE of 0.087 and 0.10 m. The results highlight the effectiveness of the ANFIS approach for vehicular robotics applications and suggest promising avenues for future research and development.},

Extensive experiments on two public datasets, i.e., DTU and BlendedMVS, show that our method has the ability of accurately reconstructing complex shapes with vivid geometric details, without the requirement of mask supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance over the state-of-the-art neural scene representation methods.

  abstract     = {Few-shot temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) aims to predict missing facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) when each relation has a limited number of available samples. Existing few-shot TKGC models primarily face two challenges. First, entities and relations in TKGs typically exhibit dynamic characteristics, and those models often adopt static neighbor information to improve their semantic representations, so the noise in neighbor information may be amplified. Second, those models mainly focus on crisp entities and relations, yet real-world facts are often fuzzy, rendering them ineffective at capturing fuzzy semantic information. To solve these challenges, this article investigates a novel method for modeling fuzzy TKGs information in a vector space and proposes a framework for few-shot fuzzy temporal knowledge graph completion. Specifically, we devise a dynamic attention neighbor aggregator and time-aware fuzzy mapping framework. These components facilitate the integration of semantic information from neighborhood relations and generate fuzzy membership degrees to describe the fuzzy information. Additionally, we integrate an error-aware feature extractor within the meta-learning framework, effectively addressing errors during the learning process. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves outstanding results across different few-shot settings, obtaining performance gains of 4.2%, 13.6% in terms of MRR and Hits@10, respectively, on the ICEWS0515-ff dataset, and 2.9%, 10.2% on the ICEWS18-ff dataset.},

As a metalevel stacking ensemble system, each layer of MECFNN is based on a single jointly evolving and compressing neural fuzzy inference system (ECNFIS) that self-organizes a set of human-interpretable fuzzy rules from input data in a samplewise manner to perform approximate reasoning. ECNFISs associate a unique compressive projection matrix to each individual fuzzy rule to compress the consequent part into a tighter form, removing redundant information while boosting the diversity within the stacking ensemble. The compressive projection matrices of the cascading ECNFISs are self-updating to minimize the prediction errors via error backpropagation together with the consequent parameters, empowering MECFNN to learn more meaningful, discriminative representations from data at multiple levels of abstraction. An adaptive activation control scheme is further introduced in MECFNN to dynamically exclude less activated fuzzy rules, effectively reducing the computational complexity and fostering generalization. Numerical examples on popular high-dimensional classification problems demonstrate the efficacy of MECFNN.},

  abstract     = {While interpretable multiview classification is accomplished by recently developed fully interpretable Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) classifier fully interpretable and more generalization (FIMG)-TSK along each view, this study attempts to enhance multiview classification performance by leveraging the corresponding Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of FIMG-TSK along each view as an accompanying classifier along the accompanying view of each view. The basic idea behind this study is to have an individual multiview ensemble learning not only for FIMG-TSK along each view but also for the corresponding GMM along each accompanying view, and then take the averaging strategy on them both to form a novel multiview fully interpretable TSK fuzzy classifier called MV-FIMG-TSKs. By maximizing the concisely-expressed output variance of FIMG-TSK along each view and simultaneously keep consistent as much as possible between all the accompanying views, the learning objective of MV-FIMG-TSKs is designed to compromise all the views. Then, it is quickly optimized to have an analytical yet global solution to the weights of all rules along each view. Enhanced generalization capability of the proposed MV-FIMG-TSKs is theoretically assured and experimentally manifested by the experimental results on 14 binary datasets.},

  abstract     = {In a distributed system, the plant and its controlling entity, the supervisor, are situated in separate locations, communicating remotely. This setup introduces delays and the potential for information loss during communication. This study delves into the supervisory control of networked fuzzy discrete event systems, an area relatively unexplored in existing literature. The plant is conceptualized as a fuzzy discrete event system with inherent constraints. Events within this system are both observed and managed from a distance by the supervisor, encountering two types of delays and losses. One type occurs during observation, where the plant transmits information to the supervisor, whereas the other arises during control, stemming from communication between the supervisor and the plant. The article first addresses the challenge of estimating states in the presence of observation delays and losses. An online methodology is devised to compute these state estimates. Leveraging these estimates, a supervisor is then designed to selectively enable or disable events, ensuring that the plant never transitions into undesirable or unsafe fuzzy states. A necessary and sufficient condition is established to guarantee the existence of such a supervisor. In addition, online techniques are developed to implement the computation of the supervisor&#39;s control actions.},

This article aims to enhance the data fitting ability of fuzzy rough set theory by incorporating an adaptive learning mechanism. Consequently, this study introduces a relative fuzzy rough set model with adaptive learning (ALRFRS), where the adaptive learning mechanism considers not only feature weights but also class variances. To describe the similarity between samples in data regions with significant differences in class density, this study introduces the concepts of relative distance and relative fuzzy similarity relation. Subsequently, the study defines relative fuzzy rough approximation operators for each feature and combines them based on varying feature weights to establish a relative fuzzy rough set model. In addition, the study conducts an analysis of some fundamental properties of the model. To enable adaptive fuzzy rough learning, the study formulates an objective function that incorporates feature weights and class variances and provides the corresponding optimization learning algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive learning mechanism can enhance the classification accuracy of relative fuzzy rough models, surpassing the performance of most existing excellent algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Imitation learning is pivotal for robot skill acquisition and holds potential for teleoperation shared control applications. This article introduces a novel imitation learning method and shared control framework using unit tangent fuzzy movement primitives (UTFMP). Using unsupervised demonstration segmentation results obtained by UTFMP as membership function references, and employing type-2 fuzzy models to manage uncertainties in segmented subtrajectories across multiple demonstrations, we propose an imitation learning method. This method facilitates trajectory learning based on either time or distance, supports real-time trajectory modulation using inputs, such as time, position, or velocity, adeptly adapts to dynamic scenarios, and possesses the capability to seamlessly blends diverse trajectories. Then, a shared control framework with segmented subtrajectories and modulated trajectories is established to extend UTFMP&#39;s application. This framework includes intent recognition through fuzzy fusion and a Markov transition matrix to identify intent of operator, as well as shared arbitration to integrate operations from both operator and robot agent. Simulation experiments validate UTFMP&#39;s effectiveness for demonstration segmentation, imitation learning and modulation. Teleoperation experiments demonstrate increased trajectory smoothness and accuracy by at least 24.38% and 9.48%, respectively, a minimum 16.56% reduction in control time compared to conventional velocity control using the shared control proposed.},

  abstract     = {The diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy necessitate the precise identification and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, EEG samples from different medical institutions often exhibit variability due to factors such as institutional characteristics, geographic locations, and the professional levels of physicians. This variability limits the widespread application of existing methods in small or single medical institutions, as they typically rely on large-scale and high-quality datasets. To rapidly assist small or single medical institutions in constructing models for the diagnosis and classification of epileptic EEG signals that are both highly generalizable and interpretable while ensuring patient privacy, this article proposes an innovative learning framework named Multicenter Knowledge Transfer Calibration with rapid zeroth-order TSK fuzzy system (MKTC-R0T). This method employs the zeroth-order TSK fuzzy system as the baseline model for each center and integrates a knowledge transfer calibration strategy within a multicenter learning framework, aiming to enhance the model&#39;s generalizability and classification accuracy in the face of inconsistent sample quality and sample heterogeneity. Specifically, MKTC-R0T first establishes a base center model in a large medical institution, and then, by imitating the forgetting mechanism of the human brain, a portion of the knowledge at the base center is randomly forgotten, while the remaining knowledge is utilized to assist the auxiliary centers in rapidly deploying models. Ultimately, through a knowledge integration strategy, all centers collectively guide the target center in building an efficient linear system for the diagnosis and classification of epileptic EEG signals. Extensive experiments conducted on 12 epilepsy EEG signal datasets have validated that MKTC-R0T outperforms other typical algorithms in terms of running time, deployment speed, rule complexity, and the model&#39;s generalization and robustness, which demonstrates the substantial potential of MKTC-R0T in the field of epilepsy EEG signal diagnosis and classification.},

In addition, the DINTFZNN model utilizes a fuzzy parameter generated by FLS as the design parameter, which can adaptively adjust the convergence rate and enhance the robustness and adaptability of the DINTFZNN model. Theories have rigorously demonstrated the convergence and robustness of the DINTFZNN model. By the comparison experiments with the single integral noise-tolerant ZNN model, the superiority of the DINTFZNN model is further confirmed.

This development seeks to overcome the bottleneck of negative transfer in evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO)-based algorithms. Specifically, previous Pareto solutions, center- and knee-points of multisubpopulation are adaptively selected to establish the source domain, which are then assigned soft labels through the designed CFS, based on a thorough evaluation of both convergence and diversity. A target domain is constructed by centroid feed-forward of multisubpopulation, enabling further estimations on learning samples with the assistance of the kernel mean matching (KMM) method. By doing so, the property of nonindependently identically distributed data is considered to enhance efficient knowledge transfer. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the reliability and superiority of the proposed CFS-DMOA in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems, showing significant competitiveness in terms of mitigating negative transfer as compared to other state-of-the-art ETO-based DMOAs. Moreover, the effectiveness of the soft labels provided by CFS in breaking the “either/or” limitation of hard labels is validated, facilitating a more flexible and comprehensive characterization of historical information, thereby promoting objective and effective knowledge transfer.},

  abstract     = {Stacking-based takagi-sugeno-kang (TSK) fuzzy system ensemble has been successfully applied to imbalanced data classification. However, there still exist many challenges that need to be further addressed. For example, during stacking, augmenting output variables into the input feature space reduces the interpretability of antecedents of fuzzy rules. During sampling for balancing, discovering informative samples usually only relies on training samples, which may reduce generalizability. More importantly, there is no theory to support the reliability of stacking. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this study, we propose a deep reconciled and self-paced TSK fuzzy system ensemble framework termed D-RSP-TSKE for imbalanced data classification. Compared with the existing ensemble frameworks, its superiorities can be exhibited from the following three aspects. First, in the first layer, we use random undersampling to generate a class-balanced training set to train an initial zero-order TSK fuzzy classifier. Based on the TSK fuzzy classifier, then we define classifier-specific and testing-compatible sample sensitivity to discover informative (high-sensitive) samples and design a reconciled and self-paced sampling approach to balance the minority class for the training of the following layers. Second, to improve the interpretability of antecedents of fuzzy rules, we propose to transfer the output variables from antecedents to consequents through equivalent mathematical transformations while keeping the final output unchanged. These transferred output variables are interpreted as the dynamic fuzzy rule confidence. Third, furthermore, we engage in a comprehensive theoretical examination of our stacking-based ensemble to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that enable the stacking strategy to consistently deliver superior performance. We conduct tests and comparisons on 7 artificial datasets and 30 real-world datasets to evaluate D-RSP-TSKE. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of D-RSP-TSKE for imbalanced data classification.},

Meanwhile, a mixed ET mechanism is consist of fuzzy state variables errors and integral sliding variables errors, which serves as a critical element for ensuring the existence of a practical sliding mode (PSM). A bounded stability criteria of the sliding motion are derived using a fuzzy Lyapunov method, in which the linear decoupling strategies are applied to address a bilinear matrix inequality problem. Furthermore, a switching approach is employed to design the ET fuzzy switching SMC (ETFSSMC) law, which effectively utilizes the characteristics of the FMFs and their derivatives.

To that end, this study proposes a new performance constraint-handling sliding mode manifold, a new prescribed performance function, and a new ADP-oriented observer disturbance observer. The above theoretical findings, together with the fuzzy logic system-based ADP algorithm, realize the convergence of tracking errors to a prespecified residual set within a finite-time setting in an optimal manner, enhance robustness, and reduce conservatism.

Second, to obtain the interval estimation results of real states, the error dynamics is split into a random process with stochastic uncertainties and a bounded process with set-based uncertainties. Different from the interval estimation methods presented in the literature, which use only zonotopic analysis for interval estimation, we use the PCE approach in conjunction with zonotopic analysis for interval estimation, where the random process is analyzed using PCE in conjunction with the zonotopic method, and the bounded process is studied using the zonotopic analysis method. Moreover, a numerical simulation is proposed, and its results illustrate that the presented approach can decrease the conservatism of interval estimation and facilitate more interval estimation accuracy compared to an advanced interval observer design approach.

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback control method for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems with prescribed tracking performance. Based on proper tuning functions and a pair of monotone tube boundary functions, a novel error transformation is proposed, which can constrain the tracking error within predefined monotone tube boundaries provided that the transferred variable is bounded. To this end, an adaptive output-feedback controller is designed to stabilize the transferred variable. We use fuzzy logic systems and adaptive control techniques to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a reduced-order observer with less dynamics is proposed to estimate the unmeasurable state. In order to reduce the computation burden, we adopt command-filters method, which can avoid the complexity explosion problem in backstepping controller design procedure. Our article presents a way to constrain the tracking error with improved performance indices, such as overshoot, and convergence time. In addition, the method is independent of the initial values. Numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The distributed optimal problem is investigated in this article for uncertain nonlinear time-varying delay multiagent systems (MASs) under unknown virtual control coefficients. The primary goal is to ensure the output states converge to the ideal point of the global objective function. In comparison to the preceding results on distributed optimization, the considered MASs are subject to time delays and unknown nonlinear functions, which brought great challenges to the controller design process. To overcome this challenge, a distributed optimization algorithm is proposed via a two-stage strategy, which consists of optimization estimator design and tracking controller design. First, in the first-stage, a novel optimal signal generator is constructed by using information interaction between agents, real-time feedback value of local gradient information, so that the optimization problem is transformed into a problem of tracking control. Second, in second-stage, the fuzzy adaptive tracking control strategy is designed via backstepping technology to track the virtual signal accurately. In addition, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is applied to counteract influences brought by time-varying delays, and fuzzy logic systems are employed for handling the uncertain function in the derivative of LKF. Furthermore, an assumption is made for the time-varying delays to settle the singularity problem, which often occurs in time-delay problems. In the spirit of the convex analysis and the Barbalats lemma, the stability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated, and all variables in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Lastly, simulations are presented to validate the efficacy of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Most feature selection models via swarm intelligence optimization have difficulty achieving an optimal global subset of features and are not ideal for classifying high-dimensional data. We study a granular ball fuzzy neighborhood rough sets-based feature selection approach via multiobjective mayfly optimization on high-dimensional datasets. First, to enhance the ability to search for samples in granular balls, the granular ball radius is defined by the standard deviation coefficient. To measure sparse samples with noise in the granular ball, a new fuzzy neighborhood is constructed inside the granular ball, and upper and lower approximations are presented to develop the granular ball fuzzy neighborhood sets model. Second, to estimate the uncertainty of features in granular balls, fuzzy neighborhood entropy is provided. In the process of searching for features in fuzzy neighborhood decision systems, a feature-partitioning strategy based on the average fuzzy neighborhood entropy is studied. A subset of the preselected features is subsequently formed in the first stage. Third, to enhance the diversity in nondominated solutions, the feature vector is decoded into the mayfly, which is optimized through the mesh model. The mayfly ranking strategy updates the mayfly velocity and position to avoid local optima. Thus, in the second stage, the improved multiobjective mayfly optimization strategy can be utilized in selecting the optimal subset of features. Finally, a feature selection scheme is proposed for high-dimensional data with noise. Experimental findings prove that the developed methodology is viable and has excellent classification efficiency on 12 high-dimensional datasets.},

  abstract     = {The binary nature of the states and transitions in discrete-time finite Markov chains makes this modeling methodology unsuitable for many practical systems, such as those found in biomedicine. To address this fundamental limitation, we have extended in this article Markov chains to fuzzy Markov chains capable of handling fuzzy states and fuzzy events. This innovative and significant advancement is founded on the theory of stochastic fuzzy discrete event systems (SFDES) and the supervised learning algorithm for fuzzy discrete event systems (FDES), recently published by the authors. We mathematically generalize a traditional Markov chain with $N$ states to a fuzzy Markov chain with $N$ fuzzy states, which is represented by an SFDES consisting of $N^{2}$ FDES. Each FDES has its own $N \times N$ event transition matrix that is automatically learned by the aforementioned learning algorithm. Crucially, the fuzzy Markov chain fully preserves the stochastic characteristics defined by the transition probability matrix of the binary Markov chain, ensuring identical stochastic behaviors. A defuzzifier is used to yield crisp model output. The structurally more complex fuzzy Markov chain encompasses its binary counterpart as a special case and degenerates into it when fuzzy states degenerate into binary states. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the systematic design procedure and demonstrate the higher prediction accuracy of the fuzzy Markov chain over its binary counterpart. Due to their advantages, fuzzy Markov chains have the potential to address real-world stochastic problems beyond the reach of conventional Markov chains, especially in biomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy information granularity is an effective granular computation approach for feature evaluation and selection. However, most existing methods rely on a single granulation channel, neglecting different granularity representations. In this article, a novel dual-channel fuzzy interaction information fused feature selection with fuzzy sparse and shared granularities is proposed. It mainly comprises the following three parts. First, a dual-channel framework is introduced to construct the fuzzy information granularity from two different strategies. One channel employs sparse mutual strategy to form the sparse representation-based fuzzy information granularity, while the other constructs the fuzzy shared information granularity with a novel fuzzy semi-ball. Second, in each channel, the criteria of maximum relevancy, minimum redundancy, and maximum interaction is adopted to access feature correlation and perform feature ranking. Third, the two feature sequences derived from the dual-channel are fused to form a final feature sequence based on the within-class and between-class mechanism. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, experimental validations on 15 datasets and schizophrenia data are conducted. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms in classification accuracy and statistical analysis. Moreover, its superiority regarding accuracy can be demonstrated in the experiments of schizophrenia detection, where it performs well in recognizing schizophrenia through visual interpretation.},

First, the IT-2 T–S fuzzy model is employed to handle system uncertainty and nonlinearity effectively. Then, the outlier-resilient local estimator is proposed using the zonotope-based set-membership filters (ZSMFs), where the outlier detection scheme only relies on the intersection between the predicted set and the measurement set. Furthermore, the compressed local estimate (LE) are designed when there are bandwidth constraints in sensor networks, and a novel DR strategy is proposed to design this compressed LE, where the compression matrix is determined by the Round–Robin protocol (RRP). After this, based on the compressed LEs, a distributed resilient zonotopic fusion estimator (DRZFE) is derived by the matrix-weighted fusion method. Note that the computational load of the DRZFE is reduced effectively due to the zonotope order reduction and the RRP-based DR independent of the online optimization. Moreover, the compensation of outliers and the compensating state estimate of RRP-based DR may improve the resilience of the algorithm and reduce information loss. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to validate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed methods, and we use root-mean-square-error as the indicator to assess the estimation accuracy.},

Compared to the standard prescribed performance control (SPPC) or funnel control methods for ISNSs, the “flexibility” of the proposed FPPC algorithm is reflected in two aspects: 1) the proposed FPPC algorithm simultaneously considers multiple key indicators (including the steady state accuracy, convergence time, and overshoot), which are widely demanded in industrial production; 2) the proposed FPPC algorithm achieves a tradeoff between performance constraint and input saturation, i.e., the performance boundary can adaptively increase when the control input exceeds the saturation threshold, effectively avoiding singularity; conversely, when the control input is within the saturation threshold range, the performance constraint boundary can adaptively revert back to the original performance boundary. In addition, the unmeasured states are observed by the state observer, and the unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by fuzzy logic systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed output feedback control algorithm can ensure that all closed-loop signals are semiglobally bounded, the system output can track the desired signal within a prescribed time, and the tracking error is consistently maintained within flexible performance boundaries that depend on input and output constraints. The developed algorithm is exemplified through simulation instances.},

Thereby, we first propose a multi-innovation-based recursive update scheme for the consequent parameters, substituting conventional recursive fuzzily weighted least squares (RFWLS) approach in order to reduce the suboptimality of consequent parameters in the case of structural changes in a fully single-pass manner $\rightarrow$ EEF-FM-MI. Our oAL technique applies a sample selection strategy in a fully single-pass manner to elicit those samples, which are expected to be most important for improving the robustness of model parameters and enriching the model structure when being used for model updates. It is based on the following three criteria: first, maximization of the D-optimality criterion in the consequent space for addressing the problem to best reduce the parameter uncertainty; it relies on the determinant of the Hessian matrix, which is updated and represented in a multi-innovation context, where a threshold for selection is automatically derived by kernel density estimation; second, overlap degree in the antecedent space for the purpose to “sharpen” the local trends in the transition regions between the hyperplanes; third, novelty content in the antecedent space for indicating required knowledge expansion through rule evolution. The results on noisy real-world datasets showed that multi-innovation RFWLS could significantly outperform conventional RFWLS in all cases, with achieving an even more significant out-performance of classical evolving fuzzy system (not using any AR-based correction component), that our oAL strategy was able to reduce the measurement effort by up to 90% with a small increase in the error trend lines, and this with about quartering the computation times for model updates.},

The IT2 SPTSF model is employed to adeptly transform the nonlinear positive system into a linear form with inherent uncertainties addressed by IT2 fuzzy sets. First, the conservativeness of the system model is relaxed by refining the IT2 membership function. Then, by the multiple Lyapunov functions technique, the condition is developed to derive the solvability of the bumpless tracking switching control issue for the IT2 SPTSFSs. By employing the matrix transformation method, the condition is convex. Furthermore, controller and switching logic are established to force the IT2 SPTSFSs to obtain the bumpless tracking switching performance. Finally, an elaborate simulation case on the turbine engine is given to verify the validity of the introduced bumpless tracking switching control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale decision systems with high dimensions, constructing an efficient feature selection method via an uncertainty measure, has become a critical problem in fuzzy rough sets (FRS). However, the uncertainty method constructed through FRS for feature selection has the following limitations. 1) The composition of the uncertainty caused by fuzzy distance and similarity is neglected, which can not precisely evaluate the uncertainty. 2) The method of measuring uncertainty is to select all the sample for establishing a fuzzy similarity matrix, which leads to substantial time consumption. 3) The efficiency of selecting import features in a nonbatch manner is relatively low. Driven by this, both granular-ball (GB) computing and three-way approximations (TWA) are integrated to guide an uncertainty measure named multigranularity fuzzy entropy (MGFE), which is based on fuzzy distance and similarity, to improve the efficiency of feature selection. The MGFE is primarily recommended for measuring the uncertainty in multigranularity spaces. Therewith, the GB and TWA computing are integrated to compress the sample space to select representative sample. In addition, the MGFE is employed to assess the significance of the features in the representative sample space. Aided by the TWA, an efficient filter-wrapper feature selection with a three-way accelerator is successfully developed. Finally, related experiments illustrate the advancement of our proposed feature selection.s},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has proven to be a valuable approach for overcoming data scarcity challenges by incorporating physical models into machine learning methods. However, PIML faces limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, as its process information is obtained from disordered collocation points. Fuzzy systems, based on expert knowledge, can provide an interpretable way for tackling strong process nonlinearities. This article proposes a brand-new physics-informed spatial fuzzy system framework (PiFuz) to capture the essential system information of complex distributed parameter systems. PiFuz utilizes spatial membership functions to transform collocation points into a 3-D fuzzy input. This input is processed by the inference mechanism, leveraging its 3-D nature to produce fuzzy outputs with distinctive spatial characteristics. A feature fusion module is utilized to integrate these characteristics and generate the distributed system state. Utilizing the known physical knowledge base, the proposed framework undergoes automatic tuning while preserving process interpretability, resulting in an optimal model that aligns with the actual physical process. A reliable prediction of strong spatial nonlinear behaviors is achieved without the dependency of process data. For modeling higher dimensional spatiotemporal problems, the extension, a multikernel PiFuz framework (MKPiFuz), is further developed to improve the representation of heterogeneous time-varying nonlinear behaviors. By incorporating spatial and wavelet kernels, MKPiFuz extracts underlying features from spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. Experimental investigations on thermal process of the battery module demonstrate the good accuracy in modeling complex spatiotemporal systems.},

  abstract     = {The current data acquisition techniques enable the gathering and storage of extensive datasets, encompassing multidimensional arrays. Recent researchers focus on the analysis of large datasets having diverse data points. These multidimensional datasets comprise diverse data points and can be represented as tensors or multidimensional arrays. Clustering, a data analysis technique, can be used to discover and reveal latent data patterns from these datasets. The traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy c-means (FCM), and possibilistic c-means (PCM) pose some drawbacks in efficiently delivering high-quality clustering results for tensor or multidimensional array data. This may stem from the fact that these algorithms are primarily designed for single-view or low-array datasets, rendering them less suitable for the complexities of multidimensional arrays. In response to this challenge, this article introduces the tensor-based PCM (TPCM) algorithm. TPCM utilizes a tensor distance (TD) function as the distance metric, different from the usual Euclidean distance. The TD function evaluates the distance between data points and cluster centers by considering relationships among different coordinates. To further enhance the analysis, the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) method and PARAFAC2 decomposition techniques are used to restructure heterogeneous data into low-order tensors. Our experiments consider two types of datasets: multiview datasets and tensor datasets. CPD is applied for tensor data decomposition, while PARAFAC2, a CPD variant, addresses multiview data with varying feature space sizes in each view. Through comprehensive illustrations and evaluations using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of TPCM. Experimental results reveal that TPCM consistently achieves higher clustering performance compared to most existing clustering algorithms.},

However, outliers can present considerable challenges by distorting the measurement of similarity between samples, and biases in projection subspace learning may impede accurate partitioning. In this article, we propose a robust discriminant embedding projection fuzzy clustering with optimal mean (RPFCOM) method. First, the weighted loss function term distinguishes outliers and normal samples through boolean weight, thereby inducing row sparsity in the learning of projection subspace. The distribution of boolean weight penalizes outliers with large errors in the projection subspace. Second, we incorporate minimizing projection reconstruction information learning while suppressing redundant features, where the optimal mean dynamically corrects the projection learning bias. And the embedding of discriminative information further strengthens the capability of differentiating normal samples. Finally, the proposed method adaptively updates the boolean weight to identify outliers, which joints fuzzy membership matrix constructed from the maximum entropy graphs, enhancing the stability in distinguishing normal sample clusters. Comprehensive experimental validation on noise contaminated dataset has demonstrated the superiority of RPFCOM.},

  abstract     = {High accuracy and decent interpretability are two main pursuits in time series multistep forecasting. Trend fuzzy information granulation shows the potential to improve accuracy. That is, trend fuzzy information granulation-based models give multistep forecasts by predicting a trend-type fuzzy information granule (FIG) at one time, thus avoiding cumulative errors resulting from repetitive iterations. However, since trend fuzzy information granulation focuses on trend information but misses magnitude information of time series, the models based on which are decently interpretable in the sense of trend but not magnitude, leading to the accuracy-interpretability dilemma. To overcome this dilemma, we first propose a new type of FIGs, named multiamplitude FIG, to interpret amplitude features and magnitude distributions. Then we present trend-magnitude synergy-oriented fuzzy information granulation, which constructs two types of FIGs on each segment simultaneously: multilinear-trend FIG and multiamplitude FIG. They, respectively, act as trend and magnitude semantic descriptors of time series. Such fuzzy information granulation method benefits to mining multilinear-trend and multiamplitude fuzzy rules that can effectively interpret complex trend associations and magnitude associations. With such new fuzzy rules, we synergize trends and magnitudes well to develop a time series multistep forecasting model. This model operates at the granular level, predicting a multilinear-trend FIG and a multiamplitude FIG at one time. Therefore, it is with not only high accuracy but also decent interpretability thanks to the sound trend-magnitude synergy.

  abstract     = {Affective analysis is a technology that aims to understand human sentiment states, and it is widely applied in human–computer interaction and social sentiment analysis. Compared to unimodal, multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) focuses more on the complementary information and differences from multimodalities, which can better represent the actual sentiment expressed by humans. Existing MSA methods usually ignore the problem of multimodal data ambiguity and the uncertainty of influence redundant features on the sentiment discriminability. To address these issues, we propose a fuzzy attention fusion-based MSA method, called FFMSA. FFMSA alleviates the heterogeneity of multimodal data through shared and private subspaces, and solves the ambiguity using a fuzzy attention mechanism based on continuous value decision making, in order to obtain accurate sentiment features for downstream tasks. The private subspace refines the latent features within each single modality through constraints on their uniqueness, while the shared subspace learns common features using a nonparametric independence criterion algorithm. By constructing sample pairs for unsupervised contrastive learning, we use fuzzy c-means to model uncertainty to constrain the similarity between similar samples to enhance the expression of shared features. Furthermore, we adopt a multiangle modeling approach to capture the consistency and complementarity of multimodalities, dynamically adjusting the interaction between different modalities through a fuzzy attention mechanism to achieve comprehensive sentiment fusion. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our FFMSA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in MSA and emotion recognition. The proposed FFMSA achieves sentiment binary classification accuracy of 85.8% and 86.4% on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, respectively.},

Given the challenges outlined above, this article proposes an unsupervised tree-shaped axiomatic fuzzy set (AFS) clustering model with semantic framework, tailored for open-domain answer prediction. Unlike traditional rule-based methods that require repeated iterations leading to complex computational overhead, the hierarchical single-feature clustering model proposed in this article achieves high retrieval efficiency and semantic interpretability. Moreover, a retrieval strategy based on tree-structured clustering semantic descriptions for unsupervised question alignment reasoning paths is introduced, effectively enhancing the capacity for intricate reasoning of the model. The application of the AFS clustering theory to information retrieval with the single feature tree clustering method is original. Experimental results on three open domain QA datasets show the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of finite-time (FT) adaptive constraint control for flexible joint robots (FJR) stochastic system. First, by combining the command filtered backstepping method with FT control, not only does it solve the “explosion of complexity” problem, but it also ensures that the error of the FJR stochastic system converges in FT. Second, the asymmetric time-varying output constraint problem of FJR stochastic system is solved by designing a nonlinear transformation function (NTF) only depends on the system output, which reduces the difficulty of system stability analyses and relaxes the constraints on the initial value of the output. Third, by exploiting the fuzzy logic system, the adverse effect of the unknown stochastic nonlinear disturbances generated by the harmonic drive of the FJR system is effectively overcome. Furthermore, by utilizing the boundary information of dead-zone slopes, the adverse impact of the dead-zone inputs on the efficacy of control is effectively compensated. Finally, the Lyapunov approach is employed to indicate that the signals are convergent, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm.},

This approach eliminates the need for tedious computations, allowing for direct presetting of state and error bounds. The concept of “bridge hole” is introduced, referring to the states&#39; transition from unconstrained to constrained and back to unconstrained. The control method demonstrates the capability to handle multiple bridges, with the number of bridges being able to be ${\bm {n}}$ or 0.

Under the IT2 fuzzy framework, the decentralized periodic dynamic event-based fuzzy control law is proposed to reduce the bandwidth burden of communication networks. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition is presented such that closed-loop systems are exponentially stable with a given $H_{\infty }$ performance. The existence condition of the controller gains and the triggering scheme&#39;s parameters is expressed in terms of matrix inequalities.

However, the spectrum of applications for collaborative robots has been continuously broadened, and robots without the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously may not be capable of collaborating in certain scenarios. In this article, we provide a fuzzy-based multitask intelligent control framework of collaborative robots for pHRI. Our controller formulation consists of “outer-loop” and “inner-loop.” In the “outer-loop,” a fuzzy logic system predicts human desired motion trajectory for the robot to track. In the “inner-loop,” the robot is driven by a hierarchical multitask controller to track the trajectory generated by the “outer-loop” and perform other subtasks simultaneously. With null space projections, the whole task stack can be implemented in a strict task hierarchy in order of priority. The weight-tuning law of the FLSs and the hierarchical multitask control law are given based on Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed control framework is applied to a mobile manipulator and the effectiveness is verified by exploratory experiments. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and compare its performance with other approaches.},

In this article, an inverse compensation-based global fast terminal integral sliding mode control scheme with lumped uncertainty fuzzy estimation is presented for the high-precision tracking control of the DEAP actuator. On the basis of the analytical inverse of a modified Prandtl–Ishlinskii model and a square root module, an inverse compensator is developed to compensate for the hysteresis and the quadratic input nonlinearity of the DEAP actuator. For the system after inverse compensating, a K-observer is adopted to estimate the immeasurable state, and a fuzzy system is used to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Then, a global fast terminal integral sliding mode controller is devised and cascaded in series with the inverse compensator to form a closed-loop control system. The stability and the finite time convergence of the closed-loop control system are proven in theory. Finally, the practical application feasibility and the excellent performance of the developed control scheme are demonstrated via experiments on a testbench for the DEAP actuator.},

To overcome these challenges, this article introduces a novel labeling algorithm called fuzzy support vector clustering (FuSVC). FuSVC utilizes fuzzy sets to generate atomic fuzzy clusters based on critical points of the SVC decision function, subsequently shaping final crisp clusters using the similarity of these fuzzy partitions. Through more than 300 computational experiments, FuSVC demonstrates robustness in outlier detection, effectively handles overlapping clusters, and provides membership degrees for clusters with diverse silhouettes. By addressing limitations inherent in state-of-the-art labeling rules, FuSVC significantly enhances the applicability and scalability of SVC, showcasing its potential for efficient and high-quality clustering in diverse real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recent advances demonstrate that deep-learning-based approaches can achieve excitingly accurate STS measurement. However, existing studies cannot capture the spatial location of important information by attention mechanisms, fail to model sentences from the perspective of overall sentences, and neglect to deal with semantic fuzziness. In this article, we propose a novel double attentive fuzzy convolutional neural network (DAFCNN) to measure STS more accurately with the consideration of semantic fuzziness. This article first introduces the spatial attention module and combines it with the improved attentive convolutions to create a multigranularity convolutional neural network in DAFCNN, which not only extracts critical spatial location information but also models sentences from multiple perspectives at word and sentence levels. Second, DAFCNN pioneers a fuzzy learning module (FLM) to fulfill the extraction of fuzzy semantic features. By using the fuzzy membership function, fuzzy aggregation operator, and trainable parameters and weights, FLM can map sentence representations to fuzzy space to constitute representations with more accurate and rich semantics. Third, compared with various state-of-the-art STS models, DAFCNN decreases by 14.57% mean-square error, increases by 4.61% Pearson&#39;s γ and 8.57% Spearman&#39;s ρ on STS score datasets, and increases by 3.39% accuracy and 2.41% F 1-score on semantic classification dataset. The ablation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of each module of DAFCNN. Finally, the experimental results also indicate that FLM is a promising new attempt to incorporate fuzzy set theory in the NLP field.},

Due to the presence of noise, the existing deep learning methods for detecting 4mC have consistently low recognition rates in positive samples. With fuzzy rules and membership functions, fuzzy systems can achieve good results in processing noisy signals. In contrast to traditional fuzzy systems that lack deep feature representation and sample measurement, we introduce novel techniques to enhance generalization and feature representation. By incorporating the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and kernel learning algorithm into the fuzzy system, we propose the fuzzy NTK (FNTK) model and the radius-based FNTK (R-FNTK) model to predict DNA 4mC sites. To achieve better generalization performance than traditional kernel functions, we first train the NTK for feature representation learning and sample measurement. Based on the membership function and NTK matrix, different fuzzy kernel matrices are constructed for each fuzzy subset of the fuzzy system. Finally, we utilize two types of iterative kernel optimization algorithms to effectively fuse multiple NTK-based fuzzy kernels and obtain the final prediction model. Rigorous testing using six benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach, yielding significant improvements in the experiment&#39;s performance.},

This research aimed to fill this gap by developing a BN inference approach for DRA using multisource-based information fusion in an IT2FS environment via the following stages. In stage A, a fusion rule for the upper and lower membership degrees of multisource IT2FS-based information was defined using the fuzzy granulation method, and an information fusion algorithm in an IT2FS environment (Algorithm 1) was developed to fuse the multisource IT2FS-based information provided by experts. In stage B, the structure and conditional probability tables of the BN model were determined, and a BN model for conducting the DRA in an IT2FS environment was built using the BN method. In stage C, a cumulative distribution function of fused multisource IT2FS-based information was defined, the traditional Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method was improved, and a novel BN inference algorithm for implementing the DRA in an IT2FS environment (Algorithm 2) was developed using the improved LHS method. The developed BN inference approach was applied in a representative case, and the application results showed that BN inference could effectively predict dynamic risk and analyze risk sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy-rough sets (FRS) provide an outstanding theoretical tool for feature selection (FS). Whilst promising, the FRS model is sensitive to noisy information and ineffectively applicable to the data with large class density difference, with existing FRS-based FS methods only tackling one of these challenges. Therefore, to overcome both of these issues, this article presents a robust FS algorithm using linear reconstruction measure for the first time. First, a pseudo FRS model is proposed, where the distribution-aware linear reconstruction relation serving as the fuzzy similarity relation is constructed by considering the insight of meaningful information (i.e., distribution information of samples and density information of classes) to enhance the robustness and the pseudofuzzy rough approximations are further redefined based on $k$ -Nearest Neighbor ( $k$ NN) granules determined by the linear reconstruction coefficients to empower the antinoise ability. Then, the pseudo FRS model is employed to guide the robust FS algorithm from the perspective of redundant filter , strongly relevant priority , and discriminative selection to determine the final feature subset. The experimental results on 31 datasets and practical applications (i.e., cancer diagnosis and face recognition) demonstrate that the reduct gained by the proposed approach generally outperforms those attained by alternative implementations of FRS-based FS and state-of-the-art FS techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a dimensionality reduction methodology of reinforced fuzzy-rule-based neural networks (FRNNs) realized with the help of determination/correlation coefficient-based streamlined feature selection strategy and fuzzy clustering with standard deviation to cope with high-dimensional data. This approach aims to reduce the design process of the proposed networks and to curb the computational overhead inherently associated with the increasing volume of data both in terms of their number and the dimensionality of the feature space. The overall architecture and learning mechanism of the FRNNs are based on radial basis function neural networks. However, we design the hidden layer of RBFNNs differently by using fuzzy clustering, which makes it easy to determine the parameters, such as centers and widths of the receptive fields (activation functions). Unlike conventional neural networks, the RBFNNs do not have a feature to support dimensionality reduction. To overcome this limitation, FRNNs select input variables by evaluating the adjusted determination coefficient of the model. To reduce the computational burden of finding an appropriate combination of inputs, we propose a simplified feature selection and elimination technique, in which the variables are selected or eliminated by correlation coefficients. A linear function expresses the connection weight, and we apply L 2 -norm regularization to least-square-error-based learning to estimate stable coefficients (weights), which is expected to significantly improve the generalization ability. The superiority of the proposed FRNNs was demonstrated by using 28 real-world benchmark datasets. The networks are also compared with the conventional models associated with the FRNNs and several related models previously published in the literature.},

Existing internal validation indexes are implemented based on distance and variance, which cannot catpure the real “density” of the cluster. Moreover the time complexity for distance-based indexes is usually too high to be applied for large datasets. Therefore, we propose a novel internal validation index based on the differential entropy, named internal purity (IP). The proposed IP index can effectively measure the purity of a cluster without using the external cluster information, and successfully overcome the drawbacks of existing internal indexes. Based on deep representation settings, where six powerful deep pretrained representation models are used, and nondeep representation settings, we use five basic crisp and fuzzy clustering algorithms to compare our index with 17 other well-known internal indexes on five text, five image datasets, and five tabular datasets. The results show that, for 105 test cases in total, our IP index can return the optimal clustering results in 61 cases while the second best index can merely report the optimal partition in 20 cases, which demonstrates the significant superiority of our IP index when validating the goodness of the clustering results. Moreover, theoretical analysis for the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed index are also provided.},

Discontinuous activations, fuzzy terms, leakage delays, and state-dependent switching are considered into the competitive neural networks to increase the generality in practical applications. Before studying the synchronization, as an important theoretical basis, a new FxT stability lemma is established based on the method of nonscaling integral denominator, which is low conservative. Five different settling-time estimates are explicitly given by discussing the range of the exponents. Previous results are included and greatly improved. In order to achieve the FxT synchronization of the addressed DFCNNs, a continuously bounded control scheme is proposed by introducing a saturation function rather than a sign function, which cannot only solve the chattering phenomenon, but also ensure the boundedness of the control input. Some new leakage-delay-dependent synchronization criteria are derived for the DFCNNs. Finally, the validity of the main results is verified by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Multistream classification aims to predict the target stream by transferring knowledge from labeled source streams amid nonstationary processes with concept drifts. While existing methods address label scarcity, covariate shift, and asynchronous concept drift, they focus solely on the original feature space, neglecting the influence of redundant or low-quality features with uncertainties. Therefore, the advancement of this task is still challenged by how to: 1) ensure guaranteed joint representations of different streams, 2) grapple with uncertainty and interpretability during knowledge transfer, and 3) track and adapt the asynchronous drifts in each stream. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable fuzzy shared representation learning (FSRL) method based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy system. Specifically, FSRL accomplishes the nonlinear transformation of individual streams by learning the fuzzy mapping with the antecedents of the TSK fuzzy system, thereby effectively preserving discriminative information for each original stream in an interpretable way. Then, a multistream joint distribution adaptation algorithm is proposed to optimize the consequent part of the TSK fuzzy system, which learns the final fuzzy shared representations for different streams. Hence, this method concurrently investigates both the commonalities across streams and the distinctive information within each stream. Following that, window-based and GMM-based online adaptation strategies are designed to address the asynchronous drifts over time. The former can directly demonstrate the effectiveness of FSRL in knowledge transfer across multiple streams, while the GMM-based method offers an informed way to overcome the asynchronous drift problem by integrating drift detection and adaptation. Finally, extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world benchmarks with concept drift demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s effectiveness and efficiency.},

How to design a stable tracking controller for sampled-data control systems affected by unknown stochastic sampling probability is a challenging task. A stochastic sampled-data model predictive control (SSDMPC) strategy for T-S fuzzy systems (TSFSs) is proposed to overcome this challenge. First, based on the input delay approach, the considered system is modeled as a continuous-time TSFS with stochastic input delay. Then, the stochastic nature of the sampling interval is effectively mapped to the input delay within the TSFS. Second, considering the unknown characteristic of the sampling interval, a Q-learning-based online estimation algorithm is developed to acquire the sampling probability, and an event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce the computational burden of the estimation algorithm. Furthermore, the mapped stochastic input delay probability can be obtained. Third, to achieve stable tracking control of the abovementioned continuous-time TSFS with stochastic input delay, a predictive controller is designed to obtain the control law. Finally, the stability of SSDMPC is analyzed theoretically to ensure its reliability. Additionally, the effectiveness of SSDMPC is confirmed through numerical simulations.},

In addition, ignoring dialectal variations significantly hinders the performance of international English (especially American and British) TC across numerous data domains. To address this multifaceted challenge, a comprehensive and adaptable framework termed dialectic feature-based fuzzy graph learning (DFFGL) is introduced that learns feature vectors by inculcating semantics and dialect variations from the inputted text. DFFGL then proficiently extracts uniquely modified terms frequency-inverse document frequency, parts-of-speech-tagged $\mathcal {N}-\text{grams}$ , with dialect-specific dictionary features in the fuzzy feature space to realize a novel language model. Later, these fuzzified features are affined by a novel fuzzy distance measure to construct an interpretable fuzzy graph that is then optimized using a novel elastic net regularizer for characterizing nodal relations, promising efficient classification through effective label propagation. Exhaustive $F1-$ score evaluations on 6 English corpora and 17 diverse datasets reveal DFFGL&#39;s superiority in consistently registering over 93% and 80% in dialect identification and TC even with just 10 labeled samples. Furthermore, DFFGL offers remarkable $F1-$ score improvements of 10.2% and 17.3% over its peers in respective tasks, highlighting its extension to real-world data classification.},

However, evidential clustering needs to estimate more parameters compared with other clustering algorithms, and thus the clustering performance of evidential clustering will be greatly affected if data is insufficient or contaminated. In addition, the existing evidential clustering algorithms can not well deal with high-dimensional data such as texts and images. To solve the above problems, an evidential clustering algorithm based on transfer learning and deep autoencoder (TDEC) is proposed. The TDEC utilizes deep autoencoder to obtain evidential clustering-friendly representations of the original data, and applies the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) constraint between the source network and the target network, so that the network can learn domain-invariant features. The algorithm jointly trains the deep evidential clustering networks in the source domain and the target domain, and realizes the deep feature representations of high-dimensional data in the target domain for evidential clustering by minimizing reconstruction loss, entropy-based evidential clustering loss, MMD loss and the regular penalty term of the network parameters. In addition, an iterative optimization method to solve the TDEC objective function is proposed. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the clustering performance of the proposed TDEC algorithm compared with the existing shallow transfer clustering algorithms and deep clustering algorithms. For both image and text clustering tasks, the proposed TDEC achieved approximately 5% performance improvement over the comparison algorithms on average. In addition, the practical application value of the proposed TDEC algorithm was demonstrated in unsupervised remote sensing image scene classification.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential increase in the volume of medical images. To optimize clinical practice, physicians often require efficient retrieval of images from various medical image databases. However, the inherent structural and textural similarities between medical images add complexity to retrieval. Traditional methods and deep learning-based hashing techniques have limitations, including their sensitivity to adversarial examples and insufficient robustness. Adversarial learning through generative adversarial networks offers an effective solution to address these challenges. In this article, we propose a vision transformer hashing with residual fuzzy generation (ViTH-RFG) for targeted attacks in medical image retrieval. ViTH-RFG comprises a ViTH model, a prototype network, a residual fuzzy generator, and a discriminator. ViTH employs the vision transformer as a feature extraction module and, to better adapt to medical images, cleverly integrates a spatial pyramid pooling layer into the multihead attention mechanism to extract and fuse medical image features at different scales. The prototype network takes image labels as input, transmitting the extracted semantic features to the residual fuzzy generator to facilitate the generation of adversarial examples. In the residual fuzzy generator, we introduce residual fuzzy blocks and embed a fuzzy layer to handle the complex relationships between feature maps and the corresponding generated examples, thereby enhancing the model&#39;s performance in the face of targeted attacks. The discriminator is responsible for identifying whether an image is an original or a generated example. Finally, experiments on ChestX-ray14 and ISIC 2018 verified the effectiveness of ViTH-RFG in targeted attack scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) being a significant subtype. Detecting IDC is a challenging task that can be hindered by the oversight of important contextual cues within whole slide images (WSIs). To address this issue, we present the Sequential-LSTM Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Detection with EfficientNet (SLIDE-Net) framework. SLIDE-Net synchronizes tissue image patch locations within WSIs, allowing for comprehensive and subtle identification of IDC. The inherent issue of data imbalance in IDC datasets, particularly the variable density of positive IDC patches concerning WSI size, is effectively tackled through the introduction of adaptive fuzzy C-Mean as a data balancing policy. This novel approach enhances model efficacy and robustness, resulting in superior performance across key metrics, such as accuracy (86%), balanced accuracy (BAC) (86%), sensitivity (87%), specificity (86%), and GMean (86%). Our findings were substantiated by a comprehensive analysis revealing the significant cross-patch dependencies observed among patches of similar classes. When tested on the balanced PatchCAM dataset, SLIDE-Net once again showcased superiority with accuracy (89%), BAC (89%), F1-Score (87%), sensitivity (87%), and specificity (90%). This underscores the efficient utilization of shared contextual information within WSIs. These results firmly establish SLIDE-Net as a robust and reliable solution for accurate IDC detection. Our work not only advances the precision of IDC detection, but also contributes valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of histopathology image analysis, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic accuracy in the ongoing battle against breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {Most of the previous machine learning-based models for multimodal medical diagnosis, primarily designed for unimodal images, usually do not fully leverage the potential of multimodal medical images, leading to limited classification accuracy. These conventional methods typically focus only on the intermodality common information, neglecting the intramodality specific information and assuming that the common information is more effective in disease diagnosis. Moreover, they do not adequately address the impact of fuzzy information between different medical imaging modalities on diagnostic results. To this end, we propose a modality fuzzy information separation network for disease classification, which extracts both common and specific information from fuzzy information to construct a comprehensive representation of multimodal medical images. Specifically, we extract modality invariant features as common information by explicitly modeling and maximizing loss constraints on mutual information. For specific information extraction, a constraint on feature space independence between specific and common information is imposed on each modality. Above-mentioned two steps, we concatenate common information and specific information to construct a comprehensive multimodal representation for separating fuzzy information. Finally, we purposely design a decoder network to reconstruct medical images from unimodal specific information and common information to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modality fuzzy information separation network. We conducted a validation of the proposed method&#39;s performance in classifying cardiomegaly, pneumothorax, edema, and skin disease. The experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid parallel fuzzy convolutional neural network (HP-FCNN) is a ground-breaking method for medical image analysis that combines the interpretive capacity of fuzzy logic with the capabilities of a convolutional neural network (CNN). This novel combination tackles problems related to brain image processing, reducing problems such as noise and hazy borders that are common in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike other CNN models, the HP-FCNN combines fine-grained fuzzy representations with crisp CNN features, improving interpretability by displaying hidden layers. This insight into activation patterns facilitates comprehension of the decision-making processes necessary for the diagnosis of brain diseases. The HP-FCNN outperforms other pretrained models (ResNet, DenseNet, visual geometry group (VGG), and EfficientNet) on measures such as the confusion matrix and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), according to comparative assessments. Furthermore, the addition of adaptive class activation mapping (AD-CAM) enhances the HP-FCNN by identifying salient features during backpropagation and bolstering the network&#39;s capacity to enhance brain illness diagnosis and treatment planning. Our methodology, incorporating AD-CAM, yielded compelling results with a 96.86 F1-Score, 96.41 AUC, and 96.81 accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in achieving high-performance metrics in brain MRI analysis. With a 15% increase in accuracy, a 10% increase in sensitivity, and a 12% decrease in false positives, the HP-FCNN outperforms its predecessors. These impressive advancements represent a quantifiable breakthrough in the capabilities of medical image processing technology; they are more than just anecdotal evidence.},

  abstract     = {Extracting latent disease patterns from electronic health records (EHRs) is a crucial solution for disease analysis, significantly facilitating healthcare decision-making. Multiview learning presents itself as a promising approach that offers a comprehensive exploration of both structured and unstructured EHRs. However, the intrinsic uncertainty among disease features presents a significant challenge for multiview feature alignment. Besides, the sparsity of real-world EHRs also exacerbates the difficulty of feature alignment. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fuzzy multiview graph learning framework named FuzzyMVG, which is designed for mitigating the impacts of uncertainty in disease features derived from sparse EHRs. First, we utilize auxiliary information from sparse EHRs to construct a multiview EHR graph using the structured and unstructured records. Then, for efficient feature alignment, we specially design the fuzzy logic-enhanced graph convolutional networks to obtain the fuzzy representations of time-invariant node features. Thereby, we implement a random walk strategy and long short-term memory networks to capture the distinct features of static and dynamic nodes, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world MIMIC III dataset to validate the effectiveness of FuzzyMVG. Results in the diagnosis prediction task demonstrate that FuzzyMVG outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.},

The disease&#39;s toxic phase is lethal, making prompt identification and control measures crucial. The emergence of the latest technologies and data analytics techniques, such as edge-cloud computing, data analytics, and machine learning/deep learning, has played a pivotal role in revolutionizing remote healthcare services. Henceforth, applying the abovementioned technologies leads to improvements in the response time, service quality, and location awareness of healthcare systems. Relative to this context, we propose an intelligent fuzzy-centric fog–cloud-assisted healthcare framework to identify and control yellow fever epidemics. Initially, at the fog layer, singular value decomposition is used for data dimensionality reduction analysis and the Fuzzy-C mean clustering (FCM) algorithm is leveraged to get rigorous results. Moreover, for better results and to focus on time-series patterns, the deep interval type 2 fuzzy Bi-LSTM model is proposed at the cloud layer to generate a yellow fever severity index and visualize each yellow fever region based on self-organized maps. In addition, we propose an alert generation mechanism to facilitate real-time decision-making. Finally, results show that the proposed system yields significant efficacy, compared with other state-of-the-art methodologies.},

  abstract     = {As a distributed intelligent paradigm, fuzzy federated learning (FuzzyFL) can reduce the uncertainty and noise of biomedical data and is suited to enhance the accurate detection of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The advanced paradigm requires the hospitals to share the gradient of the fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) rather than biomedical data. Not only that, the recent research works have been devoted to privacy-preserving FuzzyFL for secure AIS detection that adds differential privacy-based noise to the gradients against membership inference attack, attribute inference attack. However, a novel reconstruction attack called gradient leakage attack (GLA) on inferring biomedical data over the gradient brings the security challenges to FuzzyFL and, thus, has a negative influence on AIS detection. It is natural to ask a fundamental question: Can differentially private FuzzyFL for AIS detection over biomedical data defend GLA? In this article, we construct a privacy-preserving FuzzyFL framework called PrivateFuzzyFL that offers a great opportunity to present the systematic evaluation of the private FDNN threatened by the GLAs. In our experiments on a set of chest X-ray images and four FDNNs, we compare more than ten private fuzzy federated optimization algorithms in terms of the defense effect and the utility cost and derive that, first, the existing private FDNNs in FuzzyFL can offer a certain amount of privacy protection for biomedical data against the GLA; and second, the perturbation algorithm with better defense effect usually causes the worse AIS detection of the FDNN.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is the leading neurodegenerative disorder and primary cause of dementia. Researchers are increasingly drawn to automated diagnosis of AD using neuroimaging analyses. Conventional deep learning (DL) models excel in constructing learning classifiers in early-stage AD diagnosis. However, they often struggle with AD diagnosis due to uncertainties stemming from unclear annotations by experts, challenges in data collection, such as data harmonization issues, and limitations in equipment resolution. These factors contribute to imprecise data, hindering accurate analysis, interpretation of obtained results, and understanding of complex symptoms. In response, the integration of fuzzy logic into DL, forming fuzzy deep learning (FDL), effectively manages imprecise data and provides interpretable insights, offering a valuable advancement in AD. Therefore, exploring recent advancements in integrating DL with fuzzy logic is crucial for improving AD diagnosis. In this review, we explore the contributions of fuzzy logic within FDL models, focusing on fuzzy-based image preprocessing, segmentation, and classification. Moreover, in exploring research directions, we discuss the possibility of the fusion of multimodal data with fuzzy logic, addressing challenges in AD diagnosis. Leveraging fuzzy logic and membership while integrating diverse datasets, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics may provide an effective development of a DL classifier. In addition, fuzzy explainable DL promises more accurate and linguistically interpretable decision support systems for AD diagnosis. The primary objective of this article is to serve as a comprehensive and authoritative resource for newcomers, researchers, and clinicians interested in employing FDL models for AD diagnosis.},

Inspired by these, this article introduces an effective lung organ segmentation method called fuzzy attention-based border rendering feature orthogonal network, which 1) integrates an efficient transformer-like fuzzy-attention module into deep networks to cope with the uncertainty in feature representations; 2) decouples and depicts the lung organ regions as cube-trees by focusing only on recycle -sampling border vulnerable points, rendering the severely discontinuous, false-negative/positive organ regions with two novel global-local cube-tree fusion and sparse patched feature orthogonal modules; 3) develops a multiscale self-knowledge guidance module to improve model performance and robustness.

To accurately classify MFGIs, we propose a novel approach termed fuzzy channel filter-based separable convolution neural networks (FSCNN). The original design of FSCNN comprises the following components: 1) Designing the fuzzy channel filter (FCF) module, devised to establish long-distance feature dependencies for each feature channel with the input image by formulating fuzzy rules “IF–THEN”. 2) The FCF-based separable convolution (FSC) block uses depth-wise and point-wise convolutions to extract and mix feature channels. Then, the internal information of each feature channel is reintegrated through fuzzy weighted averaging in FCF to enhance fine-grained feature information. 3) Creating the deep fuzzy learning architecture FSCNN through the superimposition of FSC blocks. This architectural arrangement enables more effective learning of fine-grained feature distinctions within MFGIs, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Compared to other advanced fine-grained classification models, including state-of-the-art models, our model outperforms by 2%–6% and 3%–9% on brain MRI and pneumonia CT datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is a progressive eye disorder that can lead to permanent vision loss if not identified and treated promptly. Thus, timely glaucoma detection is paramount to developing a more efficient treatment plan and saving vision loss. Despite the promising performance achieved by deep learning methods in specific convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for glaucoma screening using fundus images, they are confined to binary classification tasks (i.e., healthy versus glaucoma) and cannot detect glaucoma stages. However, it is challenging to diagnose the glaucoma stages accurately due to considerable interstage similarities, the subtle changes in the size of lesions, and the presence of irrelevant features. Moreover, fundus images encompass significant uncertain information, which cannot be effectively captured through conventional CNNs. To solve these problems, we present a novel fuzzy joint attention-guided network called FJA-Net for the screening of glaucoma stages. Specifically, we introduce a fuzzy joint attention module (FJAM) on top of a backbone, composed of a local–global channel and spatial attention block, to learn comprehensive feature correlations along the relevant channels and spatial positions, each followed by a fuzzy layer to reduce the uncertainty in the feature representations. The FJAM aids in learning stage-specific and fine-grained features from critical regions of the fundus images. In addition, we propose a combined loss function to train the parameters of our FJA-Net to ensure better generalization and robustness. We evaluate the proposed model on two datasets, and the results of the comparative analysis demonstrate that our FJA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based glaucoma classification approaches.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the challenge posed by the unpredictable and recurrent nature of epileptic seizures, which stand among the most significant neurological conditions, remains imperative, especially within settings inundated with high patient flow. The prompt identification of these seizures is paramount for effective patient care. Unfortunately, existing epilepsy seizure detection systems encounter limitations in availability and interpretability, thereby constraining their reliability and widespread application. Presently, neurophysiologists heavily rely on visually interpreting electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings displayed on screens to identify seizures. This article introduces an innovative method dedicated to detecting epileptic seizures within EEG signals, leveraging a specifically tailored fuzzy deep learning (FDL) architecture. The proposed methodology encompasses crucial stages of preprocessing and feature extraction, augmented by the utilization of explainable artificial intelligence models, such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) for enhancing model interpretability. The developed FDL model demonstrates promising results, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 92.57%, precision of 0.96 for “normal” and 0.89 for “abnormal,” recall of 0.91 for “normal” and 0.94 for “abnormal,” and F1-score of 0.93 for “normal” and 0.91 for “abnormal,” affirming its robustness in classification tasks. In addition, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed FDL, comparisons are performed with long-short term memory networks and 1-D convolutional neural network model models. The integration of LIME and SHAP significantly enhances the interpretability of the model, providing valuable insights into influential features. This comprehensive framework adeptly balances accuracy and interpretability, thereby making a substantial stride in advancing EEG-based diagnostic tools.},

  abstract     = {Medical visual question answering (medical VQA) is a critical cross-modal interaction task that garnered considerable attention in the medical domain. Several existing methods commonly leverage the vision-and-language pretraining paradigms to mitigate the limitation of small-scale data. Nevertheless, most of them still suffer from two challenges that remain for further research: 1) limited research focuses on distilling representation from a complete modality to guide the representation learning of masked data in other modalities. 2) Multimodal fusion based on self-attention mechanisms cannot effectively handle the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of information interaction across modalities. To mitigate these issues, in this article, we propose a novel deep fuzzy multiteacher distillation (DFMD) network for medical VQA, which can take advantage of fuzzy logic to model the uncertainties from vison-language representations across modalities in a multiteacher framework. Specifically, a multiteacher knowledge distillation module is conceived to assist in reconstructing the missing semantics under the supervision signal generated by teachers from the other complete modality, achieving more robust semantic interaction across modalities. Incorporating insights from the fuzzy logic theory, we propose a noise-robust encoder called FuzBERT that enables our DFMD model to reduce the imprecision and ambiguity in feature representation during the multimodal interaction process. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to combine the fuzzy logic theory with the transformer-based encoder to effectively learn multimodal representation for medical VQA. Experimental results on the VQA-RAD and SLAKE datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DFMD method over state-of-the-art baselines.},

In the presence of everyday reverberant noise, a substantial proportion of individual users encounter challenges in speech comprehension. This study introduces a novel application of neuro-fuzzy modeling that synergizes and fuses audio-visual speech enhancement (AV SE) with an initial user preference learning based framework. Specifically, our approach uniquely integrates multimodal AV speech data with innovative SE methods and fuzzy inferencing techniques. This integration is further enriched by incorporating a user-preference learning model that adapts to environmental and user-specific contexts, including signal-to-noise ratios, sound power, and the quality of visual information. The proposed framework facilitates the incorporation of clinical measures such as user cognitive load (or listening effort) with real-world uncertainty to steer the system outputs. We employ an adaptive fuzzy neural network to derive the most effective Sugeno fuzzy inference model, employing particle swarm optimization to ensure optimal SE by considering sound power, ambient noise levels, and visual quality. Experimental results utilize our new benchmark AV multitalker challenge dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our user preference-informed, context-aware AV SE approach in enhancing speech intelligibility and quality in challenging noisy conditions, marking a significant advancement over conventional methods while reducing energy consumption. The conclusion supports the ecological scalability of our approach and its potential for real-world applications, setting a new benchmark in AV SE research, paving the way for future assistive hearing and communication technologies.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an innovative approach to the design of a hybrid fuzzy classifier, with a focus on exploring the classification capability of a conventional fuzzy polynomial neural network (CFPNN). The proposed novel self-organizing hybrid fuzzy polynomial NN classifier (HFPNNC) improves performance while maintaining model interpretability and fixability by synergistically combining an adaptive network structure and the compound regularization technique (CRT). Recent studies have focused on exploring the potential of CFPNN structures for addressing regression issues. To effectively introduce the CFPNN framework to multiclassification tasks, a resilient fuzzy polynomial neural network structure was designed as a basic subclassifier to construct the proposed HFPNNC. The proposed HFPNNC employs a dynamically adaptive structure comprising of two types of critical layers: 1) the fuzzy set-based polynomial neurons layers and 2) the polynomial neurons layers. This allows the classifier to adapt to the complexity of classification tasks. To further strengthen the robustness and generalization ability of the HFPNNC, we incorporate the synergistic combination of probabilistic constrained competitive response selection (PCCRS) and ℓ2-norm regularization least squares estimation (ℓ2-LSE) methods to manage the generation of network layers and the estimation of neuron weights. As key constituents of the CRT approach, the PCCRS and ℓ2-LSE method strike a balance between model complexity and performance. The effectiveness of the proposed HFPNNC is thoroughly evaluated against classical classifiers, state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers and deep learning baseline models using 17 public datasets, two real-world datasets, and three large-scale datasets. HFPNNC achieves the best prediction in 72.7% of the data. The experimental results and the statistical analysis show a remarkable advantage of the HFPNNC over existing methods, confirming its potential as a flexible, interpretable solution for classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the distributed zero-sum differential game adaptive control problem of six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles under denial-of-service attacks based on the self-triggered mechanism. First, a fuzzy-logic-system-based identifier-critic framework is structured to obtain the alternative approximate solution with fewer learning parameters. Then, a novel optimal value function, considering the optimal control signal, worst disturbance signal, steady-state, and dynamic performances, is designed. Subsequently, an improved self-triggered strategy, featuring negative feedback adjustment between the threshold and system consensus error, is proposed to reduce the communication resource loss and decrease the influence of introducing the self-triggered mechanism on the system performance. Unlike the event-triggered strategy, the next trigger moment of the self-triggered strategy is determined by the current information, eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of the trigger state, which is more convenient for the physical implementation. Moreover, the connectivity-broken denial-of-service attacks on the information transmission process among unmanned aerial vehicles are considered. Next, through the transformation between stabilization control and cooperative control, the difficulty of realizing cooperative control caused by the temporarily disrupted topological relationships due to denial-of-service attacks is solved effectively. Using Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals of six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles are bounded, and the consensus control performance is achieved. Finally, the rationality of the designed zero-sum differential game adaptive control scheme is verified by some simulation results.},

Among them, graph-based clustering methods have become a hot spot in the field of unsupervised clustering due to their good ability to process nonlinear data. Unfortunately, they usually suffer from high time complexity and cumbersome regularization parameter tuning, so their practical applications are greatly limited. To this end, we propose an efficient graph-cut algorithm called fS2F. Based on the similarity graph between the dataset and landmark subset, fS2F transforms the membership learning of the entire dataset into a clustering problem of representative points, which greatly improves its clustering efficiency. In addition, fS2F softly constrains the cluster size in a way that does not require additional regularization parameters so that it can be widely and conveniently applied. The article also presents the optimization method for this model and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments.},

  abstract     = {In practical applications, datasets frequently encompass noise, outliers, and imbalanced classes, which can markedly affect a model&#39;s generalization performance. Support vector machine (SVM) and its twin variant i.e., TWSVM tend to be biased towards the majority class samples, leading to misclassification of the minority class samples. TWSVM suffers from this biasness as it generates hyperplanes without considering preceding data information. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose bell-shaped fuzzy least square twin support vector machine for imbalance data (BSFLSTSVM-ID). The proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID allocates weight to the majority class samples through a novel membership function, namely, “class probability and bell-shaped” (CPBS). The CPBS function is amalgamation of class probability, bell-shaped function, and imbalance ratio of the dataset. The bell-shaped function&#39;s value diminishes as data points move farther away from the class center, reducing the influence of noise or outliers in constructing hyperplanes. To underscore the importance of samples from minority class, a weight of one is assigned to them. Furthermore, the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID utilizes the conjugate gradient method to handle the challenge of matrix inversion. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 59 UCI and KEEL datasets with imbalance ratios from 1 to 72.69. Additionally, we tested the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID model&#39;s scalability on NDC datasets and applied it to diagnosing breast cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s disease using the BreakHis and Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID outperforms baseline models, highlighting its potential for tackling classification challenges in the biomedical domain.},

  abstract     = {Multiview fuzzy c-means clustering has garnered significant attention in recent years, leading to the development of various multiview fuzzy clustering algorithms. However, existing algorithms still exhibit room for improvement. First, most existing algorithms only utilize the shallow information of the view data and fail to delve into the mining and utilization of deeper representations. Second, existing algorithms tend to extract common representations among the views first and then implement clustering separately, which may lack a collaborative linkage between two tasks. Finally, multiview clustering algorithms based on representation learning often overlook the importance of effectively preserving similarity information within the views. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm called pseudolabel enhanced multiview deep concept factorization fuzzy clustering (PE-MV-DCFCM). The algorithm first introduces a deep concept factorization method to uncover the deep information of the view data. Subsequently, it employs pseudolabel learning to preserve intraview similarity information during the learning of common representations among the views, based on non-negative matrix factorization. Finally, this algorithm integrates deep concept factorization, representation learning, and fuzzy clustering into a unified framework to enhance the collaboration among the various substeps of the algorithm. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed PE-MV-DCFCM algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, the increasing complexity and dimensionality of datasets pose significant challenges in the selection of features. Focusing on these challenges, this article proposes a cascaded two-stage feature clustering and selection algorithm for fuzzy decision systems. In the first stage, we reduce the search space by clustering relevant features and addressing interfeature redundancy. In the second stage, a clustering-based sequentially forward selection method that explores the global and local structure of data is presented. We propose a novel metric for assessing the significance of features, which considers both global separability and local consistency. Global separability measures the degree of intraclass cohesion and interclass separation based on fuzzy membership, providing a comprehensive understanding of data separability. Meanwhile, local consistency leverages the fuzzy neighborhood rough set (FNRS) model to capture uncertainty and fuzziness in the data. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is evaluated through experiments conducted on 18 public datasets and a real-world schizophrenia dataset. The experiment results demonstrate our algorithm&#39;s superiority over benchmarking algorithms in both classification accuracy and the number of selected features.},

This strategy provides easily measurable information, surpassing the complexities associated with obtaining transition probabilities. Moreover, the variations in nonhomogeneous sojourn probability are controlled by a deterministic switching signal, enabling wider applicability compared to existing methods. The fading degree of transmitted data are assessed through a censoring strategy, and the measurement is modeled using a Tobit model. Considering the presence of nonuniform sampling periods and asynchronous premise variables, a general asynchronous fuzzy filtering method is carried out, and sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the mean-square stability of the resulting system.

Distinct from the existing studies related to the H–R neuronal model, this research focuses on addressing nonlinearities of membrane potential through a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy approach. A sampled-data-based controller scheme that can resolve the stabilization issues inherent to the H–R neuronal model is proposed. Compared with many existing control schemes, sampled-data control has several advantages, which include easy digital implementation and robustness against transmission delays. This research utilizes the zero-order holder technique to handle discrete-time control actions in a continuous-time T–S fuzzy model. Furthermore, synchronization analysis pertaining to the T–S fuzzy-based H–R model with user-designed control inputs is conducted to understand and overcome the associated spiking, chaotic, and bursting behaviors. Closed-loop dynamics of the resulting model with and without control input, namely, the error model, are analyzed by employing the Lyapunov stability theory and integral inequalities. Specifically, a suitable Lyapunov Krasovskii functional is formulated and solved using the linear matrix inequalities technique to guarantee the global asymptotically stability of the error model. The developed theoretical framework is validated using numerical simulations, and the corresponding outcomes are graphically illustrated and discussed.},

Unfortunately, there always exist various kinds of uncertainties, such as attribute noise and network topology corruption, in raw graphs. Under the message passing mechanism, certainties are likely to spread throughout the whole graph. Matters like these would induce deep graph models into producing uncertain representations and restrict representation expressiveness. Considering this, we propose a pioneering framework to defend graph uncertainties by improving the robustness and capability of graph neural networks (GNNs). In our framework, we consider that weights and biases are all fuzzy numbers, thus generating representations to assimilate graph uncertainties, which are finally released by defuzzification. To describe the process of the framework, in this article, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to construct a robust graph model, called FuzzyGCN. To verify the effectiveness of FuzzyGCN, it is trained in both supervised and unsupervised ways. In the supervised setting, we find that FuzzyGCN has stronger power and is more immune to data uncertainties when compared with various classical and robust GNNs. In the unsupervised setting, FuzzyGCN surpasses many state-of-the-art models in node classification and community detection over several real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {The primary goal of the article is to introduce the relaxed TS fuzzy model transformation, a method that enhances the original TS fuzzy model transformation in two ways. First, it focuses on achieving a more efficient reduction of the number of antecedent fuzzy sets—hence, the fuzzy rules of the TS fuzzy models—while minimizing the approximation error. Second, it aims to reduce the computational load required for the transformation process. With the first enhancement, the proposed transformation strikes a better balance between the number of fuzzy rules and the approximation accuracy of TS fuzzy models. With the second enhancement, a unique pre- and postprocessing of the TS fuzzy model transformation is introduced leading to the radical computational improvements. The core part of the original TS fuzzy model transformation is the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) used to balance the approximation quality with the number of fuzzy rules by truncating singular values. The HOSVD itself is a computationally intensive algorithm, the possibilities for advancements in its implementation seem to be limited as much research has focused on its optimization in the past and had reached its pinnacle in terms of computational complexity more than a decade ago. Therefore, the approach presented in this article does not concentrates directly on enhancing HOSVD further, but instead proposes a unique pre- and postprocessing technique for the tensor on which HOSVD is applied, tailored to the special characteristics of the TS fuzzy model and the system model under consideration. Following a description of the proposed enhancements, the article presents numerical examples and two examples of real-world engineering models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relaxed TS fuzzy model transformation compared to the original TS fuzzy model transformation.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive fuzzy bipartite consensus tracking control scheme for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with dead-zone inputs and actuator faults. The consensus problem for unbalanced communication topology of the MASs is difficult to deal with. First, the hierarchical algorithm is introduced to transform the consensus tracking problem for multiagents into the tracking problem of the single agent. Then, the novel error transformation and coordinate transformation are proposed based on the hierarchical design theory, leading to the condition of global Laplacian matrix information unnecessary so that the computational difficulty and communication burden are significantly reduced. Besides, the control performance would be seriously affected by the input constraints such as dead-zone and faults. There is a balance between the input constraints and the output constraints for MASs, but these two constraints are handled independently in the most existing works. Thus, a flexible performance function is developed to balance the system performance and the stability requirements by flexible signal switching. The proposed adaptive fuzzy control scheme ensures that not only the influence of the dead-zone and various types of actuator faults is eliminated, but also the preassigned finite-time tracking performance is achieved. Finally, the simulation experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the established control scheme.},

The dynamic quantization strategy is adopted to quantize the multipath signals. The multipath packet dropouts are modeled as two mutually independent Bernoulli distribution random sequences. The observer-based controller design of T–S fuzzy NCSs is fulfilled through a novel observer design strategy. New results are derived to ensure that the closed-loop T–S fuzzy NCSs are stochastically stable with a certain GC function.

A critical hurdle in the application of fuzzy logic systems lies in their limited capability to directly approximate the variables across spatial and temporal scales. This article investigates the fuzzy approximation problem of uncertain nonlinear spatiotemporal systems. A novel multilayer fuzzy supremum approximation (MFSA) is designed to map a spatiotemporal function to a state-based iterative supremum function by separating the time-varying parameters, which can be further approximated using the proposed fuzzy upremum approximation algorithm. It is indicated that MFSA is an effective approximation method for spatiotemporal functions as compared to the references. Subsequently, MFSA is developed into the leader–following synchronization problem of discrete-time multiagent systems. The MFSA-based observer and synchronization control schemes are designed by removing the assumption that either the leader&#39;s control input or the bound of the leader&#39;s control input is a known prior to each follower. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of the observer estimation errors and synchronization errors are achieved. The corresponding simulations indicate the efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract     = {For accomplishing efficiency analysis and resource planning of organizations in various sectors, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has attracted many researchers&#39; interest. Rather than requiring accurate measurement of input and output data, traditional fuzzy DEA models have been constructed to cope with scenarios when the corresponding data can be represented using conventional fuzzy numbers. Unfortunately, the traditional models are still limited to cases where inputs and outputs take the form of fuzzy numbers, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where some inputs and outputs may possess the essence of intuitionistic fuzziness. This paper aims to break the limitation and constructs an interactive approach for intuitionistic fuzzy DEA models, which enables decision makers to present their preferences in the decision-making process. Firstly, this study introduces the comparison rules of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, thereby incorporates feasibility degrees into the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy DEA model, which enables decision makers to present their preferences for the trade-off between the satisfaction degree of constraints and that of the objective functions. Subsequently, this paper defines the algebraic operation rules for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, hence constructs operation rules for expected intervals and expected values. Further, by employing comparison rules and operation rules this research transforms the intuitionistic fuzzy DEA model into a linear programming, which facilitates problem-solving. Finally, one illustrative example is employed and compared with an existing one, which shows that our approach has significant advantages over previous approaches.},

Specifically, fuzzy logic systems aim to approximate unknown nonlinear terms, and the adaptive backstepping control achieves tracking of the desired motion state by recursively designing the virtual references and control laws. Compared with the existing FBC, the practicality is enhanced in the sense that: 1) simultaneous compliance with prescribed performance and state constraints; 2) no need for the tricky process of finding feasibility conditions for virtual references under strict constraints; and 3) insensitive to system initial conditions for the tracking error convergence of the constrained system. These advanced features lie in the improvement of backstepping protocols through the novel coordinate transformation mechanism, the designed asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions, and adaptive fixed-time control laws. Application and comparison studies based on a laboratory-developed cable-driven manipulator not only confirm the effectiveness but also show the advantages of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Belief rule base (BRB) has attracted considerable interest due to its interpretability and exceptional modeling accuracy. Generally, BRB construction relies on prior knowledge or historical data. The limitations of knowledge constrain the knowledge-based BRB and are unsuitable for use in large-scale rule bases. Data-driven techniques excel at extracting model parameters from data, thus significantly improving the accuracy of BRB. However, the previous data-based BRBs neglected the study of interpretability, and some still depend on prior knowledge or introduce additional parameters. All these factors make the BRB highly problem-specific and limit its broad applicability. To address these problems, a model-agnostic statistical BRB (MAS-BRB) modeling approach is proposed in this article. It adopts an MAS methodology for parameter extraction, ensuring that the parameters both fulfill their intended roles within the BRB framework and accurately represent complex, nonlinear data relationships. A comprehensive interpretability analysis of MAS-BRB components further confirms their compliance with established BRB interpretability standards. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that MAS-BRB not only achieves improved modeling performance but also shows greater effectiveness compared to existing rule-based and traditional machine learning models.},

Due to the impact of network environment, a novel framework of DMET-based controller scheme is constructed by considering the premise variable asynchronous and mode asynchronous phenomena between the plant and controller simultaneously. The imperfect premise matching and hidden semi-Markov model approaches are employed to resolve two types of mismatches. The redundant channel communication strategy with quantization measurement is used to improve the nonfragility of signal transmission. In terms of the stochastic theory and fuzzy model technique, some criteria are forwarded to ensure the stochastic stability and strict dissipative performance for closed-loop T-S FSMJSs.

Most of the existing multilabel embedded feature selection methods are based on least squares regression, which loses a lot of statistical and structural information. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we established an optimization framework based on fuzzy mutual information that considers global correlation to obtain the weight of each feature. Under this framework, many repeated entropy operations are avoided. Then, the weight of each feature is introduced into the orthogonal regression optimization framework as prior knowledge. Finally, two optimization frameworks are comprehensively considered for MFS. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of multilabel data, we extend the proposed method to feature-specific MFS.

For a traditional rule-based binary classification algorithm, classification rules are usually deterministic, which results in the fuzzy information contained in the rules being ignored. To do so, this article employs iterative feature selection in fuzzy rule-based binary classification. The proposed algorithm combines feature selection based on fuzzy correlation family with rule mining based on biclustering. It first conducts biclustering on the dataset after feature selection. Then it conducts feature selection again for the biclusters according to the feedback of biclusters evaluation. In this way, an iterative feature selection framework is built. During the iteration process, it stops until the obtained bicluster meets the requirements. In addition, the rule membership function is introduced to extract vectorized fuzzy rules from the bicluster and construct weak classifiers. The weak classifiers with good classification performance are selected by adaptive boosting and the strong classifier is constructed by “weighted average.” Finally, we perform the proposed algorithm on different datasets and compare it with other peers. Experimental results show that it achieves good classification performance and outperforms its peers.},

  abstract     = {Pattern recognition plays an important role in the process of knowledge discovery. The construction of easily describable and interpretable classification rules is of vital importance in pattern recognition. In this study, we propose a development of fuzzy rule-based classifier for multiclass classification problems and elaborate on a privacy-preserving realization of the proposed methodology in the presence of decentralized datasets. Fuzzy rule-based models provide an effective and efficient alternative for characterizing the complex relationship between the input variables and target classes. An overall design process of the proposed classifier consists of two main phases: (a) formation of information granules (clusters) to reveal the underlying structure of the training data, and (b) construction of local classification rules whose outputs reflect the probability distribution of the input data over all the classes. The constructed information granules form a backbone of the architecture of the classifier while the optimization of the parameters of local rules is carried out through using a gradient descent method with the guidance of the cross-entropy loss function. Furthermore, a federated gradient-based optimization mechanism is utilized to construct fuzzy classifier in a privacy-preserving approach. The originalities of the proposed methodology are twofold: first, a design of fuzzy classifier through the synergy of cluster-centric architecture and the cross-entropy loss function is presented. Second, we augment the proposed fuzzy classifier based on the concept of federated learning such that it can learn from distributed data without sacrificing data security and confidentiality. Experiments are carried out on a two-dimensional synthetic dataset and a number of real-world datasets. Experimental results show the excellent classification capability of the proposed classifier realized in the centralized way and in the federated learning environment.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised anomaly detection (WSAD) has gained increasing attention due to its core idea of enhancing the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection by leveraging prior knowledge from a limited number of labeled anomalies. In this article, we introduce a novel WSAD framework that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, exhibits greater robustness to data uncertainty, and is more efficient in utilizing limited labeled anomalies. Our method is built upon twin fuzzy networks (TFN) that learn robust fuzzy if–then rules from a pairwise training set. TFN can extract informative prototypes of training instances, exploiting the very few labeled anomalies efficiently. A two-stage sequential training scheme, comprising fuzzy C-means clustering and interpolation consistency regularization, ensures that the fuzzy rules form a solid foundation for anomaly detection while improving TFN&#39;s generalization ability. The training process of TFN relies on closed-form optimization rather than gradient-based methods, leading to significantly faster training speeds. Comprehensive experiments conducted on numerous real-world datasets confirm the advantages of the TFN framework over existing alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy convex optimization problems with fuzzy coefficients (FCOPFCs) arise in many applications. Although many neurodynamics-based models have been proposed for solving FCOPFCs, most of them are designed for FCOPFCs with equality or inequality constraints only. However, in many applications, the FCOPFCs often come with both equality and inequality constraints (general constraints, for short), so most of the neurodynamics-based models no longer work in these situations. Therefore, this article aims to construct a new model for FCOPFCs with general constraints to extend the applications of neurodynamics-based models. First of all, based on fuzzy set theory, the original FCOPFCs with general constraints is transformed into a series of interval programming tasks and further transformed into crisp optimization problems with weights. Then, a novel continuous-time neurodynamics-based model with a single-layer structure is established to solve the crisp optimization problem with weights. Further, we discuss the global existence and prove the stability of state solutions. The theoretical results show that the state solutions reach the feasible region within finite time and converge to the optimal solution with the smallest 2-norm. Simulation results completed for three kinds of FCOPFCs show the validity of the approach, and the results in real-world applications demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection facilitates system processing, and it relies on knowledge granulation and uncertainty measurement. Focusing on ordered decision systems, the fuzzy dominance neighborhood (FDN) granulation and corresponding condition entropy have recently yielded an outstanding algorithm for feature selection, FDNCE-FS (fuzzy dominance neighborhood condition entropy-based feature selection). However, there is room for improvement. Accordingly, three-level improvements of knowledge granulation, information enrichment, and heterogeneity fusion are proposed here, and $2\times 2\times 2=8$ heuristic algorithms of feature selection are systematically established. First, FDN granulation is improved to fuzzy dominance three-way neighborhood (FD3N) granulation through three-way decision on fuzzy dominance degrees, and FD3N rough sets are modeled to offer better dependency. Second, the FDN condition entropy is improved to FD3N condition entropy by reinforcing the interaction factor and class information, and corresponding measure systems are constructed. Third, FD3N dependency is fused with four types of condition entropy to produce four combined measures, and eight uncertainty measures hierarchically emerge due to the three-level improvements. Fourth, these systematic measures have granulation nonmonotonicity, and they enable heuristic algorithms for feature selection; thus, the current FDNCE-FS method is improved to seven new selection algorithms: FHN-FS, RHN-FS, RFHN-FS, HTWN-FS, FHTWN-FS, RHTWN-FS, and RFHTWN-FS. Finally, the relevant FD3N granulation, uncertainty measurement, and feature selection are validated by data-based experiments, and the seven novel algorithms are shown to outperform FDNCE-FS in terms of classification performance. This study provides new insights into uncertainty modeling, information fusion, and feature selection through granular computing and three-way decision.},

To validate our method, we conducted evaluations on two human-centric instructional video datasets, i.e., MedVidQA and YouMakeUp.

  abstract     = {Presently, intelligent games have emerged as a substantial research area. Nonetheless, the slow convergence of intelligent wargame training and the low success rates of agents against specific rules present challenges. In this article, we propose a game confrontation algorithm combining the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approach from management science and reinforcement learning (RL) technology. This integration enables us to combine the strengths of both approaches and addresses the above issues effectively. This study conducts experiments using the algorithm that integrates MADM and RL techniques to gather confrontation data from the red and blue sides within the winning-first wargame platform. The data is then analyzed using the weight calculation method of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to determine each intelligent opponent agent&#39;s threat level from the perspective of MADM. The threat level calculated by MADM is used to construct the reward function for the red side. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm combining MADM and RL proposed in this study outperforms classical RL algorithms regarding intelligence. This approach effectively addresses issues, such as the convergence difficulty, caused by random initialization and the sparse rewards for agent neural networks in wargame environments with large maps. Combining the MADM method from management with the RL algorithm in control can lead to cross-disciplinary innovation in academic fields, which provides innovative research values for intelligent wargame design and RL algorithm improvements.},

In this article, a graph classification method based on fuzzy entropy causality is introduced by combining formal concept analysis, causality, and graph convolution. First, the network formal context is combined with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), forming “graph network formal context,” providing a solid foundation for the convergence of these two theoretical domains. In addition, a high-order GCN is thoroughly studied, leading to the design of high-order cluster information aggregation algorithm and high-order aggregation hierarchical graph pooling algorithm (HAGP). These innovations comprehensively capture fundamental information in graphs. Simultaneously, combining fuzzy entropy with Pearl&#39;s causality, creating a fuzzy entropy causality classification method (FECCM). Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, classification performance comparison experiments are conducted using 12 graph datasets and nine University of CaliforniaIrvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI) classification datasets, demonstrating the advanced nature of the HAGP-FECCM.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an imitation learning framework is innovatively developed for robot skills learning in violin bowing. The introduction of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to model motion addresses issues such as the uncertainty in changing string angles, which traditional methods like physical measurements are highly error-prone and nongeneralizable. Alternatively, conventional rule-based methods often fail to precisely mimic the complex playing techniques of humans, especially in terms of musicality and emotional expression. To address this, we propose a new model named fuzzy and PCA-dynamic movement primitive (FP-DMP), built upon Type-2 fuzzy models and principal component analysis (PCA). This model utilizes variables derived from PCA (bowing plane angles) as inputs for the membership function and employs fuzzy k-means clustering to identify the angle of the violin bowing plane, independent of physical measurements or positional information. In addition, we have developed a professional-level musical performance behavior database through a task-parameterized Gaussian mixture model (TP-GMM). Biomimetic experiments prove that our FP-DMP model can control robots for high-precision violin performances. The core technology, FP-DMP, combines Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and PCA for efficient trajectory clustering based on bowing angles, uses type-2 fuzzy K-means for nuanced differentiation of violin string trajectories, and innovatively adapts the force term in DMP to account for the nonlinear friction encountered in violin playing. This not only advances imitation learning in complex performance tasks for robots, but also opens new research avenues for imitation learning in other highly specialized and technically challenging fields.},

  abstract     = {Currently, three-way decision with neighborhood rough sets (3WDNRS) is widely used in many fields. The core of 3WDNRS is to calculate threshold pairs to divide a neighborhood space into three pairwise disjoint regions. The majority of research on 3WDNRS mainly aims to calculate thresholds with the given risk parameters to minimize the misclassification cost. However, in practical applications, risk parameters are often subjectively determined based on expert experience. This makes it challenging to accurately obtain the thresholds in 3WDNRS. To solve this problem, fuzziness is introduced into 3WDNRS to provide a new perspective on 3WD theory. First, a shadowed set framework is constructed, named three-way approximations based on shadowed sets (3WA-SS). Based on 3WA-SS, a data-driven adapted neighborhood (DAN) is constructed. Then, an improved fuzziness-based 3WDNRS (F $^{\prime }$ -3WDNRS) is further proposed and optimized by minimizing uncertainty change to obtain a more reasonable threshold pair based on DAN. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed model, and the results show that F $^{\prime }$ -3WDNRS is effective and reliable for making decisions.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing multiattribute decision-making models under multiscale decision information systems are established by selecting the optimal scale or fusing multiscale information into a single scale. These models will lose part of the decision information, resulting in inaccurate decision results. However, sequential three-way decision can not only process information hierarchically, but also provide delayed decision between acceptance and rejection. In addition, the irrational behavior of decision-makers will have a certain impact on the decision-making results. To this end, for multiscale and diversity decision-making problems, this article proposes a hierarchical sequential three-way multiattribute decision-making method based on regret theory. Specifically, to represent this diversity, the multiscale evaluation information table is converted into a digital evaluation value table through a fuzzy membership function. Second, based on the regret-rejoicing function of regret theory, the regret-rejoicing relation of alternatives in multiscale information systems is established, which can be used to calculate the conditional probability. Third, the relative loss functions based on regret theory are proposed by considering the psychological behaviors of decision-makers. Finally, the hierarchical sequential three-way multiattribute decision-making method for solving the multiscale decision-making problem is proposed. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the corresponding experiments and the comparative analysis of practical cases. The proposed method solves the fusion problem of multiscale decision information and obtains flexible ranking results according to the risk factor.},

  abstract     = {A bunch of stream clustering algorithms have been proposed recently to mine data streams generated at high speeds from hardware platforms and software applications. Density-based methods are widely used because they can handle outliers and capture clusters of arbitrary shapes. However, it is still hard to effectively identify multidensity clusters with ambiguous boundaries in a data stream. To address these limitations, this article introduces a data stream clustering algorithm called TWStream, based on the three-way decision theory. It is a two-stage clustering algorithm based on density. In the online stage, an augmented $k$ nn graph is maintained incrementally to accelerate the update of the $k$ nn graph. In the offline stage, TWStream introduces the concept of boundary confidence to detect cluster boundaries efficiently and reveal potential cores of clusters. It integrates the skewness and sparsity of the data distribution, as well as the evolving trend of the stream. In the next step, a microcluster-based three-way clustering strategy is applied to reconstruct latent clusters. It improves the clustering quality of boundary-ambiguous clusters in a stream using a mutual reachability-based clustering approach and a three-way assignment approach. The proposed algorithm is compared with 9 competitors on 15 data streams. Experimental results show TWStream achieves competitive performance, verifying its effectiveness.},

However, there are challenges such as local optimum-based thresholds, initial point-related optimal solutions, and a limited model generalization. To address these challenges, we design a penalty mechanism-based approximate model and solving algorithm. First, a standard optimization model and its approximate model are established by means of a penalty mechanism. Moreover, three properties of the approximate model are explored, and the relationships between both types of models are analyzed. Second, a penalty mechanism-based particle swarm optimization (PMPSO) algorithm is designed to solve general frameworks with our established models, and comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the algorithm. Third, we generalize the established model by fuzzy loss representations, and take linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs) as a representation to establish general threshold-determined models based on single and multiple ranking measure functions of LIFNs. Then, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution and develop a three-way decision method with the PMPSO algorithm.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) can be used to effectively prevent arrhythmias and even death caused by myocardial infarction. Whether or not to implant an ICD and deciding the precise location of implantation are huge clinical challenges. This work proposes a noise-estimation-dominated fuzzy segmentation strategy for ICD implantation. It achieves accurate noise estimation in cardiac magnetic resonance image segmentation by weighting mixed noise distributions and adding a spatial information constraint. To be specific, a weighted $\ell _{2}$ -norm regularization term is proposed to form a universal noise-estimation-based fuzzy $C$ -means algorithm that can perform accurate segmentation of images subject to mixed or unknown noise. Through region growth and flood fill in order, the region and volume of myocardial scars are precisely obtained. Thus, the ICD implantation is accurately estimated. Finally, a criterion for ICD implantation estimation is reported. Experimental results on different myocardial infarction datasets show that the proposed strategy is more effective and efficient than its competitive peers.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic pruning is an effective model compression method to reduce the computational cost of networks. However, existing dynamic pruning methods are limited to pruning along a single dimension (channel, spatial, or depth), which cannot maximally excavate the redundancy of the network. Meanwhile, most of the current state-of-the-arts usually implement dynamic pruning via masked-out partial channels and pixels for training while failing to accelerate the inference speed. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel fuzzy-based multidimensional dynamic pruning paradigm to dynamically compress neural networks along both the channel and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we design a multidimensional fuzzy-mask block to simultaneously learn which spatial positions or channels are redundant and need to be pruned. Then, the Gumbel-Softmax trick combined with a sparsity loss is introduced to train these mask modules in an end-to-end manner. During the testing stage, we convert features and convolution kernels into two matrices, respectively, and then implement sparse convolution through matrix multiplication to accelerate the network inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost. For instance, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method prunes 68% FLOPs of ResNet-56 with only a 0.07% Top-1 accuracy drop.},

  abstract     = {Modern industrial processes often exhibit complex and uncertain operating state fluctuations due to the diversification of production materials, the complexity of production processes, and the harsh production environment. To address the real-time control challenge in multimode processes, this article proposes a learning framework for fuzzy neural network explicit control for full operation conditions. It includes: the fuzzy neural network-based explicit control law (FNNECL) and the neural network-based predictive model (NNPM). By adjusting the structure and parameters of FNNECL, precise control of full operation conditions is achieved. Specifically, a novel truncated radial basis activation function is first presented, and the operation condition change measurement index of data coverage is proposed to identify the mismatch degree between current and historical operation conditions. Then, for small-scale operation condition changes, an elastic weight consolidation (EWC) mechanism is introduced to ensure that FNNECL can learn control strategies for new operation conditions while maintaining control performance for historical conditions. Finally, to address large-scale operation condition changes, a radial basis function (RBF) neuron growth mechanism based on data coverage is proposed. This mechanism calculates the data coverage of fuzzy rules and selectively adds new neurons to the FNNECL. This enables the FNNECL to fit large-scale changes and effectively learn control strategies for new operation conditions. It is worth noting that without knowing the current condition, accurate control sequences can be rapidly obtained based on a single FNNECL. Extensive experiments including numerical simulation and industrial roasting process verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We develop a gradient-based fuzzy rule system that can identify the three groups based on the technical indicator values of the cluster centers. We also develop a labeling algorithm as a corrective measure in case the fuzzy rule-based system identifies more than one group as buy, sell, or hold. Subsequently, we input the clusters to a credibilistic portfolio optimization model that models asset returns using coherent fuzzy numbers. We employ a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization model that exploits the problem&#39;s special structure.

  abstract     = {Computational intelligence is increasingly applied to complex decision-making challenges, leveraging its data analysis prowess. Hybrid human–artificial intelligence models enhance the grasp of intricate social behaviors, offering valuable insights for social computing and behavior modeling. Within this landscape, large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) emerges as an invaluable asset for navigating intricate decision-making scenarios. LSGDM enlists the expertise of individuals who articulate their preferences via fuzzy preference relations that abide by additively consistent principles. Its ascendancy is underscored by its applicability and relevance in confronting multifarious decision-making conundrums. In the realm of LSGDM, machine learning methodologies, such as cluster analysis, are deployed to streamline decision-making procedures, particularly when confronted with inherent complexities. The consensus reaching process (CRP) serves as the cornerstone, ensuring that decision makers (DMs) converge on a unified verdict. Consequently, comprehensive exploration of cluster analysis and CRP assumes a pivotal role in elevating the effectiveness of LSGDM. To further augment LSGDM, this study leverages a three-way clustering approach grounded in adaptive fuzzy $c$ -mean clustering. This stratagem categorizes DMs into discrete subgroups. Moreover, a consensus metric, embracing both cardinal and ordinal consensus considerations, is established. This metric serves as the foundation for computing DMs&#39; intragroup weights and group weights. Moreover, this article introduces a feedback mechanism imbued with identification and modification rules (directional rules). It incorporates a modification function that takes into account the consensus threshold, DMs&#39; regret psychology, and the consensus level. This modification function methodically derives modification parameters for the spectrum of DMs. Finally, the viability and effectiveness of the LSGDM methodology proffered in this article are substantiated via meticulous simulation and comparative analyses.},

However, in terms of reference point selection for prospect theory, these models adopt a unified strategy for all alternatives without considering the characteristics of the alternatives themselves. To solve this problem, a reference point selection method based on fuzzy information granules is proposed in this article. Furthermore, a prospect theory-based generalized intuitionistic fuzzy three-way decision model is established. Specifically, first, a reference point selection method based on fuzzy information granules is constructed for the evaluation values of alternatives. Second, based on the value function of prospect theory, an intuitionistic fuzzy scoring function is proposed. Meanwhile, based on the difference between the two intuitionistic fuzzy scoring values, a PROMETHEE-based trisecting method is designed. In addition, utilizing the priority relationship existing in three divisions, a generalized ranking strategy using recursive trisecting is established for obtaining the ranking result of alternatives. Finally, based on the priority relationship of the classification attribute, an effectiveness index is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision-making method in decision-making cases. On this basis, the proposed model is used to process different decision-making cases, verifying its effectiveness, superiority, and feasibility.},

In this article, an adaptive robust fuzzy sliding mode control (ARFSMC) strategy for WWTPs is proposed to guarantee the operational performance. First, considering the high nonlinearity of the WWTPs, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is employed to identify the system dynamics. And the identification results are directly used for controller design. To address the effect of disturbances on identification accuracy, a sliding mode observer has been designed, where the observation error is utilized to adjust the adaptive law of the FNN identifier. Second, a variable parameters disturbance observer is devised to accurately estimate time-varying disturbances in the WWTPs. The observer is used to build a dynamic model by estimating the state, thereby obtaining disturbance as an additional state. And the parameters within the observer are dynamically adjusted using a state estimation error-based parameter adjustment law. Third, an adaptive switching gain sliding mode controller, combined with the disturbance observer, is designed to improve the stability of the system. Specifically, the switching gain is determined by subtracting the disturbance observer output from the estimated disturbance upper bound. Finally, the experimental results on the BSM1 demonstrate that ARFSMC has superior control performance compared to existing methods.},

To address this problem, a time-aware fuzzy neural network, based on the frequency-enhanced modulation mechanism (FEM-TAFNN), is developed for time-series prediction in this article. First, a Fourier-based decoder is established to extract the multiscale features. This decoder employs the frequency-domain model to orthogonally separate the time-scale features with different frequencies into independent temporal patterns based on the Fourier basis, which prevents the overlap of temporal patterns using time-domain analysis. Second, a frequency-enhanced modulation mechanism is designed to shape fuzzy rules of FNN based on the contribution of different temporal patterns in the frequency spectrum. It enables FEM-TAFNN to modulate out the realistic multiscale temporal patterns. Finally, the proposed FEM-TAFNN is tested on four multiscale time-series datasets. The empirical results confirm its superior prediction performance than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale group decision making becomes increasingly common with the rapid development of society and the increasing complexity of practical problems. However, it is difficult to distinguish the semantic differences between the same linguistic term, and original linguistic term may not express flexible semantics, so that this will affect the precise of decision-making results. With the help of granular computing, this article adopts a new format of linguistic term, named as hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set with granularity level, to endow preference information with flexibility and at a specific granularity. Then, in this study, we propose a novel intelligent biobjective optimization method for large-scale group decision making, considering group consensus degree and group risk degree in the decision-making process, where group risk degree is measured from the motivation of portfolio risk. Differential evolution is used to handle biobjective optimization method to determine the optimal results. We also introduce an additive consistency measure and develop a method to derive the corresponding threshold values through Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the case study and comparison results are covered to demonstrate the practicality and superiority of the proposed method. This work has some original points: 1) Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set with granularity level brings flexibility to the decision-making process. 2) Group consensus degree and group risk degree are involved in biobjective optimization method, where the group risk degree is measured from the motivation of portfolio risk. 3) A novel additive consistency measure is proposed and different threshold values of preference relations in different dimensions are derived.},

This article proposes a novel scalable fuzzy voltage control scheme for nonlinear direct current microgrids (DCmGs) composed of DGUs and constant power loads (CPLs) interconnected via power lines. First, a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy DCmG model with CPL is formulated to capture nonlinear characteristics and diverse transient behaviors. Then, a scalable fuzzy control approach is developed to mitigate negative coupling effects of power lines. This is achieved by a novel argument that leverages dissipativity theory to transform such effects into linear matrix inequalities and subsequently imposes constraints on their sequential principal minors. Specifically, the proposed control method operates locally and independently of other DGUs and line couplings, enabling seamless plug-and-play operations without updating any controllers. Finally, theoretical results are validated through simulations using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox.},

Then, fuzzy deep residual shrinkage network is proposed to establish the SP-based status membership function as a single assessment model. The probabilities of robot operation states are determined and formulated as the hesitation fuzzy number (HFN). These HFNs from multiple assessment models are integrated into a collective hesitation fuzzy assessment matrix.

Here, a novel tracking control solution presented in this article is capable of fulfilling such expectation. Therein, by constructing a fuzzy velocity observer with the idea of the fuzzy logic technique, the previous output-feedback control results for nonlinear systems are extended to HRCT control with unmeasured velocity and modeling uncertainties. Also, a novel self-triggered quantized (STQ) controller is developed, which can better balance the relationship between system performance and resource utilization. Under the STQ control framework, both the settling time regulator and specific system transformation ways are incorporated into the dynamic surface-based backstepping design. It results in a new set of regulation with less communication occupation that allow the position and velocity signals to be within preset restriction ranges, while the convergence time and accuracy are preassigned by the designer. Meanwhile, benefiting from the integral multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function, the adaptive obstacle avoidance behavior of the system is guaranteed. Eventually, the benefits and efficacy of the resultant scheme are fully verified via a practical example.},

  abstract     = {Histopathological image classification constitutes a pivotal task in computer-aided diagnostics. The precise identification and categorization of histopathological images are of paramount significance for early disease detection and treatment. In the diagnostic process of pathologists, a multitiered approach is typically employed to assess abnormalities in cell regions at different magnifications. However, feature extraction is often performed at a single granularity, overlooking the multigranular characteristics of cells. To address this issue, we propose the fuzzy-guided multigranularity deep neural network (FMDNN). Inspired by the multi-granular diagnostic approach of pathologists, we perform feature extraction on cell structures at coarse, medium, and fine granularity, enabling the model to fully harness the information in histopathological images. We incorporate the theory of fuzzy logic to address the challenge of redundant key information arising during multigranular feature extraction. Cell features are described from different perspectives using multiple fuzzy membership functions, which are fused to create universal fuzzy features. A fuzzy-guided cross-attention module guides universal fuzzy features toward multigranular features. We propagate these features through an encoder to all patch tokens, aiming to achieve enhanced classification accuracy and robustness. In experiments on multiple public datasets, our model exhibits a significant improvement in accuracy over commonly used classification methods for histopathological image classification and shows commendable interpretability.},

Unknown nonlinear actuator dynamics and local interconnection information render existing boundary control algorithms no longer applicable. To handle this, based on the infinite and finite-dimension backstepping techniques, a novel distributed adaptive tracking controller is designed to realize the consensus tracking control, where the unknown nonlinearities are determined by using the fuzzy wavelet neural networks. Moreover, due to the resource constraint of the communication channel and computation burden, this article further develops a new event-triggered mechanism in the sensor-to-controller channel. Based on the proposed event-triggered distributed algorithm, it is amply illustrated that consensus tracking control can be realized.

After constructing the fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, common integral terms are given to compensate for fuzzy integral terms, and free-weighting matrices are incorporated. Consequently, concerned with the unique trait of membership functions, the membership-functions-derivative-dependent stability criteria are derived. These criteria consider both precise upper and lower bounds of the membership functions&#39; derivative, resulting in less conservatism compared with the previous criteria that only contained upper bounds. Moreover, by fully incorporating fuzzy information in the derivatives of fuzzy integral terms, a local stability criterion with reduced conservatism is obtained under membership functions associated with the system states.

Fuzzy sets provide this elasticity, enabling the aggregation and representation of similar values in a human-comprehensible manner. However, many sensor signals exhibit temporal oscillations, leading to varying interpretations of the signal based on its current trend (rising or falling). This hysteresis in signal (and subsequently of the production device) interpretation inspired us to introduce this phenomenon into data stream processing, resulting in the novel concept of hysteretic fuzzy sets. This article demonstrates how fuzzy searching and grouping can be applied to IoT sensor signals in flexible Big Data stream processing on Apache Kafka. We illustrate the impact of data stream querying with KSQL queries involving fuzzy sets (encompassing fuzzy filtering of data stream events, fuzzy transformation of data stream attributes, fuzzy grouping, and joining) on the flexibility of executed operations and computational resources utilized by the Kafka processing engine. Finally, our experiments with hysteretic fuzzy sets while analyzing sensor signals in power plants demonstrate that this novel approach effectively reduces the number of alarms while monitoring the state of the production machine.},

Meanwhile, a fuzzy state observer is formulated to estimate the unmeasured states of the agents. Based on the distributed event-triggered observer and fuzzy state observer, an output-feedback event-triggered fuzzy FTC scheme is proposed by backstepping recursive control design. It is demonstrated that all the signals of the controlled MASs are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, consensus tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of zero, and continuous communication among agents is avoided.

The highlights of this study are that a modified nonsingular predefined-time filter featuring the hyperbolic tangent item and an adaptive parameter was constructed to overcome the curse of dimensionality and that the AFTC property was integrated into the optimal framework. Moreover, communication costs and control expenses were considerably minimized using an amended switching event-triggered mechanism. Under the predefined-time stability criterion, the reported control tactic ensures that the tracking error can approach the vicinity of the origin within a user-specified time while excluding the violation of the AFTC.

Due to the distinctive design of the DFM design parameter and NASbpAf, the proposed SEFC-ZN method possesses prominent self-adaptivity and enhanced fixed-time convergence. Specifically, the DFM design parameter is actually a matrix with all elements generated from a discrete fuzzy control system, so it can self-adaptively adjust the convergence rate of every error in the SEFC-ZN method resulting in the self-adaptivity. This feature is greatly different from the conventional scalar design parameters whose values are usually fixed or increase indefinitely and different errors in the ZN method can only be adjusted by the same design parameter. By summarizing the characteristic of the activation functions designed previously according to the SbpAf, it is found that keeping two terms of the SbpAf and adding extra terms can improve the performance of the ZN method. Thereout, built on the SbpAf, the NASbpAf is presented which can make the SEFC-ZN method realize the enhanced fixed-time convergence. Three theoretical analyses and proofs, together with relative corollaries, conclude the properties of the SEFC-ZN method and the advantages of the DFM design parameter and NASbpAf. A numerical experiment about solving time-variant nonlinear equations by the SEFC-ZN method and an application to the linear-quadratic optimal control strongly verify the proposed theory and method.},

Input delay is addressed based on the Pade approximation and introducing an intermediate variable, then the control problem for the original systems is transformed into one for nondelay system. For state constraints in the system, this article proposes nonlinear state dependent function instead of barrier Lyapunov function, which removes the feasibility conditions. By fuzzy logic system and variable separation technology, this article effectively solves algebraic rings created by nonstrict feedback structures. A fuzzy adaptive controller is proposed to ensure that all variables in the system are bounded in probability and the asymmetric state constraints are well kept all the time.

  abstract     = {The possibilistic c-means (PCM) clustering is an important unsupervised pattern recognition method. However, it is still faced with huge challenges in clustering multidimensional data with multiple characteristics, such as imbalanced sample sizes, imbalanced feature components, noise and outlier corruption, and the sparse distribution of small targets in the feature space caused by the “curse of dimensionality.” In view of this, this article proposes a PCM clustering algorithm based on the Mahalanobis-Kernel Distance and the suppressed competitive learning strategy. To begin with, the Mahalanobis-Kernel Distance combined with the absolute attribute of possibilistic memberships is proposed to enhance the intra-class compactness of small targets with sparse distribution and feature imbalance. In addition, to overcome the inherent coincident clustering problem caused by possibilistic memberships, the “suppressed competitive learning” mechanism based on the Mahalanobis-Kernel distance is designed to generate cluster cores and correct memberships of objects located within the cluster cores, thus guiding purposefully the clustering process. Furthermore, spatial information is introduced by the membership filtering scheme to improve the segmentation effect of color images with small targets and noise injection. Experimental results show that the algorithm in this article can achieve better clustering and segmentation performance than several state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering methods for color images with imbalanced sizes and features and noise injection.},

Aiming at improving the overall system performance by dynamically switching between different controllers according to system dynamics changing, the proposed switching MPC (SMPC) scheme formulates a group of optimization problems to determine the optimal switching strategy and corresponding control actions. To be specific, the optimization problem is solved at each moment to generate a control sequence that optimizes the gain matrices to achieve the minimized performance index. Building upon the traditional MPC structure, the proposed SMPC method forms a new framework by reducing the conservatism of controller design in the solving process based on linear matrix inequality conditions via introducing the homogeneous polynomial method. As a result, the proposed SMPC method enhances the feasibility of controller solving, improves control performance and expands the domain of attraction by utilizing the switching mechanism to handle the system dynamics more freely. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated through different examples.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we concern the rate-based output regulation (OR) for switched interval type-2 fuzzy systems (SIT2FSs) with severe instability. To expedite synchronization with the activated subsystem and more effectively mitigate of overshooting, the addressed systems need to convey the activated system modal and readily accessible state derivatives to the controller. The primary challenge in control synthesis arises from the potential impact of multiple data injection attacks (MDIAs) on networks connecting the subsystem and the controller. Such attacks cannot only compromise system states and controller signals but also manipulate system modes and state derivatives, resulting in intricate asynchronous switching behavior and significant disruptions to system dynamics. To surmount this scenario, rate-based dynamic event-triggered schemes (RDETSs) are developed to shorten the asynchronous interval by introducing the dissipativity parameter and the lower bound of MDIAs&#39; sleeping duration. Then, a switching rule is formulated to resist MDIAs and severe instability and break the binding of switching behavior between the subsystem and its controller. Based on the dissipativity theory framework, a rate-based OR control paradigm is delivered for SIT2FSs by co-designing the IT2 fuzzy derivative feedback controller, RDETSs, and switching law. The suggested methodology is validated by multiship formations that are represented as the addressed system adhering to a switching topology activated by restricted communication capabilities.},

A novel adaptive fuzzy prescribed performance control strategy is proposed to deal with the problem. Instead of the approach angle or the azimuth angle, a pair of heading- and orientation-related auxiliary variables is adopted to deal with the underactuation of the WMR. In place of the transverse function, the barrier function is combined with the adaptive fuzzy logic system to cope with the unknown WMR dynamics, as well as environmental disturbances. Moreover, the barrier function is used to confine the position error rather than the tracking errors. By doing so, a continuous singularity-free high-performance control scheme is derived, which ensures that the WMR tracks the reference trajectory with the predefined speed and accuracy.

To enhance the dynamic performance of all system errors, the error-driven nonlinear feedback technique is applied to all transform errors, enabling them to possess self-tuning characteristics. Furthermore, a decentralized adaptive learning constrained control strategy is proposed by employing fuzzy logic systems with an incremental adaptive mechanism to approximate complex uncertainties. The stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed control scheme guarantees the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system, and the full dynamic errors are constrained within self-adjustable performance boundaries in the presence of input saturation.

  abstract     = {In the realm of data classification, broad learning system (BLS) has proven to be a potent tool that utilizes a layer-by-layer feed-forward neural network. However, the traditional BLS treats all samples as equally significant, which makes it less robust and less effective for real-world datasets with noises and outliers. To address this issue, we propose fuzzy BLS (F-BLS) and intuitionistic F-BLS (IF-BLS) models that confront challenges posed by the noise and outliers present in the dataset and enhance overall robustness. Employing a fuzzy membership technique, the proposed F-BLS model embeds sample neighborhood information based on the proximity of each class center within the inherent feature space of the BLS framework. Furthermore, the proposed IF-BLS model introduces intuitionistic fuzzy concepts encompassing membership, nonmembership, and score value functions. IF-BLS strategically considers homogeneity and heterogeneity in sample neighborhoods in the kernel space. We evaluate the performance of proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models on UCI benchmark datasets with and without Gaussian noise. As an application, we implement the proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models to diagnose Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Experimental findings and statistical analyses consistently highlight the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models over baseline models across all scenarios.

  abstract     = {Single-cell multiview clustering is essential for analyzing the different cell subtypes of the same cell from different views. Some attempts have been made, but most of these models still struggle to handle single-cell sequencing data, primarily due to their nonspecific design for cellular data. We observe that such data distinctively exhibits: 1) a profusion of high-order topological correlations, 2) a disparate distribution of information across different views, and 3) inherent fuzzy characteristics, indicating a cell&#39;s potential to associate with multiple cluster identities. Neglecting these key cellular patterns could significantly impair medical clustering. In response, we propose a specialized application of fuzzy clustering for single-cell sequencing data, namely, the deep single-cell multiview fuzzy clustering method. Concretely, we employ a random walk technique to capture high-order topological relationships on the cell graph and have developed a cross-view information aggregation mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to different views. Furthermore, to accurately reflect the dynamic insight in cellular development, we propose a deep fuzzy clustering strategy that allows cells to associate with diverse clusters. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world single-cell multiview datasets demonstrate our method&#39;s superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a crucial step for data preprocessing, and it is widely applied in machine learning. It can eliminate features that are redundant or irrelevant from data, thereby improving performance and reducing runtime. The uncertain nature of labels produces unique challenges for high-dimensional data with label ambiguity, which is still an open problem; the structural information of the data is not utilized fully. In this article, we sufficiently consider the structural information of the data, including relevancy between labels and features, redundancy among features, and positive regions, and set up a novel label ambiguity feature selection model via weighted label-fuzzy relevancy and redundancy. Specifically, we first transform the nonlabel distribution annotations to label distribution annotations by using a label enhancement model. Second, we use a fuzzy similarity relation to quantify how similar samples are in label space. Third, a general label-fuzzy rough set model is created, and then, a novel feature evaluation measure based on weighted label-fuzzy relevancy and redundancy is defined. In this model, general label-fuzzy rough sets are employed to process label ambiguity problems, and the label-fuzzy relevancy and redundancy are weighted with the feature significance with the positive region as the focus. Finally, a feature selection algorithm for label ambiguity that follows the idea of weighted label-fuzzy relevancy and redundancy is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 label distribution annotation datasets and eight multilabel annotation datasets. The results indicate the advantages of our proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To achieve the offline fault estimation for the fuzzy descriptor system, the cubic spline interpolation fitting approach is first applied to fit the receiving sampled output data into a dynamic fitting function. Then, the dynamic fitting function is further applied to construct and drive an adaptive observer related to the system in consideration. Compared with the existing observers, the designed discrete sampled-output-data-driven adaptive observer does not require interface docking with the original system equipment. The fault on the system can be estimated offline with a certain degree of accuracy via the provided observer.

Thus, a first objective of this article is to develop a trust propagation operator based on trust decay among multiple overlapping communities by leveraging overlapping nodes. By incorporating overlapping nodes&#39; diverse trust relationships and perspectives, this approach allows to achieve reliable sources for generating recommendations in SN-GDM. A second objective of this article is to design a decayed trust propagation induced consensus model to determine the optimal combination of overlapping nodes and feedback parameters, while balancing consensus efficiency and interaction willingness. The innovation of this approach is grounded in its ability to avoid excessive group adjustment to reach consensus.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel center-based clustering algorithm based on bidirectional conical information granularity. The main purpose is to fully absorb the semantic information of the ordinal relationship between objects to improve the performance of central clustering in identifying interleaved and imbalanced data. The proposed algorithm includes two main stages: first, the stage of determining the cluster center and second, the division stage. In the stage of determining the cluster center, the first cluster center is determined by using the number of conical information granularity in the data, and the remaining cluster centers are determined by defining the statistical measure of “fuzzy importance degree.” In the division stage, we divide the points to be clustered into stable and active areas. The former quickly and accurately identifies and assigns the objects belonging to a cluster by measuring the fuzzy similarity between the objects to be clustered and the cluster center, and the latter assigns the objects in the active area by using the information of the points already assigned. This method describes the position and sorting relationship of objects that are granulated through ordinal relationships more accurately in the global environment, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the structural characteristics of the data. This helps to improve the accuracy and stability of clustering algorithms in handling interleaved and imbalanced data. This article uses three clustering validity indicators to test the performance of our algorithm. We compare the results with those of six different types of popular clustering algorithms and new algorithms proposed in recent years. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this article can identify clusters more accurately on the datasets with a complex and staggered distribution. It is significantly better than the clustering algorithm participating in the comparison and has good robustness on datasets with added noise.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision with neighborhood rough sets (3WDNRS) is adept at addressing uncertain problems involving continuous data by configuring the neighborhood radius. However, on one hand, the inputs of 3WDNRS are individual neighborhood granules, which reduce the decision efficiency and generality; on other hand, the thresholds of 3WDNRS require prior knowledge to be approximately set in advance, making it difficult to apply in cases where such knowledge is unavailable. To address these issues, we introduce granular-ball computing into 3WDNRS from the perspective of uncertainty. First, we propose an enhanced granular-ball generation method based on DBSCAN called DBGBC. Subsequently, we present an improved granular-ball neighborhood rough sets model (GBNRS++) by combining DBGBC with a quality index. Furthermore, we construct a three-way classifier with granular-ball neighborhood rough sets (3WC-GBNRS++) based on the principle of minimum fuzziness loss. This approach provides an objective and efficient way to determine the thresholds. To further enhance classification accuracy, we design an adaptive granular-ball neighborhood within the subsequent classification process of 3WC-GBNRS++. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that, 3WC-GBNRS++ almost outperformed other comparison methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness, including four state-of-the-art granular-balls-based classifiers and five classical machine learning classifiers on 12 public benchmark datasets. Moreover, we discuss the limitations of our work and the outlook for future research.},

It plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges associated with high-dimensional data, optimizing computational resources, and enhancing learning performance. A well-designed attribute reduction method can effectively streamline data analysis processes and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. To some extent, the quantity of information contained in an information system can be regarded as the number of distinguishable sample pairs it contains. In this article, the fuzzy distinguishable pair metric is proposed to measure the uncertainty. This metric measures uncertainty by comprehensively considering the number of fuzzy distinguishable pairs and the cardinality of fuzzy similarity relation. Correspondingly, variants of the fuzzy distinguishable pair metric such as joint distinguishable pair metric, conditional distinguishable pair metric, and mutual distinguishable pair metric are constructed. Moreover, the concepts of selected features redundancy upper bound and selected features redundancy lower bound are proposed. These two terms can be flexibly applied to the importance measure to alleviate the problem of over- or under-consideration redundancy. Considering the upper and lower bounds of the selected feature redundancy respectively, two new importance measures are proposed. Based on the previously proposed theory, two attribute reduction algorithms are designed. Finally, comparing the proposed two methods with six effective attribute reduction methods on eighteen datasets with four classifiers, our method achieves good results.},

Considering the complexity of the decision-making problems, it is usually difficult to use single linguistic terms to elicit experts&#39; preferences. Linguistic expressions that are close to cognition of human-being, such as comparative linguistic expression (CLE), are suggested to be applied in such cases. Three-way decision (3WD) has been proved an effective manner to handle multiattribute decision-making (MADM) problems, however there is a lack of 3WD methods dealing with linguistic expressions. By combining CLE and 3WD, a new multiattribute three-way group decision-making (3WGDM) method incorporating CLE (called CLE-3WGDM method) is proposed. A novel personalized numerical scale computation method, based on predecision in 3WGDM, is introduced to manage diverse interpretations of CLE for different individuals. Afterward, the attribute weights are calculated through a novel optimization model, which applies the principle of deviation maximization and minimum entropy of CLE. A novel 3WD-social network method is presented to compute the weights of experts. Comparative analysis with other existing methods have been carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed one.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are directed graphs with multiple nodes, making them well-suited for addressing multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting problems. When forecasting MTS, it is crucial to treat each vector of the MTS as a whole, considering both the causalities between different variables of the vector at a timepoint (spatial relationship) and the causalities between multiple historical vectors and future vector (temporal relationship). Existing FCM-based MTS forecasting models often fail to treat the vectors as a whole and do not distinctly reflect the temporal relationship and spatial relationship in MTS. To address these limitations, this article introduces the concept of composite FCMs (CFCMs). A CFCM comprises two layers of FCMs: the layer-1 FCM describes the temporal relationship in an MTS, whereas the layer-2 FCM describes the spatial relationship. By embedding the layer-2 FCMs into the nodes of the layer-1 FCM, the relationships within the MTS can be separately reflected while still treating each vector as a whole. In this structure, the nodes of the layer-1 FCM represent historical vectors used to forecast the future vector, and each node of the layer-1 FCM corresponds to a layer-2 FCM whose nodes represent the variables of the vector at a specific historical timepoint in the MTS. Based on the novel CFCM concept, this article proposes a new MTS forecasting model that can distinctly reflect the temporal and spatial relationships in an MTS and utilize multiple historical vectors to forecast the future vector. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MTS forecasting model.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a dynamic evolving fuzzy system (DEFS) for streaming data prediction. DEFS utilizes the enhanced data potential and prediction errors of individual local models as the main criteria for fuzzy rule generation. A vital feature of the proposed system is its novel rule merging scheme that can self-adjust its tolerance toward the degree of similarity between two similar fuzzy rules according to the size of the rule base. To better handle the shifts and drifts in the data patterns, a novel rule quality measure based on both the utility values and the prediction accuracy of individual fuzzy rules is further introduced to help DEFS identify these less activated fuzzy rules with poorer descriptive capabilities and, thereby, maintaining a healthier fuzzy rule base by removing these stale rules. Very importantly, the thresholds used by DEFS are self-adaptive toward the input data. The adaptive thresholds can help DEFS to precisely capture the underlying structure and dynamically changing patterns of streaming data, enabling the system to perform accurate approximation reasoning. Numerical examples based on several popular benchmark problems show the superior performance of DEFS over the state-of-the-art evolving fuzzy systems. The prediction performance of the proposed method is at least 2.88% better than the best-performing comparative EFSs on each individual regression benchmark problem considered in this study, and the average performance improvement across all the numerical experiments is approximately 30%.},

  abstract     = {Classification tasks involving tabular data often require a balance between exceptional performance and heightened interpretability. To address this challenge, we propose a linguistically interpretable deep fuzzy classification system called FFT-FFR-RBFC. The system employs a fuzzy feature transformation (FFT) unit, formed by employing a stacked architecture of multiple Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy models with nonlinear conclusions, to distill high-level fuzzy features from the input data, a rule-based fuzzy classifier unit to perform classification using these features, while a fuzzy feature reconstruction unit in tandem with the FFT to enhance the system&#39;s linguistic interpretability by remapping the high-level features back to their original space. The proposed approach is optimized by minimizing a composite loss function that balances classification and reconstruction losses, ensuring a harmonious interplay between performance and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluation across 20 diverse datasets demonstrates that the system&#39;s is exceptionally promising, particularly for high-dimensional or large-scale tabular data classification tasks, achieving superior classification performance while maintaining a high degree of interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a significant area of discovering knowledge that has shown success in the areas of fraud detection, cyber security, and medical diagnosis. The kernelized fuzzy-rough set is a key extension model in rough computing. It inherits the advantages of kernel functions and fuzzy-rough sets and can handle uncertain information in data more effectively. However, existing kernelized fuzzy-rough set models construct upper and lower approximation sets mainly from decision attribute data which are not available to unlabeled data. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, studies related to the use of kernelized fuzzy upper and lower approximation sets for constructing effective anomaly detection models have not yet been reported. Based on these observations, this article constructs a kernelized fuzzy-rough set model for unlabeled data and proposes a kernelized fuzzy-rough anomaly detection (KFRAD) method. Specifically, we first optimize the kernel function to compute the fuzzy relation matrix of attribute subsets to construct the fuzzy approximation space. Then, the definition of kernelized fuzzy approximation accuracy for unlabeled data is given. Then, the granule anomaly extent is determined based on the kernelized fuzzy approximation accuracy. Finally, the granule anomaly extents and the corresponding weight values are integrated to compute the kernelized fuzzy-rough anomaly scores of the objects. On the basis of the above detection ideas, we design the KFRAD algorithm and experimentally compare it with mainstream detection algorithms. The analysis results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series prediction (MTSP) stands as a significant and challenging frontier in the data science domain, garnering considerable interest among researchers. Extreme learning machine (ELM) has emerged as a popular machine learning algorithm capable of effectively addressing MTSP challenges. However, the high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of prediction information within Big Data contexts exposes certain limitations in ELM&#39;s prediction performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a hybrid MTSP framework based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering coupled with feature selection. The framework begins with a possibility distribution (PD)-based feature selection algorithm designed to evaluate information quality and describe information uncertainty via multisource information fusion. Subsequently, a robust FCM algorithm is developed, optimizing the clustering process by incorporating feature differences and neighbor information of samples while employing a multimetric hybrid strategy to determine cluster numbers. Additionally, an enhanced dual-kernel ELM (EDKELM) network is established to enhance prediction capabilities. The resulting hybrid MTSP framework with feature selection excels in autonomously discovering intrinsic feature-model connections, exhibiting superior prediction performance, and demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Experimental results using real-world datasets showcase the competitiveness of the proposed framework over existing machine learning prediction models in resolving multivariate prediction challenges.},

  abstract     = {Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique for continuously extracting the largest amount of energy that a source can provide under varying conditions, and it is indispensable for modern photovoltaic (PV) panels. Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, to increase market share, companies have preferred neuromarketing over traditional methods for better analysis of consumer behavior. Since it easily detects customers&#39; subconscious preferences, electroencephalography (EEG), a brain imaging method, has become widespread within neuromarketing techniques. To make sense of EEG signals, dimensional models are used to convert them into emotions. These steps can reveal emotions and preferences easily but still require an expert for detailed stimulus analysis. This article proposed a fuzzy linguistic summarization approach to provide a decision support tool aimed at presenting detailed analysis to neuromarketing experts. EEG signals were recorded to analyze a hotel&#39;s three (audio, video, web page) advertisements (ads). These were converted into fuzzy emotion labels in a modified Russell&#39;s circumplex model for more specific analysis. Then, these emotion labels were used in linguistic summarization. EEG data were handled in three types: univariate, multivariate, and multigranular detected time series. Each ad was summarized according to demographic features, such as gender and age, allowing comparisons between ads and their segments. The granular trend detection algorithm was modified to detect the simultaneous effects of ads. This study will inspire future studies with three innovations: fuzzy linguistic summarization technique in neuromarketing, fuzzy emotion recognition, and a modified multigranular trend detection algorithm that detects simultaneous agglomeration that is often overlooked.},

  abstract     = {In the era of Big Data, data are being collected, stored, and analyzed at an unprecedented rate. Owing to the limitations of the quantity, diversity, and complexity of data, traditional data reduction techniques cannot effectively remove redundant attributes and reduce data uncertainty. In this article, a bi-directional fuzzy granular-cabin parallel attribute reduction accelerator with granular-group collaboration is proposed. First, the in-memory computing technology of Spark is used to divide the dataset into different subsets to achieve distributed parallel acceleration. Second, a novel bi-directional fuzzy granular-cabin model is constructed using virtual samples, which greatly compresses the fuzzy neighborhood query space. Then, a granular-group collaboration attribute reduction method with the fusion of the proposed granular-cabin and attribute group is investigated, which uses the concept of similarity to divide attributes into different attribute groups, thus reducing the number of iterations for evaluating attributes. Finally, the reduction results of the subnodes are aggregated to the master-node, and the ranking results are evaluated and shown to improve the classification accuracy of attribute reduction. This article presents experiments on eighteen public datasets, including six large-scale datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only reduces the computational cost, but also improves the classification accuracy of the reduced subset.},

This article presents an adaptive fuzzy control scheme for stochastic MEMS gyroscopes, with the primary objectives of reducing control vibration and achieving high precision prescribed performance tracking with low communication resources within a fixed-time backstepping framework. To address the stochastic disturbances and unknown nonlinear system dynamics, the interval type-3 fuzzy logic system is introduced. In addition, a novel quadratic prescribed performance function is proposed to ensure satisfactory transient and steady-state performance of the system while mitigating initial control vibrations during fast error convergence. Furthermore, an event-triggered mechanism is developed using a switching threshold strategy to minimize the communication load without compromising control accuracy. By utilizing the fixed-time command-filtered backstepping design method and newly introduced error-compensating signals, the issue of “explosion of complexity” is effectively resolved, and filtering errors are adequately compensated. The proposed control scheme guarantees that the tracking errors converge to a predefined set of arbitrarily small residuals in probability. In addition, all the closed-loop signals are within a fixed time bounded in probability. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic configuration network (SCN) is an emerging type of random neural network that allocates node parameters via supervised mechanisms to ensure universal approximation capability. However, outliers and noise in real-world data can adversely affect SCN&#39;s classification performance. To enhance SCN for binary classification, we introduce intuitionistic fuzzy set concepts to propose intuitionistic fuzzy SCN (IFSCN). Unlike SCN, IFSCN allocates an intuitionistic fuzzy number to every sample by computing degrees of membership and nonmembership, thereby crafting an optimal classifier through strategic weighting of samples to mitigate the influence of noise. Furthermore, stochastic configuration sparse autoencoders (SC-SAE) effectively learn sparse features using L1 regularization. By integrating multiple SC-SAE models, we extract robust sparse feature representations. We then propose hierarchical IFSCN and IFHSCN built on SC-SAE for enhanced accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate IFSCN and IFHSCN achieve superior binary classification performance over state-of-the-art models like intuitionistic fuzzy twin SVM, kernel ridge regression, random vector functional link networks. Overall, this article successfully equips SCN for real-world noisy data via intuitionistic fuzzy sets and sparsity, providing an effective and scalable solution for robust classification.},

There exist the individual tasks of networked ASVs and virtual leaders beyond the overall goal. The containment control can be transformed into a noncooperative game problem to balance individual and group objectives. With the noncooperative game theory, the containment task is reformulated as a Nash equilibrium seeking problem of networked ASVs regarded as players. To achieve the Nash equilibrium seeking of ASVs, a noncooperative-game-based fault-tolerant fuzzy containment controller is developed for networked ASVs with an adaptive compensation technique. First, a fuzzy predictor based on the high-order tuner is constructed to tackle the total disturbances. Next, a parameter estimator for unknown faults is designed using the adaptive compensation strategy. With identified disturbances and faults, a desired control law and an intermediate control variable are developed to enable ASVs to operate effectively despite faults. By the Lyapunov functions, theoretical results show that the actions of ASVs can converge to the neighborhood region of the Nash equilibrium. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed fault-tolerant containment control method.},

The static quantization strategy is adopted. The packet dropouts are modeled as two random sequences, which are mutually independent and obey the Bernoulli distribution. The multiple hybrid strategies have the following two aspects. First, the filter state update laws are designed besides designing the switching filters for every subsystem, which are specially designed for the impulsive behaviors existing in the ISSs. Second, the mode dependent and mode independent hybrid filters are designed since the filters may not always access the mode switching information of ISSs owing to the quantizations and packet dropouts. Combining the average dwell-time approach and multiple Lyapunov functions, sufficient conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are derived to design the multiple hybrid $H_\infty$ filters. Based on the designed filters, the filtering error systems are exponentially mean-square stable and achieve a weighted $H_\infty$ performance index. Lastly, a practical example is given.},

Benefiting from the advantage, the FSM control is conveniently combined into the FC design to upgrade the performance of leaders. For followers, the analysis methods of linear multiagent (M-A) systems are extended to solve the containment analysis problem without the additional assumption by virtue of the IT-2 T-SFM representation. To deal with the disturbance effect, the passive constraints are combined into the analysis process.

Taking into account the inherent emotional characteristics of linguistic expression, a three-way semantic scales model with emotional preference is proposed. Existing minimum cost consensus (MCC) models are not suitable for this situation because the cost of adjustment in various semantic categories is different and asymmetric. Therefore, in the context of EDM, a minimum cost consensus model (MCCM) with linguistic information is proposed, considering three-way semantic scales and asymmetric adjustment costs. First, a novel MCCM with semantic category constraints (MCCM-SCC) is proposed, which considers the asymmetric adjustment cost. Then, taking into account the degree of tolerance of experts in semantic difference, an extended MCCM-SCC with semantic difference is developed, and related theorems are proved. In addition, a comprehensive feedback mechanism is developed considering the regret aversion of decision makers to prevent the manipulative behavior of experts. Finally, a case study is used to further elaborate on the methods and models mentioned above and highlight their rationality and effectiveness through comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel semantic concept-based inference neural network (SCINN) is proposed to develop a design methodology for the explainable deep neuro-fuzzy models and improve their generalization performance in high-dimensional problems. Traditional neuro-fuzzy models exhibit outstanding interpretability in the problems of lower dimensionality. However, when faced with high-dimensional scenarios, the long rule and rule explosion problems damage their interpretability and result in poor generalization performance, even making them unusable. Although deep neuro-fuzzy models show enhanced performance in handling high-dimensional problems compared to traditional counterparts, they often come at the expense of interpretability. To establish a neuro-fuzzy model that can address high-dimensional problems while preserving the interpretability, the SCINN is proposed with the aid of the concept-based measure generation paradigm (CMGP) and the multi-view information augmentation strategy (MIAS). The CMGP is designed to adaptively define the membership functions (MFs) that correspond to the human-understandable concepts based on the given data; the defined MFs contribute to the construction of the explainable fuzzy rule that can directly process high-dimensional data. The MIAS is structured to develop a unified paradigm for implementing consequence functions in the fuzzy rules, which enhances the approximation ability of the SCINN. The performance of SCINN is evaluated on various image datasets against different competitors, including neuro-fuzzy-based approaches and deep structure-based neural networks. A real-world application is adopted to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that SCINN outperforms the compared neuro-fuzzy models and is comparable to the deep structure-based neural networks.},

So, for a given set $X$ , we need to define $2^{|X|} - 2$ parameters (excluding the measure on the empty set and on $X$ itself). Because of that they are difficult to visualize, and indices and metrics have been defined. The Shapley value is an example. It permits us to determine weights of importance of each element in $X$ . In this article, we introduce an alternative index. We call it $\Upsilon$ -values. We provide an axiomatic characterization. These values are inspired on the Shapley values, and they are associated to set size, or position (order statistics) in a chain. Thus, also position when the measure is used in combination with a fuzzy integral. Andness and orness are measures that permit to evaluate the degree of simultaneity (conjunction) and substitutability (disjunction) of an aggregation function.

Therefore, we innovatively establish DMSBW switching control model and propose an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy switching fault-tolerant control strategy. First, the interval type-2 fuzzy state observer is used to estimate the state of the nonlinear DMSBW system and the time-varying fluctuation of the load torque before and after switching. Then, the prescribed performance adaptive backstepping controller is designed to solve the control output by fusing the error and fault event-triggered controller to realize the unification of switching fault tolerance and accurate tracking while reducing communication resources. And the switching fault-tolerant performance under both transient and steady state is guaranteed by proving Lyapunov stability and boundedness.

To address this critical issue, this article innovatively proposes a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) incorporated SGD (FPS) algorithm with the following two-fold ideas: refining the instance learning error by modeling the past update information guided by the principle of a PID controller efficiently and designing a fuzzy reasoning process to implement the gain parameter adaptation in a PID controller effectively.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses the challenge of distribution shift between a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain by utilizing knowledge from the source. Traditional UDA methods mainly focus on single-modal scenarios, either vision or language, thus, not fully exploring the advantages of multimodal representations. Visionlanguage models utilize multimodal information, applying prompt learning techniques for addressing target domain tasks. Motivated by the recent advancements in pretrained visionlanguage models, this article expands the UDA framework to incorporate multimodal approaches using fuzzy techniques. The adoption of fuzzy techniques, preferred over conventional domain adaptation methods, is based on the following two key aspects: 1) the nature of prompt learning is intrinsically linked to fuzzy logic, and 2) the superior capability of fuzzy techniques in processing soft information and effectively utilizing inherent relationships both within and across domains. To this end, we propose UDA enhanced by fuzz y prompt le arning (FUZZLE), a simple and effective method for aligning the source and target domains via domain-specific prompt learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel technique to enhance prompt learning in the target domain. This method integrates fuzzy C-means clustering and a novel instance-level fuzzy vector into the prompt learning loss function, minimizing the distance between prompt cluster centers and instance prompts, thereby, enhancing the prompt learning process. In addition, we propose a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence-based loss function with a fuzzification factor. This function is designed to minimize the distribution discrepancy in the classification of similar cross-domain data, aligning domain-specific prompts during the training process. We contribute an in-depth analysis to understand the effectiveness of FUZZLE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on standard UDA benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set approaches have received widespread attention across the disciplines of feature selection and rule extraction. When calculating the fuzzy degree of membership of a sample within a specific class, traditional fuzzy rough sets give precedence to the distance information between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, often neglecting the influence of the remoteness of the sample from the specified class. In fact, this calculation strategy limits the discriminability of different samples relative to a given class, which may affect the accuracy and efficiency of feature subset selection. To address the shortcoming, the present study puts forward a new fuzzy rough set approach, weighted fuzzy rough set, which can more accurately measure the correlation and difference between samples relative to the decision class. Based on the distance from a sample to a class, the model first defines the importance of the sample to the class and uses it as a weight to measure the distance between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, thereby constructing a more effective fuzzy rough approximation operator. On this basis, a dependency measure between decision variables and conditional attributes is defined to evaluate the importance of candidate features. Then, a concept of discrimination between samples relative to a class is proposed, and the rationality of weighted fuzzy rough set is discussed. Finally, based on weighted fuzzy rough approximation operator, a new algorithm for selecting a subset of features is formulated. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in terms of performance, not only selecting a smaller number of features, but also achieving higher classification accuracy for simplified data, showing its practical application value in feature selection.},

For the use of more effective information in observer, a predicted signal of the continuous system output is generated by a predictor and used for the construction of observer. Then, a dynamic gain is introduced to the construction of Lyapunov function to ensure the decreasing property of the developed Lyapunov function at sampling instants. Owing to this good property, the PET adaptive controller can be designed using adaptive fuzzy control and backstepping techniques. It is proved that the system states are locally bounded and converge to a small neighborhood of the origin under given sampling period and controller. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed control method.},

The problem is studied in both state feedback and output feedback cases. In the case where the system states are available, a fuzzy adaptive controller that can dynamically compensate for the approximation errors of fuzzy logic systems is designed for the first time. This reduces the high demand for fuzzy approximation accuracy while maintaining the control performance. In another case where only the disturbed system output is available, an augmented observer that can handle arbitrary unknown measurement disturbances is novelty constructed. In both cases, by introducing adaptive auxiliary functions, unknown leader inputs are effectively disposed of, and the tracking performance of the system is nicely guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) play a significant role in inferring causal relationships and modeling complex systems. In recent years, numerous FCM-based causal discovery methods have emerged for diverse causal inference scenarios. However, determining the causal relations that best represent the ground truth in a novel scenario remains a challenge, resulting in an abundant but noisy set of candidate causal relations. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a parameter-free model grounded in Bayesian and fuzzy theory to estimate the accurate causal relations of the real system from candidate causal relation datasets. We initially fuzzify the edge weights within candidate FCMs into distinct causal states. Assuming a probabilistic data model linking observed data (causal relations in candidate FCMs) to true causality, we employ Bayesian methods to transform model parameter solving into a maximum posterior probability estimation task. This approach yields an accurate probabilistic data model, facilitating precise estimation of genuine causality from datasets containing multiple candidate relations. This model aims to derive accurate causal relations from datasets populated with multiple candidate relations. Our method validated on 15 diverse causal datasets, constructed from real and synthetic gene regulatory data, exhibits superior accuracy in discerning causal relationships. These results also demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal: 1) stabilizing performance amidst noisy data; 2) resolving algorithmic diversity for precise causal inferences; 3) mitigating fluctuations from hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {In human–robot collaboration (HRC) tasks, the role of the robot should be naturally and smoothly transitioned between the leader and the follower to guarantee task performance. To realize this, the arbitration of the shared control between the human and the robot needs to be properly designed to assign a degree of leadership to the robot. In this article, we propose a fuzzy logic-based arbitration rule with the help of Kalman filter. Based on this rule, the arbitration can be continuously regulated between zero and one according to the interaction force and the velocity of the human–robot collaboration system with human intention taken into account. Besides, the distance between the system and the obstacle and more generally the environment is also served as a fuzzy input, so that the possible interaction with the environment, e.g., obstacle avoidance, can be considered to ensure system safety. Since our proposed arbitration rule is based on a fuzzy logic, it endows the robot with the capability of continuous reasoning without an explicit form. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by experiments.},

Different from the existing results on cooperative resilient fuzzy tracking control, the developed method can achieve the cooperative resilient fuzzy tracking control objective within the prescribed time. To begin with, a data-driven-based online learning algorithm is introduced for learning the unknown and switching matrix of the reference signal. Based on the learned matrix, novel distributed resilient cooperative observers are designed to achieve prescribed-time observation by introducing an asynchronous observing method. To further improve the smoothness of the observation signal, a new improved smooth second-order prescribed-time observer is designed. Furthermore, leveraging the states of the smooth observer, a fuzzy controller is proposed to achieve precise tracking within the prescribed time, independent of initial conditions using the scaling error method and the backstepping technique.

Fractional calculus with arbitrary noninteger orders operator is introduced into the design of control laws to further improve system performance. An event-triggered mechanism with freely adjustable threshold variable is established to debase energy wastage and computation cost.

To this end, we propose a novel critic-only optimal consensus scheme to eliminate dependency on the identifier network and significantly reduce computational complexity. Moreover, this work requires less prior knowledge and assumes that only the specific subsystems can access the leader&#39;s information under certain conditions. To cope with limited information access, we design a distributed adaptive observer to monitor the leader&#39;s dynamics.

  abstract     = {This article aims to investigate the problems of secure reachability set synthesis and reliable event-driven mechanism design for Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy semi-Markovian network control system (S-MNCS) subjected to external disturbances. To this end, important issues, such as actuator failures, stochastic jump parameters, and stochastic deception attacks occurring in the transmission network are given priority consideration during the design of the controller scheme. At this time, the stochastic parameters are generated using a semi-Markov process, where the transition rate varies depending on the sojourn time. Next, a novel mode-dependent fuzzy event trigger control mechanism for S-MNCS is proposed to achieve reliable performance against actuator failure and deception attacks, reduce unnecessary communication, and improve communication efficiency. Then, a new integral inequality based on free-weight matrices is introduced to minimize model conservatism using the knowledge of the aperiodic sampling pattern. Meanwhile, for the purpose of reducing conservatism, an augmented double-sided looped-type Lyapunov functional (ADSLLF) using membership functions information is introduced to take the available information of the actual sampling pattern. Then, by combing the ADSLLF and the proposed free-matrix integral inequality, some sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived such that all states of the systems included by an ellipsoid region. Finally, the efficiency and applicability of the approach proposed in this study are demonstrated through the simulation of networked autonomous electric vehicle systems, and its superiority is proven by comparing it with the existing method through the simulation of a well-known Rossler system.},

Specifically, to enrich and improve the existing methods for identifying consensus, the intuitionistic fuzzy distance is utilized to calculate the consensus and nonconsensus preferences of decision makers. Based on the consensus and nonconsensus preferences, stability concepts under three different kinds of attitudes, “win–win,” “self-interested,” and “neutral,” are defined to calculate equilibrium solutions. The land acquisition conflict is investigated to verify the applicability of the proposed model. The analysis results show the following: First, the consensus measure method based on the intuitionistic fuzzy distance has stronger applicability to simplify the calculation steps when there are multiple feasible states compared with the existing consensus measure methods; second, under consensus and nonconsensus preferences, the equilibrium results can reflect the differences in strategy choices with different attitudes of decision makers; third, the equilibria are not the same under the three different attitudes of “win–win,” “self-interested,” and “neutral,” while the equilibrium solution in reality is closer to the optimal solution under the “self-interested” attitude.},

To solve the problem, a hierarchical equivalence mechanism is first introduced to transform the COP into an equivalent one consisting of both a distributed optimization problem and a decentralized tracking problem (DTP). By introducing an optimal distributed algorithm, a customized virtual signal is devised to minimize the optimization function and simultaneously mitigate the effects of DoS attacks. To construct a bridge between solving the COP and the DTP, a local reference generator, which includes the characteristics of existing high-order derivatives, is designed utilizing the Hermite interpolation method. Subsequently, the backstepping technique is employed to create a decentralized fuzzy adaptive controller.

  abstract     = {The reagent addition control level of the zinc first rougher has a significant impact on the quality of the zinc concentrate. As froth visual features are important indicators of working states in froth flotation, they are usually controlled to optimal setpoints by reagent addition for the desired concentrate. The existing methods usually construct a rule base for feature setpoint generation and design an error-driven feedback controller for reagent addition. However, there are still some issues: First, a portion of data is used for rule base establishment and knowledge in the remaining data is ignored; second, as the rule base is sparse, it may lead to match failures caused by insufficient knowledge; third, existing controllers only consider the error at the current time, while ignore the temporal information in error sequences. Therefore, we propose a reagent addition control strategy with the dual-rule-based weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning module and temporal encoder–decoder Bayesian network. First, we design a dual-rule base with complementary data to fully mine knowledge. Then, we explore a weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning module for feature setpoint generation. This module selects several nearest neighbor rules in a positive rule base as interpolative candidates and determines rule weights via the nearest neighbor rules in the negative rule base. After that, we introduce a temporal encoder–decoder network by taking temporal error sequences as the input to recognize working states and use a Bayesian network to realize reagent adjustment. Ablations and comparative experiments on industrial data show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Considering the controller gain fluctuation and transmission delay, nonfragile memory sampled-data control is first employed to solve the synchronization of FMINNs. This work does not use the variable conversion technique, but directly performs efficient analysis of the system. An improved fuzzy membership functions-dependent Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional with two-sided looped-functional is designed, which is based on the entire sampling period, and includes the current states and delayed states information. Then, a fuzzy sampled-data controller with a switching topology is designed, and synchronization criteria are established, which take the excitatory and inhibitory of memristive synaptic weights into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method and the practicability of the addressed model are verified through numerical results.},

A method is devised based on this function, which incorporates the characteristic of kernel functions in fuzzy logic systems and the concept of variable separation to effectively tackle challenges posed by complex system structures and time-delay factors, as well as reducing the burden of updating dynamic gains. In addition, the application of the Nussbaum function technique efficiently resolves the issue of unknown control direction while ingeniously leveraging the distinctive properties of the Nussbaum function and the stochastic Barbalat&#39;s lemma.

The adding a power integrator can be introduced to handle the difficulties encountered in the backstepping design process for high-order nonlinear systems. Further, the event-triggered control ideology was carried out among neighbors of MASs, which is used to minimize the communication burden. In addition, the controlled MASs considered four types of sensor faults, adopting the adaptive control methods to achieve effective estimation of unknown fault parameters. According to the frame of backstepping control, an adaptive fuzzy containment event-triggered controller for MASs with positive odd rational powers was designed that can realize all signals are fixed-time bounded, even if MASs may exist sensor faults.

  abstract     = {Multilabel classification (MLC) refers to associating each instance with multiple labels simultaneously. MLC has gained much importance due to its ability to better reflect the complexity of the real world classification problems. Fuzzy system (FS) has excellent nonlinear modeling capability and strong interpretability, which makes it a promising model for complex MLC problems. However, it is widely known that FS suffers from the “curse of dimensionality.” Here, an adaptive membership function (MF) along with its generalized version is proposed to address high-dimensional problems. These MFs can effectively overcome “numeric underflow” in FS while preserving interpretability as much as possible. On this basis, a novel fuzzy rule based MLC framework called multilabel high-dimensional Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (ML-HDTSK FS) is proposed. This model can handle data with over ten thousand dimensionality. In addition, ML-HDTSK FS uses a decomposed label correlation learning strategy to efficiently capture both high and low levels of relationship between labels, and adopts a group $L_{21}$ penalty to realize the learning of label-specific features. Combining these two new multilabel learning strategies and the novel adaptive MF, ML-HDTSK FS becomes a more powerful tool for various MLC problems. The effectiveness of ML-HDTSK FS is demonstrated on seventeen benchmark multilabel datasets, and its performance is compared with eleven MLC algorithms. The experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed ML-HDTSK FS, and demonstrate the superiority of it in dealing with MLC problems, especially for high dimensional ones.},

Various changing behaviors of deviation errors caused by transmission delays, as well as the changes of some auxiliary variables, are modeled by a hybrid dynamical system with flow dynamics and jump dynamics. Then, under the hybrid control framework, an observer-based antidisturbance controller and a delay-independent hybrid event-triggering mechanism (HETM) are proposed to stabilize the closed-loop system, while guaranteeing desired performance in disturbance attenuation and delay tolerance. Compared with the case where small transmission delays could naturally lead to delay-independent HETM, the long transmission delays pose many difficulties. Given this, we propose a more robust triggering condition with only using several memorized previous states to guarantee the HETM to be delay-independent even in case of long transmission delays. Moreover, the obtained stability conditions avoid involving lower and upper bounds of transmission delays in matrix inequalities, so they can be delay-independent and significantly simplified. Relationships between system stability and maximally allowable transmission delay are transformed into designing proper auxiliary functions offline. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol is demonstrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {With the tendency of decentralization into factories, production scheduling among heterogeneous factories has become a prominent concern in industrial demand response, spurring research on distributed heterogeneous welding shop scheduling problem. Moreover, owing to the inevitable occurrence of uncontrollable system disturbance in practical production environment, the processing time of jobs is uncertain rather than deterministic. Thus, an L-R fuzzy number is introduced to tackle the uncertainty of processing time. Furthermore, in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy efficiency has been a significant emphasis from countries. An effective production scheduling in distributed heterogeneous L-R fuzzy welding shop can optimize both production and energy efficiency, but no related research is reported. Thus, to address this research gap, this article investigates an energy-efficient distributed heterogeneous L-R fuzzy welding shop scheduling problem (EDHFWSP) with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption (TEC). To solve this issue, a self-learning discrete artificial bee colony (SDABC) algorithm is proposed. First, a collaborative initialization is presented to yield excellent initial solutions. Then, a self-learning selection strategy is developed to help solutions select a superior neighborhood structure in employed bee phase. Then, a self-learning variable neighborhood search is designed to adaptively select a neighborhood structure for execution in onlooker bee phase. Furthermore, an energy-saving strategy is devised to further optimize TEC without affecting makespan. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of SDABC, extensive experiments are performed to compare SDABC with other five optimization algorithms. Experimental results validate that SDABC outperforms its competitors.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set model is a powerful tool for handling attribute reduction tasks for complex data. While the fuzzy rough set model commonly employs fuzzy information entropy to measure attribute uncertainty, utilizing fuzzy conditional information entropy for measuring attribute relationships presents a drawback due to its lack of monotonicity, impacting attribute reduction results. Furthermore, entropy computations involve numerous logarithmic function computations, resulting in a significant computational burden. Moreover, the results obtained from logarithmic functions are unbounded. To address these problems, this article presents the concept of fuzzy implication granularity information (FIGI) for measuring attribute information. In addition, we introduce several related generalizations, such as fuzzy conditional implication granularity information (FCIGI), fuzzy mutual implication granularity information, and fuzzy joint implication granularity information, aiming to measure the relationships between attributes. Notably, the introduced FCIGI to measure the relationship between attributes demonstrates the desirable property of monotonicity. Crucially, all the metrics proposed in this article are bounded, ensuring that computed values within the range of 0 to 1. Finally, we propose a forward greedy attribute reduction algorithm based on the monotonic fuzzy conditional implication granularity information (MFIGI), and the performance of our MFIGI algorithm was compared against six different attribute reduction algorithms using three classifiers across 15 different datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the excellence of our MFIGI algorithm.},

To the best of the author&#39;s knowledge, all existing studies on GRRV have utilized a 2-D framework. However, in the current complex decision-making environment, information is presented in various forms, which poses limitations on traditional GRRV architectures. To address the problem, this article proposes two 3-D GRRV structures, which are then applied to two domains: ranking vectors composed of intervals and determining the weights of experts in social network multicriteria group decision-making. In the first GRRV, we propose eight rules that consider the expectation degree, standard deviation, and skewness. In addition, we propose another GRRV considering the expectation degree, uncertainty degree, and centrality degree in the social network. By employing the Takagi, Sugeno, and Kang fuzzy model, we obtain the final representative values. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through a series of examples. Furthermore, comparative analysis with other methods further demonstrates the superiority of our proposed methods.},

However, a large amount of private data needs to be used for statistical analysis and forecasting in rule-based fuzzy models. The purpose of this study is to build an intelligent model with high accuracy and versatility under the premise of data privacy and model security. To mitigate the risk of malicious attacks on privacy data during the analysis process, we have employed highly regarded differential privacy techniques to devise a novel rule-based fuzzy modeling approach. We propose a function approximation mechanism to reconstruct the objective function and add a perturbation mechanism to the objective function in the Takagi–Sugeno rules model. Taking into account the delicate balance between data privacy and utility, we have innovatively introduced a Takagi–Sugeno rule-based model based on differential privacy. This model is applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems, offering protection to sensitive data privacy and model security within the system. We investigate the relationship between the interpretability of the model and the degree of privacy protection. By constructing a reasonable rule base, we achieve higher accuracy than other system modeling methods based on differential privacy. This article compares the influence of the number of rules on differential privacy and considers the algorithm performance under various noise distributions. It is shown that the Takagi–Sugeno rules model based on differential privacy has a strong ability to predict and analyze data.},

Nevertheless, challenges still remain in the handling of multivariate high-dimensional time series using a time-effective learning algorithm. This article introduces multiple-input multiple-output randomized high-order FCM (MRHFCM), a new methodology for predicting high-dimensional time series in multiple-input–multiple-output systems. MRHFCM represents a hybrid method that combines data embedding transformation, randomized high-order FCM (R-HFCM), and an echo state network. The core of MRHFCM involves a cascade of R-HFCMs termed the CR-HFCM model. Each CR-HFCM comprises three layers: 1) the input layer, 2) reservoir (internal layer), and 3) output layer. Notably, only the output layer is trainable, employing the least squares minimization algorithm. The weights within each subreservoir are randomly chosen and remain unchanged throughout the training procedure. Three real-world high-dimensional datasets are utilized to assess the performance of the proposed MRHFCM method. The results obtained reveal that our approach outperforms some existing baseline and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning forecasting techniques in terms of both accuracy and parsimony.},

Inspired by generally switched systems with multimodes and multidimensions, the migration of agents is described by a switched communication network, where the number of agents and the graph of topology could be simultaneously changed at the switching instant. In this article, this switching topology is modeled as a quasi-mode-dependent persistent dwell-time switched system with size-varying modes for more generalization. Furthermore, the assumption of existing a directed spanning tree can be removed during the special time interval with a limit on the maximum dwell time, which makes the stability analysis for such switching directed topology more challenging. Hence, a quasi-time-dependent Lyapunov function is utilized to construct a novel distributed reference generator, which can approach the exosystem in a globally uniformly exponential manner, and based on the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy set theory, a fuzzy cooperative controller is developed for each agent to track the estimating signal. Finally, a multipendulum system is adopted to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the derived results.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to address the issue of fixed-time consensus control for uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs), in which only a group of followers can directly access the leader&#39;s information. To ensure the minimum utilization of wireless channel without sacrificing system performance, a fixed-time event-triggered consensus scheme is developed and employed. First, the fixed-time observer with the event-triggered mechanism is proposed to estimate the states of the leader for each follower, which eliminates the unexpected Zeno behavior. Then, based on the reconstructed leader&#39;s information, a fuzzy fixed-time controller via memory-based learning is proposed, in which the fuzzy logic system (FLS) technology is utilized to handle the uncertainty in the MASs. Unlike most FLS-based results, the historical memory instead of the single data point is utilized to update the FLS, which improves the learning ability of FLS. Moreover, in the proposed distributed controller, only one FLS parameter is required to be updated for each $n$ -order uncertain follower, effectively improving the computational efficiency. With the help of graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, the fixed-time stability for the entire system is derived. Finally, the validity of the proposed control scheme is illustrated through simulation examples.},

The switching mechanism relies on fuzzy membership functions, which can make better use of nonlinear vehicle speed information.

The critic in the RLIFS-NFAC framework is implemented through a neural fuzzy critic, which is built through structure and parameter learning using temporal difference error. Structure learning employs an online clustering method to generate new rules. The actor is implemented through a neural fuzzy actor (NFA), which aims to build an IFS through structure and parameter learning. For the parameter learning of the NFA, a value function considering control performance is defined and optimized through the deterministic policy gradient algorithm. In addition, two objective functions considering model interpretability are included. Parameter learning for optimization of the objective functions together with fuzzy set clustering and merging operation help reduce model complexity and fuzzy set transparency. The RL of the RLIFS-NFAC framework using an on-policy or off-policy method is proposed. RLIFS-NFAC is applied to the RL of a wheeled robot to learn a wall-following behavior. Simulations with comparisons with different reinforcement fuzzy systems and neural networks show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RLIFS-NFAC. The learned IFS has also been successfully applied to control a real wall-following robot in unknown environments.},

The nonlinear dynamics are captured by a polynomial fuzzy model, with fewer fuzzy rules and stronger approximation capacity compared with Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy counterpart. In view of engineering applications, system mode information is not fully identified, including the mode state and the mode transitions. Here, a hidden Markov model is utilized to serve as a detector of the original system mode. The transition probability of the system and the associated conditional transition probability for the joint process are both assumed to be general, which contains unknown or inaccurately known values. An event-based mode-dependent fuzzy controller is then constructed such that the considered nonlinear Markov jump systems can be stabilized, for the purpose of reducing data transmission and power consumption. With the aid of a new decoupling strategy, feasible conditions are derived and included in sum-of-square-based theorems. Further the concept of imperfectly premise matching scheme is introduced to facilitate the membership-function-dependent stability analysis, so as to inject richer information of the membership function and obtain less conservative results. The flexibility of controller design is, thus, endowed. Examples are given to show the effectiveness of our obtained results.},

On this basis, an adaptive robust control method based on two control parameters is proposed, which is for the fuzzy mechanical systems. It is proved by Lyapunov function that this control approach can ensure the global uniform boundedness and global uniform ultimate boundedness performance of the controlled mechanical system. This is the first level of the control design. Afterward, the second level is to ensure the control performance while reducing the control cost by optimizing two control parameters. In order to optimize two control parameters, the cooperative game theory is adopted, which is another one of the innovations of this article. In the optimization process, two control parameters are regarded as two players, and the optimal control parameters are obtained by minimizing the cost function designed based on these two players.

  abstract     = {The fuzzy concept serves as a crucial tool for describing phenomena and constitutes the fundamental unit of human cognition. Fuzzy concepts are characterized by their extent and intent, with the latter being comprised of continuous membership degrees. Given that human cognition often progresses from vagueness to precision, it is imperative that the form of intent not be confined to a singular continuous value; rather, an interval possesses superior flexibility in this regard. Initial cognitive processes lack comprehensiveness in acquiring knowledge, necessitating subsequent cognitions to more accurately delineate the intended scope of a concept. Motivated by this insight, we proposed an interval-intent fuzzy concept re-cognition learning model (IFCRL). First, this model transforms fuzzy concept intent from a single continuous value into an interval-based representation, which describes the range of attribute values for all objects within the given interval. Second, in order to simulate secondary cognitive processes akin to those exhibited by humans toward phenomena, we present a concept re-cognition learning method capable of effectively scaling intervals within reasonable bounds. Third, aiming to overcome cognitive barriers and emulate imaginative processes observed in human brains, we introduce a concept clustering approach based on intent similarity which significantly reduces concept complexity while enhancing cognitive efficiency. Finally, we evaluate our classification performance using 12 datasets and experimental results demonstrate that IFCRL outperforms 14 other classification algorithms both feasibly and effectively.},

Compared with common attack detection methods relying on residuals between system and observer values, a novel and reliable mechanism for detecting DoS attacks is proposed, grounded in the logical relationship of voltage level signals derived from the outputs of detection components. Finally, a backstepping recursive design framework is utilized for constructing an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy controller.

In comparison to the traditional dynamic event-triggered scheme, the devised DMET scheme incorporates historical information of the dynamic variable, resulting in longer triggering time intervals. Note that the problem of nondifferentiability in backstepping method is generated by the event-triggered communication and quantization. To address this challenge, a smooth signal generator is introduced to reconstruct the step signals into the differentiable new one. Meanwhile, a reinforcement learning approach is employed to optimize the controllers, which utilizes an identifier–critic–actor architecture with fuzzy logic system approximations at each step of backstepping method.

  abstract     = {In large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), incomplete preferences often arise due to the complexity of LSGDM or the limited experience of decision-makers (DMs). When DMs provide preferences using incomplete fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs), most studies focus on cardinal information, overlooking the vital ordinal relations in IFPRs. However, a high level of cardinal consensus may not represent unanimous pairwise comparisons among DMs&#39; preferences. In contrast, ordinal relations are crucial for ranking results by enabling pairwise comparisons. Therefore, this article presents an LSGDM framework mining ordinal–cardinal group consensus by prioritizing ordinal relations followed by cardinal information of IFPRs. We begin by extracting ordinal relations from IFPRs. Next, an ordinal clustering optimization model is constructed to minimize overall conflicts. Finally, a value function-based consensus model is developed, identifying a consensus ranking by considering ordinal and cardinal information within subgroups. By linking this value function with IFPRs, each subgroup achieves a complete FPR that is both ordinal and cardinal consistent. The application example shows the feasibility of this approach. Numerical analyses validate the clustering optimization model&#39;s effectiveness in reducing the global average conflict degree, and simulation studies with varying levels of incompleteness in FPRs demonstrate the consensus model&#39;s robustness in achieving consistent ranking results.},

Currently, it is prevalent thinking to introduce social networks into group decision-making research, despite exhibiting promising performance, there remain significant challenges, including 1) trust risk is often overlooked, and 2) group opinions are excessively relied upon. In this regard, this article introduces the trust risk test for group consensus (SN-TRT-GC) by using probabilistic linguistic preference relations under probabilistic linguistic term sets. The proposed method ensures that the expert&#39;s competence matches the discourse as much as possible by virtue of the trust risk value. Moreover, opinion evolution relies on the dual attributes of similarity and trust, which promote the exchange of opinions among experts and greatly accelerate the consensus reaching process. Empirical investigations of satisfaction surveys demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented SN-TRT-GC technique.},

Compared with most output-triggered mechanisms, the mechanism can reduce the computation and transmission load more effectively, and requires less information interaction. The fuzzy logic systems and distributed disturbance observer are used respectively to handle uncertain nonlinear functions and external disturbances in MASs. Furthermore, considering the convergence rate of the closed-loop system, a predefined-time tuning function is introduced to preset the system stabilization time. Considering the problem of decreasing the computational complexity, the dynamic surface control technique is introduced. The stability of the controlled system is analyzed by Lyapunov function theory. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy are validated by the simulation.},

  abstract     = {In existing granular clustering algorithms, the design of coverage and specificity does not fully capture the inherent structural characteristics of granular data together with the optimization issue, and the current weight setting for the granular data is not sufficient. To address these problems, in this study, the trapezoidal information granule, which is rarely studied before, is concentrated, and we come up with a novel granular clustering algorithm called the weighted possibilistic fuzzy c-means algorithm for trapezoidal granularity (WPFCM-T). First, under the acknowledged principle of justifiable granularity, novel functions of coverage and specificity are designed for trapezoidal information granules, considering the internal characteristics of such granules. The idea of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited to upgrade the established granular data, and then the trapezoidal information granule construction (TIGC) method is proposed to realize granular modeling. Second, an exponential weight is constructed with regard to coverage and specificity, while a novel distance via $\alpha$ -cuts is given. The possibilistic fuzzy c-means structure is introduced into granular clustering, in which the new weight and distance are integrated, resulting in the proposed WPFCM-T algorithm. Third, the RC is studied to evaluate granular clustering, and hence an overall framework including granular modeling, clustering, and evaluation is constructed. Finally, through experiments completed on artificial datasets, UCI datasets, large datasets, high-dimensional datasets, and noisy datasets, WPFCM-T has superior granular data reconstruction ability by contrast with other granular clustering algorithms, indicating that the granular clustering performance of WPFCM-T is better than the others.},

In order to address the hybrid cyber-attacks, a novel integral-type sliding surface function grounded on lumped consensus tracking errors is presented, and a resilient control scheme based on this surface is designed accordingly. By adopting the analysis method of hybrid systems and finite-time control theory, sufficient conditions are deduced to guarantee that the tracking error dynamics can achieve the intended sliding surface in a finite time and remain on the surface thereafter. Meanwhile, the quantitative relationships between the influence of hybrid cyber-attacks on the convergence rate of the control strategy are clearly revealed. Moreover, the stabilities of the corresponding sliding-mode dynamics are investigated.

Then, credibility of a membership function related to a linguistic value is presented by measuring “objects in its support are close to label of the linguistic value,” which can be used to determine whether the membership function can be regarded as representation of meaning of the linguistic value. By combining credibility of a membership function related to a linguistic value with overlap indices between two membership functions, an alternative method is provided to precisiate meaning of a linguistic value and deduce fuzzy truth values of meaning rules of fuzzy If–Then linguistic rules, all of these can be exploited to improve test-score semantics of CW .

  abstract     = {Anatomically diffused tissues (ADTs) refer to soft tissues containing many anatomical regions that are spatially dispersed and structurally irregular. In magnetic resonance images, ADTs exhibit blurred morphology and heterogeneous texture, making the accurate extraction of their 3D anatomy challenging. Center-free fuzzy $C$ -means (FCM) can effectively partition nonlinear or nonspherical clusters, providing a promising scheme for ADT segmentation. It solves the uncertainty arising from unreliable center estimation by introducing a similarity criterion. However, the similarity criterion is sensitive to the number of target objects and their adjacent members in the images. Moreover, memberships of the existing algorithms are susceptible to losing real ADT details. To handle these issues, we propose an edge-preserving constrained center-free FCM algorithm for segmenting 3D ADTs in magnetic resonance images. To overcome the sensitivity of the similarity criterion, a novel object-to-cluster similarity measure is first proposed to utilize refined member-to-object adjacency. Specifically, the similarity measure focuses on members in the feature space, which share approximately homogeneous characteristics with each target object. Gradient-domain edge-preserving filtering is then combined with the improved similarity criterion to construct the novel objective function of center-free FCM. With the assistance of the designed image-driven edge-preserving regularization, the gradient information of clusters is constrained, eventually approaching that of ADTs in the guidance image. Experiments are conducted on two public brain datasets and one local intrahepatic vein dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective for ADT segmentation than the state-of-the-art peers, exhibiting superior generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {With the development of social democracy, the public begins to participate in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) events that have a significant impact on their personal interests. However, the participation of the public with insufficient expertise will cause much hesitancy in the evaluations of decision makers (DMs), which can be captured by intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Meanwhile, due to the increment in the number of DMs, the cost of consensus-reaching processes (CRPs), which are utilized to help DMs reach a consensus, is getting higher and higher. In order to improve the efficiency of the CRP, this article presents a confidence and conflict-based CRP (CC-CRP) for LSGDM events with intuitionistic fuzzy representations. In the proposed model, according to the hesitancy of the DMs&#39; intuitionistic fuzzy evaluations, an objective method is first developed to calculate the confidence level of DMs that does not require any extra information. Then, a 3-D clustering method is designed by considering the type of conflict, the degree of conflict, and the confidence level of DMs. After this, an efficiency rate of modification is defined to select DMs who will be persuaded first to adjust their evaluations with recommendation plans generated by a specific optimal method. Finally, according to the clustering process results, different CC-CRP management methods will apply to DMs with different attributes. An illustrative example and several experiments are reported to provide evidence that the proposed model is feasible and effective.},

This is in contrast to the traditional discrete description of the disease, where the inherent characteristic of its progression is ignored, and a finite number of DSs are resulted, effectively leading the sensing process to the act of classifying. Central to the framework is a canonical fuzzy model of DS that allows for the conversion of its linguistic description into a normalized numerical variable. This generates the mapping between one set with the domain of the universe of DSs and another set with the domain of the universe of disease labels (DLs). Subsequently, the framework is analyzed from the fuzzy-set-theoretic perspective by utilizing the medical expert knowledge system of disease severity, consisting of the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation, which provides useful insight that enables the disease diagnosis process to be designed and optimized as a soft-computing problem. Built on this fuzzy analysis, we present two multimodal strategies, namely 1) reversibility combining and 2) reliability combining, to enhance the sensing performance measured through the degree of nonreversibility of the surjective mapping from DLs to sensing outputs. Finally, we utilize some numerical examples based on highly realistic synthetic medical data to elaborate on the proposed framework, which offers a new perspective for disease diagnosis by monitoring continuously the individual&#39;s disease progression.},

Removing the haze from a given image is a tough issue owing to its highly ill-posed property. To restore the haze-free image effectively, we develop an unsupervised dehazing method using patch-line and fuzzy clustering-line priors in this article. The method obtains the dehazed image by inversely solving the atmospheric scattering model, which involves in estimating two key parameters, including atmospheric light and scene transmission. First, the orientation of atmospheric light is achieved by using a patch-line prior. Then, a quadtree subspace hierarchical searching scheme is designed to get the magnitude by calculating the differences between the mean and variance of each component for local regions. Besides, a fuzzy clustering-line prior combined with a guided filtering is proposed to estimate the scene transmission for each pixel. The proposed method can obtain the dehazed image directly without any training process and achieve much better performance than many existing ones with less space and time cost.},

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the model uncertainty arising from the unknown mass of the vehicle, and then we derive a thrust command law that follows from a desired stabilizing force. In addition, unlike traditional fixed and relative threshold strategies that rely solely on control signals, we develop a new time-varying event-triggered mechanism linked to the performance of the controlled system, taking into account factors, such as tracking errors, to develop angular velocity commands, enhancing tracking accuracy while efficiently conserving communication resources, especially in the absence of Zeno behavior. We present simulation results to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and validate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.},

To perform online prediction of multidimensional chaotic time series, a novel evolving fuzzy system, called hierarchical evolving fuzzy system with kernel conjugate gradient (HEFS-KCG), is proposed in this article. HEFS-KCG excavates and captures latent evolutionary patterns concealed within dynamic systems through a layer-by-layer processing of multidimensional information. HEFS-KCG performs structural evolution based on data distribution in the antecedent part, and combines the sparse learning strategy and kernel conjugate gradient to update the consequent parameters. Subsequently, we provide a theoretical analysis of HEFS-KCG, ensuring its convergence when applied to online prediction.

The synergy of fuzzy sets, information aggregation, consensus reaching, and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques offers a versatile framework for systematically incorporating human intelligence in quantitative judgments. The Best Worst Method (BWM), a robust pairwise comparison-based MCDM technique, has gained prominence due to its distinct advantages: streamlined comparison steps, more consistent preference information, and mitigation of anchoring bias and equalizing bias. This article focuses on a comprehensive survey of advanced fuzzy set theories (including intuitionistic, neutrosophic, hesitant, Pythagorean, spherical, and Fermatean fuzzy sets), commonly used aggregation operations under fuzzy numbers (including classical mean, generalized Heronian mean, power averaging, min, and max, and ordered weighted averaging operators), and group consensus reaching process for the BWM-based decision models. A generalized algorithm for the fuzzy best-worst group decision-making (F-BWGDM) process based on a democratic-autocratic decision style is demonstrated with five performance measures, including consistency ratio, conformity, minimized violation, total deviation, and sensitivity analysis. In this survey, the technical pitfalls and application studies related to F-BWGDM are analyzed to stimulate upcoming exploration in this domain, with the ultimate goal of maintaining human group decision-making processes for qualitative assessments in a fair and systematic manner.},

This article proposes a new approach for estimating unknown parameters of continuous-time dynamic models. The proposed approach is composed of three main steps: a searching grid of model parameters is formulated in certain step sizes, objective functions of all grid points are calculated, and optimal model parameters are found as the ones corresponding to the minimum value of the objective function. Compared with existing identification approaches, the proposed approach has one new feature that model uncertainties are measured based on the fuzzy set theory by a number of companion model parameters that are associated with objective functions close to the minimum one. The proposed approach does not require a restrictive assumption for existing approaches that the true unknown system must be enclosed by the model set being considered, and provides model uncertainties in the presence of model structure errors. The main obstacle of the grid search is a high computation cost in calculating objective functions for all grid points. This obstacle is overcome to an acceptable level via parallel computation using a number of CPUs in multiple computers. The proposed approach is validated and compared with the existing approach through numerical and experimental examples.},

  abstract     = {Defect recognition is an important task in intelligent manufacturing. Due to the subjectivity of human annotation, the collected defect data usually contains a lot of noise and unpredictable uncertainties, which have a great negative influence on defect recognition. It is a significant challenge to discover an effective defect recognition model with satisfactory uncertainty processing ability. A natural way is to automatically search for an efficient deep model, which can be realized by neural architecture search (NAS). To achieve this, we propose an efficient fuzzy NAS framework for defect recognition, where the searched architecture can effectively handle uncertain information from the given datasets. Specifically, we first design a fuzzy search space and the related encoding strategy for fuzzy NAS. Then, we propose a comparator-based evolutionary search approach, where an online end-to-end comparator is learned to directly determine the selection of candidate architectures from the evolutionary population. The comparator works in an end-to-end way and it transforms the complex ranking problem of evaluating architectures into a simple classification task, which overcomes the rank disorder issue suffered from traditional performance predictors. A series of experimental results demonstrate that the architecture with fewer #Params (1.22 M) search by fuzzy neural architecture search framework for defect recognition method achieves higher accuracy (92.26%) compared to the state-of-the-art results (i.e., DARTS-PV) on the ELPV dataset, as well as competitive results (accuracy = 76.4%, #Params = 1.04 M) on the CODEBRIM dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in handling uncertain problems.},

With the suitable S-ERPS, it is easy to give coordination between the items, reduce waste, and take quicker and better decisions. Implementation of an effective S-ERPS is one of the major investment decisions for any firm; thus, the selection of suitable S-ERPS requires major attention from the experts. Due to involvement of several aspects of sustainability, the S-ERPS selection process can be considered as a complex uncertain multicriteria decision making problem. The aim of this work is to develop a four-stage hybrid decision support system (DSS) by integrating the symmetry point of criterion (SPC), ranking comparison (RANCOM), and multiattribute multiobjective optimization based on ratio assessment (MULTIMOORA) approaches with q-rung orthopair fuzzy rough set (q-ROFRS), named as q-ROFR-SPC-RANCOM-MULTIMOORA. The underlying DSS consists of four main stages: first, new q-ROFR-Hamacher aggregation operators are developed to aggregate the q-ROFRSs; second, q-ROFR-score rating and rank sum model is given to find the significance weights of decision experts; third, an integrated q-ROFR-SPC-RANCOM model is developed to determine the weights of sustainability dimensions and criteria for S-ERPSs; and fourth, a hybrid q-ROFR-MULTIMOORA model is presented to evaluate and rank the S-ERPSs. To exhibit the feasibility of the developed DSS, a case study is discussed to evaluate the S-ERPS in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The developed DSS effectively prioritized the S-ERPS options and recognized the suitable S-ERPS using the information obtained from various SMEs. In this study, the evaluation criteria are categorized into social, environmental, and economic dimensions with the expert&#39;s opinions. The results indicate that cost, environmental grievance mechanisms, and technical requirements are the most effective sustainable factors, and SAP ERP is the most suitable alternative among others. The robustness and superiority of the developed DSS is evaluated by means of sensitivity and comparative analyses.

Within CET, the complex basic belief assignment (CBBA) can model uncertainty accurately, while the complex rule of combination can effectively reason uncertainty with multiple sources of information, reaching a consensus. However, determining CBBA, as the key component of CET, remains an open issue. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel method for generating CBBA using high-level features extracted from Box–Cox transformation and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Specifically, our method deploys complex Gaussian fuzzy number (CGFN) to generate CBBA, which provides a more accurate representation of information. The proposed method is applied to pattern classification tasks through a multisource information fusion algorithm, and it is compared with several well-known methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CGFN-based method outperforms existing methods, by achieving the highest average classification rate in multisource information fusion for pattern classification tasks. We found the Box–Cox transformation contributes significantly to CGFN by formatting data in a normal distribution, and DFT can effectively extract high-level features. Our method offers a practical approach for generating CBBA in CET, precisely representing uncertainty and enhancing decision-making in uncertain scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Neural network control has been developed into an efficient strategy to guarantee the safe and steady operation of wastewater treatment process (WWTP). However, due to the complex mechanism and serious damage of sludge bulking in WWTP, it is significant for neural network control to achieve the timely self-helaing of operation. Therefore, the goal of this article is to devise a knowledge-guided adaptive neuro-fuzzy self-healing control (KG-ANFSHC) for sludge bulking. The originality of KG-ANFSHC is threefold. First, a knowledge evaluation strategy is introduced to consider the correlation and differentiation between the normal operation condition and sludge bulking to obtain available information. Then, the proposed strategy can provide a guide for control to take remedial actions. Second, a KG-ANFSHC based on a knowledge transfer mechanism, which makes full use of knowledge and data to dynamically adjust its parameters, is designed to eliminate the sludge bulking. Then, KG-ANFSHC can timely and precisely regulate manipulated variables to realize the self-healing of operation. Third, the Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to ensure the stability of KG-ANFSHC. Then, the proof of stability can assist its effective application. Finally, the proposed control is applied to Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 to verify its advantages. Several results demonstrate that KG-ANFSHC can own satisfying self-healing performance to guarantee the operation recovered from sludge bulking.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an adaptive fuzzy control design for the distributed competitive control problem of multiagent systems (MASs) with multiple unknown control directions. The bipartite synchronization control is investigated by using the fuzzy backstepping control framework and fuzzy logic systems. To broaden the application field for the distributed protocol design, we consider practical bipartite synchronization for a group of MASs consisting of followers subject to heterogeneous unknown control directions. To address these multiple unknown control directions, a novel Nussbaum-type function is developed. Moreover, to reduce the communication bandwidth, this article proposes two threshold strategies for event-triggered control to avoid any unnecessary sampling while taking flexibility into consideration, further improving the efficiency and feasibility of the developed bipartite protocol design. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control method can effectively realize bipartite synchronization of MASs with multiple unknown control directions.},

  abstract     = {In practical fuzzy applications, such as image processing, the utilization of precise models in hardware may not be the most efficient approach due to increased energy consumption and chip resource allocation. In a fuzzy system, an approximate implementation of min-max blocks offers an efficient solution with minimal accuracy compromise. Nevertheless, recent designs predominantly employ noncommercialized technologies for the fundamental fuzzy blocks. This article introduces a novel hardware solution for approximate fuzzy image edge detection using the well-established independent gate Fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) technology. The proposed hardware leverages two inference rules to identify edge pixels effectively. The fuzzy inference engine is implemented at the circuit level using 24 FinFETs, whereas the defuzzifier section incorporates four FinFETs with a configurable thresholding structure for optimal performance. Our circuit-level simulations reveal a remarkable 71% reduction in energy consumption compared with previous designs. The edge detection results are compared at the system level with the MATLAB Sobel edge detector. The proposed approximate hardware consistently matches the Sobel edge detection outcomes, exhibiting a 15% average improvements in data loss rate than other approximate structures. A figure of merit (FoM) is introduced to provide a comprehensive evaluation, considering both circuit and system-level metrics. The proposed FinFET-based hardware outperforms other approximate and even exact fuzzy edge detection hardware designs, boasting a 1.8 times higher FoM. This design paradigm exemplifies a promising direction toward compact and energy-efficient on-chip hardware implementations of real-world fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the impact of partial supervision on the outcomes of modeling is of uttermost importance in semi-supervised fuzzy clustering. Semi-Supervised Fuzzy C-Means (SSFCMeans), a specific model we consider, uses a single hyperparameter called a scaling factor $\alpha$ to weigh the impact of partially labeled data. This concept became widespread and was reused directly in many works building on SSFCMeans, or even applied to other fuzzy clustering algorithms, such as Possibilistic C-Means. However, none of the works challenged the original interpretation of $\alpha$ , which suggests that the impact of partial supervision is directly proportional to the scaling factor. We fill the above-mentioned research gap and thoroughly analyze this relationship. We provide novel explanations of the scaling factor $\alpha$ in terms of the key element of fuzzy clustering—the membership values. We prove that the impact of partial supervision is a nonlinear function of $\alpha$ . Our approach is rooted in the explainability framework, which distinguishes interpretation from an explanation and treats the latter as superior. Explaining the scaling factor leads to an explainable impact of partial supervision and enables greater control of it. Finally, built on the novel explanations, we propose a unified, analytically justified framework for selecting the value of the hyperparameter $\alpha$ that is based on the cross-validation approach. We illustrate that the proposed framework enables an extensive analysis of the impact of partial supervision in SSFCMeans with a simulation experiment.},

This performance gain comes at a computational cost. We describe a new class of higher order fuzzy sets constructed from IT2 fuzzy sets that supports efficient type reduction. Our focus is on representations that use input from experts (SMEs) in the subject matter of interest. Differing interpretations of a concept by different subject matter experts (SMEs) leads to imprecision, which is captured in an IT2 fuzzy set defined on the relevant domain by approaches such as the Hao–Mendel approach. A second source of imprecision that has largely been ignored is SME confidence in their own judgments. This can also be captured as an IT2 fuzzy set, defined on the unit interval. We present a novel and intuitive construction to combine these representations into an IT3 fuzzy set. We show more generally how imprecision in hierarchical estimates of knowledge can be incorporated into a type-n fuzzy set representation.},

Subsequently, adaptive algorithms are utilized, informed by the observations of leaders&#39; system matrices, to solve the regulator equations. Then, the state observer-based controller is proposed, which employs the adaptive fuzzy-based approximation law to approximate the unknown nonlinear item and integrates the adaptive gains to cope with the actuator faults in the follower&#39;s dynamics. In addition, a set of modest conditions and rigorous proofs is constructed to guarantee the accomplishment of predetermined output containment through the output regulation method and Lyapunov stability theory.

The usage of PDT allows high-frequency switching and attacking phenomenon during certain intervals. Meanwhile, the DMETM is designed to screen for more effective triggering instants and reduce signal transmission frequency. The dynamic triggering conditions vary based on both the latest triggering data and historical triggering data simultaneously. By combining the DMETM and the acknowledgement character technique, the system can detect the initial and end instants of DoS attacks to improve control performance. Besides, a dual Lyapunov function is constructed and sufficient conditions for input-to-state stability (ISS) of nonlinear switched systems are derived. Finally, simulation verification is conducted in a nonlinear dc microgrid, illustrating feasibility, and effectiveness of the DMETM.},

First, a formation control protocol based on a fixed-time backstepping sliding-mode control is designed, in which the consensus cooperative tracking errors for each AUV will be formulated. Then, to compensate for the saturated control torques, an adaptive auxiliary variable is introduced. Finally, a fixed-time adaptive fuzzy logic control (FLC) is derived to approximate the unknown dynamics, in which the adaptive laws of the FLC are derived such that the adaptive signals and errors can be convergent within a fixed time. The fixed-time convergence is desired in practice because it provides an exciting property that the global convergence of the whole system is independent of the initial states of the AUVs. The computer simulation results for a consensus formation control of four AUVs show that the proposed formation control can provide higher tracking performance with lower and smoother control efforts.},

A novel feasible criterion is proposed to guarantee that the asymmetric time-varying constraint is not violated by demonstrating that the Lyapunov function is bounded.

The source and target domains usually share different distributions. Existing UDA research primarily concentrates on image data characterized by crisp-valued features. However, interval-valued data, where all the observations&#39; features are described by intervals, is also a common type of data in real-world scenarios. For instance, measurement instruments are unable to provide exact numerical outcomes, instead employing intervals to describe their results. Hence, this article focuses on the highly challenging context known as domain adaptation with interval-valued observations . In this environment, the objective is to improve classification accuracy within an unlabeled target domain by capitalizing on knowledge gleaned from a labeled source domain, where both domains exclusively feature interval-valued observations. To address this, we first establish an upper bound on the risk in the interval-valued target domain, underpinning our analysis with rigorous theoretical insights. Subsequently, guided by our theoretical analysis, a new model based on T akagi– S ugeno F uzzy rules and a S elf-supervised P seudo-labeling strategy (SP-TSF) is developed to address the proposed problem. Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rules are harnessed to handle the inherent uncertainty intrinsic to interval-valued data, while a pseudolabeling strategy is developed to augment distribution alignment between the source and target domains, each characterized by interval-valued observations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets verify the rationality of our theoretical analysis and the efficacy of the proposed model.},

The fuzzy transformation function is applied to extract valuable crisp-valued information from interval-valued target data, while fuzzy distances are designed to guide the fusion of multiple source models. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets verify the superiority of our proposed MSDA method for the classification task.

We argue that this is a good baseline approach, because it can be used with any classification algorithm, preserves missingness information, is very simple to apply, and offers good performance. In particular, unlike the existing missing-indicator approach, it does not require imputation, ensures that missing values are equidistant from nonmissing values, and lets decision tree algorithms choose how to split missing values, thereby, providing a practical realization of the missingness incorporated in attributes proposal. Furthermore, we show that categorical and [0, 1]-valued attributes can be viewed as special cases of a single attribute type, corresponding to the classical concept of barycentric coordinates, and that this offers a natural interpretation of polar encoding as a fuzzified form of one-hot encoding. With an experiment based on twenty real-life datasets with missing values, we show that, in terms of the resulting classification performance, polar encoding performs better than the state-of-the-art strategies multiple imputation by chained equations and multiple imputation with denoising autoencoders and — depending on the classifier — about as well or better than mean/mode imputation with missing-indicators.},

First, the fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Then, the partial loss of effectiveness and bias fault of actuator are considered simultaneously in the HNMASs, which is effectively handled by using adaptive compensation technology. In addition, the developed bipartite consensus tracking control protocol based on a practical predefined-time strategy not only ensures the fast convergence of the studied systems, but also predetermines the convergence time not relied on the initial conditions. The theoretical result shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly predefined-time bounded, and the BCTC performance is guaranteed within the predefined time. Finally, the simulation example based on the agents of different orders shows the validity of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to consider the finite-time synchronization of a class of discontinuous fuzzy competitive networks with nondifferential leakage delays. Different from the previous competitive networks and leakage-delayed networks, the activation functions are discontinuous and the leakage delays are nondifferential. Without using the Lyapunov function methods, the synchronization in a finite time is investigated based on the comparison principle and inequality techniques, which are used for the first time in the study of the competitive networks and leakage-delayed networks. Moreover, the feedback controller and bounded feedback controller are designed to help achieve the finite-time synchronization. The bounded feedback controller is formulated by the function $\arctan$ and a new inequality lemma is given, which plays a vital role in achieving the synchronization via bounded feedback controller. Although both controllers can help achieve the finite-time synchronization, it can be found that there is a big difference that the value of feedback controller is greatly influenced by system&#39;s state variables, but bounded controller is not. Such fact leads to different settling-times. The conclusion is that bounded controller has more advantages in shortening convergence time through numerical simulations.},

In this contribution, we consider the possibility of defuzzifying multiple general type-1 fuzzy sets, given that their defuzzified values are bound by a single, known constraint. This stems from an application in spatial data processing, where we obtained a number of fuzzy sets whose defuzzified values should sum up to a crisp and known value. It is possible to defuzzify each fuzzy set individually and rescale the outcomes to meet the constraint. However, considering that the fuzzy set contains information on what constitutes good values, accounting for the constraint in the defuzzification process has the potential to yield better results. We considered this as an optimization problem and investigated appropriate goal functions. The approach and goal functions are discussed with respect to typical properties of defuzzifiers.},

  abstract     = {The data mining community has a major challenge in classifying datasets with noise, outliers, and imbalanced classes. Twin support vector machine (TSVM) is a well-known plane-based learning technique for classification, however, it has poor performance on the aforementioned datasets. To address the issue, in this article, we propose a novel class probability and generalized bell fuzzy twin SVM for imbalanced data (CGFTSVM-ID). The proposed CGFTSVM-ID assigns membership value to the data points using a new membership function called class probability and generalized bell (CPGB) function. The membership function for the majority class is a combination of the generalized bell (gbell) function, class probability, and imbalance ratio. The gbell function suppresses the negative impact of outliers in the training data by assigning them less value. The less class probability of the majority class data points denotes their higher possibility to be noise. The imbalance ratio of the classes considered in the membership function tackles the imbalancing issue of the datasets. In order to ensure the importance of the minority class samples in model learning, relatively high memberships are assigned to them. Thus, the proposed CPGB function handles the class imbalance learning problem with noise and outliers. We employ successive overrelaxation technique to solve the proposed optimization problem. The extensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis carried out over imbalanced real-world UCI and KEEL datasets clearly reveal that the proposed CGFTSVM-ID has superior generalization performance in comparison to baseline models. Moreover, the experiments are also conducted on the publicly available ADNI dataset for Alzheimer&#39;s disease classification and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CGFTSVM-ID.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of uncertain spatiotemporal data has led to an increasing demand for fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge modeling in various applications. However, performing multihop query modeling on incomplete fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graphs (KGs) poses significant challenges. Recently, embedding-based multihop KG querying approaches have gained attention. Yet, these approaches often overlook KG uncertainty and spatiotemporal sensitivity, resulting in the neglect of fuzzy spatiotemporal information during multihop path reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose an embedding-based multihop query model for fuzzy spatiotemporal KG. We use quaternion to jointly embed spatiotemporal entities, and relations are represented as rotations from spatiotemporal subject to object. We incorporate uncertainty by the scoring function&#39;s bias factor, allowing for relaxation embedding. This approach facilitates the learning of a richer representation of fuzzy spatiotemporal KGs in vector space. By exploiting the inherent noncommutative compositional pattern of quaternions, we construct more accurate multihop paths within fuzzy spatiotemporal KGs, thus improving path reasoning performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on two fuzzy spatiotemporal KG datasets, focusing on link prediction and path query answering. Results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to introduce a user-controlled chaotic fuzzy cellular neural network (FCNN) model that incorporates the effects of stochastic (external) disturbances and proportional delay. Theoretically, synchronization analysis is a considerably more effective approach to exploring the dynamical characteristics of the FCNN model with and without external control input. FCNN models with suitable control input help to possess the dynamical characteristics of the traditional FCNN but with the potential to handle stochastic disturbances and other uncertainties. Besides, this study focuses on achieving synchronization within a prescribed-time synchronization. In this regard, a quantified intermittent control (QIC) scheme is proposed, which is a considerably simple but effective control for nonlinear models with stochastic disturbances. Along with QIC, the synchronization of uncontrolled (drive)-controlled (response) FCNN models can be guaranteed by employing the Lyapunov stability theory, Ito&#39;s calculus, and some inequalities. Mathematically, sufficient conditions that guarantee the global asymptotically stability of the error model will ensure the synchronization of the drive-response FCNN model. In terms of application, the drive-response model can be used as a cryptosystem (pseudo-random generator) that helps to encrypt the information from the sender side and to decrypt the information from the receiver side. Due to the chaos and randomness in the solutions, the proposed encryption/decryption algorithm is more effective and resistive than existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As data resources grow, providing recommendations that best meet the demands has become a vital requirement in business and life to overcome the information overload problem. However, building a system suggesting relevant recommendations has always been a point of debate. One of the most cost-efficient techniques in terms of producing relevant recommendations at a low complexity is product quantization (PQ). PQ approaches have continued developing in recent years. This system&#39;s crucial challenge is improving PQ performance in terms of recall measures without compromising its complexity. This makes the algorithm suitable for problems that require a greater number of potentially relevant items without disregarding others, at high speed and low cost to keep up with traffic. This is the case of online shops where the recommendations for the purpose are important, although customers can be susceptible to scoping other products. A recent approach has been exploiting the notion of norm subvectors encoded in product quantizers. This research proposes a fuzzy approach to perform norm-based PQ. Type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs) define the codebook allowing subvectors (T2FSs) to be associated with more than one element of the codebook, and next, its norm calculus is resolved by means of integration. Our method finesses the recall measure up, making the algorithm suitable for problems that require querying at most possible potential relevant items without disregarding others. The proposed approach is tested with three public recommender benchmark datasets and compared against seven PQ approaches for maximum inner-product search. The proposed method outperforms all PQ approaches, such as norm-explicit PQ, PQ, and residual quantization up to +6%, +5%, and +8% by achieving a recall of 94%, 69%, and 59% in Netflix, Audio, and Cifar60k datasets, respectively. Moreover, computing time and complexity nearly equal those of the most computationally efficient existing PQ method in the state of the art.},

A two-phase design of rule-based model is offered in this study to provide a good alternative to cope with high dimensional data. We first build a standard decision tree on the basis of variables in order to discover homogeneous subsets of the data. Subsequently, a collection of fuzzy rules is induced by the decision tree with the aim of reflecting the underlying phenomenon. The calculation of membership degrees and the refinement of fuzzy rules on the basis of data located in each partition exhibit a substantial level of originality and innovation. The introduction of fuzziness into decision rules helps to characterize and quantify the continuous change of output values near the boundary areas. The constructed fuzzy rules could efficiently handle the ambiguity and vagueness in the experimental evidence and offer an accurate characterization of the nonlinearities of the input–output relationships. The developed fuzzy models could achieve much higher prediction accuracy in comparison with traditional decision trees of the same size and fuzzy rule-based models with the same number of rules. Another advantage of the proposed methodology comes with the evident readability of the formed fuzzy rules. A series of experiments is reported to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture of fuzzy rule-based models over traditional fuzzy rule-based models and decision trees.},

However, it often happens that many sentences contain high ambiguity of sentiment. GCNs are not capable of capturing these inherent ambiguities with performance. Meanwhile, the fuzzy logic theory can improve knowledge representation under uncertainty. These facts motivate us to propose a novel fuzzy graph convolutional network (FGCN) method for SLSA by integrating fuzzy logic into GCNs to reduce the ambiguities of sentiment in sentences. In this method, the BERT+BiLSTM model is first used to convert sentences into a matrix of contextualized vectors. Second, the fuzzy function is integrated into the contextualized matrix to transform it into the fuzzy contextualized representation. Third, the sentence adjacency matrix is constructed based on the dependency tree. Fourth, the fuzzy function is continuously used to transform the sentence adjacency matrix into the fuzzy adjacency matrix. After that, the defuzzy function is used to convert the fuzzy adjacency matrix to continuous values before deriving significant features. Next, the fuzzy adjacency matrix and the fuzzy contextualized representation are concatenated to create the final representation and fed into GCN layers to capture the high-level features of the sentence. Finally, the sentiment classifier is constructed to learn the output distribution by applying the softmax function over the final representation. The experimental results on benchmark datasets prove that the FGCN can enhance the accuracy and $F_{1}$ score of SLSA compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Time series classification (TSC) is a supervised task in which time series data are associated with predefined classes. Time ordering and correlations of the samples should be considered and observations can have different lengths. Therefore, learning compact and useful representations is an important approach for TSC. Fuzzy time series (FTS) methods have the ability to find temporal patterns and transition rules. Probabilistic weighted FTS (PWFTS) uses the empirical probabilities to find the model of a TS. Despite its good performance, this method has been used exclusively for forecasting problems. Therefore, in this study we propose a novel TSC method using the PWFTS representation learning weights as features in conjunction to a classifier algorithm. We show that PWFTS method is able to learn useful representations for time series in low computational time. Our algorithm was tested in 24 datasets available in the UCR TSC archive and compared with state-of-the-art methods: fuzzy cognitive maps, Rocket, and TS2Vec in combination to the classifiers random forest and support vector machine. The classification accuracy and execution time required to find the features were evaluated. The results show that our fuzzy-probabilistic representation learning method is similar in accuracy to the other methods, and the time consumption for PWFTS computation was two to five orders of magnitude faster than the other methods. The results suggest that our approach can be used in time sensitive applications and in systems with hardware limitations.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting is an essential and challenging task, especially for large-scale time-series (LSTS) forecasting, which plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. Due to the instability of time series data and the randomness (noise) of their characteristics, it is difficult for polynomial neural network (PNN) and its modifications to achieve accurate and stable time series prediction. In this study, we propose a novel structure of hierarchical neural networks (HNN) realized by long short-term memory (LSTM), two classes of self-organizing dynamical fuzzy neural network architectures of fuzzy rule-based polynomial neurons (FPNs) and polynomial neurons constructed by variant generation of nodes as well as layers of networks. The proposed HNN combines the deep learning method with the PNN method for the first time and extends it to time series prediction as a modification of PNN. LSTM extracts the temporal dependencies present in each time series and enables the model to learn its representation. FPNs are designed to capture the complex nonlinear patterns present in the data space by utilizing fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering and least-square-error-based learning of polynomial functions. The self-organizing hierarchical network architecture generated by the Elitism-based Roulette Wheel Selection strategy ensures that candidate neurons exhibit sufficient fitting ability while enriching the diversity of heterogeneous neurons, addressing the issue of multicollinearity and providing opportunities to select better prediction neurons. In addition, L 2 -norm regularization is applied to mitigate the overfitting problem. Experiments are conducted on nine real-world LSTS datasets including three practical applications. The results show that the proposed model exhibits high prediction performance, outperforming many state-of-the-art models.},

Among the various sensors used for this purpose, the electromyogram (EMG) sensor remains one of the most widely employed. However, EMG signals are highly susceptible to electrical noise, motion artefacts, and perspiration, which can compromise their quality. To address these challenges, we designed an air-pressure mechanomyography (PMMG) sensor and developed a wearable multimodal sensor system that incorporates PMMG thigh-ring, inertial measurement unit, and force-sensitive resistor. To enhance gait phase and locomotion mode recognition performance, we proposed a gate multitask Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system (GMT-TSK-FIS) algorithm that enables simultaneous handling of multiple recognition tasks. This approach enabled the development of a lower limb motion intent recognition system that can simultaneously recognize gait phase and locomotion mode based on GMT-TSK-FIS. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of gait phase and locomotion mode recognition was 98.28% and 99.96%, respectively. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that multimodal sensor fusion outperformed single-modal sensor fusion, while multi-task recognition exhibited better performance than single-task recognition.},

  abstract     = {Q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set is a potent and effective technique for dealing with more general and complex uncertainty. Multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) under complex uncertainty has been a key research issue. However, in the existing MADM approaches, the fuzzy entropies involve much higher hesitancy degree loss and the fuzzy measure of attributes cannot be determined objectively. Also, these existing MADM methods under complex uncertainty have high data redundancy and low computational efficiency. In order to solve these problems, this article proposes a novel q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy information MADM method based on the Choquet integral. First, we give the axiomatic definition of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy entropy (q-ROHFE) by extending dual hesitant fuzzy information entropy and derive the fuzzy entropy construction theorem and the two related q-ROHFE formulas, which greatly reduces the loss of hesitancy degree resulting from the existing fuzzy entropy. Second, combined with ${\lambda }$ -fuzzy measure and proposed q-ROHFE, a constrained nonlinear fuzzy measure optimization model for q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy decision making is presented, which addresses the difficulty that existing research cannot determine the fuzzy measure of attributes under fuzzy MADM. Third, an improved Choquet integral-based VIKOR approach based on the fuzzy measure computed by the model is developed. Finally, two real-life cases are shown to fully illustrate the suggested approach. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy entropy has much less hesitancy degree loss and the proposed approach significantly increases computational efficiency while reducing data redundancy. And our method has strong adaptability and scalability.},

First, a synchronous slow switching mechanism is considered in switched stochastic MASs and realized through a class of designed switching signals under MDADT property. By utilizing the information of both specific agents under switching dynamics and observers with switching features, the synchronous switching signals are designed, which reduces the design complexity. Then, a switched state observer via a switching-related output mask is proposed. The information of agents and their preserved neighbors is utilized to construct the observer and the observation performance of states is improved. Moreover, a modified self-triggered mechanism is designed to improve control performance via proposing auxiliary function. Finally, by analyzing the relationship between the synchronous switching problem and the different switching features of the followers, the synchronous slow switching mechanism based on MDADT is obtained. Meanwhile, the designed self-triggered controller can guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are ultimately bounded under the switching signals.

Flexible manufacturing cells typically work in confined spaces in order to increase efficiency and decrease cost. The operation can be further complicated if uncertainty is involved.

The design procedure consists of five phases: constraint-following formulation, fuzzy uncertainty prescription, diffeomorphism transformation, adaptive robust control design, and Nash game-based optimization.

To this end, a novel fuzzy state observer and an auxiliary system are constructed to address unavailable impaired system states and input saturation, respectively. Furthermore, by constructing a new transformation of coordinate and employing adaptive fuzzy technique and single parameter learning approach, the sensor deception attacks, fuzzy weight, and external disturbance are reconstructed online into linear composite uncertain terms with single parameter under the framework of backstepping and dynamic surface design. In addition, the communication and computation burden is significantly reduced by using fewer single-parameter adaptive laws and dual-channel event-triggered strategy.

  abstract     = {Zero-shot fault diagnosis can identify unseen faults by predicting attributes. However, existing methods ignore the multigrained characteristics of attributes, namely, the varying levels of detail in describing fault categories. We recognize the following considerations for the first time: attributes show typical multigrained characteristics, which could be expressed in a coarse-to-fine-grained hierarchical structure; multigrained attributes play different roles in fault diagnosis, where coarse-grained attributes indicate the rough range of faults, while fine-grained attributes facilitate the precise identification of fault types. In this article, a fuzzy hierarchical zero-shot learning method is proposed to solve these issues. First, the attributes are divided into different layers according to the coarse-to-fine granularity via expert knowledge rather than being treated equally. Then, a knowledge transfer strategy is designed to transfer the knowledge from coarse-grained attributes to fine-grained ones, which can improve attribute prediction accuracy. Finally, a fuzzy inference strategy is developed to distinguish the effect of attributes with different granularity on fault inference. This strategy can identify the faults stepwise in a coarse-to-fine-grained order. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a real thermal power plant process.},

However, the fuzzy measures in the existing Choquet-like integrals are typically provided via human intervention, not driven by data, thereby significantly limiting the automation level of the resulting systems. As an effective data-driven tool, rough set theory has shown its great potential for attribute reduction while dealing with many real-world problems. Nonetheless, different reduction methods generally lead to different outcomes, while obtaining all reductions exhaustively is NP-hard. Therefore, it is an interesting challenge to induce fuzzy measures by rough sets, using corresponding Choquet-like integrals to establish a data-driven decision-making method that is applicable for practical problems. To tackle this challenge, Choquet-like integrals based on rough attribute fuzzy measures are introduced here. Also, a novel decision-making model exploits the resulting Choquet-like integrals for problems of fault diagnosis and classification. First, a form of data-driven fuzzy measure is introduced through the specificity measures of rough sets, which is named as rough attribute fuzzy measure. Second, for decision information systems, the concept of $p$ -matching degree between two objects is defined over different domain attributes. Third, based on rough attribute fuzzy measures and $p$ -matching degrees, a type of Choquet-like integral is established. Subsequently, the new decision-making network model and its associated computational algorithm are provided. The proposed approach is evaluated over both numerical examples and public datasets to demonstrate its efficacy.},

This article, instead, investigates a different challenge of achieving team superiority in dynamic competitions among competitors that evolve dynamically with MARL. We aim to enhance the competitiveness of such MARL learners by enabling them to adjust their own learning settings dynamically, so as to take quick counter measures against the policy shift of competitor learners, or to learn faster to suppress the opponents. We propose a competitive automultiagent learner with fuzzy feedback (CALF) with two essential highlights: 1) CALF establishes feedback controllers to achieve real-time adjustments based on fuzzy logic, using human-readable fuzzy rules to provide significant explainability and flexibility; 2) CALF integrates Bayesian optimization to search and optimize the feedback fuzzy logic rules automatically. CALF can be used to apply real-time adjustments for MARL hyperparameters and intrinsic rewards. We also give solid empirical results to show that CALF significantly promotes team competitiveness in adversarial competitions, spanning from small-scale tasks involving two teams to large-scale tasks involving three teams and hundreds of agents. Furthermore, CALF exhibits superior competitiveness when engaging in competition with established competitors, such as Qmix, Qtran, and Qplex, in dynamic competitive environments. Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate that the integration of the fuzzy logic with Bayesian optimization offers considerable transferability and explainability, enabling a CALF-implemented learner optimized from one scenario to be transferred to other distinct scenarios.},

Reasoning with OSF logic is based on the unification of OSF terms, record-like structures that denote classes of objects and that are themselves ordered in a subsumption relation. OSF term unification aims to combine the constraints expressed by two terms in a consistent way, and it takes into account the subsumption relation between sort symbols, providing an efficient calculus of type subsumption. This article presents an approach to define approximate reasoning with OSF logic by extending its language with a similarity relation on sorts. In order for the OSF term unification algorithm to take into account this similarity and its interaction with the subsumption relation, we propose to combine the two relations into a single fuzzy subsumption relation. The advantage is that the same unification rules of OSF logic can then be applied to this fuzzy setting. We conclude by discussing potential applications of OSF logic extended with a sort similarity relation.},

Replacing uniformly sampled centres of the membership functions with adaptive centres and fixed supports with adaptive supports allows us to preserve the input signal&#39;s local and global features and achieve a good approximation accuracy with fewer membership functions. We compare our method with uniform sampling and previous work.

A novel event-triggered mechanism is proposed, where the containment error of stochastic MASs is considered as a part of the threshold function in the form of an exponential decreasing function, which can provide more freedom to balance system performance and resource utilization. Then, a practical fixed-time containment control scheme is presented, whose convergence time is not affected by the initial conditions. Furthermore, the Padé approximation technique is utilized to convert the input delay to the case without delay. The design process of the controller is simplified, and the computational complexity is reduced. Finally, two examples are rendered to demonstrate the performance of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {The random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network has shown the potential to overcome traditional artificial neural networks&#39; limitations, such as substantial time consumption and the emergence of suboptimal solutions. However, RVFL struggles to provide comprehensive insights into its decision-making processes. We propose the Neuro-fuzzy RVFL (NF-RVFL) model by combining RVFL with neuro-fuzzy system. The proposed NF-RVFL model takes humanlike decisions based on the IF-THEN approach and enhances its transparency in decision-making. Within this framework, input features undergo a fuzzification process as they traverse the fuzzy layer. The resulting fuzzified features then navigate a hidden layer through random projection as well as yielding defuzzified values via defuzzification. The defuzzified values, hidden layer outputs and original input features collectively contribute to the output prediction process. The proposed NF-RVFL model employs three distinct clustering methods to establish fuzzy layer centers: randomly initialized centers (referred to as R-means), K-means clustering centers, and fuzzy C-means clustering centers. This approach generates three distinct model variations, namely NF-RVFL-R, NF-RVFL-K and NF-RVFL-C, each producing a diverse set of fuzzified and defuzzified samples. Our research involves experiments on various UCI benchmark datasets, covering binary, multiclass classification, and regression tasks. The statistical tests and comprehensive experimental analyses consistently show that all variations of the proposed NF-RVFL model outperform baseline models, highlighting their generalization capabilities. The proposed NF-RVFL models show the generic nature by being adeptly applicable and excelling in regression as well as classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {In heavy-duty series hybrid electric vehicles (SHEVs), the engine-generator set (EGS) functions as the main power source for propulsion. However, the limitation of engine power per liter and delayed computation of control algorithm result in the hysteretic response of EGS to high demand power. It leads to deteriorating operation of powertrain. Thus, the challenging technical issue lies in achieving stable powertrain operation, which is difficult to describe precisely by real-time control. In this work, an efficient power control scheme for heavy-duty HEV with online optimized variable universe fuzzy system is proposed. First, a splitting sequential clustering quadratic programming algorithm is designed to solve power distribution and achieve real-time control. The original subproblem is split into two subproblems with smaller scale to obtain iterative points. And clustering algorithm is introduced to gather up the points to improve the termination criterion. It turns to skip unnecessary short step in the iteration which fails to obtain sufficient descent. Then, the online optimized variable universe fuzzy system is established to achieve rapid response of EGS by adjusting power distribution. In this system, online optimization of membership function distribution parameters is considered. The optimization is constructed on real-time membership overlap degree and central value of fuzzy system rather than the traditional offline optimization using posterior information of vehicle. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated both in simulation test and hardware-in-loop test. The results reveal that stable power output is maintained and calculation time is decreased by 40.9%, 46.0% under two driving cycles.},

By employing a nonlinear state transformation function, the original constrained outputs of the MASs are converted into unconstrained ones. Meanwhile, a prescribed-time shifting function is introduced to handle the deferred output constraints, by which the singularity problem generated from the denominator of nonlinear state transformation functions is avoided. In addition, considering that the communication bandwidth is limited, a distributed dynamic self-triggered control (DSTC) mechanism is constructed to improve the transmission efficiency. Different from the traditional self-triggered control strategy, the proposed DSTC strategy allows triggered intervals to be adjusted dynamically according to bipartite formation tracking errors, which enables the DSTC strategy to compromise communication burden and system performances dynamically.

  abstract     = {Water quality prediction is an indispensable task in water environment and source management. The existing predictive models are mainly designed by data-driven artificial neural networks (ANNs), especially deep learning models for large-scale water quality prediction. However, the state of water environment is a dynamic process where the stationarity of water quality data suffers from time variation and human activities, which leads to a poor prediction accuracy because ANNs receive whole water quality data passively, including abnormal conditions. We consider such a tough problem in this article and propose an event-triggered deep fuzzy neural network (ET-DFNN) to pursue the better performance of water quality prediction in the complex water environment. First, a deep pretraining model is constructed to extract the effective features from raw water quality data. Second, we construct a DFNN model where the extracted effective features are considered as the input variables. Third, some events are defined to characterize the abnormal conditions of state evolution in water quality. The DFNN is trained and updated using different learning strategies only when the corresponding events are triggered, otherwise it ignores the current data sample and directly goes to the next data sample. The practical data-based experimental results show that the ET-DFNN achieves better prediction performance in accuracy and efficiency than its peers. Especially, the training efficiency of ET-DFNN is improved by 57.94% on total phosphorus prediction and 48.31% on biochemical oxygen demand prediction, respectively.},

Followed by two sufficient conditions to deal with the gain matrix of the state observer and the estimation error. Then, the decay aggregation strategy is used, and after offline designing an ellipse as large as possible in the direction of the short axis of the projection ellipse of the original elliptic invariant set so that the two ellipses intersect each other, the additional perturbation variables are online optimized, and convex combinations are performed, which reduces the online computational burden and enlarges the initial feasible region. Finally, according to Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the augmented closed-loop system under deception attacks is guaranteed and satisfies input constraints.

Initially, the SMHFM is developed to address the so-called conservatism problem caused by the one-order free-weighting matrix method. To solve this problem, the homogeneous polynomial technique is employed to introduce groups of free-weighting matrices for different switching modes. As a result, the SMHFM is synchronized with the working modes and possesses a high-order feature. In addition, a switching multimode mechanism is implemented to enable the SMHFM to exhibit multiple modes. Time-variant balanced matrices are introduced for different switching modes to adjust the relevant matrix terms. This adjustment allows for obtaining more relaxed conditions, leading to smaller constraint sets and higher accuracy in state estimation. Furthermore, a zonotope-based set-membership attack detection algorithm is introduced for T-S fuzzy systems, which is capable of detecting various types of attacks. By utilizing the proposed SMHFM method for attack detection, the level of conservatism in state estimation can be reduced.

Compared with finite/fixed-time control schemes, the upper bound of the convergence time no longer depends on initial conditions or complex design parameters. Instead, it can be predefined by making adjustments to a single relevant control parameter in advance. In order to avoid the violation of constraint boundaries by position tracking errors, a suitable tan-type barrier Lyapunov function is constructed, and rigorous stability is derived from constrained predefined time Lyapunov theory. The results demonstrate that the error signals converge to a small range near origin within the user-defined time. In addition, to compensate for unknown nonlinearity, a new adaptive update law associated with the convergence time control parameter is established.

To improve the estimation accuracy, an $H_\infty$ design method that can simultaneously optimize all design parameters by solving linear matrix inequalities is proposed to design the proposed observer. Second, interval estimation is achieved by zonotopic analysis on the error dynamics of the designed observer. Comparison studies show that the proposed method not only has broader application scopes but also can obtain more accurate estimation results than a state-of-the-art interval observer design method.

  abstract     = {The key focus in this article is to develop an adaptive fuzzy function constraint control method for nonlinear systems with actuator and sensor faults. The effectiveness indicators of actuator and sensor are considered as the unknown functions with the bounded time-varying bias fault existing in actuator. Because system states are not applied to design controller, how to achieve constraints on the system states is a significant challenge. In order to cope with this challenge, the constraint target transformation is introduced to convert the constraints on real states to measurement variables. Then, the nonlinear state-dependence mapping is used to ensure tracking error and system states remain within the given function constrain ranges. In contrast to the existing time-dependence constraint methods, this article considers that the constraint boundaries are related to not only time but also state variables, which extend the application fields for practical systems. Moreover, the deferred transformation function is employed to remove the restrictive condition that the initial values of system states must be within the constraint regions. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is confirmed by two simulation examples including the numerical example and wastewater treatment process.},

  abstract     = {The computation of the Jaccard similarity measure between Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy sets with uncertain means presents a significant challenge due to the lack of precise formulas and the computationally expensive nature of existing methods. This article addresses this challenge by proposing a novel method that derives analytical formulas for calculating the intersection area between upper and lower membership functions. A comprehensive analysis has identified nine cases for upper membership functions and fifteen cases for lower membership functions, with closed-form equations provided to compute the intersection areas for each identified case. By using these derived equations, the similarity measure can be computed precisely without relying solely on numerical integration. The derived analytical formulas confer the advantage of significantly reducing computational burden and accurately calculating similarity, making the proposed method more suitable for real-world applications. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that calculating Jaccard&#39;s similarity measure becomes significantly simpler when interval type-2 fuzzy sets have no uncertainties, implying that these sets are equivalent to type-1 fuzzy sets.},

In the classification process, to provide more reasonable suggestions, the subjective evaluation and qualitative selection given by decision makers and experts are important and cannot be ignored. Thus, this article proposes the hesitant fuzzy LSTM (HF-LSTM) network model to simultaneously address these two issues. To do this, we first define the series-connection hesitant fuzzy set (SHFS) and the classified SHFS to show the internal logic and the sequential order among the qualitative data. They could be more suitable presentation tools to present subjective evaluation information than other fuzzy sets. Concerning the new characters and properties of these new fuzzy sets, the HF-LSTM network is further constructed; also, the generalized and dispersed properties are proven mathematically. Then, the HF-LSTM network model is suitable for these new fuzzy environments and can provide classification results so that subjective evaluation and qualitative selection can be achieved in the whole classification process. Furthermore, this article derives the global optimization algorithm of the HF-LSTM network, which can make the final classification and improve the credibility of the classification results. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to intelligent building selection and the results present the feasibility of the HF-LSTM network and its global optimization.},

However, optimizing the roasting temperature is challenging due to complex reaction mechanisms, feed composition fluctuations, and the coupling relationship with downstream processes. In this article, a two-level decision-making system for co-optimization of the roasting temperature is proposed. In the first level, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model with a variable-weight degradation degree is established to accurately evaluate the operating performance of the zinc roasting process. The evaluation results are used to design the basic setting rules that provide the basic temperature setting values. In the second level, the concept of a temperature-adjustable margin is introduced via sensitivity analysis of the process model to evaluate the optimality of two roasters in the zinc roasting process. Based on the temperature-adjustable margin, the collaborative setting rules are designed to reasonably allocate the basic setting value to the two zinc roasters for optimizing the operating performance of the zinc roasting process. Finally, an industrial case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-level decision-making system.},

This article focuses on this problem, and proposes an adaptive fuzzy inverse optimal output feedback control strategy for a class of nonlinear CPSs suffering from actuator and sensor attacks. First, a state transformation is implemented to change the attacked system into a new system for which output feedback control becomes feasible. Moreover, the Nussbaum gain function method is adopted to overcome the design difficulties caused by uncertain network attacks and unknown control coefficients. By combining inverse optimal control design theory, fuzzy logic systems method, and adaptive backstepping technique, a novel adaptive inverse optimal output feedback control scheme is developed to guarantee the security of the closed-loop system, i.e., the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, the cost function is minimized to meet the control requirement on low power consumption. At last, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed control method are verified through two simulation examples.},

In the existing literature, cooperative game as a powerful tool is not well applied to cope with noncooperative behaviors of experts in terms of their adjustment willingness and adjustment cost. The objective of this article is to propose a group decision-making method with hesitant fuzzy preference relations based on the cooperative game to address the above issues comprehensively. To achieve this objective, the previous collaboration information of experts is applied to construct an undirected collaborative network, and trust weights of experts are determined according to the in-degree centrality of the undirected collaborative network. To determine the degree of consensus of experts, the integrated trust relationship and preference consistency level of experts are used as a referent standard for the collective preference. A cooperative game is introduced in the consensus adjustment process. Two factors, namely, experts’ adjustment willingness and unit adjustment cost, are included in the profit function of the game. In addition, the effects of changes in adjustment willingness and adjustment cost on the degree of consensus, the iteration number of games, and the ranking result of alternatives are analyzed. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by an example regarding sustainable supply chain strategy selection. Comparisons with related methods are also presented. Results show that the proposed method can reflect trust relations and noncooperative behaviors of experts, and improve the degree of group consensus.},

Technically, an adaptive hysteresis inverse constructed through an iteration algorithm and updated by a projection-based adaptive law is developed as a feedforward hysteresis compensator, and then, the hysteresis inverse compensation error and plant nonlinearities and uncertainties are handled by a newly designed adaptive fuzzy controller. With our scheme, the closed-loop stability in the sense of signal boundedness, the prescribed steady-state tracking performance, and the convergence of the iteration algorithm can be established.

To circumvent these obstacles, with the help of RL-based actor–critic architecture, a novel finite-time adaptive optimal control algorithm for each subsystem is developed to alleviate the negative impacts of cyberattacks that deliberately tamper with sensor signals. Furthermore, the proposed resilient adaptive optimal control approach for a compromised nonlinear system ensures that all the signals of the overall system remain bounded in finite time.

Specifically, a hierarchical strategy is designed to improve the estimation accuracy by preventing the wrong pruning of rules, without setting the pruning threshold based on rule density and significance. Second, an additional robust control component based on sliding mode surface is designed to suppress the influence on the control performance by external disturbances and the approximation error. Furthermore, to further improve the robust control performance and reduce computational complexity, an adaptive allocation strategy is studied to set the parameters of HSOFC.

Initially, we propose a fixed-time sliding mode differentiator to estimate unmeasured angular velocity. Model uncertainties and external disturbances are approximated using fuzzy logic systems. Subsequently, a nonsingular fixed-time adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control scheme is developed based on the backstepping theory, which actively mitigates the impact of actuator faults, resulting in superior attitude tracking performance. The theoretical foundation of the proposed control scheme guarantees the boundedness and convergence of all closed-loop attitude control system states to a confined region around the origin within a fixed time. Notably, this convergence is achieved regardless of initial errors. Finally, simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the estimator and controller.},

  abstract     = {The widely studied finite/fixed-time control guarantees fast convergence of the controlled systems. Yet, the adjustment of settling time remains complex, and the optimality of control signal is not considered. In this article, a predefined-time optimal tracking control scheme is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems with input saturation. With the aid of fuzzy approximation, the reinforcement learning actor–critic structure is established, in which the actor and critic network are used to implement control actions and evaluate execution costs, respectively. Then, by introducing the actor–critic structure into the command filtered backstepping design framework, the approximated optimal control signals containing the predefined-time parameter are derived, and an easily tunable upper bound on the settling time with respect to the predefined-time parameter is obtained. With the approximation of saturated nonlinearity using tanh function, the input saturation constraint is satisfied. Stability analysis proves that all signals in the closed-loop system can converge to a small neighborhood near the origin in a predefined time. Eventually, comparative simulations on quadrotor attitude system are carried out to assess the validity of the developed control strategy.},

Such malfunctions can significantly impact the entire system, leading to substantial economic losses. To address these challenges, this article proposes an actuator-sensor fault estimation and self-healing control scheme aimed at ensuring the stable and efficient operation of a discrete Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system. First, a dual observer fault estimation method is introduced to overcome the limitations of highly conservative stability conditions and limited applicability encountered when estimating actuator and sensor faults with a single observer. Second, self-healing controllers based on integral sliding mode and state feedback are individually designed. Lastly, leveraging the T-S fuzzy model of the wastewater treatment plant, simulation experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. Comparative analysis of simulation results reveals that the dual observer fault estimation methods exhibit faster response speed for both faults estimation. Furthermore, in comparison to other self-healing controllers, the fuzzy-weighted self-healing controller exhibits superior overall performance.},

An information-granule-consensus-based decision brings about high flexibility and promising aspects in group decision making. The consensus reaching proposals reported so far paid little attention to the merits of granular computing for managing LSGDM problems. This article concerns an extension of the well-known analytic hierarchy process to the LSGDM scenario using the optimizing-information-granule-based consensus reaching method. The consensus measurement is first quantified using coverage and specificity to derive the optimal cluster using the fuzzy C-means algorithm. Then, based on the optimization model of an information granule leading from numerical to interval representation, a novel construction model of information granule from interval representations to type-2 interval representation is developed, which yields the consistency of the obtained result instead of proceeding with an extra revision. To achieve the desired consensus, a preference modification algorithm is designed to detect the adjusted decision maker and further provide adjustment suggestions following the reference decision maker.

First, considering communication congestion and the randomly changing environment, multiple stochastic time-varying delays are introduced via the Bernoulli distribution. Second, a mode-dependent quantizer is proposed to save the limited network bandwidth. Third, to enhance network security, the measurement output signal is assumed to suffer from deception attacks during the transmission process. Subsequently, under the influences of the above-mentioned three factors, a novel filtering error model is well constructed. Further, by applying the Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory and the stochastic analysis techniques, a delay-dependent stochastic stability criterion with less conservatism is given to ensure that the filtering error system is stochastically stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance, where the feasible asynchronous filter gains and dynamic parameters can be obtained in a unified framework.

The disturbance and uncertainty are treated as an equivalent-input-disturbance (EID). However, the conventional EID estimators typically suppress the EID through high gain. Meanwhile, the low-pass filter associated with EID causes a certain degree of phase lag. A proportional–integral (PI) filter is integrated with an EID estimator to develop a PI-EID structure to improve the estimation accuracy. Based on the self-learning mechanism of repetitive control, the 2-D repetitive controller is used to achieve a high level of tracking. Unlike the conventional nonlinear repetitive control methods, the state observer and the PI-EID estimator are membership function dependent. The gains of both controllers switch in line with the signs of the time derivative of the normalized premise variables, and this framework takes full account of the information of the nonlinear membership functions. The controller design procedures and the stability conditions are detailedly presented. Finally, a rotation speed control experiment is conducted to validate the developed PI-EID method.},

Particularly, semisupervised boosting is widely recognized as a powerful approach for creating stronger ensemble classification models in the absence of sufficient labeled data without introducing any modification to the employed base classifiers. However, the potential of fuzzy systems in semisupervised boosting has not been systematically explored yet. In this study, a novel semisupervised boosting algorithm devised for zero-order evolving fuzzy systems is proposed. It ensures both the consistence among predictions made by individual base classifiers at successive boosting iterations and the respective levels of confidence toward their predictions throughout the process of sample weight updating and ensemble output generation. In so doing, the base classifiers are empowered to gradually focus more on challenging samples that are otherwise hard to generalize, enabling the development of more precise integrated classification boundaries. Numerical evaluations on a range of benchmark problems are carried out, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed semisupervised boosting algorithm for constructing ensemble fuzzy classifiers with high accuracy.},

On the basis of the newly presented convergence method and control scheme, several easy-to-verify criteria in the form of linear matrix inequalities are provided to guarantee the FxTS for fuzzy CDNs, and a more accurate estimation of the settling time is obtained. Finally, two examples are given to clarify the correctness of the established theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the optimal tracking problem for discrete-time autonomous nonlinear switched systems with the switching cost. To avoid excessive switching frequency, the switching cost between modes is considered in the performance index, which means that the optimal switching policy is not only related to the tracking error but also the mode applied at the previous instant. The objective is to make the system state track the reference signal while minimizing the defined performance function. A model-free Q-learning algorithm that learns the optimal switching policy from real system data is developed. Furthermore, it is proved by mathematical induction that the iterative Q-functions generated by the proposed Q-learning algorithm will converge to the optimum. To implement the Q-learning algorithm, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to approximate the iterative Q-functions. A novel structure of FLSs is designed to ensure the validity of Q-function approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the algorithm.},

The existing methods integrated into the TS Fuzzy model transformation offer limited capabilities in deriving only a few types of loose and tight convex hulls. In this article, we propose a radically new approach that enables the derivation of an infinite number of alternative Fuzzy rules and, hence, convex hulls in a systematic and tractable manner. The article encompasses the following key novelties. First, we develop a fuzzy rule interpolation method, based on the pseudo TS Fuzzy model transformation and the antecedent Fuzzy set rescheduling technique, that leads to a smooth transition between the Fuzzy rules and the corresponding convex hulls. Then, we extend the proposed concept with the antecedent Fuzzy set refinement and reinforcement technique to tackle large-scale problems characterized by a high number of inputs and Fuzzy rules. The article also includes demonstrative examples to illustrate the theoretical key steps, and concludes with an examination of a real complex engineering problem to showcase the effectiveness and straightforward execution of the proposed convex hull manipulation approach.},

  abstract     = {To address learning problems in which many examples and variables are involved, the use of algorithms that are capable of processing the data using simple and efficient techniques is required. The Wang and Mendel algorithm applied to classification (also known as the Chi algorithm) satisfies these properties in many cases. However, in particularly complex problems, such as those provided by big data, it has become necessary to use architectures for parallel processing, such as MapReduce, whose base algorithm is just this algorithm. The use of these architectures is necessary because the bottleneck of the algorithm is the calculation of the weight of the rules. This calculation requires, for each selected rule, to consider the adaptation of all the examples with this rule. Although this calculation is polynomial-order, in problems with many examples and where many rules are generated, it is very time consuming. In this article, we propose Quick Chi (QChi), a new algorithm based on the Wang–Mendel algorithm that uses, among other changes to make it efficient, a new way of calculating the weights of the rules that is much less computationally expensive. The reduction in learning time is so significant that it allows the algorithm to tackle big data problems without parallel processing structures. In addition to the description of the algorithm, this article checks experimentally on a wide variety of problems, including those that other authors have used as big data problems that this algorithm drastically reduces the learning time while maintaining the classification performance.},

The fruitful marriage of the two has been an active research topic in knowledge discovery. Currently, most feature selection methods via entropy theory mainly focus on the information measures at a single granular level. However, it ignores the interaction between granular levels, which leads to the poor stability and accuracy of related methods. Hence, this article proposes a novel zentropy-based uncertainty measure to design a feature selection method by exploiting the granular level structure in knowledge space. Subsequently, by analyzing the granular level structure in decision data, the zentropy-based uncertainty measure and its properties are designed and analyzed to depict the uncertainty knowledge from whole and internal. Moreover, two importance measures are defined to evaluate features based on the designed uncertainty measure, and then a corresponding feature selection algorithm is developed. Finally, some experiments are carried out on public datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance among methods, especially regarding stability and classification accuracy.},

On the basis of the proposed structural relaxation approach, the stability conditions for the analysis and $H_\infty$ synthesis are achieved through linear matrix inequalities with elaborate matrix manipulation techniques.

  abstract     = {In order to process the high-dimensionally complicated problems, the intelligence systems need to go deeper to learn high-level data representation. In this article, based on the stacked generalization principle, a multilayered stacked learning system is proposed. Like the deep networks, the proposed system is organized in a layer-by-layer way with evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) as its base-building units. Each EFS is designed as an autoencoder (AE) to learn the simpler data representation, then multiple EFS-based AEs are stacked in a feedforward manner for learning more complex data representation. Since there exists the redundant or irrelevant information in the new data representation, which may limit high generalization, a novel feature compressing layer is followed by each EFS-based AE to refine the new data representation and reduce the feature dimension via very sparse random projection (VSRP). The proposed system is featured in the following merits: 1) more expressive and complex data representation can be learned in a stacked multilayer architecture; 2) manually tuning the structure of each AE is avoided in every layer since the EFS can self-adapt both its structure and parameters online; 3) the resulting system can avoid overfitting and obtain higher generalization by removing redundant or irrelevant information via VSRP; 4) the steady-state error analysis of the proposed system is studied based on the separable approximation property, which guarantees the learning convergence of the resulting system. Our experimental results on various benchmark datasets indicate the efficacy of the proposed system.},

First, to avoid losing the initial information, the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are adopted to represent the professional knowledge of domain experts. Subsequently, a knowledge acquisition approach is proposed to acquire the knowledge parameters of PLPNs. Then, a dynamic consensus reaching method is introduced during the knowledge acquisition process to increase the group consensus level among experts. Finally, a real-world risk assessment example concerning the subway fire system is presented to validate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed PLPNs.

  abstract     = {Designing machine learning models followed by their deployment in a real-world environment has been an area of recent pursuits, resulting in a large number of successful applications. In particular, these applications target environments that call for a great deal of autonomy and criticality of the developed constructs and ensuing decision processes. An efficient design, carefully structured advanced architecture, high performance, and efficient learning methods are of paramount importance. Equally desired is the confidence of any result produced by the numeric model. In this study, we advocate that the associated information granularity of the numeric models and their results inherently link with the notion of specificity of information granularity. The confidence of results can be quantified in the form of an information granule where the two associated criteria of granular outcomes, such as coverage and specificity, are crucial to the holistic evaluation of the granularity of the results. It is shown that these two characteristics are conflicting and their quality becomes evaluated and optimized. Two main approaches are studied in depth. The first one concerns a granular embedding of numeric models. In the second one, we consider a synergistic environment of Gaussian process models whose results come as probabilistic information granules and can be transformed into interval information granules. An interesting architecture of a rule-based model constructed with the use of innovative clustering takes into account the generative-discriminative aspect of the process of structure discovery, which is accomplished through the optimization of some augmented objective functions. This model is investigated with regard to the two approaches to the design of the mechanism of granular assessment of results. Some illustrative examples are covered to show the essentials of the design process.},

However, this assumption may not hold in most real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose an information theoretical importance sampling based approach for clustering problems (ITISC), which minimizes the worst case of expected distortions under the constraint of distribution deviation. The distribution deviation constraint can be converted to the constraint over a set of weight distributions centered on the uniform distribution derived from importance sampling. The objective of the proposed approach is to minimize the loss under maximum degradation hence the resulting problem is a constrained minimax optimization problem, which can be reformulated as an unconstrained problem using the Lagrange method. The optimization problem can be solved by either an alternating optimization algorithm or a general optimization routine by commercially available software. Experiment results on synthetic datasets and a real-world load forecasting problem validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fuzzy c-means is a special case of ITISC with the logarithmic distortion, and this observation provides an interesting physical interpretation for fuzzy exponent $m$ .},

First, for an uncertain signal, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) observer is constructed. Furthermore, in accordance with the unique feature of the coefficient matrix for an uncertain block, the observation system is divided into two low-order subsystems through regular transformation. Subsequently, a common and fixed sliding surface function that does not change with jump is constructed; this is one of the characteristics that differ from the characteristics of the integral switching surface designed by many researchers who have studied the Markovian jump. An adaptive controller is also designed and finite-time reachability analysis is performed by using it. Additionally, a stochastic stability study is performed by constructing Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional, introducing slack matrices and utilizing linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical simulation was conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problem of resilient event-triggered $H_{\infty }$ filtering for networked switched Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems in the presence of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. To improve the utilization efficiency of communication resources and resist the influence of attacks, the resilient mode-dependent event-triggered strategy (ETS) is proposed to determine the necessary data transmission. Different from the existing ETSs for the switching linear systems, the proposed strategy not only removes the two adjacent trigger instants that are strictly less than the average dwell time constraint but also releases data immediately at the end of the attack to mitigate its side effects. Based on the transmitted switching signal and measurable output, the switching fuzzy filter is constructed to estimate the target signal. Unlike the traditional switching filter design, the transmission signals are affected by intermittent interruption of DoS attacks and ETS leads to the asynchronous behavior of system mode and filter mode, which increases the difficulty of filtering error system analysis and filter design. To overcome this challenge, a novel multiple Lyapunov function related to attack signals, system modes, and filter modes is established to analyze the exponential stability and $H_{\infty }$ performance of the estimation error system. Furthermore, co-design methods regarding filter gains and event-triggered parameters are given. Finally, simulation results are carried out to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to address the modeling and control problems of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems that are affected by stochastic packet dropouts. To describe the stochastic behavior of packet dropout between the sensor–controller and controller–actuator, a consecutive packet dropout model is employed. By treating consecutive packet dropouts (CPDs) as an extension of the transmission interval, the considered T-S system is transformed into a stochastic system with bounded stochastic input delay. In addition, a novel equivalent model for the closed-loop system is proposed, which captures the nonuniform distribution of the input delay caused by CPDs. Using the obtained equivalent model, it is possible to evaluate the probability distribution of each stochastic input delay value using the formula for total probability. This approach allows us to fully consider the probability information of CPDs in subsequent stability analysis and controller design. Based on this model, delay-probability dependent stability conditions are derived using stochastic Lyapunov functionals, and controller design conditions are also provided. Finally, the correctness and conservatism reduction of the proposed design method are demonstrated using numerical examples of two physical systems described by T-S fuzzy models.},

  abstract     = {We recently proposed a new class of fuzzy discrete event systems called the stochastic fuzzy discrete event systems (SFDES), which has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, including those in healthcare. An SFDES is comprised of multiple fuzzy automata with different occurrence probabilities. Assuming the number of states is known, goals of SFDES identification are: 1) determining number of fuzzy automata and their event transition matrices, and 2) estimating the occurrence probabilities of the fuzzy automata. In this article, we develop an innovative technique, named the equation-systems-based technique, which uses whatever pre- and post-event state vector pairs available to establish and solve equation systems to achieve the identification goals. The ability of using arbitrary state vector pairs is a crucial and practical advantage over another SFDES identification technique that we previously published. That technique, called the prerequired-pre-event-state-based technique, requires the system of interest to be subject to some special pre-event states during the identification process, which may not be feasible for many real-world systems. The new equation-systems-based technique has no adjustable parameter to set or hyperparameter to experiment with. Theoretical analysis is conducted on the Technique, resulting in necessary or sufficient conditions as well as formulas for computing the minimal (or near minimal) number of state vector pairs needed for various SFDES settings. Computer simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Technique.},

  abstract     = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation is one of the most important sources for renewable energy. However, PV power generation is entirely dependent on the amount of downward solar radiation reaching the solar cells. This is determined by uncertain and uncontrollable meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, as well as other factors such as topographical characteristics. Good solar radiation prediction models can increase energy output while decreasing the operation costs of PV power generation. For example, in some provinces in China, PV stations are required to upload short-term online power forecast information to power dispatching agencies. Numerous AI, statistical, and numerical weather prediction models have been used in many real-world renewable energy applications, with a focus on modeling accuracy. However, there is a need for explainable AI models that could be easily understood, analyzed, and augmented by the stakeholders. In this article, we present a compact, explainable, and lifelong learning metaheuristic-based interval type-2 fuzzy logic system for solar radiation modeling. The generated model will be composed of a small number of short IF-Then rules that have been optimized via simulated annealing to produce models with high prediction accuracy. These models are updated through a life-long learning approach to maximize their accuracy and maintain interpretability. In the process of lifelong learning, the proposed method transferred the model&#39;s knowledge to new geographical locations with minimal forgetting. The proposed method achieved good prediction accuracy and outperformed on new geographical locations other transparent and black-box models by 13.2% as well as maintaining excellent generalization ability. The resulting models have been evaluated and accepted by experts, and thanks to the generated transparency, the experts were able to augment the models with their expertise, which increased the models&#39; accuracy.},

An auxiliary dynamic system is designed to eliminate the effects of saturation. Fuzzy logic systems are applied to the state observer design, which enables the observer to obtain satisfactory observation results without relying on the system dynamic parameters. The event-triggered weight adaptive law is designed to alleviate system&#39;s computational burden. Due to the existence of output triggering, conventional recursive backstepping technology is infeasible as the virtual control law is discontinuous and no longer differentiable. Consequently, dynamic surface control is introduced to circumvent the aforementioned problem. Compared with the existing literature that considers output triggering, the assumption of the system function satisfying the global Lipschitz continuity condition is relaxed in this article. Besides, variable transformation technology is used to ensure that the output is constrained within asymmetric performance functions. Finally, the simulation results are depicted to verify the validity of the derived method.},

An agent hierarchical categorization strategy is suggested, with the assistance of which the requirements on the network topology can be relaxed, and the bipartition of all agents is easily achieved, even if the communication graph is structurally unbalanced. In addition, taking advantage of the treatment with symmetric fractional barrier Lyapunov functions, which transforms asymmetric constrained scenarios into symmetric cases and subsequently into equivalent unconstrained ones, it facilitates the realization of the bipartite consensus under state constraints and the performance analysis is greatly simplified. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the uncertainties involved in the system.

First, a granule-based soft-margin support vector machine (GSSVM) algorithm is proposed for classification tasks by introducing the $\lambda$ -conditional entropy into the hinge loss function, which takes the impact of granule size on data loss into account. Then, according to stability theory, the generalization error bound of the GSSVM algorithm is derived as a theoretical guarantee for selecting the optimal reduct. Finally, an optimization attribute reduction algorithm (RDROAR) based on the relative discernibility relation is presented by removing the attributes with low importance in a reduct while ensuring the generalization ability of GSSVM. Numerical experiments prove the effectiveness of the improved algorithm as well as verify the rationality and effectiveness of the optimal reduct.},

However, the inherent defects of PAMs, such as high nonlinearities, limited contraction lengths and frequencies, and multiple input constraints, pose significant challenges to the motion control of PAM-actuated parallel robots; meanwhile, most existing methods do not take into account motion constraints and working efficiency. To this end, a prescribed-time adaptive fuzzy motion control method is developed in this article, where PAM-actuated parallel robots can accurately achieve prescribed tracking performance within an allowable input pressure range. In particular, regardless of the initial values of target trajectories, the expected tracking accuracy is achieved within the prescribed time by restricting the tracking errors to the improved performance constraints; also, the motion velocities remain within the preset dynamic constraints, thereby improving the working safety and efficiency. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, this article presents the first adaptive fuzzy motion control method for PAM-actuated parallel robots, which can simultaneously achieve motion constraints and prescribed tracking performance.

To this end, in the first part of this article, the nonlinear system is formulated in the time-varying fuzzy manner, and based on it, a unified fault detection approach is developed by solving a multiobjective optimization problem. In this sense, the optimal tradeoff between fault detectability and robustness against unknown inputs is ensured by solving the Riccati equation. Meanwhile, a fuzzy fault detection approach is studied in the second part of this article based on piecewise-fuzzy Lyapunov functions, which is realized by solving linear matrix inequalities.

Actuator failures would have a huge impact on the system performance, especially when the actuator failures are time-varying, which may even cause system insecurity. In order to cope with time-varying actuator failures, a fixed-time convergence approach is proposed based on adaptive fuzzy control technology. Simultaneously, solving the above problems would aggravate the occupation of communication resources of the system. Therefore, a periodic adaptive event-triggered control scheme is developed, in which the triggering period can be adjusted adaptively. Furthermore, the convergence time of formation errors can be preset by applying the fixed-time control method. The convergence velocity can be accelerated immensely. Eventually, theoretical analysis and simulation illustrate that the proposed method can effectively compensate the time-varying actuator failures, and the MASs can achieve formation within a fixed time by using less communication resources.},

  abstract     = {Attributed graph (AG) clustering is a fundamental, yet challenging, task for studying underlying network structures. Recently, a variety of graph representation learning models has been proposed to effectively infer the node embeddings, which are then incorporated into conventional clustering techniques to identify meaningful clusters. While these models tend to preserve node proximities, which reflect the similarity between nodes in both structural and attribute dimensions, for representation learning, they generally overlook the crucial dependencies between node embeddings and the resulting clusters. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel fuzzy-based deep AG clustering model, namely FDAGC, which is capable of achieving the task in a purely unsupervised and end-to-end manner without additionally incorporating conventional clustering techniques. In particular, FDAGC first encodes network structures and node attributes into a compact representation with graph convolution. A reconstruction error is then estimated to minimize the information loss during network message-passing. Besides, we utilize a self-monitoring training strategy to optimize node embeddings, thus improving the cluster cohesion by guiding them toward cluster centers. In the training phase, our expectations about resulting clusters are explicitly incorporated into the optimization of FDAGC via the concept of fuzzy clustering, thus leading to more accurate clustering by coupling the dependency between graph representation learning and AG clustering. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of FDAGC in terms of several evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, normalized mutual information, F1-score and adjusted rand index, on six real-world AGs with different scales.},

When the samples with fresh properties appear, IT2FNN invariably suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to the modification of its numerous parameters. To solve this problem, an antiforgetting incremental learning algorithm is proposed to update IT2FNN. First, a double-displacement indicator (DDI) is designed to detect when catastrophic forgetting occurs caused by property drift. It integrates the indicators from the feature and target spaces to avoid missing detection of property breakpoints. Second, a multilevel learning objective is developed to perceive catastrophic forgetting. The convergence, diversity, and stability criteria of fuzzy rules are embedded into the objective to improve the compatibility of IT2FNN for different properties. Third, an adaptive hierarchical update strategy (AHUS) is proposed to update the parameters of IT2FNN. With AHUS, the parameters are shared among samples with different properties, which can alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, some experiments have verified that the performance of the presented method is superior to other methods in dynamic system identification.},

Post hoc attention mechanisms, such as class activation mapping (CAM), are commonly used to produce these pseudolabels. While traditional CAM methods derive feature importance from heuristics on gradient information, this work alternatively investigates whether a subset of discriminative activation feature maps can be down-selected and fused to improve pseudolabel accuracy. More specifically, the multiple instance Choquet integral (MICI) [1] was explored as a method for discriminative feature selection and fusion. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate the utility of the MICI in down-selecting class-discriminative activation feature maps.

When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this article, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that compared to multitask learning, our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to 19% more accurate results when using the residual network architecture and 3% when using ConvNeXt. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than other kinds of features.},

Next, a reachable set lemma is proposed to deal with stochastic variables, and a novel free-weight matrix integral inequality is also introduced to reduce model conservatism. Further, assuming that the sampling period satisfies Bernoulli distribution and introduces stochastic variables to describe the unknown input delay and sampling period, a suitable discontinuous Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional is constructed, and some sufficient conditions are derived such that all states of the systems included by an ellipsoid region under zero initial condition. Also, an optimization control algorithm is proposed to understand the output feedback structure of the proposed SASDC scheme. Finally, to prove the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed theoretical observations, the numerical simulations of wind turbine systems are validated numerically by considering the experimental range of parameter values. Then, a comparative example is also given to emphasize the superiority and relevance of the proposed method.

However, storing multiview data across multiple devices in many real scenarios poses significant challenges for efficient data analysis. Federated learning framework enables collaborative machine learning on distributed devices while preserving privacy constraints. Even though there have been intensive algorithms on multiview fuzzy clustering, federated multiview fuzzy clustering has not been adequately investigated so far. In this study, we first develop the federated learning mode into multiview fuzzy clustering and realize the federated optimization procedure, called federated multiview fuzzy C-means clustering. Then, we design an original strategy of consensus prototype learning during federated multiview fuzzy clustering. It is termed as federated multiview fuzzy C-means consensus prototypes clustering (FedMVFPC). We also further develop the federated alternative optimization algorithm with proven convergence. This study also introduces the notion of clustering prototype communication within the federated learning framework, and integrates the clustering prototypes of different views into a unified optimization formulation. The experimental studies on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FedMVFPC method improves the federated clustering performance and efficiency. It achieves comparable or better clustering performance against the existing state-of-the-art multiview clustering algorithms.},

During the long transmission from multirate sensors to the remote fuzzy observer, the amplify-and-forward relay scheme is utilized to facilitate data communication, in which the measurement outputs are first directed to the relay nodes and then sent to the observer side. A unified model, incorporating both fast and slow sampling, is described using the switching system method. Subsequently, a fuzzy PIO is proposed by utilizing estimated premise variables along with current and historical system information. Through the application of stochastic analysis theory, the error dynamics of the state estimation is examined, and the observer gain matrices are determined by solving a specific convex optimization problem. Ultimately, two simulation experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy and utility of the formulated fuzzy PIO.},

  abstract     = {As an important factor in fine thunderstorm detections, a multitime scale thunderstorm monitoring, warning, and imaging system is proposed in this article. The first computing phase involves a decomposition, classification, denoising, and reconstruction of the atmospheric electric field signals (AEFSs), collected by a self-made 3-D AEF apparatus, based on autocorrelation characteristics and fuzzy $C$ -means (FCM). Second, FCM classifies the equally divided AEFS components. A scale reconstruction rule is put forward and applied to obtain multitime scale AEF branch data, according to the component temporal continuity in the same class. A corresponding scale correction strategy is then proposed. Thunderstorm point charge coordinate results are calculated by using branch data, and noise points contained in these results are removed. Finally, the curve fitting of denoised coordinate results is performed to image the point charge moving path. Empirical results confirm that the proposed system effectively warns and images thunderstorms, as well as provides a valid reference for multiscale thunderstorm monitoring.},

A Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is adopted to characterize the underlying model with singularly perturbed parameters, which is more widely used in nonlinear systems. Because the statistical characteristic of a semi-Markovian kernel is laborious to be obtained in practical engineering, the information of a semi-Markov kernel is recognized to be incomplete. The main novelty lies in constructing a suitable fuzzy SMC scheme to realize the attainment of the quasi-sliding mode, overcoming the difficulty caused by an incomplete SMK. Based on the Lyapunov function related to the fuzzy rule and the elapsed time of current mode, the stability criterion is constructed for the corresponding model. An appropriate SMC approach is then developed to achieve the attainment of a quasi-sliding mode. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by an improved tunnel diode circuit model.},

  abstract     = {As an important kind of aggregation function, overlap functions are widely used in information fusion, data intelligence, image processing, decision science, etc. It is also used to construct new fuzzy rough set models. Moreover, fuzzy rough sets have been deeply studied and made great progress in data analysis and mining, feature selection, and other fields. However, after studying a large amount of literature, we find that the current research includes the following issues. First, existing fuzzy rough set models based on overlap functions (O-FRSs) need to be optimized (for example, the definition of fuzzy rough lower approximation in ( IO , O )-fuzzy rough sets is not flexible, which restricts the application of ( IO , O )-fuzzy rough sets). Second, the application research of O-FRSs is rarely involved, and the advantages of O-FRSs in feature selection and image processing are not presented. In this article, combining the above aspects, we extend ( IO , O )-fuzzy rough sets to ( I , O )-fuzzy rough sets (IOFRS), which are applied to feature selection and image edge extraction systematically. First, ( I , O )-fuzzy rough set model and fuzzy mathematical morphological operators based on IOFRS (IO-FMM operators) are proposed, and their relations and properties are sufficiently analyzed. Second, we propose and implement the IOFRS-based feature selection algorithm (IO-FS algorithm), and the results of 750 experiments show that the classification accuracy of IO-FS algorithm&#39;s results is better than others. Finally, combining the IO-FMM operators and fuzzy C-meaning (FCM) algorithm, an image edge detection algorithm (IO-FCM algorithm) is proposed and implemented, and the result of 35 experiments shows that the IO-FCM algorithm not only introduces the least noise but also extracts the complete image edge. The excellent performance of IOFRS in feature selection and image edge extraction fully demonstrates the advantages of O-FRSs.},

  abstract     = {Based on the support vector machine (SVM), the Large Margin Distribution Machine (LDM) improves the generalization performance by incorporating the marginal distribution theory. Nevertheless, the current LDM models (LDMs) still exhibit limitations when handling noise, such as: i) LDMs fail to effectively discern the noise samples and consequently fall short in robust defenses. ii) The hinge loss of LDMs is predicated upon the minimal inter-category separation, rendering the classifier highly susceptible to perturbations. To address these limitations, we leverage the fuzzy set theory and pinball loss function, and propose a novel Fuzzy Large Margin Distribution Machine with Unified Pinball Loss (FUPLDM), which is performed as: i) An innovative fuzzy membership function is developed, utilizing two distinct types of feature centers and their associations with the samples. The membership degree indicates the likelihood of a sample being classified as noise. As a result, the model gains the remarkable ability to accurately identify and distinguish noise. ii) A unified pinball (UP) loss is utilized to replace the hinge loss. The UP function is based on interquartile distance, which is less affected by noise and helps improve the noise immunity. Therefore, FUPLDM has superior noise recognition capabilities and substantial noise resistance against its detrimental effects. Furthermore, we also analyzed the properties of FUPLDM, including noise insensitivity, intra-class distance, inter-class scatter, and misclassification error. At last, we conduct a series of comparative experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FUPLDM.},

IOCs mean that output constraints can occur in some intermittent time intervals rather than for all time. Unlike traditional continuously monitored state-dependent switching laws, an event-triggered state-dependent switching law is constructed to overcome the difficulty of the corresponding problem of subsystems being unsolvable, which is caused by unknown control gains of subsystems going through zero. Meanwhile, a positive lower bound of consecutive switching instants is derived. Also, it is achieved that adaptive fuzzy controller and switched update laws are event-triggered by designing several new switching event-triggering mechanisms, which results in the reduction of communication and computation loads. Furthermore, by developing some modified shifting functions and barrier functions, more general intermittent output constraints are handled. The effectiveness and applicability of the method proposed are verified by a mass-spring-damper system.},

Then, using the time-varying Lyapunov function method that depends on attack parameters, the exponential stability criterion of dc-MG system under hybrid attacks is derived, which realizes the decoupling of co-design. More importantly, a co-design method of fuzzy state-FDI estimation and attack compensation control based on convex optimization technique is proposed. Furthermore, a set of switching modes are designed according to the fuzzy membership functions. Different gain matrices of attack compensation controller and state observer are designed under specific modes to reduce the conservatism of the co-design method.

Since social trust has an influence on individual&#39;s willingness to change risk ratings, this study discusses the role of social-trust-driven rating modifications willingness in prioritizing failure modes during the consensus reaching process. FMEA participants’ rejection of rating modifications suggestions significantly different from their trusted FMEA participants’ risk ratings is formulated as the basis assumption. Based on this assumption, a two-stage social-trust-driven consensus model is proposed to assist FMEA participants with linguistic distribution assessment in reaching consensus willingly.

However, the quality of samples can vary greatly. While partial samples are dominated by high-quality domain-invariant class-related information, others may only contain irrelevant domain-specific information or useless random noise. Treating all samples equally may lead to negative transfer, significantly impairing the performance. To address the issue of varying sample quality, we propose an attention module to emphasize the samples that are most suitable for transfer. Within the attention module, we have designed a fuzzy inference system to assess the quality of data based on its class and domain information. Such a fuzzy inference attention (FIA) module demonstrates strong interpretability due to its consideration of the fuzzy nature inherent in class and domain information within the data. FIA also has high flexibility and extensibility as the rule base can be easily adjusted by expert knowledge. More importantly, FIA does not use any parameters requiring training and has a low overhead. This makes it fast and applicable to most existing UDA methods. The experiments on several benchmark datasets prove that FIA can bring significant improvement to existing methods.},

Meanwhile, in cooperation with the controller, the proposed compensator shares the same membership functions (MFs) and modes as the controller, providing a more reasonable structure and bringing less conservatism. To tackle the dual asynchronous phenomenon characterized by asynchronous modes and mismatched MFs simultaneously, an asynchronous nonparallel distributed compensation controller is presented with the idea of hidden Markov model. Furthermore, the asynchronous control strategy is investigated to guarantee the strictly dissipative and stochastically stable performance of the augmented closed-loop systems under the condition of partially known CPM. Less conservative criteria is guaranteed by introducing Lyapunov functionals with mode dependence and fuzzy basis dependence.

Furthermore, an affine matched sampled-data controller is designed to contain an affine transformed membership function, thereby achieving larger stabilizable regions. Based on a novel fuzzy Lyapunov function and parameterized matrices bounding technique, a sufficient condition concerning the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop fuzzy system is formulated in the form of linear matrix inequality. In comparison with the prior works, the derived condition has less conservative and the largest sampling interval. Numerical experiments on Rosser&#39;s system confirm the advantages and benefits of the novel mismatch parameter-dependent stabilization approach.},

  abstract     = {Except for linguistic interpretability and uncertainty-handling ability, fuzzy Apriori method (FAM) is being hurdled by both very expensive computational burdens and low generalization capability caused by serious correlation between short to long fuzzy rules generated. The novel doubly interpretable classifier (DI-FAM) with FAM-based hybrid structure is proposed to circumvent the above shortcomings of FAM. DI-FAM successively stacks the short rule bundles of each FAM subclassifier on both a sampled feature subset and the outputs of the previous stacking layer. DI-FAM then finds out the output weights of short rule bundles at each stacking layer, followed by a linear subclassifier (as a compensator) on all the original input features with one-step wide calculation. DI-FAM has four distinct merits: 1) low computational complexity stemmed from both its fast generation way of short rule bundles by FAM subclassifiers, respectively, on their own features, and its one-step calculation for the output weights; 2) theoretical guarantee about no violation of the importance ranking orders of the short rules by each FAM subclassifier on its own features at each stacking layer with regard to all the fuzzy rules by FAM on all the input features; 3) enhanced generalization capability by successively stacking short rule bundles at each stacking layer according to the stacked generalization principle; and 4) double interpretability that DI-FAM shares both linguistic interpretability of all FAM subclassifiers and feature-importance-based interpretability of a linear subclassifier. Extensive experimental results indicate the effectiveness of DI-FAM in the sense of classification performance, training speed, incremental learning, and double interpretability.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel algorithm for factorization of matrices with grades or, equivalently, for decomposition of fuzzy relations. The algorithm is inspired by a recent factorization method for Boolean matrices and develops two ideas in the setting of ordinal attributes. First, it uses formal concepts associated with the factorized matrix, or fuzzy relation, as essential components around which factors are built. Second, it steps back when computing new factors to check whether some computed factors may be eliminated or improved given the subsequently generated factors. The new algorithm thus uses convenient properties of formal concepts utilized by previous factorization algorithms. Still, unlike the previous algorithms, our algorithm allows for more general and therefore more precise factorizations due to a possible overcovering of the input data, which our new algorithm admits. We provide an experimental evaluation of the new algorithm and compare it to some existing algorithms for factorization of data with grades. The evaluation reveals that our new algorithm outperforms the current algorithms in terms of quality of factorization. We also present observations and improvements for factorization of Boolean matrices. We conclude with a discussion regarding open research topics.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to model and investigate the dynamical properties of a grid-connected permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). Considering the dc-link capacitor in voltage equations of PMSM can cause hyperchaotic solution behavior, whereas the conventional PMSM model exhibits chaotic solutions. In addition, disturbances are inevitable in WECS hence in this study the aerodynamics of PMSM is considered as stochastic disturbances that can degrade the performance of the WECSs. As a result, grid-connected PMSM is modeled as stochastic differential equations with nonlinear characteristics. Due to nonlinearity, investigating the stability properties of PMSM with dc-link is economically expensive. In this regard, an equivalent Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model can be derived to mimic the dynamical characteristics of the stochastic PMSM model with the help of fuzzy membership grades. Overall this study focuses on designing a suitable control algorithm that guarantees the global stable performance of T–S-based linear hyperchaotic PMSM model involving stochastic disturbances. Among various controllers, an event-triggered-based sampled-data control scheme with continuous-type network transmission delay is considered to be effective for the proposed model with disturbances. Theoretically, the Lyapunov stability theory is employed to derive sufficient stability conditions in terms of solvable linear matrix inequalities. Technically, the numerical simulations are performed with the experimental range of parameter values to validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical frameworks.},

SMP integrates dimensionality reduction, multiprototype clustering, and multiprototype merge clustering under a two-layer seminonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF) architecture. Specifically, the first semi-NMF layer performs multiprototype clustering, which solves the problem that a single prototype cannot represent complex data structures. Meanwhile, the multiprototype fuzzy clustering constraints ensure that the multiprototypes better characterize the original data structure. The second semi-NMF layer performs multiprototype merge clustering to mitigate the issues of heavy computation burden and poor antinoise performance of the spectral clustering algorithm. The introduction of the Laplace graph matrix regularization constraint in this layer assists SMP in completing the merging of multiprototypes with complex data structures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

For the purpose of reducing conservatism, additional groups of gain matrices are introduced corresponding to different switching modes such that the switching controller switches along with the working modes. Then, the resilient fuzzy stabilization can be accomplished by the proposed controller when the condition of alarm threshold is satisfied. Second, regarding controller design, few groups of time-variant balanced matrices (TVBM) coping with different switching modes are introduced to update the linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for system stabilization. Thereby, the feasibility of LMI conditions can be enhanced by using the TVBMs to adjust the related matrix terms in the framework of the homogeneous polynomial technique. Therefore, larger feasible region and less conservatism can be attained by the developed switching mechanism than before even if the alarm threshold is assigned larger values.

To address this issue, this article proposes a fuzzy neural controller to learn kinematic parameters online and synchronously achieve the model-free control of redundant manipulators. Specifically, this controller consists of a gradient-based fuzzy (GBF) subsystem and a neural dynamics (ND) subsystem. On the one hand, the GBF subsystem is designed to achieve online learning of kinematic parameters, considering additional noise and a fuzzy parameter. Notably, the fuzzy parameter can drive the GBF subsystem to automatically terminate the learning process and convert the acquired information into usable structural knowledge once the kinematic parameters are precisely learned. On the other hand, based on the learned kinematic parameters, the ND subsystem is employed to solve a quadratic programming scheme for the kinematic control of manipulators. Such a scheme implements functions of orientation maintenance, trajectory tracking, and joint constraints in a model-free manner. Theoretical analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller&#39;s learning and control abilities. Finally, simulations, experiments, and comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the fuzzy neural controller in controlling manipulators with unknown kinematic parameters.},

To remove this limitation, for strict-feedback nonlinear systems under output quantization, a new adaptive fuzzy inverse method is presented in this article, which achieves the optimal performance without relying on the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Considering that only quantized output is applied to feedback, first of all, a novel quantized state observer is devised. Second, the unknown nonlinearities are approximated by fuzzy logic systems. Third, to overcome the issue that the partial derivatives of virtual controllers do not exist after quantization, the command filtering technology is applied. Then, by combining the tuning functions and the projection operator, an auxiliary intermediate controller and a parameter adaptive law are constructed. Furthermore, an adaptive inverse optimal controller under output quantization is established. It is shown that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the inverse optimal practical stabilization is realized.

Nevertheless, a worrisome and overlooked issue is that the loss of visual features in the camera&#39;s field of view may lead to the failures of the visual servoing tasks. This article addresses the visual features escaping problem, by implementing an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function with a field-of-view constraint controller. The asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function defines a tightly specified range for the feature coordinate errors and ensures the transient response of the tracking error as well as enables arbitrary tracking accuracy. It is worth noting that the asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function directly handles the visual-robot-coupled dynamics while guaranteeing system stabilities. Besides, to accommodate the uncertain dynamics derived from a high-dimensional coupled system, an adaptive controller is proposed utilizing fuzzy neural networks with computational efficiency and few training parameters to enhance the control performance.

We analyze the intricate asynchronous switching scenario under dual data derivative injection attacks (DDIAs) with duration limits. In particular, the IT2 fuzzy controller (IT2FC) acquires a false switching signal of subsystems manipulated by the data integrity attacks. Next, the event-triggered scheme with rolling detection (ETSRD) based on matching conditions of switching modalities and interval constraints of DDIAs is proposed to reduce asynchronous durations between switching subsystems and controllers while enhancing the stability of the closed-loop system. The switching rule associated with DIDIAs duration parameters is then developed to ensure exponential stability in the framework of the dwell time technique, which permits irregular destabilizing and stabilizing switching. The joint design of the IT2FC, ETSRDs, and switching rule yields a security control scheme for OR of IT2-SFSs in the presence of severe instability, DIDIAs, and packet delays. Finally, a robot model with a single-link arm is used to exemplify the proposed methodology.},

Instead of the tracking errors themselves, the auxiliary error variables constructed via the shifting function are employed into nonlogarithm barrier Lyapunov function to perform error constraints, not only making the restrictive conditions in initial phase be removed but also ensuring tracking errors to evolve within the preassigned regions after a given time. Then, to allow for a reduced computational cost concerning fuzzy/neural approximators, a single parameter updating based fuzzy wavelet neural network is devised to approximate the unknown nonlinearity acting on every subsystem. Furthermore, by using hysteresis quantizer to convert continuous control inputs into discrete scalars, a robust fuzzy quantized controller is synthesized with the aid of a novel quantization decomposition scheme, where the problem of constrained data bandwidth is successfully handled without involving chattering in control signals. Finally, simulations confirm the benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Then, an estimator-based secure control scheme is proposed by employing the adaptive backstepping technique against DoS attacks, where the unknown nonlinearities are approximated through fuzzy logic systems due to their powerful approximation capability. By combining of Lyapunov stability theory and a modified average dwell time method that incorporates the constraints imposed on DoS attacks, the stability of the closed-loop system is established. Moreover, the controller guarantees the convergence of tracking errors to a vicinity of the origin even under DoS attacks, and all signals remain semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability.

This article proposes a graphical game-based adaptive fuzzy optimal bipartite containment scheme that removes these restrictions. The optimal containment is formulated as an $N$ -player game over the communication topology for high-order nonlinear MASs by defining a cost function that integrates the agent&#39;s control inputs, including those of its neighbors, and the local tracking errors. To seek the Nash equilibrium, integral reinforcement learning is adopted, which does not involve the system drift dynamic. This approach eliminates the need for an identifier network and simplifies the control scheme using adaptive critic learning. To drive the online learning mechanism, the Bellman residual error is utilized, and a fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the optimal value functions of the critic networks. The updating laws incorporate an experience stack, resulting in an easy-to-check persistence excitation condition. It is proven that the synchronization error is uniformly ultimately bounded, and the bipartite containment of the outputs of followers is achieved. An illustrative example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.},

Some early attempts in the field have successfully combined CCL and 3WD, i.e., three-way concept learning. However, only a few attempts were made to combine CCL with 3WD in a dynamic fuzzy context due to two challenges: 1) Three-way CCL incapability; 2) The current incremental three-way concept learning mechanism is insufficient to model real-time updating cognitive procedure. Hence, this article first shows some new standpoints on improving fuzzy-based CCL accuracy and then proposes fuzzy-granular three-way concept-cognitive learning (F3WG-CCL) for concept modeling and dynamic knowledge learning. Specifically, we first define a new F3WG-concept to characterize the knowledge embedded in fuzzy data. Furthermore, a big concept priority principle and an update mechanism are borrowed for concept recognition and dynamic concept cognition. Finally, we show that F3WG-CCL can be implemented simultaneously via theoretical guarantee and sufficient experimental, including 1) achieving state-of-the-art dynamic knowledge learning; 2) demonstrating that the three-way concept is effective in a fuzzy context; and 3) discovering that the big concept is valuable for fuzzy concept recognition.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy systems (FSs) have been widely utilized in diverse domains, such as pattern recognition, intelligent control, data mining, and bioinformatics due to their strong interpretation and learning abilities. Traditionally, FSs have mainly been applied to model Euclidean data. However, with the emergence of scenarios involving graph data, such as social networks and traffic route maps, which inherently possess non-Euclidean structures, there is a need to develop FS modeling methods suitable for graph data while retaining the advantages of traditional FSs. This article presents a novel FS called graph fuzzy system (GFS) specifically designed for modeling whole graph data. The concepts, modeling framework, and construction algorithms are systematically developed. First, the article defines GFS-related concepts, including the graph fuzzy rule base, graph fuzzy sets, and graph consequent processing unit (GCPU). Second, the learning framework for GFS is proposed. It includes a novel K-Means with graph similarity measure clustering approach (KM-GSM) for generating antecedents in GFS and a new consequent parameters learning algorithm based on graph neural network (GNN). Moreover, three different versions of the GFS implementation algorithm are developed and thoroughly evaluated through experiments on various graph prediction datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed GFS inherits the advantages of mainstream GNNs methods and conventional FSs methods while achieving superior performance in whole graph prediction compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recent changes in trade barriers and increasing uncertainties in trade policies have forced companies to rethink their optimal supply chain settings. This article studies the impact of the regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) agreement, particularly the cumulative rules of origin, on the resilient manufacturing supply chain network design problem with demand uncertainty. Three resilience strategies, namely, multiple sourcing, capacity redundancy, and technology innovation, are employed to improve supply chain resilience. Using type-2 fuzzy theory, we develop a distributionally robust fuzzy optimization (DRFO) model to address the proposed problem. In this model, the demand is represented as a parametric interval-valued fuzzy variable and its associated uncertainty distribution set. In terms of the model&#39;s tractability, we analyze the computational issues of the credibility constraint and reformulate the DRFO model into a computationally tractable mixed-integer linear program. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a real-life automotive supply chain case and demonstrate its superiority in providing uncertainty-immunized solutions. Our analysis reveals that the RCEP agreement may deepen the manufacturing supply chain networks in Asia–Pacific and promote their integration and localization. Also, we find that using any resilience strategy or a mixture of them can increase supply chain&#39;s resilient performance while decreasing costs against disruptions.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the stability analysis and event-triggered controller design of interval type-2 (IT2) discrete-time positive polynomial fuzzy networked control (DPPFNC) systems with time delay subject to asynchronous premises. The reasonable design of the IT2 polynomial fuzzy event-triggered controller guarantees the closed-loop system&#39;s positivity and stability, reduces energy consumption, and efficiently utilizes the communication bandwidth. Furthermore, for DPPFNC systems with time delay, obtaining more relaxed stability conditions and lower network communication frequency is quite challenging, even for the current advanced theory. Meanwhile, to strengthen the practicality of the control strategy, the asynchronous constraints of premise variables due to the introduction of the network are considered. Aiming at the above problems, a polynomial fuzzy event-triggered control (ETC) strategy is proposed based on the stability analysis of IT2 membership function (IT2-MF) dependence and imperfect premise matching. First, the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model, which employs IT2-MFs to capture parameter uncertainty, depicts the event-triggered positive nonlinear dynamics. Second, an IT2 polynomial fuzzy event-triggered controller is designed by introducing the 1-norm ETC strategy. Then, by optimizing the approximation error between the original and the approximate membership function, a genetic algorithm is employed to relax the stability criteria. Finally, numerical and practical examples illustrate the viability of the suggested design.},

However, their reliance on predefined graphs constrains the efficacy of label propagation (LP) and interpretability in predictions, especially in high-dimensional feature spaces with limited information. Addressing these challenges, this article employs a fuzzy graph-based label propagation (FGLP) model, which is inherently interpretable in exploring the similarities of the normalized histogram envelope-based scaled features assisting data categorization. FGLP initiates the structuring of an undirected fuzzy-weighted graph using the novel fuzzy distance matrix by exploiting the local data affinity with reduced influence of outliers. The learned information is then optimized using two distinct SoftMax-constrained objective functions coupled with cross-entropy and lasso regularization to construct the similarity and projection matrices in tandem assisting LP and feature selection in scarcely labeled high-dimensional feature space. Performance validation on heterogeneous datasets showcases FGLP&#39;s superiority, achieving over 88% accuracy with just 10% labeled data, surpassing prior methods by an average enhancement of 18.29%.},

However, FAM successively expands shorter rules into longer ones and simultaneously discards short rules that perform poorly on the training data, which inevitably results in highly correlated rules and hence deteriorates its generalization capability. By designing a novel cognitively confidence-debiased adversarial attack on fuzzy association rules, an adversarial fuzzy Apriori method (FA 2 M) is proposed in this study to ensure enhanced generalization capability of FAM. FA 2 M has three distinct merits: 1) Reliable analysis about why adversarial attacks should be directly exerted on confidence and support&#39;s values of fuzzy association rules instead of inputs and/or outputs. 2) Cognitively behavioral inspiration by actively debiasing a small amount of cognitive base-rate biases in a disturbed way during the generation of FAM&#39;s rules while such a bias means that humans tend to ignore the base rates of fuzzy association rules during their plausibility evaluation. In other words, the active usage of the proposed cognitively confidence-debiased adversarial attack may be beneficial for FA 2 M to obtain higher generalization capabilities. 3) Theoretical guarantee about FA 2 M&#39;s enhanced generalization and overfitting-avoidance capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that FA 2 M attains satisfactory classification performance and enhanced generalization capability while maintaining the interpretability of fuzzy association rules therein.},

To this end, a wide ensemble of all base regressors (i.e., FIMG-TSKs) called EFIMG-TSKs is proposed.

To assess uncertainty in project activity time, the Pythagorean fuzzy reasoning might be appropriate in circumstances where past performance is either unavailable or irrelevant. The development of Pythagorean fuzzy critical path method, however, was motivated by the vagueness of the time parameters. By utilizing Gaussian Pythagorean fuzzy numbers as time spans of activities, we propose an approach that relies on credibility-based ranking to add ambiguities into classical critical path method. In addition, we define the Pythagorean fuzzy precedence diagramming technique, which is used to analyze project networks comprising mutually dependent activities with lead or lag time spans. The suggested approach is successfully examined for a case study in project management by the Council of Multiple Listing Services Florida, concerning a project plan created to provide ePropertyWatch, enabling it to assist project managers in better grasping and managing project schedule uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Along with the abundant appearance of the interval-valued time series (ITS), the study on ITS clustering, especially shape-based ITS clustering, is becoming increasingly important. As an effective approach to extracting trend information in time series, fuzzy trend granulation addresses the needs of shape-based ITS clustering. However, when extracting trend information in ITS, unequal-size granules are inevitably produced, which makes ITS clustering difficult and challenging. Facing this issue, this article aims to generalize the widely used fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm to a fuzzy trend-granulation-based FCM algorithm for ITS clustering. To this end, a suite of algorithms, including ITS segmenting, segment merging, and granule building algorithms, are first developed for fuzzy trend-granulation of ITS, with which the given ITS is transformed into granular ITS, which consists of double linear fuzzy information granules (DLFIGs) and may be of different lengths. With the defined distance between DLFIGs, the distance between granular ITS is further developed through the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. In designing the fuzzy trend-granulation-based FCM algorithm, the key step is to design the method for updating cluster prototypes to cope with the unequal lengths of granular ITS. The weighted DTW barycenter averaging method is a previously adopted prototype updating approach with the drawback of hardly changing the lengths of prototypes, which often makes prototypes less representative. Thus, a granule splitting and merging algorithm is designed to resolve this issue. Additionally, a prototype initialization method is also proposed to improve the clustering performance. The proposed fuzzy trend-granulation-based FCM algorithm for clustering ITS, being a typical shape-based clustering algorithm, exhibits superior performance, which is validated by the ablation experiments as well as the comparative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble methods are widely used to tackle class imbalance problem. However, for existing imbalanced ensemble (IE) methods, the samples in each subset are resampled from the same dataset, and are directly input to the classifier for training, so the quality (diversity and separability) of the subsets is unsatisfactory usually. To solve the problem, a deep fuzzy envelope sample generation mechanism is proposed. First, the fuzzy C-means clustering based deep sample envelope prenetwork (DSEN) is designed to mine correlation information among samples, thereby increasing the quality of the subsets. Second, the local manifold structure metric and global structure distribution metric are designed to construct local-global structure consistency mechanism (LGSCM) to enhance distribution consistency of interlayer samples of DSEN. Third, the DSEN and LGSCM are combined to form the final deep sample envelope network–DSENLG to refresh the existing subsets. Finally, base classifiers are applied on the new subsets generated by the DSENLG and then fused, thereby realizing a new IE algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than existing representative IE algorithms and it achieves the highest improvement of 10.64%, 19.5%, 18.67% and 22.33% on four criteria over the state-of-the-art methods. The originality of the article is threefold: proposing the concept of “deep fuzzy samples” or “envelope samples”, which comprehensively considers the correlation information among original samples; proposing the LGSCM to resolve the distribution inconsistency of interlayer samples; and forming an fuzzy envelope sample based IE algorithm.},

However, the existing proposals based on adversarial steganography against targeted steganalyzers are insufficient in terms of eliminating or reducing anomalous pixels caused by subsequent embedding. This limitation impedes the full potential of cover enhancement schemes for enhancing steganographic security. In this article, we present Immucover, a novel immunized cover image construction method that leverages fuzzy enhancement and an artificial immune system (AIS) to incorporate texture region- and edge-region-adaptive enhancement. Specifically, we first design a parameterized method to adaptively enhance the texture region of the given cover image using a distortion function. Then, Immucover detects and enhances the edge region of the cover image using a fuzzy-parameterized approach based on an optimized smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus for edge detection. Finally, a powerful AIS module acts as an optimizer to optimize the parameters that affect the texture and edge area, i.e., the area where the secret information is suitably embedded. In this way, a so-called immunized cover image is generated. In addition, we develop a novel affinity metric to assess the antibody quality within the AIS module, which guides the generation of the immunized cover with higher security. Comprehensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that our Immucover provides significantly improved resistance to steganalysis and enhances the security of steganography.},

The study utilizes the unique characteristics of switching and fuzzy logic systems to introduce a continuous piecewise predefined-time controller with a fault-tolerant compensation mechanism to avoid singularity problems.

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel attention-based reinforced interval type-2 fuzzy clustering neural network (ARIT2FCN) is developed to improve the generalization performance of fuzzy clustering-based neural networks (FCNNs). Commonly, fuzzy rules in FCNNs are generated through the clustering-based rule generator. However, the generated fuzzy rules may not be able to fully describe the given data, because the clustering-based rule generator does not simultaneously consider the intracluster homogeneity and intercluster heterogeneity for both of data characteristics and label information when defining membership functions (MFs) of fuzzy rules. This negatively affects fuzzy rules to accurately quantify the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity and degrades the performance of FCNNs. The ARIT2FCN is proposed with the aid of the attention-based clustering mechanism and the successive learning method. The attention-based clustering mechanism is designed to define MFs by simultaneously considering data characteristics and label information. The successive learning method is adopted to construct the desired fuzzy rules that can capture the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity. Moreover, L$_{2}$ norm regularization is used to alleviate the overfitting effect. The performance of ARIT2FCN is evaluated on machine learning datasets with 16 comparative methods. In addition, two real-world problems are adopted to validate the effectiveness of ARIT2FCN. Experimental results demonstrate that the ARIT2FCN outperforms the comparative methods, and the statistical tests also support the superiority of ARIT2FCN.},

During multiple-mode operations, both actuated and unactuated constraints are guaranteed by constructing integral constraint terms as time-variant gains, which introduce control energy in advance, to drive all state variables to converge to their desired values, rather than direct braking force that may destroy the transient performance of unactuated states (e.g., residual payload swing induced by rapid braking in cranes). Further, when underactuated systems suffer from matched/mismatched disturbances, a model-independent disturbance observer is elaborately designed to improve anti-disturbance performance, ensure the boundedness of closed-loop signals, and restrict all variables in every mode . Based on Lyapunov methods and the concept of average dwell time, the closed-loop stability of entire switched systems is theoretically analyzed and proven; then, the effectiveness of the proposed switching controllers is verified by hardware experiments.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is the most widely used soft clustering algorithm. In contrast to hard clustering, the cluster membership of data generated using the fuzzy c-means algorithm is ambiguous. Similar to hard clustering algorithms, the clustering results of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm are also suboptimal with varied performance depending on initial solutions. In this paper, a collaborative annealing fuzzy c-means algorithm is presented. To address the issue of ambiguity, the proposed algorithm leverages an annealing procedure to phase out the fuzzy cluster membership degree toward a crispy one by reducing the exponent gradually according to a cooling schedule. To address the issue of suboptimality, the proposed algorithm employs multiple fuzzy c-means modules to generate alternative clusters based on memberships repeatedly reinitialized using a metaheuristic rule. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets are elaborated to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm to thirteen prevailing hard and soft algorithms in terms of internal and external cluster validity indices.},

Meanwhile, a novel mode-dependent event-triggered optimized mechanism for subsystem is proposed to resolve the impact of asynchronous switching on system performance, which not only does not have strict assumptions but also reduces the communication burden. Moreover, to eliminate the impact caused by actuator failures, fault-tolerant compensation scheme depending on the switching signal is designed. By presenting Lemma 3 and using the coordinate transformation technique, it is proven that the choice of the performance index function still conforms to the control protocol under the prescribed performance control framework.

To address these problems, we propose a novel approach called curriculum learning-based FSVM. Our approach employs a curriculum-learning strategy, where the model initially learns easy samples to avoid noise interference and obtain a good initial solution, before proceeding to learn all samples, including hard ones. To distinguish between easy and hard samples, we introduce an adaptive density-based clustering model, which is extended to kernel feature space. Moreover, we propose a slack variable-based fuzzy membership function to evaluate the importance of samples. Additionally, our model adaptively adapts the importance of samples based on feedback during the learning process.

Subsequently, a new objective function is formulated, incorporating the distribution of these parameters. To solve this objective function, a probabilistic inference strategy is developed to estimate the distribution. Using this distribution information, a solving strategy for the fuzzy model is devised. By constructing the distribution relationship between disturbances and model parameters and incorporating probabilistic information in the model, the proposed method demonstrates enhanced robustness and reliability for motion intention recognition under noisy conditions.

The DFM-FNCN employs the divide-and-conquer technique, where a feature map-based fuzzification operation is proposed to find the firing strength of a fuzzy rule, to address the curse of dimensionality problem.

The inference behavior of a fuzzy rule is interpreted by inspecting the relationship between the visualized antecedent and the classification levels of each class in the consequent. To speed up retraining of the DFM-FNCN in a new scenario, this article proposes a method to select representative retraining images in a low-dimensional fuzzy rule-mapped space.

  abstract     = {With the development of fuzzy set theory, the clustering methods widely used in various fields can be divided into hard clustering methods and fuzzy clustering methods. Fuzzy clustering methods use the membership function with values in the interval [0, 1] to describe fuzzy concepts, which is different from the idea of “non-0 is 1” in hard clustering methods, so they are more suitable for some real datasets. In this article, we introduce a novel fuzzy clustering method called fuzzy connected clustering (FCC), which is based on the idea of topological connected components. According to the basic view of topology, FCC directly considers the location characteristics between objects, unlike the common clustering methods that need artificial conditions, such as distance scale, cluster center, fuzzy similar matrix, etc. We use topological knowledge to derive FCC through a series of strict logical reasoning, and design a new algorithm, FCC algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a method of constructing “partial order” to express the clustering results of FCC intuitively. Combining with the application examples of FCC, we not only demonstrate the FCC&#39;s high interpretability in dealing with real-world problems, but also compare FCC with the commonly used fuzzy clustering method FEMCM. Moreover, we also try to use a benchmark dataset to show how well the FCC deals with real problems related to fuzzy concepts. Finally, we further discuss the extensions and limitations of FCC, and give some basic directions to effectively address these limitations, as well as prospects for future work related to this novel clustering method FCC.},

This article first designs a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) system to track the states of a nonlinear time-varying system. Creating a working NTSMC for practical applications is quite complex because the detailed system dynamics, which includes the unpredictability of the controlled plant, is not available beforehand. Thus, this study suggests that a recurrent Petri probabilistic fuzzy neural network with asymmetric membership function (RPPFNN-AMF) can act as a close substitute for the ideal NTSMC to resolve its existing complications. Furthermore, this study modifies an adaptive compensator to proactively adjust for the potential calculated deviance of the RPPFNN-AMF.

  abstract     = {This article extends the finite-time adaptive tracking control to stochastic nonlinear systems with multiple uncertainties, including output constraints, unknown parameters, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances. Most relevant results in literature have two main restrictions: 1) uncertainties and unknown items in the systems; 2) the matter of “explosion of complexity.” By integrating an improved technique of adding fuzzy logic systems to estimate unknown parameters with a bounded command filter method, a systematic tracking control scheme is developed that eliminates both of the above restrictions. To alleviate the serious uncertainties caused by the constraints, a quartic asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is utilized when the control coefficient is known. Subsequently, an event-triggered controller is constructed that enables boundedness and finite-time convergence of all closed-loop signals. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation strategy, this new method is applied to ship maneuvering systems that encounters multiple uncertainties arising from disturbances, such as wind, waves, and ocean currents.},

In this article, the event-based synchronization problem for quaternion-valued Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy MNNs (QVT-SFMNNs) with time-varying delays is studied. Different from the existing synchronization results of MNNs, T-S fuzzy logic and quaternion are simultaneously considered in the MNNs, which makes the model more applicable. Based on some algebraic properties of quaternions, a novel event-based fuzzy controller and some static and dynamic event trigger conditions are designed. By constructing simple Lyapunov functions instead of complex Lyapunov functionals and using Halanay inequality, several sufficient criteria are given to ensure the global exponential synchronization between the considered QVT-SFMNNs. Meanwhile, the Zeno behaviors of the response QVT-SFMNN under different event trigger conditions are excluded. It is important to note that the results obtained in article are less conservative and applicable to low-dimensional complex-valued and real-valued MNNs.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel randomized neuro-fuzzy model called fuzzy stochastic configuration networks (F-SCNs), which integrates the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy inference system into SCNs to enhance its fuzzy inference capability. Unlike original SCNs, the hidden layer in SCNs is replaced by the T–S fuzzy inference module, which is responsible for fuzzifying the input data and performing fuzzy reasoning. The fuzzy rules generated by the fuzzy module are directly connected to the output layer of the network. In addition, an enhancement layer is added between the fuzzy module&#39;s output and the output layer of the network to extract nonlinear information contained in fuzzy rules. The parameters of fuzzy systems are determined by the distribution characteristics of the input-output data of the network, which enhances the interpretability of the model. Moreover, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model are learned by stochastic configuration algorithms. Therefore, the model inherits the fast learning speed and universal approximation capability of SCNs. A series of simulation experiments are carried out, including nonlinear dynamic system identification, sequence prediction, and benchmark data modeling from the real world to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a soft sensing model for the effluent total phosphorus concentration in wastewater treatment processes is developed based on the proposed F-SCNs. The results show that the proposed method has good potential for nonlinear system modeling tasks compared to some classical neuro-fuzzy and nonfuzzy models.},

The difficulties in solving such problems include the integral windup problem and the severe chattering problem when the system converges. Moreover, the design of the traditional fixed-time controller algorithm in the integral sliding mode control becomes complicated. In order to overcome these difficulties: 1) a piecewise function which can bring distant states closer to the sliding surface is considered in the integral function to prevent the integral windup problem, 2) a class of state variable controllers with odd power is designed to solve the chattering problem due to there is no sign function, 3) a fixed-time control algorithm is introduced into the integral function and the controller to guarantee that both the reachability and sliding motion phases are fixed-time stable. Furthermore, based on 1) and 3), an appropriate fixed-time conditional integral sliding mode controller is constructed to ensure the fixed-time reachability of the designed sliding mode surface. Besides, combining 1), 2) and 3), a class of chattering-free fixed-time integral sliding-mode controllers is established to obtain the fixed-time reachability of the sliding mode surface and the fixed-time stability of sliding mode dynamics. This method dramatically reduces the chattering problem and can adjust integral windup.

This is achieved by using a joint random process, which is presented in a concise format and encompasses both spontaneous and simultaneous jumps. Further to facilitate the design flexibility and low implementation burden, the structure of the asynchronous polynomial fuzzy controller is formed based on the imperfect premise matching scheme. Facing both mismatched modes and mismatched premise variables, a joint Markov chain-based membership-function-dependent stability criteria is established by utilizing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory and the $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ performance analysis is then conducted using a sum-of-square approach.

  abstract     = {This article explores the design of switched fuzzy controllers for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems with a fuzzy-rule-dependent adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM). First, a novel fuzzy-rule-dependent AETM is proposed for the studied system, which takes into consideration both the information of membership functions (MFs) and fuzzy rules. The corresponding AETM for each fuzzy rule can effectively conserve the limited communication bandwidth by adaptively adjusting the triggering parameter based on the state evolution trends and MF information. Second, an appropriate switched IT2 fuzzy controller is designed that can be switched according to the values of the MFs. Compared to the existing works, the proposed switched IT2 fuzzy controller achieves superior control performance. Subsequently, relaxed stability conditions are developed by considering the information of both the lower and upper MFs, and introducing some slack matrices to cope with parameter uncertainties. The proposed stability condition can stabilize the state of the resulting closed-loop system despite the AETM. Finally, a practical mass–spring–damper example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the presented method.},

Fuzzy logic systems are employed to model unknown agents, and a state observer is designed to obtain the state information of system. A smooth model is designed to approximate the nonsmooth saturated function by using the continuity of hyperbolic tangent function such that the system outputs can be used for backstepping design. To deal with the nondifferentiable problem of virtual controllers caused by switched topologies, a novel high-order distributed filter is proposed to estimate the local reference signals; then, the continuous local tracking errors instead of the noncontinuous local formation errors are utilized to design the virtual controllers. By utilizing backstepping recursive design, an output feedback formation control scheme is developed. It is proved that the closed-loop signals are all bounded, the leader-follower formation is achieved, and the system outputs are constrained in their saturated bounds.

This article focuses on the fault detection problem of interval type-2 Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems with external disturbances, and noises by investigating set-membership estimation. The existing set-membership techniques give the admissible compact set of residuals under the condition of no fault, which is generated by Luenberger-like observer. The boundary of the compact set is affected by the disturbances and noises in the process channel and the measure channel, which results the main difficulty in improving the accuracy of fault detection. To this end, a zonotopic analysis-based $H_{-}/L_{\infty }$ fuzzy fault detection unknown input observer is proposed to decouple disturbances from residual dynamic, to improve the efficiency of fault detection and to further reduce the admissible compact set of residuals. Meanwhile, the Lyapunov function of fuzzy basis dependence is used to analyze the stability and $H_{-}/L_{\infty }$ performance of fault detection unknown input observer, further reducing conservatism. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed fault detection unknown input observer.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF) is a typical forecasting method with wide application. Traditional FTSF is regarded as an expert system, which leads to the loss of the ability to recognize undefined features. The mentioned is the main reason for poor forecasting with FTSF. To solve the problem, the proposed model differential fuzzy convolutional neural network (DFCNN) utilizes a convolution neural network to reimplement FTSF with learnable ability. DFCNN is capable of recognizing potential information and improving forecasting accuracy. Thanks to the learnable ability of the neural network, the length of fuzzy rules established in FTSF is expended to an arbitrary length that the expert is not able to handle by the expert system. At the same time, FTSF usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance of nonstationary time series due to the trend of nonstationary time series. The trend of nonstationary time series causes the fuzzy set established by FTSF to be invalid and causes the forecasting to fail. DFCNN utilizes the difference algorithm to weaken the nonstationary time series so that DFCNN can forecast the nonstationary time series with a low error that FTSF cannot forecast in satisfactory performance. After the mass of experiments, DFCNN has an excellent prediction effect, which is ahead of the existing FTSF and common time series forecasting algorithms. Finally, DFCNN provides further ideas for improving FTSF and holds continued research value.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses cooperative target enclosing of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to obstacles. Each ASV suffers from input constraints in addition to unknown kinetics induced by model nonlinearities, unknown input gains, and external disturbances. A safety-critical cooperative target enclosing control method is proposed for surrounding a maneuvering target vehicle. Specifically, a finite-time fuzzy predictor is presented to learn the unknown kinetics with the integral of historical vehicle data. By using a distributed target estimator to recover the target position, a nominal distributed target enclosing control law is developed to achieve a circumnavigation formation. To avoid collisions between ASVs and obstacles/team members, input-to-state safe high-order control barrier functions are first introduced for encoding safety constraints. Based on the safety constraints and input constraints, a quadratic programming problem is formulated, and an optimal safety-critical control law is obtained by using projection neural networks to track the optimal solution. The closed-loop control system is proven to be input-to-state stable via Lyapunov theory. Moreover, the multiple ASV systems are proven to be input-to-state safe regardless of high-order relative degree. The salient contributions of the proposed approach lie in finite-time fuzzy learning and collision-free target enclosing control under disturbances. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed safety-critical model-free control method for cooperatively surrounding a maneuvering target.},

This function is utilized to design a fixed-time optimal scheme based on an identifier–actor–critic structure, which is a well-established control framework.

The extraction process involves mapping the original data into a space with lower dimensions while preserving the desirable information. However, the data often has hidden manifold structures, which contain neighbor sample information within the same class. Most existing methods that extract data features without considering the potentially significant manifold structures would result in poorly discriminative features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel geodesic fuzzy rough set model (GFRS) to capture those complex manifold structures embed in the data. Given GFRS, we further design a discriminant feature extraction algorithm based on graph embedding to enhance the discriminative performance of the extracted features. Extensive experiments on fourteen real-world datasets and visualization results on modified national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) digits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over baselines methods.},

To address this drawback, a novel algorithm named as multi-view fuzzy clustering based on anchor graph is presented. The proposed method can simultaneously obtain the membership matrix and minimize the disagreement rates of different views. A novel regularization based on trace norm is also presented in this article, which can not only obtain a clear clustering partition to prevent that all samples belonging to each cluster with the same membership value $\frac{1}{c}$ , but also balance the size of each cluster.

  abstract     = {This article aims to develop a methodology for the hybrid-triggered control for nonlinear switched systems under denial-of-service attacks. By means of the T–S fuzzy method, the complex nonlinear system is transformed into a series of local linear models. Essentially different from the common switching signal design for DoS attacks, it challenges the situation that attack signals may appear with high frequency in a certain interval. The phenomenon aroused by attacks and the characteristics of the switched system constitute a double-layer switched structure, both of the switchings described by the PDT switching rule. A hybrid control strategy based on event-triggered mechanism is utilized to reduce the frequency of data transmission, where signal updates of the controller exhibit aperiodic. By constructing a Lyapunov function depending on dual switching signals, sufficient conditions to ensure the global exponential stability of the considered system are deduced. Furthermore, the minimum interval between two successful events under the event-triggered mechanism is calculated, which proves that the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, a simulation example and an example of the single-link robot arm are studied, illustrating the proposed method&#39;s feasibility and effectiveness.},

Specifically, a spatiotemporal fuzzy set on a hypercube is first constructed from the 3-D fuzzy set on a simple 1-D space domain to completely take into account the spatial–temporal property of the PPDS. Then, a spatiotemporal fuzzy system is developed on an open subset to approximate any real continuous functions in a separable Hilbert space based on the spatiotemporal fuzzy set notion. It is shown that any continuous functions can be approximated by the proposed spatiotemporal fuzzy system in arbitrary precision. Both indirect and direct spatiotemporal adaptive fuzzy state profile tracking control strategies are put forth with the use of the spatiotemporal fuzzy system. The resulting closed-loop tracking error system&#39;s stability is thoroughly examined in terms of Lyapunov stability.

  abstract     = {In the traditional constrained control of nonlinear systems, the controller design usually requires that the initial value of the system meets certain strict conditions, and generally only considers static constraints. This article concentrates on the issue of adaptive fuzzy echo state network decentralized control for fractional-order (FO) large-scale nonlinear systems with strong interconnections and time-varying deferred constraints. With the backstepping technique, an FO fuzzy echo state network is constructed to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and interconnected terms in each step, which greatly removes some additional assumptions on unknown functions and provides a higher degree of design freedom and stronger robustness. A shifting function and an error transformation scheme are introduced to handle constraints against the unknown initial tracking condition. Moreover, the constraint conditions are satisfied within a specified time even if they are violated initially by using a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function. Especially, an equivalent definition of the bivariate convex function is given, and an inequality is constructed, which can be used to analyze the stability of FO systems by constructing a bivariate Lyapunov function. According to the FO Lyapunov stability theorem, the proposed adaptive controller can ensure that all the signals involved remain bounded and the tracking error possesses a fast convergence. Finally, an example of the FO single-machine-infinite bus power system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

This article investigates the ${H_\infty }$ control issue of T-S fuzzy Markov jump systems with time-varying delay. First, delay-product-type terms and MFs are introduced to design a new LKF, which fully utilizes the information of time-varying delay and MFs simultaneously. Moreover, based on a hidden Markov model, the controller mode is assumed to operate asynchronously with the system mode, and an asynchronous switching fuzzy controller is proposed by employing the switching approach. Thus, a more practical and less conservative stability criterion is obtained to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with ${H_\infty }$ performance.

A fuzzy approximation-based optimal consensus control scheme is proposed via the reinforcement learning algorithm. Meanwhile, a time-varying constraint function is embedded into the optimized backstepping consensus design to guarantee the consensus errors converge to a preassigned residual set within the prescribed time. To overcome the difficulty of the virtual optimized controller design caused by unknown virtual control coefficients, a class of intermediate variables is designed. A modified variable separation technique is proposed to circumvent the problem of algebraic loop caused by the construction of virtual optimized controllers. Then, based on the reconstruction of unknown bounds, a fault-tolerant controller under the quantization action is developed to compensate for the impact of unknown actuator faults automatically, and achieve semiglobally ultimately uniformly bounded results. In the end, a practical example of a group of single-link manipulators is given to illustrate the validity of the presented method.},

An adaptive optimized control algorithm is proposed using the backstepping technique and reinforcement learning method. The algorithm incorporates an identifier–critic–actor architecture and features a flexible design of dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) to decrease signal transmission. The ETM is adaptively adjusted by the estimated fuzzy adaptive weights and design parameters, making it more efficient in terms of communication resources. Moreover, to ensure the system states do not exceed their constrained sets while achieving the optimization objective, a novel performance index function based on the barrier Lyapunov function is constructed. Finally, it can be demonstrated that the system output accurately tracks the desired reference signal, while ensuring that all closed-loop signals remain bounded.

First, a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) is designed to adaptively approximate the strong nonlinearity of the system. Then, the self-organizing strategy, based on rule similarity and validity, is studied to adjust the number of fuzzy rules in SOFNN to improve the approximate accuracy. Second, a dynamic surface control scheme is designed to describe the system dynamics. Then, the dynamic surface control law is obtained to achieve the stable control. Third, a state predictor is developed to predict the state variable accurately. Then, the prediction error is utilized to design the adaptive law of PSOC to reduce the variation range of tracking control errors and further improve the control accuracy.

Evaluating different noise-control technologies by many experts according to multiple attributes can be seen as a multiattribute large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problem. The existing LSGDM models often neglected the time costed by consensus reaching progress, and methods to determine the number of clusters and the influence of unstable opinions of experts are rarely discussed. As experts spend different amounts of time in hesitation and revising their opinions, the adjusted opinions are always fed back to the moderator asynchronously. Considering the hesitancy time of each expert, this study designs a multiattribute LSGDM model with a minimum-time-based consensus mechanism to help select noise-control technologies for practical cases. Additionally, an iterative self-organizing data analysis clustering algorithm is adopted to cluster experts, and a punishment mechanism for experts with unstable opinions is proposed. A numerical example regarding the selection of traffic noise-control technologies for an expressway shows the effectiveness of the proposed model. Comparative analyses verify the advantages of our proposed method in saving the time of opinion adjustment process.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering has received great attention in recent years for the potential in clustering performance improvement by using cooperative learning of different views. Despite the considerable progress, a few issues remain: 1) real multiview data contains redundant features and noises that lead to unsatisfactory clustering performance; 2) most existing multiview clustering methods only mine the shared information between views and ignore the specific information within views; and 3) most multiview clustering methods are based on a two-step framework that learn the hidden view representation and then perform clustering, overlooking the correlation between the two processes. Although some approaches have been proposed to deal with these issues, they cannot them simultaneously. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multiview fuzzy clustering. First, we construct a multiview fuzzy clustering framework to mine the specific information of the visible views. Second, to reduce the impact of redundant features and noises on clustering performance, we introduce the orthogonal projection matrix into the clustering framework to learn the low-dimensional representation of the visible views. Meanwhile, this procedure is integrated into the clustering framework. Third, we explore the shared hidden view representation between the visible views by multiview non-negative matrix factorization and integrate it into the clustering framework to realize visible-hidden view cooperation learning. Finally, the shared hidden view representation learning between visible views, the low-dimensional representation learning of visible views, and the clustering partition of multiview data negotiate with each other in the end-to-end learning framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark multiview datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.},

Then, a new practical preassigned fixed-time nonsingular terminal sliding-mode (PFNTSM) control algorithm with the shared-control framework is subsequently established, which is beneficial to sustain the continuity, nonsingularity, and higher robustness to system uncertainties. A significant feature of this study is that a complete force-position synchronous tracking and transparency-lifting human–robot interaction are realized. Moreover, the absolute stability of the two-port networked system under complex transmission time delays is rigorously proved.

As for the sampling-dependent functional approach, it improves the previously common functionals from the following two innovations. First, the distinctive basic term is able to combine aperiodic sampling in various degrees and thus become discontinuous. Second, the proposed sampling-dependent looped-functional terms are with different matrix variables for aperiodic sampling intervals. Therefore, the approach reduces the conservatism of the stability and stabilization results for the systems with aperiodic sampling.

  abstract     = {A latent feature analysis (LFA) model is very efficient in representation learning to high-dimensional incomplete (HDI) data emerging from various Big Data-based applications. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is frequently adopted as the learning algorithm by an LFA model owing to its ease of implementation. However, the standard SGD-based LFA model&#39;s training process is serial, which greatly decreases its scalability on massive HDI data. On the other hand, all existing parallel SGD-based LFA models suffer from low speedup due to their frequent synchronizations during the training process. Motivated by this discovery, this article proposes an asynchronous parallel fuzzy stochastic gradient descent (APF-SGD) algorithm to establish an efficiently parallelized LFA model on shared memory with threefold ideas: first, decoupling the update interdependences among heterogeneous latent features alternatively, thereby achieving two parallelizable subtasks without learning information loss; second, proposing a novel parallelized learning scheme that eliminates the synchronizations from both the subtask and thread perspectives, i.e., subtasks and their affiliated threads are taken simultaneously and continuously without any synchronization; third, applying the fuzzy optimization to its hyperparameters, thus enabling its adaptation in training. Theoretical convergence proof illustrates that the newly proposed APF-SGD algorithm guarantees the convergence of a resultant LFA model. Experimental results on four real HDI datasets illustrate that an APF-SGD-based LFA model outperforms several state-of-the-art parallel SGD-based LFA models in both missing data estimation accuracy and parallelization speedup.},

Meanwhile, knowledge embedded into vector space can imply more meanings. Much real-world information, however, is often uncertain and dynamic. Existing KG embedding (KGE) models are insufficient to deal with uncertain dynamic knowledge in vector spaces. To overcome this drawback, this article concentrates on an embedding module for the distributed representation of uncertain dynamic knowledge and proposes a strongly adaptive fuzzy spatiotemporal RDF embedding model (FSTRE). Specifically, we first propose a fine-grained fuzzy spatiotemporal RDF model, which provides the underlying representation framework for FSTRE. Then, within the complex vector space, spatial and temporal information is embedded by projection and rotation, respectively. Fine-grained fuzziness penetrates each element of the spatiotemporal five-tuples by a modal length of the anisotropic vectors. By using geometric operations as its transformation operator, FSTRE can capture the rich interaction between crisp and static knowledge and fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge. We performed an experimental evaluation of FSTRE based on the built fuzzy spatiotemporal KG. It was shown that our FSTRE model is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can handle complex fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge.},

The unknown nonlinear function in the robotic manipulator is handled by employing an intelligent estimation technique based on fuzzy logic systems. Unlike the related finite-time work, a new adaptive command-filtered finite-time controller is constructed by fusing a piecewise continuous function in each step of the backstepping process, such that the singularity of the control signal of the finite-time results is completely circumvented. Further, the mathematical model of the dead zone is delicately reconstructed such that the dead-zone input can be rigorously designed using effective mathematical techniques.

  abstract     = {Segmentation on the left atrium from magnetic resonance imaging scans is a crucial task for the clinical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have demonstrated their advantages in recent years, but they often suffer from the difficulty to process high uncertainty of some regions. Focusing on the cognitive uncertainty in deep neural networks, we build an uncertainty-aware model based on anchor fuzzy sets in this article. A fuzzy entropy measure defined on membership functions is employed to quantify the uncertainty induced by an anchor&#39;s membership degrees to the individual categories. A key insight in this study is that the anchor regions with higher uncertainty are considered to include hard-generalized cases. Based on this prior of high uncertainty about image segmentation, the uncertainty-aware model exhibits the self-learning attention that sheds light on the regions the deep learning should focus on. In addition, our segmentation model with an uncertainty-aware plug-in unit highlights its nonlocal perception due to Fourier convolution and global self-attention mechanism. Experiments show that our model can achieve competitive results on left atrium segmentation tasks. This article provides some useful guidelines for using uncertainty modeling to improve the performance of deep learning systems for image segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this article, fractional-order nonautonomous system (FONAS) with the input delay and nonlinear terms are considered and investigated using adaptive fuzzy control method based on Q-learning. With the novel estimation model, the defined predictions for the error system determines the weights of the fuzzy logic system (FLS). On this basis, an error derivative-based cost function is introduced, which not only deals with the classic problem that quadratic term cost function is unbounded in infinite time, but also resolves the challenge that the exponential discount factor cost function fails to stabilize asymptotically. For the unmeasurable part of the state, the designed fuzzy observer eliminates the restriction on the gain parameters. Furthermore, based on the measured information and the actor–critic architecture of the online training FLSs, the improved adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) input approximate the optimal control. Utilizing a fractional-order Lyapunov method, the stability of FONAS with actuator faults is discussed, and a sufficient criterion for stability is obtained, which is easier to perform with convex optimization tools. Finally, numerical simulations are shown to display the effectiveness of the optimal adaptive fuzzy FTC strategy.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates a game-theoretic optimization approach toward robust control of uncertain dynamical systems with state and input constraints. The uncertainty involved is possibly rapidly time-varying but bounded within a prescribed fuzzy set. For this, the associated fuzzy dynamical system is appropriately established and constructed based on fuzzy set theory. To cope with the bounded state and input constraints, a novel state-and-input diffeomorphism technique is proposed, where a transformed system is formulated such that the prescribed inequality constraints are innovatively merged into the stabilization and trajectory tracking problems. Furthermore, a diffeomorphism-based robust control strategy is developed to ensure the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the transformed system. Under this proposed control architecture, the constraint satisfaction of the original system is, thus, always analytically ensured based on the rigorous properties of the diffeomorphism technique. The resulting control parameter optimization problem then has to take into account the multiple considerations (and compromise) amongst the factors of the steady-state performance; the finite convergence time, and the control effort. For this, a two-player Nash game is formulated and solved in an effective manner. The Nash equilibrium is obtained and the existence of the solution is also proved theoretically. With this methodology, and with the resulting attainment of the desired Nash equilibrium, the attendant outcome of superior system performance is achieved. Finally, numerical simulations on a steer-by-wire system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained lip image segmentation plays a critical role in downstream tasks, such as automatic lipreading, as it enables the accurate identification of inner mouth components, such as teeth and tongue, which are essential for comprehending spoken utterances. However, achieving accurate and robust lip image segmentation in natural scenes is still challenging due to significant variations in lighting condition, head pose, and background. This article proposes a novel deep neural network-based method for fine-grained lip image segmentation that exploits fuzzy and graph theories to handle these variations. A fuzzy learning module is designed to deal with the uncertainties in color and edge information and enhance feature maps at various scales. The fuzzy graph reasoning module with fuzzy projection models the relationship among semantics components and achieves a global receptive field. In our experiments, a fine-grained lip region segmentation dataset, i.e., FLRSeg, is built for evaluation, and experimental results have shown that the proposed method can achieve superior segmentation performance (94.36% in pixel accuracy and 74.89% in mIoU) compared with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) lip image segmentation methods.},

  abstract     = {Considerable research achievements have been made in utilizing information granulation as an effective technique for addressing long-term time-series forecasting. However, existing studies suffer from limitations in their failure to account for the impact of periodicity on information granulation. As a result, the predictive outcomes of the model are significantly restricted, including issues, such as the accumulation of original errors and low temporal correlation. To address the aforementioned issues, this article presents a novel approach for long-term time series forecasting by employing a multilinear trend fuzzy information granule (FIG) within a periodic framework for LSTM. The proposed model tackles the problems through several key steps. First, the time window is divided during the information granulation process to enhance the periodic information of the time series. Second, a dynamic time warping (DTW) information granule segmentation and merging algorithm is utilized to adjust the division of information granules, ensuring periodic consistency and alignment with the time series&#39; change pattern. Lastly, Gaussian linear FIGs and LSTM are employed to achieve consistent forecasting of data points with consistent trend characteristics, including trend changes, fluctuation magnitudes, and trend persistence. This approach effectively prevents the accumulation of errors over time and enhances the temporal correlation of the data. Experimental results on open time series demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed forecasting model.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous feature transfer (HeFT) learning can leverage the semantically related source domain from a different feature space for modeling the target domain with insufficient information. Although HeFT learning has made significant progress, it still faces two major challenges: weak interpretability of the transfer process and underutilization of the hidden information of the heterogeneous source and target domains. To address these two challenges, a framework called heterogeneous feature transfer using fuzzy inference rules (HeFT-FIR) is proposed. The HeFT-FIR framework has two parts: First, design of Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems (TSK-FSs) for the source and target domains, respectively, to achieve HeFT and enhance the interpretability of the transfer process; and second, integration of the HeFT learning mechanism with fuzzy inference rules to optimize the parameters of TSK-FSs and mine the hidden information of the two domains. Based on the framework, a TSK-FS-based heterogeneous feature transfer learning method is then developed with three fuzzy feature space-based learning mechanisms for joint distribution adaptation, local geometric property preservation, and heterogeneous discriminant information extraction, respectively. The mechanisms reduce the difference in distribution between the heterogeneous source and target domains in a common feature subspace, preserve the local geometric properties of two domains, and extract the global discriminant information of them. Extensive analyses are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed framework and method.},

  abstract     = {Manipulability ellipsoid on the Riemannian manifold serves as an effective criterion to analyze, measure, and control the dexterous performance of robots. For asymmetric bilateral telerobotics, due to the different structures of leader and follower robots, it is difficult or even impossible for the operator to manually regulate the manipulability of the remote follower robot. Thus, it is desired that the follower robot can automatically regulate its manipulability to assist the operator in remote different task executions, like humans regulating their own postures to enhance manipulability and adapt to different task scenarios. This article proposes a novel framework for manipulability transfer from human to robot. In this framework, we develop a Type-2 fuzzy model-based imitation learning method to encode and reproduce manipulability ellipsoids from demonstrations. This method can achieve high performance in accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, it supports learning from a single demonstration. Then, we combine this method with a Riemannian manifold-based quadratic programming control algorithm such that the robot manipulability can fast track the desired manipulability profile. This framework is applied to telerobotics, in which a bilateral teleoperation controller is designed that enables the robot to follow the operator&#39;s command and simultaneously self-regulate its manipulability to perform the task adaptively. Meanwhile, the operator can receive force feedback relating to the manipulability regulation. Evaluations using comparative studies and practical experiments with a 3-degrees of freedom (DoF) haptic device and 7-DoF robots are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

This article extends the FTSVM model to uncertain objects with probability distributions and proposes a distribution-input FTSVM (DFTSVM) model. Unlike the classical FTSVM, the DFTSVM model adopts an insensitive pinball loss function that can suppress feature noise. It also defines a fuzzy membership function of uncertain objects in terms of the Wasserstein distance and k -nearest neighbors. We use properties of Gaussian distributions to transform the original DFTSVM into a tractable model. When covariance matrices of uncertain objects are positive definite, two optimization problems in DFTSVM are smooth and convex, and the quasi-Newton algorithm is employed to solve the DFTSVM model. We also analyze the DFTSVM model to demonstrate its noise insensitivity and weighted scatter minimization. The fuzzy decision rule we define is independent of Gaussian assumptions, and a kernel version of DFTSVM via a reduced-set strategy is achieved. In the experimental part, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DFTSVM when handling uncertain objects. Moreover, we illustrate how the DFTSVM model is modified to deal with large-scale datasets by constructing probability density functions of samples and how to model deep features as distribution inputs for image datasets.},

  abstract     = {The stability and stabilization problems for T–S fuzzy systems with a periodic variable delay are analyzed in this article. First, an improved delay-dependent reciprocally convex inequality is presented to deal with the periodic variable delay, which contains some existing results. Second, according to the monotonicity of the delay interval, the interval of each period is divided into a monotonically increasing interval and a monotonically decreasing interval, and different looped functionals are constructed on the two intervals. A new monotone delay-interval-based functional is presented to introduce more delay information and system state information on the basis of augmented functional and looped functional methods. Then, a generalized memory controller is designed to assure robust stabilization of the system by considering the variable delay and its bounds, which is more general than conventional controllers. Finally, some examples are shown to elaborate on the feasibility and validity of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Fractional-order nonlinear systems have been widely studied, and their optimal control problems have been difficult to be solved. In this article, an event-triggered fuzzy reinforcement learning method is proposed to achieve the optimal control of fractional-order nonlinear systems. First, the fractional Hamiltonian–Jacobi–Bellman equation is derived by constructing an equivalent integer-order auxiliary system and the fractional optimal solution under a global performance index is derived. Then, two fuzzy logic systems are used to form an actor–critic structure to approximate the cost function and the optimal controller, respectively. By constructing the Lyapunov function of the optimal fuzzy weight error, the fractional weight learning laws are designed to ensure that the fuzzy weights converge to the optimum. With this approach, it is not necessary to train the fuzzy weights by gradient descent, and the persistent excitation condition is relaxed. Considering reducing the computational burden, an event-triggered mechanism is used to avoid Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by stability analysis and simulation.},

  abstract     = {The explainability of reinforcement learning (RL) models has received vast amount of interest as its applications have widened. Most existing explainable RL models focus on improving the explainability of an agent&#39;s observations instead of the relationships between agent states and actions. This study presents a fuzzy centered explainable network (FCEN) for RL tasks to interpret the relationships between agent states and actions. The proposed FCEN leverages the interpretability of fuzzy neural networks to establish if–then rules and a generative model to visualize learned knowledge. Precisely, the FCEN includes if–then rules that formulate state-action mappings with human-understandable logic, such as the form “IF Input is A THEN Output is B.” In addition, these rules connect with a generative model that concretizes the states into human-understandable patterns (figures). Our experimental results obtained on 4 Atari games show that the proposed FCEN can achieve a high level of performance in RL tasks and enormously boost the explainability of RL agents both globally and locally. In other words, the FCEN maintains a high-level explanation for the agent decision logic and the possibility of low-level analysis for each given observation sample. The explainability boost does not undermine reward learning performance, humans can even enhance the agent&#39;s performance with the provided explainability.},

However, the acquisition of clustering results follows the relaxed-discrete procedure, which might lead to serious information loss. Given that, local-global fuzzy clustering with anchor graph is proposed in this article, which jointly completes subspace learning and clustering. With the construction of anchor graph, we first impose the fuzzy constraint on the indicator matrix, which is beneficial for revealing the ambiguity and uncertainty in clustering tasks. Thereafter, we introduce the graph divergence regularization term for maximizing the variance of fuzzy indicator matrix, which not only avoids the trivial solutions in local graph learning, but also enhances the separability of data for explicit global structure. In this way, the local graph loss and global divergence regularization term are able to jointly capture the critical clustering structure. Finally, we can obtain the clustering results in accordance with the optimal fuzzy indicator matrix, which is updated alternately by the presented coordinate descent method in optimization process. Therefore, the desirable discrete labels come out automatically under the fuzzy strategy without extra discretization operations, which conforms to reality. The effectiveness of our method will be demonstrated through comprehensive experimental results.},

However, with the consideration of the switching signal, the constraints of positivity and the existence of the time delay make the control of this special system much more complicated. In this article, a novel exponential stability analysis that can tighten the bounds of switching dwell time is proposed under the switched positive polynomial fuzzy control scheme. First, the polynomial fuzzy model represents the dynamic characteristics of nonlinear switched positive systems with a time delay, which can sufficiently promote the approximation capability, thereby simplifying the model structure. Second, the switched polynomial state fuzzy controller is designed based on the principle of the premise variable mismatching to enhance the design flexibility, and matrix decomposition is proposed to overcome the obstacle caused by the nonconvexity conditions both in positive and stable conditions. In addition, as the existing switching control theory is relatively conservative, which leads to a high bound of dwell time, a switched fuzzy copositive Lyapunov–Krasovskii function with the upper bound of the derivative of the membership function and a Taylor expansion technique are together incorporated in a positive switched stability analysis to obtain tight bound of dwell time and relax conditions. At last, two simulation examples are provided to validate the proposed methods.},

Considering that the embedded membership functions of the interval type-2 fuzzy system are unknown, the definite part and the uncertain part of the interval type-2 T–S fuzzy system are separated to facilitate the subsequent analysis. Next, a novel disturbance observer design structure under the fuzzy framework is introduced. Through the novel design method, the expression of the unknown disturbance can be transformed into a new form containing only the uncertain parameter, and the estimation is realized by estimating the uncertain parameter. Then, a fuzzy integral sliding mode controller is adopted in combination with the disturbance estimation to ensure the stability of the composite system and the reachability of the specified fuzzy integral switching surface. Finally, simulation results of the front steering vehicle model that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are provided.},

To cope with this problem, this article proposes a robust modeling method based on frequency reconstructed fuzzy neural network (FRFNN) for industrial process. The robust modeling consists of two parts: One is feature extraction, where a Fourier-based filter is developed with input data denoising. It enables the model to suppress high-frequency input noises and burst outliers. The other one is feature representation that is realized with a FRFNN. The soft margins of membership functions of FRFNN are designed with Fourier estimation of outliers, which have the capability of outlier-tolerant for filtered-residual outliers. Moreover, an adaptive gradient descent algorithm is introduced to update the model parameters. Based on the adaptive learning rate decaying with outliers, this algorithm is insensitive to the bias effect of outliers and also maintains convergence. Finally, the proposed robust modeling method is tested on two real-world industrial datasets with input outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust modeling method can strengthen robustness and achieve superior performance over other previous methods.},

  abstract     = {This article studies an event-triggered tunnel prescribed control (TPC) for uncertain nonlinear systems under any initial condition. A more general entry capture problem (ECP) is introduced, where the tunnel prescribed performance is satisfied after a certain period of system operation, as opposed to starting from the beginning, thereby, making the control design complex yet challenging. In this case, the normally employed prescribed performance control becomes invalid due to the singularity problem arising from the initial condition violation. An error self-tuning function is proposed to provide a unified approach for handling different initial conditions, which can be extended to other methods. In order to deal with unknown control directions, an orientation function is employed in lieu of Nussbaum-type function, by which the initial control input is always equal to zero avoiding a large initial value. We then develop an event-triggered mechanism from an encoding–decoding viewpoint, by which only 1-bit string, either 1 or 0, is required for each communication between control and actuator. In this way, such event-triggered mechanism can further reduce communication burden and improve communication security at the same time. The developed event-triggered TPC provides an effective solution for the underlying ECP and exhibits low-complexity level since no additional filters or time derivatives of virtual control inputs are required in the control design. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to illustrate the abovementioned theoretical finding.},

  abstract     = {Environmental collision is a challenging issue in human–robot collaboration. This article proposes a novel fuzzy cluster-based framework for robots to have reactive responses to various environmental collision scenarios. This framework makes four contributions: First, a fuzzy cluster-based environmental collision detection algorithm is developed to efficiently classify the collision area and noncollision (free) area of the environment. Second, based on the collision detection algorithm, a $p$ -norm approximation-based collision avoidance algorithm is proposed to enable robots to avoid environmental collisions with guaranteed stability. Third, by extending the collision avoidance algorithm, an environmental collision adaptation algorithm is proposed to allow robots to adapt to environmental collisions with intelligently regulated contact force. Fourth, a teleoperation controller is designed to strengthen haptic force rendering and enhance the operator&#39;s perception of collisions. Going beyond existing methods, the proposed framework allows teleoperated robots to have real-time responses to collisions in quasi-static environments without suffering from local optima, where the environments can be unstructured, nonconvex, and detected with noisy outliers. In addition, this framework is simple in implementation because the proposed collision avoidance and collision adaptation algorithms work as several linear quadratic programming constraints that can be flexibly used by inverse kinematics solvers. Several experiments using 7-degree-of-freedom robots are conducted to test and compare the proposed framework with existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the optimal control problem for semicar active suspension systems (SCASSs). First, we model the SCASSs by Newtonian dynamics as well as considering the uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of the actuator. Second, in order to solve the complexity brought by uncertainties, we apply the Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy approach to transform the SCASSs as multilinear systems, as well as solving the optimal control problem as a zero-sum problem to find the solution of Nash-equilibrium. Third, we construct a novel self-learning method based on the reinforcement learning framework, and propose two algorithms to solve the fuzzy game algebraic Riccati equation. Especially, in the second algorithm, without using any model information of the SCASSs, we only use the state and input information in control design by a self-learning manner removing the traditional dependence problem, which is more preferable for practical applications. Finally, we give a simulation result of the SCASSs to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability for the designed self-learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the distributed fuzzy tracking control problem is investigated for high-order fuzzy nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) under denial-of-service attacks. The proposed method is distinct from existing approaches in that it can accommodate scenarios where the model parameters of the reference systems are unknown, and the MAS is high order and nonlinear. Specifically, a data-driven algorithm is first introduced to learn the unknown reference system matrix. Based on the learned matrix, a distributed resilient observer and an improved observer are, respectively, designed to guarantee that both observers can observe the reference system state and that the high-order derivative of the improved observer state exists. By using the improved observer state and its high-order derivatives, a decentralized adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for each agent based on the backstepping technique. It is shown that the distributed resilient tracking can be achieved by the proposed method. Finally, a simulation example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Automatic analysis of epileptic encephalography signals with intelligent models can greatly reduce the workload of doctors. However, the lack of data, insufficient labels, and inconsistent data distribution in real-world scenarios significantly affect the performance of intelligent models. Transfer learning plays an important role in solving the above problems but some challenges remain. First, while various feature extraction methods are available to extract features from the original epilepsy signal, it is difficult to determine which features are effective. Second, transfer learning may lead to domain information loss since the original feature representation from different domains is changed. Third, most of the existing models lack transparency to provide medical practitioners confidence of use. To this end, this article proposes the novel method Multiview Information Preservation Transfer Representation Learning based on Fuzzy Systems (MIP-TRL-FS) to address the issues. First, MIP-TRL-FS utilizes multiple views to get rid of the feature selection process. Second, information preservation techniques are utilized to maintain the data information from the aspects of sample level and feature level, thus minimizing information loss during the transfer learning process. Third, by using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems as the base model, the output of the proposed method can be interpreted linguistically with IF-THEN rules to makes the model transparent. Extensive experiments were conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By constructing the corresponding Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and variable separation method, the complex nonlinear functions with time-varying delays and highly nonlinearity can be handled. With the help of the fuzzy logic systems and adaptive compensation technique, the processing difficulty of the unknown nonlinear terms and the parameters of actuator faults is reduced. Simultaneously, the proposed control scheme can greatly decrease the waste of communication resources by a switching event-triggered mechanism. Then, all signals in the system are ensured to be bounded under Lyapunov stability theorem. Ultimately, the simulation example demonstrates the availability of the developed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Granular computing (GrC) is an efficient way to reveal descriptions of data in line with human cognition and plays a critical role in knowledge discovery. Information granules (IGs), the basic computing unit of GrC, is the key component of knowledge representation and processing. Rough sets are one of the classical GrC models and generate IGs based on indiscernibility relations. The relations can effectively achieve the granulation of nominal attributes and generate desirable IGs, but they may cause information loss when achieving the granulation of numerical attributes. To overcome this issue, fuzzy rough sets (FRS) and neighborhood rough sets (NRS) were developed based on the rough sets. However, to generate high-performance IGs in practice, the FRS model requires prior knowledge to determine a fuzzy operation in advance, and NRS needs to calculate an optimal neighborhood radius. In addition, regardless of FRS or NRS, each object is taken as a computing unit to generate IGs that constitute a covering rather than a partition for the universe. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to generate redundant IGs. Therefore, in this study, a data-driven interval granulation approach based on the uncertainty principle is proposed to generate justifiable interval neighborhood IGs with flexibility and tolerance. First, the interval granulation of attribute values and interval equivalence relation are defined. Next, with the interval equivalence relation, a novel interval rough sets model is developed to unify numerical and nominal attributes into one framework, and a membership function is developed without requiring prior knowledge in advance. Then, a highly effective classifier named CAR-ING integrating attribute reduction technique is developed from the perspective of interval neighborhood IGs. Finally, experiments and comparisons on 17 widely used UCI benchmark datasets and 3 real Biobank medical datasets from the U.K. demonstrated that CAR-ING performs significantly better than four state-of-the-art classifiers based on GrC and five classical classifiers in machine learning. Additionally, the efficiency of CAR-ING is demonstrated on 20 datasets.},

  abstract     = {This article unifies the stability criteria of asymptotic, exponential, and finite-time control within a single framework for fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) with infinite time delays. First, the boundedness and differentiability for time delays are removed. Then, Lipschitz condition for activation function is relaxed, which is allowed to have jumping discontinuous points. To stabilize FNNs, the analytical method is established by comparison principle, contradiction method and inequality techniques. Moreover, different from the traditional Lyapunov method and finite-time stability theorem, several sufficient conditions are deduced and the suppression functions are designed to guarantee asymptotic, exponential, and finite-time stabilization for FNNs by adjusting the parameters of the same controller. There is not necessary to construct the complex integral-type Lyapunov functional to deal with infinite time delays and to design power function in controller for finite-time stabilization. In addition, the designed event-triggered mechanism has the inherent advantages of saving communication resources and indirectly eliminates the chattering caused by signum function. Finally, simulations are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.},
