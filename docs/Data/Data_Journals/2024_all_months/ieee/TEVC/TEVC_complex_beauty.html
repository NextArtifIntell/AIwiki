  abstract     = {SAEA, mainly including regression-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) and classification-based SAEAs, are promising for solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs). Regression-based SAEAs usually use complex regression models to approximate the fitness evaluation, which will suffer from high-training costs to obtain a fine-accuracy surrogate. In contrast, classification-based SAEAs can achieve solution selection via coarse binary relations predicted by classifiers, thus avoiding high requirements in prediction accuracy and training costs. However, most of the binary relations in existing classification-based SAEAs mainly only involve convergence comparison whereas diversity maintenance is neglected. Considering the capacity of the grid technique in maintaining both convergence and diversity, we propose a new classification method called grid classification to discretize the objective space into grids and train a lightweight grid classification-based surrogate (GCS), for which low-training costs are needed. The GCS can evaluate the solution performance in terms of both convergence and diversity simultaneously according to the predicted grid locations, which opens up a new field for follow-up research on classification-based SAEAs. Following this, a GCS-assisted particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for tackling EMOPs. Experimental results on widely used benchmark problems (including high-dimensional EMOPs) and a 222-high-dimensional real-world application problem show its competitiveness in terms of both optimization performance and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multiobjective optimization has shown success in feature selection. However, existing methods often address these tasks independently, disregarding their potential interconnections and shared knowledge. On the other hand, evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has been utilized to address multiple related tasks simultaneously and transfer common knowledge. However, most EMTL-based feature selection methods prioritize a single task, and treat it as the main task and the other tasks as auxiliary or secondary tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multiobjective feature selection method based on EMT in this article. The new method introduces a novel representation that consolidates the solutions of multiple interconnected feature selection tasks into a single solution. It enables these tasks to share a common population, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of transferring common knowledge across them. In addition, a novel searching method is devised to facilitate the evolution of the population across multiple tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer between them. Finally, a transformation method is introduced to transfer valuable genes among the solutions for multiple tasks, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the proposed algorithm when confronted with tasks characterized by distinct features. This method effectively addresses multiple feature selection tasks simultaneously, offering a comprehensive solution to the aforementioned issue. Compared with four single-task multiobjective feature selection methods and a state-of-the-art EMT-based feature selection method, the proposed method demonstrates superior feature selection performance across the majority of benchmark datasets.},

An evolution strategy (ES) algorithm is proposed, which uses a Gaussian distribution to guide the search and requires only the comparisons among solutions. The new method achieves the similar convergence rate as finite-difference-based gradient methods on nonconvex landscapes, while being adaptive in the sense that the convergence is ensured with any initial step-size. We further improve the method with a variance adaptation mechanisms that alleviates the need for hyperparameter tuning and an asynchronous parallelization implementation that enables linear speedup. The persistent monitoring task is chosen as an application to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The task is to schedule a team of agents to minimize the uncertainties of some targets in a changing environment defined on a grid map. We show in the single-agent case that the task can be cast into a sequence of pathfinding subproblems of which the sequential order can be modeled as a Markov decision procedure and solved by the proposed ES method. In the multiagent case, we show that solving the single-agent subproblems using the ES method in a round-robin way can provide collision-free solutions. Numerical studies demonstrate the reduction in convergence time and the robustness against complicated environments relative to several existing evolutionary algorithms and zeroth-order gradient methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective feature selection (MOFS) aims to find a set of feature subsets that achieves a tradeoff between two objectives, i.e., reducing the number of selected features and improving the classification performance. However, these two objectives might not be always conflicting during the optimization process and have varying difficulties in optimization. Such characteristics pose a great challenge to existing multiobjective evolutionary approaches, which often treat two objectives equally. Specifically, a large number of feature subsets with few features may appear in the population and compete for survival opportunities with promising feature subsets located in not fully explored regions, leading to poor performance. To this end, we propose a two-archive evolutionary feature selection algorithm for MOFS. In the proposed method, all individuals are equally allocated into two independent archives. A two-archive-based solution generation strategy is proposed, where a dynamic dimensionality reduction operator is used to exploit small features subsets while a diversity-based mutation operator is utilized to find feature subsets with better-classification performance. Moreover, a novel environmental selection scheme is proposed, which aims to improve the survival probability of promising feature subsets by providing different selection environments. Experimental results on 23 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other five state-of-the-art algorithms.},

For large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs), special efforts must be made to both the surrogate and the evolutionary components to overcome the “curse of dimensionality,” which remains a challenge in this research area. To address this research limitation, we propose a novel cooperative coevolution-based DDEA (CC-DDEA). First, a hierarchical surrogate-joint learning model is designed to provide fitness approximations at both global and subdivided spaces, thus being able to guide the evolutionary population searching at different granularities. Then, optimization is conducted on both the global level and local subspace level in the manner of cooperative coevolution. In the local-level search, we introduce a gradient-based operator to accelerate the convergence efficiency of subspaces, owing to the differentiable property of our surrogate model. Additionally, the entire framework is used in conjunction with a progressive and dynamic space division strategy, enabling local parallel-to-global unified search and facilitating the final convergence. Experiments on up to 1000-D problems and the comparisons with state-of-the-art DDEAs validate the powerfulness of the proposed algorithm.},

First, a mathematical model is constructed to analyze problem characteristics. Subsequently, we introduce a collaborative multiobjective evolutionary algorithm driven by indicators (CMOEA/I). In CMOEA/I, an indicator-driven approach is proposed for solution selection, which approximates the Pareto front based on the convergence indicator, while screening potential solutions based on the spread indicator. Furthermore, a collaborative model and local search are developed by incorporating the intrinsic linkages of factories, groups, and jobs. Additionally, to further explore the potential nondominated solutions, a speed variation strategy is devised based on the pivots of decreasing speed to save energy and increasing speed to reduce makespan. An extensive set of simulation experiments is conducted on a diverse range of test instances. Through meticulous statistical analysis, the outcomes demonstrate that the CMOEA/I exhibits efficacy when contrasted with other advanced algorithms.},

However, most studies in this domain primarily concentrate on devising knowledge transfer mechanisms for specific problem domains, often lacking the examination of the fundamental aspects of knowledge transfer, i.e., what, when, and how to transfer across diverse scenarios. This not only restricts the generality of these algorithms but also hinders their practical applicability. In light of this, this article: 1) reviews a vast array of techniques associated with the crucial aspects of solution transfer and 2) conducts a series of experiments to explore the underlying transfer mechanisms that enhance the evolutionary search. In particular, we first define solution transferability in the context of evolutionary search, which provides a new perspective in understanding what, when, and how to transfer in enhancing evolutionary search. Next, through comprehensive experiments, we find that the approximation and evaluation of solution transferability are of great importance in designing what, when, and how to transfer toward enhanced evolutionary search. Furthermore, our empirical study also discusses the counterintuitive performance improvements unrelated to the search experience of source tasks.

This article proposes a novel ensemble GP (EGP) method that uses a population consisting of both single individuals and ensembles. The main contributions include: 1) developing a GP method that evolves a population comprising both single individuals and ensembles, allowing breeding between them to explore the search space more effectively; 2) proposing an ensemble construction and selection strategy to form ensembles by selecting diverse and complementary individuals; and 3) designing new crossover and mutation operators to produce offspring from single individuals and ensembles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing traditional and EGP methods in most scenarios. Further analyses find that the success is attributed to the enhanced population diversity and extensive search space exploration achieved by the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask optimization employs similarities among tasks via evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with knowledge transfer techniques to address multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. Although existing knowledge transfer techniques achieved success on population-based EAs, they are inappropriate for evolution strategies (ESs) that employ probability distribution sampling. These techniques will face two difficulties when applied to ESs: 1) distribution adaptation errors and 2) convergence difficulties. This article proposes a knowledge-guided external sampling (KGxS) method to provide effective knowledge transfer in multitask ESs (MTESs) for solving multitask optimization problems (MTOPs). KGxS guides the distribution evolution in the target task by transferring solutions from source tasks as external samples. Since these external samples are close to the target distribution, they can handle the difficulty of distribution adaptation errors. In addition, the convergence difficulty caused by negative knowledge transfer is also handled through a mitigation strategy, which adaptively controls the number of external samples. Besides, the external samples carry two kinds of knowledge: 1) domain knowledge which employs the similarity of the optimal domains among tasks and 2) shape knowledge that utilizes the function shapes similarity among tasks. Furthermore, a general boundary constraint handling technique is proposed for ESs to adapt to unconstrained and constrained optimization environments. Empirical results show that KGxS can significantly enhance the positive transfer effect on different types of ES on MTOPs. Moreover, the proposed method obtained superior performance over 20 state-of-the-art algorithms on 38 benchmark problems and three types of real-world applications, including multitask, many-task, and constrained multitask optimization.},

  abstract     = {Many practical optimization problems in the fields of transportation, business, engineering, environmental economics, etc., involve more than one level of decision making and can be modeled as a bilevel optimization problem with a nested structure of decision variables. Existing studies have made remarkable progress on bilevel single-objective problems. However, due to the increased complexities in terms of computation and decision making, few efforts have been devoted to bilevel multiobjective optimization problems (BLMOPs). This article proposes an evolutionary multiform optimization paradigm that explores alternative formulations of the target task to assist in the search with the original formulation, namely, BLMFO, for bilevel multiobjective optimization. First, in the proposed framework, alternative formulations of the original problem are derived to facilitate the problem solving and also alleviate computational overheads. Then, BLMFO performs the evolutionary search in the original problem space and the auxiliary task space simultaneously to combine searching for feasible solutions and exploring regions of promising solutions, thus ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further, useful information is transferred across the original and auxiliary tasks via explicit knowledge transfer to enable complementary exploration for better optimization performance. To the best of our knowledge, this work serves as the first attempt to solve BLMOPs via multiform evolutionary optimization in the literature. The framework is verified using four instantiation groups with different underlying baseline solvers on various benchmarks and practical problems. The experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in terms of performance indicators and the quality of final optimized solutions.},

  abstract     = {A variable reduction strategy (VRS) drives evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to evolve more effectively by simplifying optimization problems. To represent a decision space with the smallest set of variables via VRS, a variable reduction optimization problem (VROP) has been defined, which could be handled by a heuristic rule-based automatic variable reduction algorithm (HR-AVRA). However, HR-AVRA has limitations in identifying an optimal solution and is susceptible of getting trapped in local optimums. To handle these challenges, we propose to solve VROP with exact and metaheuristic algorithms. We construct a linear programming model of VROP for the first time. Then, Gurobi, an exact algorithm optimizer, is employed to seek and identify an optimal solution for it. Subsequently, we design two representative single-point-based and population-based metaheuristic algorithms, simulated annealing-based (SA-AVRA) and ant colony optimization-based (ACO-AVRA) methods, to solve VROP more effectively. These variable reduction algorithms can group variables of a continuous optimization problem into reduced and core variables, with the latter representing both reduced variables and the entire decision space. Extensive experiments verify that Gurobi can provide optimal solutions for small-scale VROPs, while SA/ACO-AVRA enables more reduced variables than other variable reduction methods. We also integrate various variable reduction algorithms with several competitive EAs to tackle equality-constrained optimization problems and nonlinear equations systems. Experiments show that EAs integrated with a variable reduction algorithm outperform both standard EAs and those with several other complexity reduction methods. Furthermore, integrating a variable reduction algorithm that introduces more reduced variables generally can lead to better performance of EAs.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, genetic programming (GP) has achieved impressive results on evolutionary feature construction tasks. To increase search effectiveness, researchers have developed many semantic-based crossover and mutation operators to guide GP searches toward the target semantics. However, semantics has not yet been explored for the hoist mutation operator, which is an operator designed for controlling the bloat effect. Although the hoist mutation operator can significantly reduce model sizes, the most informative subtree may be disrupted by the randomness in mutation. To address this issue, we develop a semantic-based hoist mutation (SHM) operator in this article to preserve the most informative subtree that has the largest cosine similarity between its semantics and the target semantics. Experimental results on 98 regression datasets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmark show that using this operator not only significantly reduces model size but also improves the test accuracy of features constructed by GP. A comparison with seven bloat control methods shows that the proposed operator achieves the best tradeoff between accuracy and model size. Moreover, an experiment on the state-of-the-art symbolic regression benchmark shows that GP with the SHM operator achieves the best test accuracy and competitive model sizes compared with 22 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The automatic design of soft robots characterizes as jointly optimizing structure and control. As reinforcement learning is gradually used to optimize control, the time-consuming controller training makes soft robots design an expensive optimization problem. Although surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have made a remarkable achievement in dealing with expensive optimization problems, they typically suffer from challenges in constructing accurate surrogate models due to the complex mapping among structure, control, and task performance. Therefore, we propose an action inheritance (Act_Inh)-based EA to accelerate the design process. Instead of training a controller, the proposed algorithm uses inherited actions to control a candidate design to complete a task and obtain its approximated performance. Inherited actions are near-optimal control policies that are partially or entirely inherited from optimized control actions of a real evaluated robot design. The Act_Inh plays the role of surrogate models where its input is the structure and output is the near-optimal control actions. We also propose a random perturbation operation to estimate the error introduced by inherited control actions. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated by evaluating it on a wide range of tasks, including locomotion and manipulation. Experimental results show that our algorithm is better than the other three state-of-the-art algorithms on most tasks when only a limited computational budget is available. Compared with the algorithm without surrogate models, our algorithm saves about half the computing cost.},

To address this issue, we propose three different benchmark functions in this article based on NAS-Bench-101. Specifically, we first propose a correlation-based feature extraction method, to capture the accuracy relationship between neural architectures and their fitness values. Furthermore, we propose a function toolkit, which allows combining different architecture features to specific benchmark functions. In addition, three benchmark functions are derived upon the toolkit by considering the features of neural net topologies, the features of neural operations, and their combinations. Based on these designs, the search space partition and transition probability calculation could be easily established, which in turn greatly promote the runtime and convergence analysis. We perform the experiments of ranking correlation, and the experimental results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed benchmark functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on ENAS benchmark functions.},

  abstract     = {Air traffic flow management (ATFM) is the key driver of efficient aviation. It aims at balancing traffic demand against airspace capacity by scheduling aircraft, which is critical for air navigation service providers in delivering secure and sustainable air transport. Nowadays, the scale of scheduled aircraft grows dramatically along with the sharp increase in air traffic demand, which brings heavy pressure to efficient scheduling. Regarding safety and efficiency as two fundamental objectives of air transport, this article proposes a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm to solve large-scale multiobjective ATFM problems. First, a new multiobjective co-evolution framework with an evolving external archive is devised, in which the subcomponents collaborate with each other via the knee solution of the archive. Second, a novel fuzzy decomposition method is specifically designed to split the large-scale ATFM problem into small-size subcomponents by utilizing the spatiotemporal correlations of aircraft. During optimization, the proposed algorithm can continuously receive feedback from the optimization process and make the decomposition more likely better suited to the problem. Third, a new contribution-based probabilistic resource allocation mechanism is developed to automatically assign the computing resources to the unbalanced subcomponents. Finally, a test suite with different scales extracted from real air traffic data is created. Extensive experimental results show that, given the same number of fitness evaluations, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness on all the benchmark instances.},

However, existing decomposition methods are computationally expensive, resulting in limitations under dynamic variable interactions. Quick online decomposition is still a challenging issue, along with solution reconstruction for new subproblems. This article proposes transfer-based particle swarm optimization, which adopts a dynamic differential grouping (DDG) for online decomposition and a solution transfer strategy in response to environmental changes. Particularly, once an environmental change occurs, the DDG readjusts historical groupings based on the change severity of variable interactions. In addition, according to the similarity between subproblems in successive environments, the solution transfer strategy constructs new solutions from historical ones through dimension mapping. Multiple swarms are created to explore subareas of subproblems. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on problem instances up to 1000-D in terms of solution optimality. The DDG obtains accurate groupings using less function evaluations.},

This work reveals that when constraints are introduced in decomposition-based methods, the optima of a subproblem might change during the evolution process. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the population diversity in cooperative coevolution. This work proposes a bi-population-enhanced cooperative differential evolution to address this issue. In the proposed method, the population of a subproblem is divided into two subpopulations (local and global) according to a specific strategy. The global and local subpopulations evolve independently, using different differential mutation operators to generate offspring separately without interference. The local subpopulation aims to track and improve the previous optima, while the global subpopulation attempts to find and locate the potential emerging optima. The proposed algorithm is tested on 12 constrained large-scale benchmarks and the experiments show that it can provide highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed bi-population strategy is more effective at the lower dimensionality of the subproblem.},

This article first demonstrates that ML intervention can also help enhance the diversity capability of RV-EMâOAs through mapping of intragenerational solutions across the RVs. Subsequently, the UIP operator integrates the convergence and diversity enhancement capabilities in a manner that is generic—applicable to different RV-EMâOAs, and practicable—not requiring any extra solution evaluations over the base RV-EMâOAs. Based on 24 056 experimental runs on multi- and many-objective problems, the UIP operator, when integrated with different RV-EMâOAs, has provided statistically better performance in about 36% instances, and better or equivalent in about 92% instances, compared to the respective base RV-EMâOAs.},

However, existing approaches are difficult to be applied to large binary classification tasks due to the huge computational cost in fitness evaluations. To address this issue, we introduce a highly efficient method that enables fitness evaluations to be entirely conducted on graphics processing units (GPUs). Specifically, a prefix notation is used as program representation on the GPU device side, and column-major storage is used for the training dataset on the device side to achieve coalesced global memory access on the GPU. The evaluation of multiple GP programs in each generation can be simultaneous, which increases the parallelism of the algorithm. In addition, a parallel reduction is performed to maximize the use of the powerful parallel computing capability of GPU devices. Furthermore, the hoist mutation is also added to the proposed approach to help eliminate stack overflow on the device side. We compare training time and classification accuracy on various datasets with several GP and non-GP approaches. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly speeds up the existing GP-based binary image classification approaches without degradation in classification accuracy. We also analyze the influence of the batch size on the training time and investigate the classification accuracy in different settings of the max program depth and the number of generations.

  abstract     = {Jointly optimizing both the body and brain of a robot is known to be a challenging task, especially when attempting to evolve designs in simulation that will subsequently be built in the real world. To address this, it is increasingly common to combine evolution with a learning algorithm that can either improve the inherited controllers of new offspring to fine tune them to the new body design or learn them from scratch. In this article an approach is proposed in which a robot is specified indirectly by two compositional pattern producing networks (CPPNs) encoded in a single genome, one which encodes the brain and the other the body. The body part of the genome is evolved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA), with an individual learning algorithm (also an EA) applied to the inherited controller to improve it. The goal of this article is to determine how to utilize the results of learning process most effectively to improve task performance of the robot. Specifically, three variants are investigated: 1) evolution of the body+controller only; 2) a learning algorithm is applied to the inherited controller with the learned fitness assigned to the genome; and 3) learning is applied and the genome is updated with the learned controller, as well as being assigned the learned fitness. Experiments are performed in three different scenarios chosen to favor different bodies and locomotion patterns. It is shown that better performance can be obtained using learning but only if the learned controller is inherited by the offspring.},

Most existing multitask GP methods are designed based on tree-based structures, which are not good at reusing building blocks since each subtree passes its outputs to only one parent. It may limit the design and performance of knowledge sharing in multitask optimization. Different from tree-based GP, building blocks in linear GP (LGP) can be easily reused by more than one parent. Besides, existing multitask GP methods always allocate each individual to a specific task and have to duplicate genetic materials from task to task in knowledge transfer, which is inefficient and often produces redundancy. Contrarily, it is natural for an LGP individual to produce multiple distinct outputs, which enables each LGP individual to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. With this in mind, we propose a new multitask LGP method that transfers knowledge via multioutput individuals (i.e., shared individuals among tasks). By integrating different solutions into one multioutput individual, the proposed method efficiently reuses common knowledge among tasks and maintains distinct behaviors for each task. The empirical results show that the proposed method has a significantly better test performance than state-of-the-art multitask GP methods. Further analyses verify that the new knowledge transfer mechanism can adjust the transfer rate automatically and, thus, improves its effectiveness.},

Since the traditional Pareto-dominance-based algorithms prioritize the convergence of individuals by the Pareto-dominated sorting, it will face a phenomenon that a large number of well-distributed individuals could be dominated by other well-converged individuals during the optimization of MMOPs. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic-niching-based Pareto domination (DNPD), which adds a dynamic niche to constrain the traditional Pareto domination to achieve a balance of convergence and diversity of population in the decision space. In the early stage of the algorithm, the smaller niche makes the algorithm retain a large number of well-distributed individuals. In the later stage of the algorithm, the dynamically increased niche accelerates the convergence of the population. DNPD can be integrated into the Pareto-dominance-based algorithms to solve MMOPs. Experimental results show that the DNPD performs well on MMF and IDMP series benchmark functions after comparing the original algorithm with the original algorithm combined with the DNPD.},

  abstract     = {Virtual sample generation (VSG) is an important technology for dealing with small sample learning in some industries. Using evolutionary computation algorithms to solve VSG is a promising way. However, two issues remain unaddressed in the existing VSG approaches: 1) estimating the distribution of original samples and 2) ensuring the authenticity of virtual samples. Thus, this article proposes a novel VSG approach based on the genetic algorithm (GA) combing with information gain and acceptance-rejection sampling (ARS), abbreviated as VSG3A2. First, this work develops the ARS-VAD subalgorithm, by integrating the acceptance rejection sampling method into the crossover and mutation operations of GA. The algorithm ensures that the distribution of offspring attribute values is close to the distribution of original samples at attribute level. Second, this work presents the IG-VSS subalgorithm, which is combined with the idea of minimizing absolute information gain, to find the optimal offspring sample as a virtual sample in each loop, ensuring the authenticity of virtual samples at the sample level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces the concept of information gain into VSG. Extensive experiments on four public datasets from various fields fully demonstrate that VSG3A2 is more competitive than six state-of-the-art VSG approaches. The MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics of prediction models, trained on virtual samples generated by the proposed VSG3A2, are reduced at least by 19.78%, 19.56%, and 20.16% on average than that of the best compared VSG approach, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has attracted much attention in the community of evolutionary computation recently. It intends to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization on multiple problems via knowledge learning and transfer across them while the optimization processes progress online. Existing EMT paradigms can be classified as explicit EMT (EEMT) and implicit EMT (IEMT) according to the mechanisms adopted in the knowledge transfer. With additional knowledge learning and transfer modules, the EEMT often brings flexible algorithmic designs and effective knowledge transfer against the IEMT. However, most of the existing EEMT studies are designed for continuous optimization problems. Due to the difficulty of learning problem-specific mappings across combinatorial optimization problems, EEMT for combinatorial optimization is still in the nascent stage. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, with the growing number of tasks in today’s real-world applications and the enlarged number of decision variables in each of the tasks, learning mappings across tasks becomes more challenging. Keeping the above in mind, this article presents a novel EEMT algorithm with centralized learning for solving the large-scale and multiobjective combinatorial optimization in many-task manner, in which knowledge transfer across tasks is conducted based on a centralized learning model, instead of task-specific mappings which are required in existing EEMT studies. To investigate the performance of the proposed centralized learning assisted EEMT, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted on the large-scale and multiobjective knapsack problems. Finally, the efficacy of our proposed method is further validated on a real-world combinatorial optimization application.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble learning methods have been widely used in machine learning in recent years due to their high-predictive performance. With the development of genetic programming-based symbolic regression (GPSR) methods, many papers begin to choose a popular ensemble learning method, random forests (RFs), as the baseline competitor. Instead of considering them as competitors, an alternative idea might be to consider symbolic regression (SR) as an enhancement technique for RF. GPSR methods which fit a smooth function are complementary to the piecewise nature of decision trees (DTs), as the smooth variation is common in regression problems. In this article, we propose to form an ensemble model with SR-based DTs to address this issue. Furthermore, we design a guided mutation operator to speed up the search on high-dimensional problems, a multifidelity evaluation strategy to reduce the computational cost, and an ensemble selection mechanism to improve predictive performance. Finally, experimental results on a regression benchmark with 120 datasets show that the proposed ensemble model outperforms 25 existing SR and ensemble learning methods. Moreover, the proposed method can provide notable insights on an XGBoost hyperparameter performance prediction task, which is an important application area of ensemble learning methods.},

However, as a major component of an MOEA, the offspring generator has been largely overlooked, lacking a principle to design generators. This article addresses this issue by introducing an offspring generation paradigm, called regularity evolution (RE), for MOEAs. RE assumes that a solution consists of two parts: 1) a structure vector and 2) a perturbation vector. The former represents the manifold structure learned from the population, in accordance with the regularity property of multiobjective optimization problems, while the latter represents the noise or uncertainty that can be embedded in the learned manifold structure. With the RE paradigm, we can explain and improve some existing generation operators, e.g., the regularity model-based generators, and furthermore, design new generators by proposing alternative ways to construct structure or perturbation vectors. The systematic studies with comparisons on popular generation operators and newly developed MOEAs indicate that the RE paradigm has significant superiority in offspring generation for multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary feature construction is a key technique in evolutionary machine learning, with the aim of constructing high-level features that enhance performance of a learning algorithm. In real-world applications, engineers typically construct complex features based on a combination of basic features, reusing those features as modules. However, modularity in evolutionary feature construction is still an open research topic. This article tries to fill that gap by proposing a modular and hierarchical multitree genetic programming (GP) algorithm that allows trees to use the output values of other trees, thereby representing expressive features in a compact form. Based on this new representation, we propose a macro parent-repair strategy to reduce redundant and irrelevant features, a macro crossover operator to preserve interactive features, and an adaptive control strategy for crossover and mutation rates to dynamically balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. A comparison with seven bloat control methods on 98 regression datasets shows that the proposed modular representation achieves significantly better results in terms of test performance and smaller model size. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art acrlong SRBench demonstrate that the proposed symbolic regression method outperforms 22 existing symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms, providing empirical evidence for the superiority of the modularized evolutionary feature construction method.},

Despite numerous successful applications, several studies have shown that the NSGA-II is less effective for larger numbers of objectives. In this work, we use mathematical runtime analyses to rigorously demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon. We show that even on the simple $m$ -objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in subexponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently. This is not a problem for two objectives, where any sorting of a pairwise incomparable set of solutions according to one objective is also such a sorting according to the other objective (in the inverse order).},

  abstract     = {Handling energy resource management energy resources management (ERM) in today’s energy systems is complex and challenging due to uncertainties arising from the high penetration of distributed energy resources. Such penetration introduces various uncertain factors, such as renewable energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles, making it difficult for traditional mathematical methods to find effective solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown good performance in solving this problem. Therefore, in this article, an self-adaptive collaborative differential evolution algorithm (SADEA) is proposed to solve the ERM problem under uncertainty. In SADEA, a three-stage adaptive collaboration strategy, includes boundary randomization stage, knowledge-assisted collaboration stage, and range restructuration stage, is used to generate collaborative solutions. The collaborative solutions generated in the above stages will jointly participate in the perturbation of differential evolution (DE) strategies to explore promising solutions. In addition, different DE strategies are selected according to count values and random factors. At the end of the algorithm, boundary control, elite selection and retention are used to ensure the legitimacy and robustness of solutions. The proposed SADEA is compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on a real-world distribution network (DN) located in Salamanca, Spain. The results show that SADEA is superior to its competitors in terms of the objective function (OF), ranking index, and convergence. In summary, the proposed algorithm is effective to handle the ERM problem under uncertainty.},

A simulated IMO-DRSA approach was adopted and extended to offer insights on how to design interactive processes for index tracking considering the stochastic output of EMO. The extended simulated IMO-DRSA approach analyzes how different factors, such as the number of interactions and methods for cognitive effort reduction, affect the capacity of an EMO to produce good portfolios for different types of artificial investors during interactions and to maintain their goodness over time.

This article proposes a simple yet effective transfer learning framework to empower data-driven evolutionary optimization to solve expensive dynamic optimization problems. Specifically, a hierarchical multioutput Gaussian process is proposed to capture the correlation among data collected from different time steps with a linearly increased number of hyperparameters. Furthermore, an adaptive source task selection along with a bespoke warm staring initialization mechanisms are proposed to better leverage the knowledge extracted from previous optimization processes. By doing so, the data-driven evolutionary optimization can jump start the optimization in the new environment with a very limited computational budget.

To evaluate the capability of an algorithm in solving dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems (DCMOPs), artificial test problems play a fundamental role. Nevertheless, some characteristics of real-world scenarios are not fully considered in the previous test suites, such as time-varying size, location, and shape of feasible regions, the controllable change severity, as well as small feasible regions. Therefore, we develop the generators of objective functions and constraints to facilitate the systematic design of DCMOPs, and then a novel test suite consisting of nine benchmarks, termed as DCP, is put forward. To solve these problems, a dynamic constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DCMOEA) with a two-stage diversity compensation strategy (TDCEA) is proposed. Some initial individuals are randomly generated to replace historical ones in the first stage, improving the global diversity. In the second stage, the increment between center points of Pareto sets in the past two environments is calculated and employed to adaptively disturb solutions, forming an initial population with good diversity for the new environment. Intensive experiments show that the proposed test problems enable a good understanding of strengths and weaknesses of algorithms, and TDCEA outperforms other state-of-the-art comparative ones, achieving promising performance in tackling DCMOPs.},

However, most existing GP-based image classification methods often have a complex tree/program structure and a large search space, which may lead to poor performance. To address this, this article develops a two-stage-based GP approach to automatically evolving solutions/ensembles for image classification. In the new approach, the process of constructing an image classification solution is divided into two stages, i.e., evolving small building blocks for feature extraction and evolving ensembles of classifiers by reusing these blocks. Accordingly, at each stage, a simple tree structure can be designed to facilitate the search. In the first stage, a simple block representation and a new search mechanism including a population updating strategy are developed to evolve diverse and effective blocks. In the second stage, a small set of diverse blocks are selected and transformed into primitives, which produces a new tree representation to evolve ensembles of classifiers for image classification. The new designs allow the proposed approach to construct sufficiently but not over complex solutions for difficult tasks by using/searching small trees. The new approach outperforms most GP-based and non-GP-based comparison methods on five image datasets, including CIFAR10, Fashion_MNIST, and SVHN. Deep analysis is conducted to provide more insights into the proposed approach.},

Thus, a subsequent decision-making (DM) step or a curiosity on the part of the optimization researcher may demand solutions at regions not well-represented by the obtained PO front. In this study, we propose to train machine learning (ML) models to capture the mapping between unique identifiers of PO solutions—pseudo-weight vectors, computed from the existing PO front data, and their corresponding decision variable vectors. These learned models can then be used to predict PO decision variables for any new desired pseudo-weight vector. We evaluate the proposed approach with two different ML methods on a variety of multi- and many-objective test and real-world problems. This procedure can also be incorporated into an EMO algorithm to find a better-converged set of PO solutions, attempt to fill apparent gaps, and find more nondominated solutions at preferred regions of the PO front, facilitating a number of key advances for multiobjective optimization and DM tasks.},

  abstract     = {evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) is a new optimization paradigm proposed in the field of evolutionary computation in recent years. EMTO can solve several different optimization tasks simultaneously and facilitate superior convergence characteristics by transferring effective knowledge among the tasks. However, existing EMTO usually focuses only on facilitating convergence characteristics while neglecting the potential privacy leakage problem in the knowledge transfer between different tasks. The privacy leakage could result in considerable financial losses or severe reputation impairment, which may impede the development of EMTO in real-world applications. To solve the problem of privacy leakage in EMTO, this article proposes a privacy-enhanced multitasking particle swarm optimization algorithm. A knowledge transfer strategy with privacy preservation is designed based on homomorphic encryption by combining multitasking particle swarm optimization. In addition, an intertask knowledge transfer mechanism implemented in a low-dimensional subspace is introduced to reduce the extra computational burden caused by privacy preservation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and NAS problems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. According to the experimental results, the proposed method has remarkable advantages in privacy preservation compared to existing EMTO.},

  abstract     = {It is a big challenge to develop efficient models for identifying personalized drug targets (PDTs) from high-dimensional personalized genomic profile of individual patients. Recent structural network control principles have introduced a new approach to discover PDTs by selecting an optimal set of driver genes in a personalized gene interaction network (PGIN). However, most of the current methods only focus on controlling the system through a minimum driver-node set and ignore the existence of multiple candidate driver-node sets for therapeutic drug target identification in PGIN. Therefore, this article proposed multiobjective optimization-based structural network control principles (MONCPs) by considering minimum driver nodes and maximum prior-known drug-target information. To solve MONCP, a discrete multiobjective optimization problem is formulated with many constrained variables, and a novel evolutionary optimization model called large-scale constrained variables-based multitasking cooperative evolutionary algorithm (LSCV-MCEA) was developed by adapting a multitasking framework and a ranking-based fitness function method. With genomics data of patients with breast or lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the effectiveness of LSCV-MCEA was validated. The experimental results indicated that compared with other advanced methods, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively identify PDTs with the highest area under the curve score for predicting clinically annotated combinatorial drugs. Meanwhile, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively solve MONCP than other evolutionary optimization methods in terms of algorithm convergence and diversity. Particularly, LSCV-MCEA can efficiently detect disease signals for individual patients with breast invasive carcinoma cancer. The study results show that multiobjective optimization can solve structural network control principles effectively and offer a new perspective for understanding tumor heterogeneity in cancer precision medicine.},

To address this issue, we propose a Kriging-assisted evolutionary algorithm with two search modes to adaptively reduce the utilization frequency of surrogate models for constraints. To be more specific, an adaptively switching strategy analyzing the correlation between the objective optimization direction and constraint satisfaction direction is designed to determine whether to build the constraint surrogate models to assist the current evolutionary search. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm contains two search modes: 1) unconstrained surrogate-assisted search mode and 2) constrained surrogate-assisted search mode. In the first search mode, an existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm without considering constraint is introduced, which rapidly drives the population to move to the feasible region(s) while avoiding the negative effects of the constraint surrogate models. In the second search mode, a novel Kriging-assisted constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm is designed for locating constrained Pareto front in the feasible region. In addition, a data selection strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency and quality of surrogate models for constraint functions. The proposed method has been tested on numerous instances from three popular benchmark test suites. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

ROOT is dedicated to the study and development of algorithms capable of dealing with the implications of deploying or maintaining solutions over longer time horizons involving multiple environmental changes. This article presents an in-depth review of the research on ROOT. The overarching aim of this survey is to help researchers gain a broad perspective on the current state of the field, what has been achieved so far, and the existing challenges and pitfalls. This survey also aims to improve accessibility and clarity by standardizing terminology and unifying mathematical notions used across the field, providing explicit mathematical formulations of definitions, and improving many existing mathematical descriptions. Moreover, we classify ROOT problems based on two ROOT-specific criteria: 1) the requirements for changing or keeping deployed solutions and 2) the number of deployed solutions. This classification helps researchers gain a better understanding of the characteristics and requirements of ROOT problems, which is crucial to systematic algorithm design and benchmarking. Additionally, we classify ROOT methods based on the approach they use for finding robust solutions and provide a comprehensive review of them. This survey also reviews ROOT benchmarks and performance indicators. Finally, we identify several future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Constrained optimization is an active research topic in evolutionary computation. It challenges the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in allocating fitness evaluations to the minimization of constraint violations and the optimization of objectives. Most existing EAs implement fixed allocation schemes by using nonpriority, priority, or priority-complete comparison criteria. This article argues that different constrained optimization problems (COPs) should be solved by algorithms with a dynamic allocation scheme (DAS), and the key to adjusting the allocation scheme is a judgment on whether the objective optimization or the constraint violation minimization is beneficial to finding the optimum. In this article, correlations between objectives and constraints are measured for judgment. Based on the correlations, the DAS for fitness evaluations is proposed for constrained evolutionary optimization. The objective priority criterion or the objective priority-complete criterion is dynamically selected to allocate more fitness evaluations to the objective optimization if the optimization of objectives is beneficial. Otherwise, the constraint priority criterion or the constraint priority-complete criterion is selected to allocate fitness evaluations. The experimental results show that algorithms with the selected criterion significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of attaining feasible solutions with better objective values. Furthermore, algorithms with the DAS have the advantage of consistently finding feasible solutions with better objective values than algorithms based on nonbeneficial, fixed, and randomly selected schemes. The results demonstrate the positive impact of the correlation-based DAS on EAs for solving COPs.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (JSS) is a prominent combinatorial optimization problem with many real-world applications. Genetic programming (GP) has been widely used to automatically evolve effective scheduling heuristics for dynamic flexible JSS (DFJSS). A limitation of GP is the premature convergence due to the loss of population diversity. To overcome this limitation, this work considers using lexicase selection (LS) to improve population diversity, which has achieved success on regression and program synthesis problems. However, it is not trivial to apply LS to GP for DFJSS, since a fitness case (training scheduling simulation) is often large-scale, making the fitness evaluation very time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a new multicase fitness scheme, which creates multiple cases from a single scheduling simulation. Based on the multicase fitness, we develop a new GP algorithm with LS, which uses a single simulation for fitness evaluation, thus, achieving a better balance between the number of cases for LS and evaluation efficiency. The experiments on a wide range of dynamic scheduling scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better population diversity and final performance than the current GP parent selection methods and a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method.},

Evolutionary clustering has found many successful applications, but all the results are empirical, lacking theoretical support. This article fills this gap by proving that the approximation performance of the global simple evolutionary multiobjective optimizer (GSEMO) (a simple multiobjective EA) for solving four formulations of clustering, i.e., $k$ -tMM, $k$ -center, discrete $k$ -median, and $k$ -means, can be theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we consider clustering under fairness, which tries to avoid algorithmic bias, and has recently been an important research topic in machine learning. We prove that for discrete $k$ -median clustering under individual fairness, the approximation performance of the GSEMO can be theoretically guaranteed with respect to both the objective function and the fairness constraint.},

In this article, introducing conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), we use only one surrogate model to effectively fit such a set valued mapping, which extracts knowledge from lower-level optimal vectors corresponding to the same upper-level vector. Then, a BLMOP is transformed into a single-level constraint multiobjective optimization problem (CMOP). By adaptively allocating computational resources to optimize the CMOP, promising upper-level vectors are obtained. Furthermore, a lower-level search is executed for these promising upper-level vectors, thus obtaining high-quality solutions. Because of the excellent performance of cGAN and the lower-level search conducted only for promising upper-level vectors, the computational overhead is greatly reduced.

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved surpassing success in the field of computer vision, and a number of elaborately designed networks refresh the performance records in benchmark datasets. Recently, evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) has become an emerging area, which could employ an evolutionary computation (EC) technique to automatically construct promising network architectures without human intervention. However, existing algorithms still have limitations: most standard EC approaches cannot process flexible-length architecture representations directly, and most fitness evaluation processes suffer from the exhibitive computational cost and the unreliable prediction results. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based neural architecture search algorithm to search for appropriate dense blocks on image classification tasks, named EAEPSO. EAEPSO addresses the first limitation by designing an autoencoder to encode variable-length network representations as fixed-length latent vectors, which converts the original search space to a latent space that can facilitate the downstream search. Besides, an efficient and effective hierarchical fitness evaluation method is designed to guide the search process to address the second limitation. The experimental results show that EAEPSO is a very competitive ENAS algorithm that achieves an error rate of 2.74% on CIFAR-10 and 16.17% on CIFAR-100, and reduces the computational cost from hundreds or thousands of GPU-days to only 2.2 and 4 GPU-days, respectively. Further analyses investigate the reduced training data’s effect and confirm the effectiveness of both the proposed autoencoder and the proposed hierarchical fitness evaluation method.},

It provides a normative account for the changes in ties within interaction networks in response to the behavior of social partners. While considerable efforts have explored the role of partner selection in fostering cooperation, there remains a limited understanding of how agents learn to establish effective interaction patterns and adapt their connections accordingly. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leverage recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and propose an adaptive interaction mechanism to investigate self-organization behavior in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma game. Within this framework, artificial agents are trained using a self-regarding Roth-Erev algorithm, utilizing reputation as a dynamic signal to update their willingness to engage with neighbors. Additionally, these agents are endowed with the capability to sever inactive connections. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing RL and local information from reputation to capture the dynamics of interactions. Notably, we discover that the entangled coevolution of strategy and interaction network can facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation, despite the optimal tolerance threshold for ineffective neighbors varying depending on the strength of the social dilemma. Furthermore, the emerging network topology presented in this work accurately captures the assortative mixing pattern observed in previous experiments and realistic evidence. Finally, we validate the simulation results through theoretical analysis and confirm the robustness of the proposed mechanism across populations of varying sizes and initial structures.},

Due to the multiple different modalities of each task, a major challenge of solving multiple MMOPs is how to extract and transfer knowledge across modalities of different tasks. To this end, this article designs a distributed knowledge transfer-based evolutionary multitask multimodal optimization (EMTMO-DKT) approach for solving multiple MMOPs simultaneously by discovering and utilizing local knowledge across modalities of different tasks. Specifically, we first divide the population of each task into multiple subpopulations, where each subpopulation explores a modality. Then, we propose an evolution path-based similarity measurement to measure the local similarities between subpopulations of different tasks. Since the modalities can be locally similar across tasks, we develop a subpopulation cross matching strategy according to the obtained similarities to pair subpopulations of different tasks. In this stage, the successfully paired subpopulations are allowed to transfer knowledge. Finally, the knowledge transfer probability self-adjusting strategy is applied to each subpopulation to balance knowledge transfer and self-evolution, so as to improve search efficiency. In this article, a set of multitask multimodal optimization test problems are constructed to assess the efficacy of compared algorithms. Experimental results on both the benchmark functions and the real-world optimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly locate more global optima in comparison with state-of-the-art EMTO and multimodal optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) are widely encountered in real-world applications and have received considerable attention in recent years. During the process of solving DMOPs, tracking the constantly changing Pareto optimal set (POS) quickly is the main task, and numerous methods have been proposed to achieve this task from different perspectives. However, how to improve the evolution of static optimizers via using historical information from past environments gets little attention. In fact, with adequate historical evolution information to learn, the trend of population evolution in the historical environments is promising to guide the future evolution and thus enhance the search ability. Therefore, in this article, a historical evolution learning-based framework is proposed to assist the static optimizers in fully using the historical evolution direction and POSs distribution. Specifically, two new models are designed with a purpose of generating offsprings and environmental selection, respectively. For enhancing the contribution of offsprings, a direction guidance model is developed to guide the offsprings according to the direction tendency of historical evolution. Furthermore, to improve the robustness of static optimizers and avoid the disturbance caused by misleading solutions, a manifold revise model is proposed to produce promising solutions via consulting historical POSs distribution. The proposed framework employs these two models collaboratively, and it is flexible and readily to be embedded into various dynamic response mechanisms and static optimizers in coping with DMOPs. The superiority of the framework has been comprehensively demonstrated by experimental comparison results on a variety of benchmark test problems.},

However, the performance of SAEAs heavily relies on the surrogate model and infill criterion used. To improve the generalization of SAEAs and enable them to solve a wide range of EOPs, this article proposes an SAEA called AutoSAEA, which features model and infill criterion auto-configuration. Specifically, AutoSAEA formulates model and infill criterion selection as a two-level multiarmed bandit problem (TL-MAB). The first and second levels cooperate in selecting the surrogate model and infill criterion, respectively. A two-level reward (TL-R) measures the value of the surrogate model and infill criterion, while a two-level upper confidence bound (TL-UCB) selects the model and infill criterion in an online manner. Numerous experiments validate the superiority of AutoSAEA over some state-of-the-art SAEAs on complex benchmark problems and a real-world oil reservoir production optimization problem.},

However, most existing prediction methods are manually designed learning models. These methods consider only macroscopic data while ignoring mesoscopic data that also have a significant impact on product quality. Thus, they are often poor at accuracy and generalization performance in practice. To address this issue, a multiobjective convolutional neural networks ensemble learning method with multiscale data fusion (MOCNNEL-MSDF) is developed. Using data fusion of macro/meso data derived from kinetic models, MOCNNEL-MSDF first evolves a swarm of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by knowledge-transferring-based reproduction and adaptive weights initialization adjustment to improve learning performance, and then a sparse ensemble approach based on differential evolution is applied to achieve the final prediction model from the evolved CNNs. Experimental results on both benchmark data and practical data of continuous annealing show that MOCNNEL-MSDF achieves competitive or better accuracy and robustness compared with other powerful learning methods, and outperforms the existing strip quality prediction models. The proposed method can be used in the product quality modeling of each process in the iron and steel industry, where it is desirable to combine mechanism models with production process data to construct a product quality prediction model with higher accuracy and generalization.},

Furthermore, the EGNA baseline learns a GBN at each iteration based on the best individuals in the last iteration, which may lead to local optimum convergence or large variance between solutions across multiple independent runs of the algorithm. In this work, we propose a semiparametric EDA in which the restriction of assuming Gaussianity in the variables is relaxed using semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs), in which nodes estimated by kernels coexist with nodes that assume Gaussianity, and the algorithm itself is able to determine where to use each type of node. Additionally, our approach takes into account information from several past iterations to learn the SPBN from which the new solutions are sampled in each iteration.

Its appropriate specification depends on problem characteristics, such as the Pareto front shape and the number of objectives. In this article, the difficulty of the reference point specification in hypervolume-based EMO algorithms is circumvented by using two reference points. Instead of using only a single reference point, we propose a new hypervolume-based EMO algorithm that can effectively utilize two reference points cooperatively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good and robust performance on a wide range of test problems. In comparison to hypervolume-based EMO algorithms with only a single reference point, the proposed algorithm can find a wider and more uniformly distributed solution set.

  abstract     = {In some real-world applications, the optimization problems may involve multiple design stages. At each design stage, the objective is incrementally modified by incorporating more decision variables and optimized. In addition, the fitness evaluations (FEs) are often highly costly. Such optimization problems can be called expensive incremental optimization problems (EIOPs). Despite their importance, EIOPs have not attracted much attention over the past few years. Since the objectives of different design stages are different but related, reusing the search experience from the past design stages is beneficial to the evolutionary search of the current design stage. Therefore, a surrogate-assisted differential evolution with knowledge transfer (SADE-KT) is proposed in this work, which aims to fill the current gap in solving EIOPs. The major merit of the proposed SADE-KT is its ability to seamlessly integrate knowledge transfer and the surrogate-assisted evolutionary search. In SADE-KT, a surrogate-based hybrid knowledge transfer strategy is first proposed. This strategy makes it possible to reuse the knowledge captured from the past design stages by leveraging different knowledge transfer techniques. As a result, the convergence for the current design stage can be speeded up. Then, a two-level surrogate-assisted evolutionary search is developed to search for the optimum. Comprehensive empirical studies have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm works efficiently on EIOPs.},

To solve these problems, this article proposes a multiform optimization framework to solve a multiobjective feature selection task together with several auxiliary single-objective feature selection tasks in a multitask environment. The proposed framework uses the problem-solving experience of single-objective tasks to assist the multiobjective feature selection task in exploring more promising regions and accelerating the convergence speed. Specifically, a knowledge transfer strategy based on the search experience of different tasks is developed to accomplish multiform optimization. In addition, a diversity enhancement mechanism is presented to improve search ability in promising decision space areas by considering historical information about the population.

Therefore, this study proposed a surrogate and autoencoder-assisted multitask particle swarm optimization algorithm. First, an autoencoder-embedded multitask evolutionary framework was established to transform a high-dimensional MMOP into multiple low-dimensional subproblems or subtasks. Further, a multilevel surrogate model management mechanism combining mirror learning was proposed. An appropriate local surrogate model can be rapidly generated for each modality of the problem. Moreover, a dual-mode local exploitation strategy was developed to improve the capability of swarm to exploit each subtask. The proposed algorithm was compared with seven existing SAEAs on 33 benchmark functions and the aeroengine aerodynamic design optimization problem. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm can obtain multiple highly competitive optimal solutions, including global optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Air traffic flow management (ATFM) plays a crucial role in efficient aviation. Most existing studies assume the flight speed as constant throughout the trip, leading to ineffective fixed-speed schedules. To address this issue, we propose a new problem model, which allows variable speed control to improve the flexibility and maneuverability of the management. In addition, we consider two conflicting objectives, which are minimizing the total flight delays and conflicts between flights, where the conflicts depend on the flight 4-D trajectories (3-D position plus time). To solve this new challenging problem, we propose a novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with new problem-specific individual representation and search operators. Specifically, the multichromosomes encoding scheme is designed to adapt to different types of operations. Then, to search the huge search space effectively, we develop a hybrid crossover operator that recombines the parents based on their flight routes. Furthermore, to balance the exploration and exploitation, we develop a new mutation strategy to utilize the heterogeneous search potential of different individuals. For exploitation, the knee individual in the Pareto front is improved by a new time shift operator for exploitation, and other nondominated solutions are mutated by fixed-route mutation. For exploration, the dominated solutions are mutated randomly. To verify the effectiveness, we compare it with the real ATFM schedules and the state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of real-world air traffic datasets. Extensive results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly outperform the baselines in generating safe and efficient 4-D trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful surrogate-assisted algorithm for solving expensive black-box optimization problems. While BO was developed for centralized optimization, the availability of massive distributed data has attracted increased interests in exploring federated BO (FBO) that can use data on multiple clients without leaking the raw data. However, existing FBO approaches assume that either all clients jointly solve the same optimization task, or only one client solves one target optimization task by transferring knowledge from others in a federated way, making them unsuited for many real-world applications. In this article, we consider FBO for the scenario where multiple related local black-box tasks associated with different clients are jointly optimized by sharing knowledge between tasks without leaking the data privacy. An efficient federated many-task BO framework is proposed to address not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data while protecting the data privacy in the federated setting. A novel federated knowledge transfer paradigm is developed for dynamic many-task model aggregation according to a dissimilarity matrix. The dissimilarity is measured based on the rank of the predictions and only the hyperparameters in the local Gaussian process models are shared. In addition, a federated ensemble acquisition function is constructed by integrating the predictions of two surrogates using the global and local hyperparameters, respectively, to effectively search for the optimal solution. Experimental results show that our proposed method has reliable performance on both benchmark problems and a real machine-learning problem also in the presence of non-IID data.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization has received extensive attention and research in the past two decades, and a lot of benchmarks have been proposed to test the effect of the constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). Especially, the constraint functions are highly correlated with the objective values, which makes the features of constraints too monotonic and differ from the properties of the real-world problems. Accordingly, previous CMOEAs cannot solve real-world problems well, which generally involve decision space constraints with multimodal/nonlinear features. Therefore, we propose a new benchmark framework and design a suite of new test functions with scalable high-dimensional decision space constraints. To be specific, different high-dimensional constraint functions and mixed linkages in variables are considered to be close to realistic features. In this framework, several parameter interfaces are provided, so that users can easily adjust the parameters to obtain the variant functions and test the generalization performance of the algorithms. Different types of existing CMOEAs are employed to test the use of the proposed test functions, and the results show that they are easy to fall into local feasible regions. Therefore, we improve one evolutionary multitasking-based CMOEA to better handle these problems, in which a new search algorithm is designed to enhance the search abilities of populations. Compared with the existing CMOEAs, the proposed CMOEA presents better performance.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression (SR) algorithms attempt to learn analytic expressions which fit data accurately and in a highly interpretable manner. Conventional SR suffers from two fundamental issues which we address here. First, these methods search the space stochastically (typically using genetic programming) and hence do not necessarily find the best function. Second, the criteria used to select the equation optimally balancing accuracy with simplicity have been variable and subjective. To address these issues we introduce exhaustive SR (ESR), which systematically and efficiently considers all possible equations—made with a given basis set of operators and up to a specified maximum complexity—and is therefore guaranteed to find the true optimum (if parameters are perfectly optimized) and a complete function ranking subject to these constraints. We implement the minimum description length principle as a rigorous method for combining these preferences into a single objective. To illustrate the power of ESR we apply it to a catalog of cosmic chronometers and the Pantheon+ sample of supernovae to learn the Hubble rate as a function of redshift, finding ~40 functions (out of 5.2 million trial functions) that fit the data more economically than the Friedmann equation. These low-redshift data therefore do not uniquely prefer the expansion history of the standard model of cosmology. We make our code and full equation sets publicly available.},

  abstract     = {In high-dimensional environment, the interaction among particles significantly affects their movements in searching the vast solution space and thus plays a vital role in assisting particle swarm optimization (PSO) to attain good performance. To this end, this article designs a random contrastive interaction (RCI) strategy for PSO, resulting in RCI-PSO, to tackle large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) effectively and efficiently. Unlike existing interaction mechanisms for low-dimensional problems, RCI randomly chooses several different peers from the current swarm to construct a random interaction topology for each particle. Then, it lets the particle interact with the selected peers based on their current evolutionary information instead of their historical evolutionary information. Within the topology, RCI only propagates the evolutionary information of two contrastive dominators with the largest difference in fitness to direct the evolution of the particle. Therefore, particles with no more than two dominators in their topologies are not updated. Furthermore, a dynamic topology size adjustment scheme is devised to gradually enlarge the interaction topology. In this way, the swarm gradually switches from exploring the immense search space dispersedly to exploiting the found optimal regions intensively as the evolution continues. With these two strategies, RCI-PSO expectedly compromises search diversity and search convergence well at the swarm level and the particle level. Finally, extensive experiments executed on two public LSOP suites verify that RCI-PSO performs competitively with or even much better than totally 40 state-of-the-art large-scale approaches and preserves a good capability and scalability in tackling complex LSOPs.},

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully used to evolve routing policies that can make real-time routing decisions for uncertain arc routing problems. Although the evolved routing policies are highly effective, they are typically very large and complex, and hard to be understood and trusted by real users. Existing studies have attempted to improve the interpretability by developing new GP approaches to evolve both effective and interpretable (e.g., with smaller program size) routing policies. However, they still have limitations due to the tradeoff between effectiveness and interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a new post-hoc explanation approach to explaining the effective but complex routing policies evolved by GP. The new approach includes a local ranking explanation and a global explanation module. The local ranking explanation uses particle swarm optimization to learn an interpretable linear model that accurately explains the local behavior of the routing policy for each decision situation. Then, the global explanation module uses a clustering technique to summarize the local explanations into a global explanation. The experimental results and case studies on the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can obtain accurate and understandable explanations of the routing policies evolved for uncertain arc routing problems. Our explanation approach is not restricted to uncertain arc routing, but has a great potential to be generalized to other optimization and machine learning problems, such as learning classifier systems and reinforcement learning.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evolutionary multiobjective method to evolve local explanations. The proposed method is model agnostic, i.e., it is applicable to explain any deep convolutional neural networks. ImageNet is used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three well-known deep convolutional neural networks—VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet, are chosen to demonstrate the model-agnostic characteristic. Based on the experimental results, it can be observed that the local explanations are understandable to end users, who need to check the sensibility of the evolved explanations to decide whether to trust the predictions made by the deep convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, the local explanations evolved by the proposed method improves the confidence of deep convolutional neural networks making the predictions. Finally, the pareto front and convergence analyses indicate that the proposed method can form a good set of nondominated solutions.},

  abstract     = {Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization has proven to yield promising results across a broad set of applications. However, QD approaches struggle in the presence of uncertainty in the environment, as it impacts their ability to quantify the true performance and novelty of solutions. This problem has been highlighted multiple times independently in previous literature. In this work, we propose to uniformise the view on this problem through four main contributions. First, we formalize a common framework for uncertain domains: the Uncertain QD setting, a special case of QD in which fitness and descriptors for each solution are no longer fixed values but distribution over possible values. Second, we propose a new methodology to evaluate Uncertain QD approaches, relying on a new per-generation sampling budget and a set of existing and new metrics specifically designed for Uncertain QD. Third, we propose three new Uncertain QD algorithms: Archive-sampling, Parallel-Adaptive-sampling, and Deep-Grid-sampling. We propose these approaches taking into account recent advances in the QD community toward the use of hardware acceleration that enable large numbers of parallel evaluations and make sampling an affordable approach to uncertainty. Our final and fourth contribution is to use this new framework and the associated comparison methods to benchmark existing and novel approaches. We demonstrate once again the limitation of MAP-Elites in uncertain domains and highlight the performance of the existing Deep-Grid approach, and of our new algorithms. The goal of this framework and methods is to become an instrumental benchmark for future works considering Uncertain QD.},

Deep learning-based KT (DLKT) achieves superb performance in terms of prediction accuracy, but it lacks of explainability, which makes us hard to trust or understand models. The previous work on explaining DLKT was mainly based on gradients or attention scores, which is susceptible to spurious correlations, reducing the credibility of the explanation. To address this limitation, in this article, we propose a causal explanation method based on the genetic algorithm (GA), named genetic causal explainer (GCE), which constructs a causal framework to estimate the attribution of subsequence to the predictions of DLKT models, and a genetic coding system is designed. Further, A multistrategy initialization method inspired by domain prior knowledge is proposed, and a global empirical matrix is introduced to capture the causal correlation knowledge during the search process across instances, and guiding the mutation operators. The GCE as a post hoc explanation method can generate explanation results without affecting model training, and can be applied to analyze different DLKT models. Experimental results demonstrate the GCE perform better than other explanation methods in terms of accuracy and readability in quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, the GCE also shows good application prospects in mining educational laws and comparing KT models.},

Multiobjective feature selection in classification has its unique characteristics, such as it has a strong preference for the classification performance over the number of selected features. Besides, solution duplication often appears in both the search and the objective spaces, which degenerates the diversity and results in the premature convergence of the population. To deal with the above issues, in this article, during the evolutionary training process, a multiobjective feature selection problem is reformulated and solved as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem, which adds a constraint on the classification performance for each solution (e.g., feature subset) according to the distribution of nondominated solutions, with the aim of selecting promising feature subsets that contain more informative and strongly relevant features, which are beneficial to improve the classification performance. Furthermore, based on the distribution of feature subsets in the objective space and their similarity in the search space, a duplication analysis and handling method is proposed to enhance the diversity of the population. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms and is computationally efficient on 18 classification datasets.},

The results show that GSEMO/Ps can find the Pareto front of $COCZ_{TL}$ and the expected runtime is at most $O(n^{3})$ .

Among the existing algorithms for subset selection, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have achieved great performance in obtaining the subsets with high quality. However, as the selected subsets are sparse, i.e., most variables of these solutions are zero, most existing EAs for subset selection problems pose great challenges to find the optimal solutions effectively and efficiently, especially when the size of the original set is large. To this end, we propose the SPESS approach which is a sparsity-preserved EA for subset selection. To be specific, we design two sparsity-preserved operators (i.e., sparsity-preserved crossover operator and sparsity-preserved mutation operator), which can be used in SPESS to ensure the sparsity of the generated solutions in the process of Pareto optimization. The main advantages of the proposed sparsity-preserved operators are that they can obtain high-quality solutions and improve the search efficiency of the algorithm. According to the experimental results on 12 SR problems and 12 UFS problems, the proposed SPESS is superior over the state-of-the-arts in solving subset selection tasks, and the effectiveness of the proposed two sparsity-preserved operators is also verified.},

Building a deep ensemble model is a challenging task, since maintaining the prediction performance of each base-learner and the diversity among base-learners at the same time is difficult. To address this problem, this article proposes a two-stage optimization algorithm for deep ensemble model generation, called ELDE-TS. ELDE-TS aims to build a weighted voting-based deep ensemble model for classification tasks end-to-end. The ensemble model includes several convolutional neural network classifiers with different hyperparameters. Each classifier is assigned a weight. The first stage of ELDE-TS is a biobjective algorithm that generates candidate classifiers for the ensemble model. It takes the validation accuracy and the diversity among classifiers as the optimization objectives. A novel objective function is proposed for the first stage to describe the diversity among the classifiers. The second stage is a single-objective algorithm, which selects representative classifiers for the ensemble model and calculates a weight for each classifier. A tree-based nonrepetitive evaluation mechanism is embedded in the second stage to accelerate the search process. The experimental results show that the ensemble model generated by ELDE-TS has competitive performance over the state-of-the-art ensemble models and hand-designed deep models on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Furthermore, further analysis demonstrates that the proposed ensemble selection method and the nonrepetitive evaluation mechanism positively contribute to improving the performance of the ensemble model.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in image translation tasks. However, its prohibitive computational overhead has been a major hurdle for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Due to the training instability and the complicated network architecture, existing model acceleration techniques cannot appropriately handle the GAN compression problem. To cope with these difficulties, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to compress GAN models in the context of image translation tasks, which is termed MEGC. Particularly, the conflict between the computational cost of the GAN model and the quality of the generated image is explicitly modeled as a two-objective optimization problem, and the evolved Pareto set is utilized to guide the sampling process during supernet training, which can in turn divert the focus of the supernet training to well-performing compact subnets. Besides, an evaluation-free strategy is introduced to facilitate exploration in the search space while incurring no extra computational cost. Based on the above design, the proposed MEGC eliminates the requirement of subnet searching in the post-processing procedure.

  abstract     = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are heuristic optimization techniques inspired by Darwinian evolution, which are characterized by successfully finding robust solutions for optimization problems. While quantum resources have allowed for the acceleration of many computational tasks, it remains an open question whether they can enhance the efficacy of evolutionary algorithms, particularly GAs. Here, we propose a subroutine-based quantum GA with individuals codified in independent registers. This distinctive codification allows our proposal to depict all the fundamental elements characterizing GAs, i.e., population-based search with selection of many individuals, crossover, and mutation. Our subroutine-based construction permits us to consider several variants of the algorithm. For instance, we first analyze the performance of two different quantum cloning machines (QCMs), a key component of the crossover subroutine. Indeed, we study two paradigmatic examples, namely, the biomimetic cloning of quantum observables and the Bužek–Hillery universal QCM. We observed a faster average convergence of the former, but better-final populations of the latter. Additionally, we analyzed the effect of introducing a mutation subroutine, concluding a minor impact on the average performance. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum channel analysis to prove the exponential convergence of our algorithm and even predict its convergence ratio.},

In these methods, a decision maker (DM), who is a domain expert, is iteratively involved in the solution process and guides the solution process toward her/his desired region with preference information. However, there have not been many studies regarding the performance evaluation of interactive evolutionary methods. On the other hand, indicators have been developed for a priori methods, where the DM provides preference information before optimization. In the literature, some studies treat interactive evolutionary methods as a series of a priori steps when assessing and comparing them. In such settings, indicators designed for a priori methods can be utilized. In this article, we propose a novel performance indicator for interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods and show how it can assess the performance of these interactive methods as a whole process and not as a series of separate steps.

In this algorithm, we design a tribe classification operator to divide the population into different tribes according to a feasibility check and the objective values, which is beneficial for driving the population toward the feasible region and Pareto-optimal fronts. Meanwhile, a population selection strategy is proposed to identify promising solutions from tribes and exploit them to update the population. The optimal values of the distance variables vary differently with dynamic environments, thus, we design a dynamic response strategy for solutions in different tribes that estimates their distances to approach the Pareto-optimal fronts and regenerates a promising population when detecting environmental changes. In addition, a scalable generator is designed to simulate diverse movement directions and magnitudes of the optimal distance variables in real-world problems under dynamic environments, obtaining a set of improved test problems.

For deep MTL, knowledge transfer is often implemented via sharing all hidden features of tasks. A major shortcoming is that it can lead to negative knowledge transfer across tasks when task correlation is weak. To overcome it, this article proposes an evolutionary method to learn sparse sharing representations adaptively. By embedding the neural network optimization into evolutionary multitasking, our proposed method finds an optimal combination of tasks and sharing features. It can identify negative correlation and redundant features and then remove them from the hidden feature set. Thus, an optimal sparse sharing subnetwork can be produced for each task.

Due to the nested structure, the upper-level population evaluation requires a set of complete lower-level optimizations, thereby reducing the efficiency and practicability of EA methods. In this article, a multiobjective transformation-based EA (MOTEA) is proposed to perform multiple lower-level optimizations in a parallel and collaborative manner. Specifically, the corresponding multiple lower-level optimizations for each generation of the upper-level population evaluation are transformed into locating a set of Pareto-optimal solutions of a constructed multiobjective optimization problem. By utilizing the built-in implicit parallelism of evolutionary multiobjective optimization, multiple lower-level problems can thus be optimized in parallel. Within one multiobjective search population, the collaboration among the parallel lower-level optimization can be realized by exploiting and utilizing the implicit similarities among them for better efficiency. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MOTEA are verified by comparing it with four state-of-the-art evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithms on two sets of popular bilevel optimization benchmark test problems and three application problems.},

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) has achieved promising performance in image classification. However, GP-based methods usually require a long computation time for fitness evaluations, posing a challenge to real-world applications. Surrogate models can be efficiently computable approximations of expensive fitness evaluations. However, most existing surrogate methods are designed for evolutionary computation techniques with a vector-based representation consisting of numerical values, thus cannot be directly used for GP with a tree-based representation consisting of functions/operators. The variable sizes of GP trees further increase the difficulty of building the surrogate model for fitness approximations. To address these limitations, we propose a new surrogate-assisted GP approach including global and local surrogate models, which can accelerate the evolutionary learning process and achieve competitive classification performance simultaneously. The global surrogate model can assist GP in exploring the entire search space, while the local surrogate model can speed up convergence and further improve performance. Furthermore, a new surrogate training set is constructed to assist in establishing the relationship between the GP tree and its fitness, and effective surrogate models can be built accordingly. Experimental results on ten datasets of varying difficulty show that the new approach significantly reduces the computational cost of the GP-based method without sacrificing the classification accuracy. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. Further analysis reveals the significance of the global and local surrogates and the new surrogate training set on improving or maintaining the performance of the proposed approach while reducing the computational cost.},

Such an archive can be solely used to store high-quality solutions presented to the decision maker, but in many cases may participate in the search process (e.g., as the population in evolutionary computation). Over the last two decades, archiving, the process of comparing new solutions with previous ones and deciding how to update the archive/population, stands as an important issue in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). This is evidenced by constant efforts from the community on developing various effective archiving methods, ranging from conventional Pareto-based methods to more recent indicator-based and decomposition-based ones. However, the focus of these efforts is on empirical performance comparison in terms of specific quality indicators; there is lack of systematic study of archiving methods from a general theoretical perspective. In this article, we attempt to conduct a systematic overview of multiobjective archiving, in the hope of paving the way to understand archiving algorithms from a holistic perspective of theory and practice, and more importantly providing a guidance on how to design theoretically desirable and practically useful archiving algorithms. In doing so, we also present that archiving algorithms based on weakly Pareto-compliant indicators (e.g., $\epsilon $ -indicator and IGD+), as long as designed properly, can achieve the same theoretical desirables as archivers based on Pareto-compliant indicators (e.g., hypervolume indicator). Such desirables include the property limit-optimal, the limit form of the possible optimal property that a bounded archiving algorithm can have with respect to the most general form of superiority between solution sets.},

Neural architecture search (NAS) offers an effective means of discovering architectures. It has been highly successful in numerous applications, particularly in natural image classification. Yet, medical images possess unique characteristics, such as small regions and a wide variety of lesion sizes, that differentiate them from natural images. Furthermore, most current NAS methods struggle with high computational costs, especially when dealing with high-resolution image datasets. In this article, we present a novel evolutionary NAS method called multiscale training-free neural architecture search (MSTF-NAS) to address these challenges. Specifically, to accommodate the broad range of lesion region sizes in disease diagnosis, we develop a new reduction cell search space that enables the search algorithm to explicitly identify the optimal scale combination for multiscale feature extraction. To overcome the issue of high computational costs, we utilize training-free indicators as performance measures for candidate architectures, which allows us to search for the optimal architecture more efficiently. More specifically, by considering the capability and simplicity of various networks, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem that involves two training-free indicators and model complexity for candidate architectures. Extensive experiments on a large medical image benchmark and a publicly available breast cancer detection dataset are conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that our MSTF-NAS outperforms both human-designed architectures and current state-of-the-art NAS algorithms on both datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Network architecture plays a significant role in determining the final output of GANs, but designing a fine architecture demands extensive domain expertise. This article aims to address this issue by searching for high-performance generator’s architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). The proposed approach, called evolutionary weight sharing GANs (EWSGAN), is based on weight sharing and comprises two steps. First, a supernet of the generator is trained using weight sharing. Second, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed to identify optimal subnets from the supernet. These subnets inherit weights directly from the supernet for fitness assessment. Two strategies are used to stabilize the training of the generator supernet: 1) a fair single-path sampling strategy and 2) a discarding strategy. Experimental results indicate that the architecture searched by our method achieved a new state-of-the-art among NAS–GAN methods with a Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 9.09 and an inception score (IS) of 8.99 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

To assess the performance of ECGP, we conduct extensive experiments on three text classification task datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ECGP outperforms other NAS methods, requiring only hundreds of fitness evaluations to find architectures with competitive accuracy compared with human-designed models. Additionally, the ECGP-evolved architectures are shown as converging fast and stably, and having high-level transferability with merely a 1%–2% accuracy drop. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operators and age mechanism, and identify GRU as the most critical function in the text classification task. Finally, we summarize three design principles observed from the ECGP-evolved architectures that are in line with human-design strategies.

Given the privacy concerns surrounding financial data, we aim to employ neural architecture search (NAS) to help nonexpert end-users automatically design architectures. The genetic algorithm (GA)-based NAS stands out due to its relatively low hardware requirements and robust theoretical foundation. However, constrained by limited data, the model would undergo architecture search on a general regulatory dataset while being deployed on private one owned by each organization. The data distribution of the private dataset may vary from that of public datasets, giving rise to the challenge of data domain shift. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel fitness evaluation method. When scoring the fitness, we take into account both the architecture’s validation accuracy and its potential for generalization by the metric of loss landscape. In addition, we improve the training paradigm for evaluation, utilizing a prototype-based training paradigm based on embedding distances for classification, allowing for rapid domain adaptation and improving performance on the distribution-shift data. We further introduce GA-TextCNN, a GA-based NAS framework specifically designed for text recognition, enhancing its suitability for text data within AIFR tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect two related datasets and evaluate our method on it. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves baseline models and is effective in solving the AIFR problem.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective neural architecture search (MONAS) methods based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are inefficient when the evaluation of each architecture incorporates parameter learning from scratch. A surrogate-assisted multiobjective neural architecture search (MONAS) problem can be tough considering cold-start in surrogate construction, and the evaluation of predicted promising architectures could still be cumbersome. Previously solved MONAS problems are likely to convey useful knowledge that could assist solving the current MONAS problem. To take the benefit from knowledge of these previous practices, a framework tackling large-scale knowledge transfer is proposed. Through sparse-constraint transfer stacking, the surrogate for the current problem gets informative easily. With knee-region knowledge distillation from previously learned parameters of nondominated architectures, evaluation of current architectures could be efficient and credible. To avoid transferring knowledge from irrelevant problems, an iterative source selection algorithm is designed to avoid negative transfer. The proposed framework is analyzed under different source and target MONAS problem combinations. Results show that with the help of this framework, architectures with competitive performance could be found under limited evaluation budget.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a competitive performance in medical imaging applications, such as image segmentation. However, choosing an existing architecture capable of adapting to a specific dataset is challenging and requires design expertise. Neural architecture search (NAS) is employed to overcome these limitations. NAS uses techniques to design the Neural Networks architecture. Typically, the models’ weights optimization is carried out using a continuous loss function, unlike model topology optimization, which is highly influenced by the specific problem. Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm (EA) capable of adapting to the topology optimization problem of CNNs by considering the attributes of its representation. A tree representation can express complex connectivity and apply variation operations. This article presents a tree-based GP algorithm for evolving CNNs based on the well-known U-Net architecture producing compact and flexible models for medical image segmentation across multiple domains. This proposal is called NAS / GP / U-Net (NASGP-Net). NASGP-Net uses a cell-based encoding and U-Net architecture as a backbone to construct CNNs based on a hierarchical arrangement of primitive operations. Our experiments indicate that our approach can produce remarkable segmentation results with fewer parameters regarding fixed architectures. Moreover, NASGP-Net presents competitive results against NAS methods. Finally, we observed notable performance improvements based on several evaluation metrics, including dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), and Hausdorff distance (HD).},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize the novel classes which cannot be collected for training a prediction model. Accordingly, generative models [e.g., generative adversarial network (GAN)] are typically used to synthesize the visual samples conditioned by the class semantic vectors and achieve remarkable progress for ZSL. However, existing GAN-based generative ZSL methods are based on hand-crafted models, which cannot adapt to various datasets/scenarios and fails to model instability. To alleviate these challenges, we propose evolutionary GAN search (termed EGANS) to automatically design the generative network with good adaptation and stability, enabling reliable visual feature sample synthesis for advancing ZSL. Specifically, we adopt cooperative dual evolution to conduct a neural architecture search (NAS) for both generator and discriminator under a unified evolutionary adversarial framework. EGANS is learned by two stages: 1) evolution generator architecture search and 2) evolution discriminator architecture search. During the evolution generator architecture search, we adopt a many-to-one adversarial training strategy to evolutionarily search for the optimal generator. Then the optimal generator is further applied to search for the optimal discriminator in the evolution discriminator architecture search with a similar evolution search algorithm. Once the optimal generator and discriminator are searched, we entail them into various generative ZSL baselines for ZSL classification. Extensive experiments show that EGANS consistently improve existing generative ZSL methods on the standard CUB, SUN, AWA2 and FLO datasets. The significant performance gains indicate that the evolutionary NAS explores a virgin field in ZSL.},

To this end, a classifier-based Pareto evolution approach is proposed, where an online classifier is trained to directly predict the dominance relationship between the candidate and reference architectures. Besides, an adaptive clustering method is designed to select reference architectures for the classifier, and an $\alpha $ -domination-assisted approach is developed to address the imbalance issue of positive and negative samples. The proposed approach is compared with a number of state-of-the-art NAS methods on widely used test datasets, and computation results show that the proposed approach is able to alleviate the rank disorder issue and outperforms other methods. Especially, the proposed method is able to find a set of promising network architectures with different model sizes ranging from 2M to 5M under diverse objectives and constraints.},

In some scenarios, however, there are irrelevant objectives that are optimized by the EMOA but ignored by the DM, as well as, hidden objectives that the DM considers when judging the utility of solutions but are not optimized. This discrepancy between the EMOA and the DM’s preferences may impede the search for the most-preferred solution and waste resources evaluating irrelevant objectives. Research on objective reduction has focused so far on the structure of the problem and correlations between objectives and neglected the role of the DM. We formally define here the concepts of irrelevant and hidden objectives and propose methods for detecting them, based on univariate feature selection and recursive feature elimination, that use the preferences already elicited when a DM interacts with a ranking-based interactive EMOA (iEMOA). We incorporate the detection methods into an iEMOA capable of dynamically switching the objectives being optimized. Our experiments show that this approach can efficiently identify which objectives are relevant to the DM and reduce the number of objectives being optimized, while keeping and often improving the utility, according to the DM, of the best solution found.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in reinforcement learning (RL) have been able to derive optimal policies for sophisticated and capable agents, and shown to achieve human-level performance on a number of challenging tasks. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiagent systems (MASs), complexities, such as nonstationarity and partial observability bring new challenges to the field. Building a flexible and efficient multiagent RL (MARL) algorithm capable of handling complex tasks has to date remained an open challenge. This article presents a multiagent learning system with the evolution of social roles (eSRMA). The main interest is placed on solving the key issues in the definition and evolution of suitable roles, and optimizing the policies accompanied by social roles in MAS efficiently. Specifically, eSRMA incorporates and cultivates role division awareness of agents to improve the ability to deal with complex cooperative tasks. Each agent is assigned a role module, which can dynamically generate roles based on the individuals’ local observations. A novel MARL algorithm is designed as the principal driving force that governs the role-policy learning process by a role-attention credit assignment mechanism. Moreover, a role evolution process is developed to help agents dynamically choose appropriate roles in decision making. Comprehensive experiments on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmarkhave demonstrated that eSRMA exhibits superiority in achieving higher learning capability and efficiency for multiple agents compared to the state-of-the-art MARL methods.},

Moreover, the true Pareto-optimal solutions of a combinatorial MMOP are usually difficult to know, which has limited the development of its optimizer. In this article, we first propose a test problem generator for multimodal multiobjective traveling salesman problems (MMTSPs). It can readily generate MMTSPs with known Pareto-optimal solutions. Then, we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm to solve MMTSPs. In our proposed algorithm, we develop two new edge assembly crossover operators, which are specialized in searching for superior solutions to MMTSPs. Moreover, the proposed algorithm uses a new environmental selection operator to maintain a good balance between the objective space diversity and decision space diversity. We compare our algorithm with five state-of-the-art designs. Experimental results convincingly show that our algorithm is powerful in solving MMTSPs.},

  abstract     = {Location-routing problems (LRPs) widely exist in logistics activities. For the biomass waste collection, there is a recognized need for novel models to locate the collection facilities and plan the vehicle routes. So far most location-routing models fall into the cost-driven-only category. However, comprehensive objectives are required in the specific context, such as time-dependent pollution and speed- and load-related emission. Furthermore, LRPs are hierarchical by nature, containing the facility location problems (strategic level) and the vehicle routing problems (VRPs) (tactical level). Existing studies in this field usually adopt computational intelligence methods directly without decomposing the problem. This can be inefficient especially when multiple objectives are applied. Motivated by these, we develop a novel multiobjective optimization model for the LRP for biomass waste collection. To solve this model, we explore the way to tailor evolutionary algorithms to the hierarchical structure. We develop adapted versions of two commonly used evolutionary algorithms: 1) the genetic algorithm and 2) the ant colony optimization algorithm. For the genetic algorithm, we divide the population by the strategic level decisions, so that each subpopulation has a fixed location plan, breaking the LRP down into many multidepot VRPs. For the ant colony optimization, we use an additional pheromone vector to track the good decisions on the location level, and segregate the pheromones related to different satellite depots to avoid misleading information. Thus, the problem degenerates into VRP. Experimental results show that our proposed methods have better performances on the LRP for biomass waste collection.},

  abstract     = {Routing and scheduling problems with increasingly realistic modeling approaches often entail the consideration of multiple objectives, time constraints, and modeling the system as a multigraph. This detailed modeling approach has increased computational complexity and may also lead to violation of the additivity property of the costs. In the worst scenario, increased complexity makes the problem intractable for exact algorithms. Even when the problem is solvable, exact algorithms may not provide solutions within the given time budget, and the found solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal due to the additivity property violation. Approximate solution methods become more suitable in this case. This article focuses on one particular real-world application, the Airport Ground Movement Problem, where both time constraints and parallel arcs are involved. We introduce a novel memetic algorithm for routing in multigraphs with time constraints (MARMT) and present a comprehensive study of its different variants based on diverse genetic representation methods. We propose a local search operator that enhances search efficiency and effectiveness. MARMT is tested on real data based on two airports of different sizes. Our results show that MARMT does not suffer from the nonadditivity property problem as it outperforms the state-of-the-art exact algorithm when allowed to converge. When a time budget of 10 s is imposed on MARMT, it is able to provide solutions with quality comparable (within 1%–5% degradation) to the ones given by the exact algorithm with respect to the aggregated objective values. MARMT can be adapted for other applications, such as train operations.},

  abstract     = {Many critical science, societal, and engineering fields contain large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs), comprised of many decision variables. However, as the number of decision variables increases, optimization algorithms face exponentially large search spaces, thereby exhibiting a degraded performance. Nonetheless, LSMOPs whose optimal solutions correspond to sparse variable vectors can be solved more efficiently by evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. Despite the great recent strides in developing generic EMO algorithms for sparse LSMOPs, there is still room for improvement. Specifically, algorithms still struggle to find convergent and diverse Pareto fronts in an acceptable amount of time when solving sparse LSMOPs with thousands of decision variables. To better solve sparse LSMOPs, we propose a novel set of evolutionary operators to adapt small-scale EMO algorithms for sparse LSMOPs. These simple, novel, and effective operators include varied striped sparse population sampling (VSSPS), sparse simulated binary crossover (S-SBX), and sparse polynomial mutation (S-PM). These operators, combined with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), make the proposed S-NSGA-II algorithm. S-NSGA-II runs near-universally faster than existing methods for problems containing up to 6400 decision variables, while performing as well as or better than contemporary sparse LSMOP algorithms with respect to hypervolume, especially, with problems with larger than 5000 decision variables.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the observation that most neural architecture search (NAS) methods are time consuming because a “training process” is required to evaluate each searched neural architecture, this article presents an efficient NAS algorithm based on a promising metaheuristic algorithm named search economics (SE) and a new training-free estimator to evaluate the searched neural architectures for not only obtaining a good neural architecture but also accelerating the computation time. The basic idea of the proposed NAS algorithm is to use the so-called expected value of each region in the search space to guide the search so that it will focus on searching high potential regions instead of solutions with high objective values in particular regions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with state-of-the-art nontraining-free and training-free NAS methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding a result that is similar to or better than those found by most nontraining-free NAS algorithms compared in this study but taking only a tiny portion of the computation time.},

  abstract     = {The hypervolume metric is widely used to guide the search in multiobjective optimization. However, in parallel expensive multiobjective optimization, the hypervolume-based multipoint expected improvement (EI) suffers from high computational overhead and scales poorly with the batch size. To address this issue, we integrate hypervolume-based EI with the MOEA/D framework and propose a novel EI, named the expected direction-based hypervolume improvement (DirHV-EI). The DirHV-EI only measures the hypervolume improvement within each axis-parallel box induced by the modified Tchebycheff scalarization. Thus, it has a simple analytical expression that can be easily computed. Theoretical analysis indicates that the maximization of our proposed improvement function can help to maximize both the weighted hypervolume and the Tchebycheff improvement metrics. Using DirHV-EI, we design a decomposition-based Bayesian optimization algorithm for solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems. At each iteration, the MOEA/D is used to maximize the DirHV-EI values with respect to a number of direction vectors in a collaborative manner, and a number of candidate solutions can be obtained. Then, a submodularity-based greedy selection strategy is used to select multiple query points from the candidates. Experimental results on both benchmark instances and real-world problems show that our proposed algorithm is an efficient and effective method for parallel expensive multiobjective optimization.},

As video data evolves, more special perspectives and challenging video data are constantly kept up to date. This poses challenges for object tracking tasks and places higher demands on the generalization capabilities of the models. In this article, we propose a novel quantum evolutionary learning tracker (QELT) for video. The model combines quantum evolution with deep networks for tracking video objects. The model uses a QELT to generate a reliable population of candidate regions and a deep network for classification. In particular, the quantum evolutionary predictor predicts the object motion state through rotation operator and trajectory inference, and provides motion state information for the tracker. The predictor can incorporate object history contextual information and can provide stable candidate estimation populations for the model in case of failure of appearance features. Both quantum evolution and deep networks are combined to form an end-to-end online video object tracker. In addition, we propose a new video object tracking evaluation algorithm, Balanced Intersection over Union. The evaluation algorithm uses aspect ratios to balance the share of overlap and distance. Finally, we test the model on the OTB 2015 dataset for natural video and on the SV248A10-SOT dataset for satellite video. The performance of the proposed model is also analyzed and validated by comparing it with more than 20 classical tracker models. The experimental results show that our model has high generalization ability and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Subset selection, which selects a subset of solutions according to certain criterion/indicator, is a topic closely related to evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). The critical component of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), environmental selection, is essentially a subset selection problem, i.e., selecting $N$ solutions as the next-generation population from usually $2N$ candidates (where $N$ denotes the size of the population). Another use of subset selection is the solution preprocessing procedure for decision-making, in which typically a few representatives are selected from the final population or a large-size archive, in order not to overwhelm the decision maker. Existing work for subset selection in EMO is focused on developing greedy algorithms, but may suffer from being trapped in local optima. In this article, we approach the problem by providing a multiobjective evolutionary algorithmic framework. We consider several popular quality indicators for subset evaluation and present accelerated variants of a well-studied MOEA in the theoretical study area, global simple evolutionary multiobjective optimizer (GSEMO), for each indicator. We conduct rigorous theoretical analyses of the acceleration procedure. Moreover, we prove that our algorithms can achieve the best-so-far approximation guarantee by the submodularity of the indicators. We finally empirically show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the potentials to be further improved by introducing popular MOEAs (e.g., using NSGA-II and MOEA/D to replace GSEMO).},

  abstract     = {Recently, a number of domain adaptation (DA) methods have been proposed for knowledge transfer in evolutionary multitasking (EMT). However, the learned mappings in these methods often have unique biases in representing the connection between source and target tasks. Few studies have paid attention to the complementarity of different mappings in knowledge transfer. To fill this research gap, this article proposes an ensemble method to combine multiple DA methods for knowledge transfer in EMT by considering the efficacy and diversity of these methods. First, a hierarchical clustering method is used to divide the population of each task into multiple clusters. Then, when two parental solutions are selected for knowledge transfer across tasks, the solutions within the same cluster are checked. In particular, if none of these solutions has been transferred before, the efficacy of DA methods is considered first by using roulette wheel selection based on the corresponding performance improvements in the evolutionary optimization process. Otherwise, the diversity of DA methods is emphasized by randomly selecting one of the DA methods for knowledge transfer. The effectiveness of our proposed ensemble method is validated by embedding it into existing state-of-the-art EMT algorithms, and the experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms several recently proposed EMT algorithms on most cases of two multitasking benchmark suites and one practical case.},

  abstract     = {Block sparse signals have the characteristics of nonzero values concentrated as blocks. Therefore, block sparse recovery requires recovering the original signal from the observed signal and the measurement matrix, where the recovered error should be small and the signal satisfies the block sparsity. In this article, block sparse recovery is solved as a multiobjective problem (MOP) and the recovery error, sparsity, and the block number of the recovered signal are considered as the conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the dimensionality of real block sparse signals is often too large, which increases the difficulty of recovery. Cooperative coevolutionary (CC) can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality in block sparse recovery. In addition, block sparsity causes zero and nonzero variables in the signal to form natural clusters, which is similar to the decomposition and cooperation of subproblems in CC. Therefore, CC is used in the algorithm to solve the block sparse MOP and decomposes the original problem into different subproblems. Each subproblem has a defined nonzero degree that can be combined with the proposed adaptive operator to adaptively adjust the way of generating new solutions of subproblem, which encourages the complete solution to have block sparsity. For the increased number of function evaluations (FEs) caused by the decomposition, a new list-inquiry evaluation is designed to avoid repeated evaluation. Finally, the experimental results on simulated data and real data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, with the rapid growth of mobile devices connected to the edge server, it is challenging to directly obtain an optimal task offloading scheme due to increasing computational cost and problem scale. In this study, we model the costly task offloading problem (CTOP) in mobile-edge computing networks to achieve efficient joint optimization of energy consumption and processing latency for mobile devices. Inspired by the success of evolutionary multitasking in solving complex optimization problems by leveraging the experience of simple optimization problems, we develop a novel multitasking framework whose effectiveness is demonstrated in solving the CTOP. In this framework, auxiliary tasks are created to optimize the local processing overhead and the edge processing overhead of task offloading. On this basis, we propose an effective multitask evolutionary algorithm that includes segmented knowledge transfer and auxiliary task update. Specifically, source and extended decision variables are considered as different knowledge to be utilized, while the auxiliary tasks are allowed to be updated dynamically. Related knowledge that is learned from cheap and simple auxiliary tasks promotes the evolutionary search for CTOP. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Compared to existing multitasking and single-tasking algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows competitive performance in CTOP instances and achieves better comprehensive performance in terms of energy consumption and processing latency.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing advancements in network architecture design have led to remarkable achievements in deep learning across various challenging computer vision tasks. Meanwhile, the development of neural architecture search (NAS) has provided promising approaches to automating the design of network architectures for lower prediction error. Recently, the emerging application scenarios of deep learning (e.g., autonomous driving) have raised higher demands for network architectures considering multiple design criteria: number of parameters/weights, number of floating-point operations, inference latency, among others. From an optimization point of view, the NAS tasks involving multiple design criteria are intrinsically multiobjective optimization problems; hence, it is reasonable to adopt evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for tackling them. Nonetheless, there is still a clear gap confining the related research along this pathway: on the one hand, there is a lack of a general problem formulation of NAS tasks from an optimization point of view; on the other hand, there are challenges in conducting benchmark assessments of EMO algorithms on NAS tasks. To bridge the gap: 1) we formulate NAS tasks into general multiobjective optimization problems and analyze the complex characteristics from an optimization point of view; 2) we present an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed EvoXBench , to generate benchmark test problems for EMO algorithms to run efficiently—without the requirement of GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow; and 3) we instantiate two test suites comprehensively covering two datasets, seven search spaces, and three hardware devices, involving up to eight objectives. Based on the above, we validate the proposed test suites using six representative EMO algorithms and provide some empirical analyses. The code of EvoXBench is available at https://github.com/EMI-Group/EvoXBench .},

Neural network-based deep learning methods are effective for image classification, but they typically require large-scale training data and have major limitations, such as requiring expertise to design network architectures and having poor interpretability. Evolutionary deep learning (EDL) is a recent hot topic that combines evolutionary computation with deep learning. However, most EDL methods focus on evolving architectures of neural networks, which still suffers from limitations such as poor interpretability. To address this, this article proposes a new genetic programming-based EDL approach to data-efficient image classification. The new approach can automatically evolve variable-length models using many important operators from both image and classification domains. It can learn different types of image features from color or grayscale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for image classification. A flexible multilayer representation enables the new approach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different tasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple internal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification tasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves a better performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient image classification. A deep analysis shows that the new approach has good convergence and evolves models with high interpretability, different lengths/sizes/shapes, and good transferability.},

However, in most DD-MOPs, only a few available data can be practicably collected from real engineering experiments due to the unaffordable cost and time. The key challenge in such a DD-MOP is to prevent the serious deterioration on the accuracy of the obtained approximate Pareto front. In this article, two novel strategies, critical fitness for evolutionary algorithms and data augmentation for a surrogate model, are complementarily imposed by a generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle with the challenges in DD-MOPs. In the critical fitness strategy, a new critical fitness, composed of the critical score from the discriminator of GAN and the prediction value of the surrogate model, is proposed to improve the accuracy of the approximate Pareto front of a DD-MOP. In the data augmentation strategy, some new samples are synthetized by the generator of GAN to build a better-trained surrogate model. As a result, the GAN concurrently serves the critical fitness strategy and the data augmentation strategy as the roles of “killing two birds with one stone.” The performance of the proposed algorithm for DD-MOPs was well-verified over 26 benchmark problems and successfully applied to discover new NdFeB materials.},

  abstract     = {In science and engineering, multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) usually contain multiple complex constraints, which poses a significant challenge in obtaining the optimal solution. This article aims to solve the challenges brought by multiple complex constraints. First, this article analyzes the relationship between single-constrained Pareto front (SCPF) and their common Pareto front (PF) subconstrained PF (SubCPF). Next, we discussed the SCPF, SubCPF, and unconstraint PF (UPF)’s help to solve constraining PF (CPF). Then, further discusses what kind of cooperation should be used between multiple populations constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm (CMOEA) to better deal with multiconstrained MOPs (mCMOPs). At the same time, based on the discussion in this article, we propose a new multipopulation CMOEA called MCCMO, which uses a new cooperation mechanism. MCCMO uses C+2 (C is the number of constraints) populations to find the UPF, SCPF, and SubCPF at an appropriate time. Furthermore, MCCMO uses the newly proposed activation dormancy detection (ADD) to accelerate the optimization process and uses the proposed combine occasion detection (COD) to find the appropriate time to find the SubCPF. The performance on 32 mCMOPs and real-world mCMOPs shows that our algorithm can obtain competitive solutions on MOPs with multiple constraints.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multiobjective and many-objective optimization (EMO and EMaO) algorithms are increasingly used to identify the true shape and location of the Pareto-optimal front using a few representative well-converged and well-distributed solutions. The reason for their popularity is due to their ability to provide a better understanding of objective relationships for optimal solutions, and also to facilitate the choice of a preferred solution using an interactive or post-optimal multicriterion decision analysis. However, since EMO and EMaO algorithms are stochastic, a single application may not provide a true representative set with a desired number of Pareto solutions reliably in repetitive runs and importantly with a well-distributed set of solutions. In this article, we propose a multistage framework involving reference-vector-based evolutionary multi- and many-objective algorithms (MuSt-EMO and MuSt-EMaO) that attempts to recursively rectify shortcomings of previous stages by careful executions of subsequent stages so that a prescribed number of well-distributed and well-converged solutions are achieved at the end. The proposed multistage approach is implemented to a number of popular reference vector-based EMO/EMaO algorithms and is applied on various multi- and many-objective test and real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in handling dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), particularly for environmental changes with predictable characteristics. However, little attention has been paid to DMOPs with stochastic changes. It may be difficult for existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) to effectively handle this kind of DMOPs because most DMOEAs assume that environmental changes follow regular patterns and consecutive environments are similar. This article presents a Mahalanobis distance-based approach (MDA) to deal with DMOPs with stochastic changes. Specifically, we make an all-sided assessment of search environments via Mahalanobis distance on saved information to learn the relationship between the new environment and historical ones. Afterward, a change response strategy applies the learning to the new environment to accelerate the convergence and maintain the diversity of the population. Besides, the change degree is considered for all decision variables to alleviate the impact of stochastic changes on the evolving population. An MDA has been tested on stochastic DMOPs with two to four objectives. The results show that MDA performs significantly better than the other latest algorithms in this article, suggesting that MDA is effective for DMOPs with stochastic changes.},

  abstract     = {Experienced users often have useful knowledge and intuition in solving real-world optimization problems. User knowledge can be formulated as intervariable relationships to assist an optimization algorithm in finding good solutions faster. Such intervariable interactions can also be automatically learned from high-performing solutions discovered at intermediate iterations in an optimization run—a process called innovization. These relations, if vetted by the users, can be enforced among newly generated solutions to steer the optimization algorithm toward practically promising regions in the search space. Challenges arise for large-scale problems where the number of such variable relationships may be high. This article proposes an interactive knowledge-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization (IK-EMO) framework that extracts hidden variable-wise relationships as knowledge from evolving high-performing solutions, shares them with users to receive feedback, and applies them back to the optimization process to improve its effectiveness. The knowledge extraction process uses a systematic and elegant graph analysis method which scales well with the number of variables. The working of the proposed IK-EMO is demonstrated on three large-scale real-world engineering design problems. The simplicity and elegance of the proposed knowledge extraction process and the achievement of high-performing solutions quickly indicate the power of the proposed framework. The results presented should motivate further such interaction-based optimization studies for their routine use in practice.},

  abstract     = {The construction of machine learning models involves many bi-level multiobjective optimization problems (BL-MOPs), where upper-level (UL) candidate solutions must be evaluated via training weights of a model in the lower level (LL). Due to the Pareto optimality of subproblems and the complex dependency across UL solutions and LL weights, a UL solution is feasible if and only if the LL weight is Pareto optimal. It is computationally expensive to determine which LL Pareto weight in the LL Pareto weight set is the most appropriate for each UL solution. This article proposes a bi-level multiobjective learning framework (BLMOL), coupling the above decision-making process with the optimization process of the upper-level MOP (UL-MOP) by introducing LL preference $\boldsymbol {r}$ . Specifically, the UL variable and $\boldsymbol {r}$ are simultaneously searched to minimize multiple UL objectives by evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. The LL weight with respect to $\boldsymbol {r}$ is trained to minimize multiple LL objectives via gradient-based preference multiobjective algorithms. In addition, the preference surrogate model is constructed to replace the expensive evaluation process of the UL-MOP. We consider a novel case study on multitask graph neural topology search. It aims to find a set of Pareto topologies and their Pareto weights, representing different tradeoffs across tasks at UL and LL, respectively. The found graph neural network is employed to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, including graph classification, node classification, and link prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that BLMOL can outperform some state-of-the-art algorithms and generate well-representative UL solutions and LL weights.},

First, the effects of different solving strategies on population states are evaluated in the early evolutionary stage. Then, the mapping model of population states and solving strategies is established. Finally, the model recommends subsequent solving strategies based on the current population state. This method can be embedded into existing evolutionary algorithms, which can improve their performances to different degrees.

However, since different tasks in the MTO problem usually have heterogeneous characteristics, it is difficult to realize the positive knowledge transfer among tasks, resulting in poor convergence. To cope with this problem, a multitask particle swarm optimization (MTPSO) with a heterogeneous domain adaptation strategy (MTPSO-HDA) is proposed to transfer positive knowledge among heterogeneous tasks. First, a nonlinear mapping between the source task and the target task is constructed based on the adaptive kernel function. Then, source tasks are mapped to the target task space to reduce the differences among heterogeneous tasks. Second, a multisource domain adaptive strategy based on fitness landscape similarity is designed to implement domain adaptation. Then, the importance of each source domain is quantitatively described to reduce the differences between multiple source domains and a target domain and achieve domain adaptation among heterogeneous tasks. Third, a heterogeneous MTPSO mechanism is introduced to facilitate positive knowledge transfer among heterogeneous tasks. Then, an appropriate evolutionary mechanism is designed according to the fitness landscape similarity to achieve positive knowledge transfer. Finally, to assess the effectiveness of the MTPSO-HDA algorithm, some experiments are designed based on some benchmark problems and real-world application of wastewater treatment process. The results demonstrate that the proposed MTPSO-HDA algorithm can promote positive knowledge transfer among heterogeneous tasks to improve convergence.},

To handle MMOPs, we propose a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm (BOEA), which transforms an MMOP into a bi-objective optimization problem. This problem is constructed by the penalty boundary intersection technique and a diversity indicator to obtain multiple PSs. The first objective reflects the population convergence and factors in the population diversity in the objective space, while the other objective concentrates more on the population diversity in the decision space. Furthermore, an environmental selection strategy is designed to choose the offspring solutions, which consists of nondominated sorting based on the transformed optimization problem and hierarchical clustering for selecting promising solutions. Experiments on 34 MMOPs demonstrate that BOEA performs better than selected state-of-the-art representatives, including 22 MMOPs from CEC2019 and 12 imbalanced MMOPs. In addition, the effectiveness of BOEA is further validated by six feature selection problems in real-world applications.},

JSS has a wide range of applications, such as order picking in the warehouse and vaccine delivery scheduling under a pandemic. In real-world applications, the production environment is often complex due to dynamic events, such as job arrivals over time and machine breakdown. Scheduling heuristics, e.g., dispatching rules, have been popularly used to prioritize the candidates such as machines in manufacturing to make good schedules efficiently. Genetic programming (GP), has shown its superiority in learning scheduling heuristics for JSS automatically due to its flexible representation. This survey first provides comprehensive discussions of recent designs of GP algorithms on different types of JSS. In addition, we notice that in the recent years, a range of machine learning techniques, such as feature selection and multitask learning, have been adapted to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of scheduling heuristic design with GP. However, there is no survey to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these recent approaches. To fill this gap, this article provides a comprehensive survey on GP and machine learning techniques on automatic scheduling heuristic design for JSS. In addition, current issues and challenges are discussed to identify promising areas for automatic scheduling heuristic design in the future.},

In such algorithms, HV-based environmental selection (HVES), which aims at selecting a subpopulation with the maximal HV from the current population, plays a crucial role in guiding evolution. However, the computation time of HV increases exponentially with the number of objectives, making the HVES task an expensive optimization problem. In this article, we propose an efficient surrogate-assisted greedy inclusion algorithm to deal with computationally expensive HVES tasks. It uses a lightweight surrogate model, radial basis function network, to replace the most time-consuming calculations. In addition, an $L_{1}$ -norm distance-based filter is performed as a preselection operator to reduce the search space and avoid some unnecessary calculations. Considering the inevitable approximation errors of surrogate models, we also design an online sampling strategy to enhance the reliability of selected solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested on two types of datasets and compared with six state-of-the-art greedy algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs excellently on most datasets.},

  abstract     = {Trusting others and reciprocating the received trust with trustworthy actions are fundaments of economic and social interactions. The trust game (TG) is widely used for studying trust and trustworthiness and entails a sequential interaction between two players, an investor and a trustee. It requires at least two strategies or options for an investor (e.g., to trust versus not to trust a trustee). According to the evolutionary game theory, the antisocial strategies (e.g., not to trust) evolve such that the investor and trustee end up with lower payoffs than those that they would get with the prosocial strategies (e.g., to trust). A generalization of the TG to a multiplayer (i.e., more than two players) TG was recently proposed. However, its outcomes hinge upon two assumptions that various real situations may substantially deviate from: 1) investors are forced to trust trustees and 2) investors can turn into trustees by imitation and vice versa. We propose an asymmetric multiplayer TG that allows investors not to trust and prohibits the imitation between players of different roles; instead, investors learn from other investors and the same for trustees. We show that the evolutionary game dynamics of the proposed TG qualitatively depends on the nonlinearity of the payoff function and the amount of incentives collected from and distributed to players through an institution. We also show that incentives given to trustees can be useful and sufficient to cost-effectively promote trust and trustworthiness among self-interested players.},

  abstract     = {Hypervolume contribution is an important concept in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). It involves hypervolume-based EMO algorithms and hypervolume subset selection algorithms. Its main drawback is that it is computationally expensive in high-dimensional spaces, which limits its applicability to many-objective optimization. Recently, an R2 indicator variant (i.e., $R_{2}^{\text {HVC}}$ indicator) is proposed to approximate the hypervolume contribution. The $R_{2}^{\text {HVC}}$ indicator uses line segments along a number of direction vectors for hypervolume contribution approximation. It has been shown that different direction vector sets lead to different approximation qualities. In this article, we propose learning to approximate (LtA), a direction vector set generation method for the $R_{2}^{\text {HVC}}$ indicator. The direction vector set is automatically learned from training data. The learned direction vector set can then be used in the $R_{2}^{\text {HVC}}$ indicator to improve its approximation quality. The usefulness of the proposed LtA method is examined by comparing it with other commonly used direction vector set generation methods for the $R_{2}^{\text {HVC}}$ indicator. Experimental results suggest the superiority of LtA over the other methods for generating high-quality direction vector sets.},

  abstract     = {Network structure evolves with time in the real world, and the discovery of changing communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that poses challenging tasks. Most existing methods assume that no significant change occurs; namely, the difference between adjacent snapshots is slight. However, great change exists in the real world usually. The great change in the network will result in the community detection algorithms are difficulty obtaining valuable information from the previous snapshot, leading to negative transfer for the next time steps. This article focuses on dynamic community detection with substantial changes by integrating higher order knowledge from the previous snapshots to aid the subsequent snapshots. Moreover, to improve search efficiency, a higher order knowledge transfer strategy is designed to determine first-order and higher order knowledge by detecting the similarity of the adjacency matrix of snapshots. In this way, our proposal can keep the advantages of previous community detection results and transfer them to the next task. We conduct the experiments on four real-world networks, including the networks with great or minor changes. Experimental results in the low-similarity datasets demonstrate that higher order knowledge is more valuable than first-order knowledge when the network changes significantly and keeps the advantage even if handling the high-similarity datasets. Our proposal can also guide other dynamic optimization problems with great changes.},

  abstract     = {Solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) with various features and challenges via evolutionary algorithms is very popular. Existing methods usually adopt an additional helper problem to simplify and solve them by divide and conquer. This article proposes a new multitasking framework for CMOPs, borrowing the idea of evolutionary multitasking optimization. The main contributions are: 1) a multitasking framework is proposed, where a CMOP is modeled as a multitasking optimization problem with three tasks. Then, it is solved by constraint-first, constraint-ignored, and constraint-relaxed multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; 2) a knowledge expression and a transfer strategy are devised to transfer the knowledge among the tasks; and 3) based on the proposed framework, a new two-stage algorithm is presented to solve CMOPs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments on four CMOP benchmark suites and 19 real-world CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration is an important task in computer vision, where the goal is to estimate a transformation to align a pair of point clouds. Most of the existing registration methods face the problems of poor robustness and getting stuck in local optima. Evolutionary multitasking is an effective paradigm to enhance global search capability and improve convergence characteristics through knowledge transfer across multiple related tasks. Inspired by evolutionary multitasking, this article proposes a multiform optimization approach through evolutionary multitasking for solving the point cloud registration problems. We first construct two related registration tasks with different functional landscapes to form a multiform optimization problem. Compared with methods that only focus on a single registration attribute, the two proposed tasks focus on robustness and precision of registration, respectively. Then, a new two-stage bidirectional knowledge transfer strategy is presented, which can implement efficient knowledge transfer among two related tasks. Finally, both simulations and real experiments show the power of our method. The proposed method is robust to noise, outliers, and partial overlaps and is effective in multiple real registration scenarios, such as object registration, scene reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping.},

  abstract     = {With the rising number of large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) from academia and industries, some multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with different decision variable handling strategies have been proposed. Decision variable analysis (DVA) is widely used in large-scale optimization, aiming at identifying the connection between each decision variable and the objectives, and grouping those interacting decision variables to reduce the complexity of LSMOPs. Despite their effectiveness, existing DVA techniques require the unbearable cost of function evaluations for solving LSMOPs. We propose a reformulation-based approach for efficient DVA to address this deficiency. Then a large-scale MOEA is proposed based on reformulated DVA, namely, LERD. Specifically, the DVA process is reformulated into an optimization problem with binary decision variables, aiming to approximate different grouping results. Afterwards, each group of decision variables is used for convergence-related or diversity-related optimization. The effectiveness and efficiency of the reformulation-based DVA are validated by replacing the corresponding DVA techniques in two large-scale MOEAs. Experiments in comparison with six state-of-the-art large-scale MOEAs on LSMOPs with up to 2000 decision variables have shown the promising performance of LERD.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is a practical and efficient evolutionary framework for solving large-scale global optimization problems (LSGOPs). The performance of CC depends on how variables are being grouped and can be improved through guided variable decomposition for various optimization problems. However, achieving a proper variable decomposition is computationally expensive. This article proposes an effective yet efficient differential grouping (EDG) method to reduce the associated computational cost. Our method exploits the historical interrelationship information of previous variable groups to examine interactions between the remnant variable groups. This allows us to spend less computing resources without compromising the accuracy of the final grouping result. Our proposal utilizes the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, in conjunction with EDG, to solve LSGOPs. Further, to reduce time complexity and improve the stability of CMA-ES, we substitute the complex matrix decomposition step with simpler matrix operations to compute the square root of the covariance matrix. Results from our experiments and analysis indicate that EDG is a competitive method to solve LSGOPs and improve the performance of CC. The proposed schemes significantly enhance the searchability of CMA-ES compared to the other large-scale variants of CMA-ES and state-of-the-art large-scale optimizers. Moreover, our EDG could be integrated with evolutionary optimizers of different flavors like differential evolution (DE).},

  abstract     = {For the past many years, several constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) have been designed for solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). In these CMOEAs, some constraint-handling techniques (CHTs) were proposed to balance the convergence and constrained satisfaction, however, they still face some serious challenges, such as premature convergence to the local optimal region and labor-intensive tuning of parameters for a specific CMOP. Furthermore, most of the existing CHTs are derived by solving constrained single-objective optimization. The information hidden from the feasible nondominated set (FNDS) has not been fully utilized. This study proposed a novel parameter-less constraint handling technique, which divides the entire population into three mutually exclusive subsets dynamically: 1) FNDS; 2) the subset dominated by FNDS; and 3) the subset not dominated by FNDS. According to the proposed division of labor, it is not necessary to balance the convergence and constrained satisfaction in each subset. To avoid being entrapped in local optima, the proposed algorithm adopts a two-stage strategy to solve CMOPs. In the first stage, the proposed algorithm focuses solely on converging toward the unconstrained Pareto front (PF) without considering the constrained satisfaction. In the second stage, the FNDS constraint handling technique is adopted to guide the population converging toward constrained PF effectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs, and the comparison results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on the CF, MW, and LIRCMOP test suites.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is an important data preprocessing technique that selects a small subset of relevant features to improve learning performance. However, it is also challenging due to its large search space. Recently, a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) has shown promising results in FS because of its potential global search ability. The main idea of CSO is to select two solutions randomly and then let the loser (worse fitness) learn from the winner (better fitness). Although such a search mechanism provides a high population diversity, it is at risk of generating unqualified solutions since the winner’s quality is not guaranteed. In this work, we propose a constrained evolutionary mechanism for CSO, which verifies the quality of all the particles and lets the infeasible (unqualified) solutions learn from the feasible (qualified) ones. We also propose a novel local search and a size-change operator that guide the population to search for smaller feature subsets with similar or better classification performance. A surrogate model, based on support vector machines, is proposed to assist both local search and the size-change operator to explore a massive number of potential feature subsets without requiring excessive computational resource. Results on 24 real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can select smaller feature subsets with higher classification performance than state-of-the-art evolutionary computation (EC) and non-EC benchmark algorithms.},
