  abstract     = {Empowering each vehicle with 4D situational awareness, i.e., accurate knowledge of neighboring vehicles&#39; 3D locations over time in a cooperative manner, is fundamental for improving autonomous driving performance in diverse traffic conditions. For this task, identification, localization and tracking of road users is critical for enhancing safety, motion planning and energy consumption of automated vehicles. Advanced perception sensors as well as communication abilities, enable the close collaboration of moving vehicles, and significantly increase the positioning accuracy via multi-modal sensor fusion. The challenge here is to actually match the extracted measurements from perception sensors with the correct vehicle ID, through data association. In this paper, two novel and distributed Cooperative Localization algorithms are formulated, based on linear least-squares and the celebrated Kalman Filter. They both aim to improve ego vehicle&#39;s 4D situational awareness, so as to be fully location aware of its surrounding and not just its own position. For that purpose, ego vehicle forms a star like topology with its neighbors, and fuses four types of multi-modal inter-vehicular measurements via the linear Graph Laplacian operator and geometry capturing differential coordinates. Moreover, a data association strategy has been integrated to the algorithms as part of the identification process, which is shown to be much more beneficial than traditional Hungarian algorithm. An extensive and realistic experimental study has been conducted, highlighting the benefits of the proposed methods in a variety of experimental scenarios, and verifying increased situational awareness ability. The proposed distributed approaches offer high positioning accuracy, outperforming other SOA centralized methods.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based motion planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is regarded as a critical requirement for marine intelligent transportation systems. However, the limited vision range and the uncertain model parameters of an AUV make it difficult to fulfill this requirement. This study focuses on a binocular-vision-based motion planning issue for an AUV. First, we develop an intelligent AUV system that mainly comprises binocular cameras for patrolling the target, a localization unit for acquiring the position information, and an acoustic modem for communicating with buoys. Accordingly, the parallax angles from the AUV to target are used to construct an optimal motion planning problem. To solve the aforementioned problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning method called the improved twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient algorithm in order to minimize the reward function, such that the AUV can perpendicularly patrol the target with a fixed distance. The advantages of our solution are as follows: 1) the binocular-vision-based motion planning method can achieve a trade-off between motion stability and observation effectiveness; 2) the improved TD3 algorithm can accelerate the convergence compared to other algorithms, while it can simultaneously overcome the dependency on the model parameters of the AUV. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Compliance with traffic laws is a fundamental requirement for human drivers on the road, and autonomous vehicles must adhere to traffic laws as well. However, current autonomous vehicles prioritize safety and collision avoidance primarily in their decision-making and planning, which will lead to misunderstandings and distrust from human drivers and may even result in accidents in mixed traffic flow. Therefore, ensuring the compliance of the autonomous driving decision-making system is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and promoting the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology. To this end, the paper proposes a trigger-based layered compliance decision-making framework. This framework utilizes the decision intent at the highest level as a signal to activate an online violation monitor that identifies the type of violation committed by the vehicle. Then, a four-layer architecture for compliance decision-making is employed to generate compliant trajectories. Using this system, autonomous vehicles can detect and correct potential violations in real-time, thereby enhancing safety and building public confidence in autonomous driving technology. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the DJI AD4CHE highway dataset under four typical highway scenarios: speed limit, following distance, overtaking, and lane-changing. The results indicate that the proposed method increases the vehicle&#39;s overall compliance rate from 13.85% to 84.46%, reduces the proportion of active violations to 0%, and only slightly decreases the vehicle&#39;s traffic efficiency by 2.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an extremum seeking-based algorithm using fuzzy logic for maximizing the braking friction force in anti-lock brake systems (ABSs) without relying on vehicle speed information and slip ratio dynamics. Many current ABSs algorithms utilize slip ratio as a control parameter. If the slip ratio is inaccurately measured, the braking performance of the ABSs may not be optimal. To address this, we propose a method to achieve maximum friction force by designing a reference generator that generates the control inputs for the ABSs without requiring slip ratio information. We design an extended state observer that can estimate the braking friction force and braking friction coefficient. Based on the estimated friction force, the desired wheel cylinder pressure (WCP), which is the control input of the hydraulic brake system, is generated to converge to the maximum friction force using the extremum seeking control algorithm. To achieve improved braking performance, the initial desired WCP is calculated using fuzzy logic for quick convergence to the optimal region. The proposed method is experimentally validated using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation, which includes components such as MATLAB/Simulink, CarSim, SCALEXIO real-time system, and a hydraulic brake system.},

Various research efforts based on deep learning or handcrafted methods are currently underway to improve the place recognition performance. However, deep learning-based approaches pose certain challenges compared to handcrafted methods such as being less interpretable and often requiring extensive training time. In this paper, we propose a handcrafted method-based efficient feature extraction method for place recognition and point registration that aims to overcome these challenges while achieving high performance. The proposed method involves extracting robust feature points, generating powerful descriptors, and achieving performance levels similar to deep learning methods, while ensuring algorithmic versatility. Validation results using the KITTI dataset are also included in the paper, demonstrating exceptional performance even in demanding scenarios involving rotated loops. The results show an average loop closure accuracy of 95% or better, and an average pose estimation accuracy of 0.1 meters for translation and 0.15 degrees for rotation.},

With the maturity of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft technology, decision-makers have started to look upward to the low-altitude airspace. This blue space has the potential to reshape the transportation system and shorten the average travel time in daily life. To explore this emerging area, we held a Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustain- ability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL), and this letter summarizes the outcomes of our discussion. Here, we first pinpoint the pain issues of conventional transportation. Then, we present the emerging low-altitude airspace transportation option, followed by a discussion on how such a new transportation option can integrate with the conventional ground-based transportation system.

This task entails the process of accurately matching and identifying persons across several camera views that do not overlap with one another. This is of utmost importance to video surveillance, public safety, and person-tracking applications. However, vision-related difficulties, such as variations in appearance, occlusions, viewpoint changes, cloth changes, scalability, limited robustness to environmental factors, and lack of generalizations, still hinder the development of reliable person re-ID methods. There are few approaches have been developed based on these difficulties relied on traditional deep-learning techniques. Nevertheless, recent advancements of transformer-based methods, have gained widespread adoption in various domains owing to their unique architectural properties. Recently, few transformer-based person re-ID methods have developed based on these difficulties and achieved good results. To develop reliable solutions for person re-ID, a comprehensive analysis of transformer-based methods is necessary. However, there are few studies that consider transformer-based techniques for further investigation. This review proposes recent literature on transformer-based approaches, examining their effectiveness, advantages, and potential challenges. This review is the first of its kind to provide insights into the revolutionary transformer-based methodologies used to tackle many obstacles in person re-ID, providing a forward-thinking outlook on current research and potentially guiding the creation of viable applications in real-world scenarios. The main objective is to provide a useful resource for academics and practitioners engaged in person re-ID.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the electrical and/or electronic (E/E) architecture of vehicles has evolved significantly, driven by the demand for increased computational power to support safety-critical applications and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) functionalities. This evolution has led to the adoption of centralized architectures with high-performance computing units. These architectures also require high-bandwidth and deterministic communication protocols to handle numerous sensors and actuators, especially in mixed-criticality systems. However, configuring and integrating essential applications into a vehicle&#39;s E/E architecture while meeting safety requirements, guaranteeing reliable communication, and considering optimization objectives are time-consuming, complex, and error-prone tasks. This article presents a novel model-based framework, called E/E Designer , to facilitate the synthesis of a car&#39;s E/E architecture supporting automotive embedded systems modeling. The framework automates mapping of software components to hardware elements and computes schedules for application threads. It establishes network message routing and schedules communication tasks within the car&#39;s topology while addressing safety requirements such as redundancy. The E/E Designer also optimizes the system model using multi-objective optimization, and utilizes a single-step approach to solve mixed-integer programming (MIP) constraints in order to reduce the solving time and consider the relations among various constraints. We use an experimental setup to investigate the framework&#39;s performance through design-time and run-time evaluations. The results of our design-time experiments indicate that our formulations can scale to systems of reasonable size. During our run-time evaluations, we observed no timing deadline violations after deploying the design-time solutions on the experimental setup.},

They provide very high temporal resolution and dynamic range, which can eliminate motion blur and improve detection performance at night. However, event-based images lack color and texture compared to images from a conventional RGB camera. Considering that, data fusion between event-based and conventional cameras can combine the strengths of both modalities. For this purpose, extrinsic calibration is necessary. To the best of our knowledge, no targetless calibration between event-based and RGB cameras can handle multiple moving objects, nor does data fusion optimized for the domain of roadside ITS exist. Furthermore, synchronized event-based and RGB camera datasets considering roadside perspective are not yet published. To fill these research gaps, based on our previous work, we extended our targetless calibration approach with clustering methods to handle multiple moving objects. Furthermore, we developed an Early Fusion, Simple Late Fusion, and a novel Spatiotemporal Late Fusion method. Lastly, we published the TUMTraf Event Dataset, which contains more than 4,111 synchronized event-based and RGB images with 50,496 labeled 2D boxes. During our extensive experiments, we verified the effectiveness of our calibration method with multiple moving objects. Furthermore, compared to a single RGB camera, we increased the detection performance of up to +9% mAP in the day and up to +13% mAP during the challenging night with our presented event-based sensor fusion methods.},

Leveraging a unique mesh representation, RoMe ensures that the reconstructed road surfaces are accurate and seamlessly aligned with semantics. To address challenges in computational efficiency, we propose a waypoint sampling strategy, enabling RoMe to reconstruct vast environments by focusing on sub-areas and subsequently merging them. Furthermore, we incorporate an extrinsic optimization module to enhance the robustness against inaccuracies in extrinsic calibration. Our extensive evaluations of both public datasets and wild data underscore RoMe&#39;s superiority in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness. For instance, it costs only 2 GPU hours to recover a road surface of $600\times 600$ square meters from thousands of images. Notably, RoMe&#39;s capability extends beyond mere reconstruction, offering significant value for auto-labeling tasks in autonomous driving applications.},

  abstract     = {The recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks have shown significant promise in the domain of road scene parsing. Nevertheless, the existing works focus primarily on freespace detection, with little attention given to hazardous road defects that could compromise both driving safety and comfort. In this article, we introduce RoadFormer, a novel Transformer-based data-fusion network developed for road scene parsing. RoadFormer utilizes a duplex encoder architecture to extract heterogeneous features from both RGB images and surface normal information. The encoded features are subsequently fed into a novel heterogeneous feature synergy block for effective feature fusion and recalibration. The pixel decoder then learns multi-scale long-range dependencies from the fused and recalibrated heterogeneous features, which are subsequently processed by a Transformer decoder to produce the final semantic prediction. Additionally, we release SYN-UDTIRI, the first large-scale road scene parsing dataset that contains over 10,407 RGB images, dense depth images, and the corresponding pixel-level annotations for both freespace and road defects of different shapes and sizes. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on our SYN-UDTIRI dataset, as well as on three public datasets, including KITTI road, CityScapes, and ORFD, demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms all other state-of-the-art networks for road scene parsing. Specifically, RoadFormer ranks first on the KITTI road benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Current perception models in autonomous driving heavily rely on large-scale labelled 3D data, which is both costly and time-consuming to annotate. This work proposes a solution to reduce the dependence on labelled 3D training data by leveraging pre-training on large-scale unlabeled outdoor LiDAR point clouds using masked autoencoders (MAE). While existing masked point autoencoding methods mainly focus on small-scale indoor point clouds or pillar-based large-scale outdoor LiDAR data, our approach introduces a new self-supervised masked occupancy pre-training method called Occupancy-MAE, specifically designed for voxel-based large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds. Occupancy-MAE takes advantage of the gradually sparse voxel occupancy structure of outdoor LiDAR point clouds and incorporates a range-aware random masking strategy and a pretext task of occupancy prediction. By randomly masking voxels based on their distance to the LiDAR and predicting the masked occupancy structure of the entire 3D surrounding scene, Occupancy-MAE encourages the extraction of high-level semantic information to reconstruct the masked voxel using only a small number of visible voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Occupancy-MAE across several downstream tasks. For 3D object detection, Occupancy-MAE reduces the labelled data required for car detection on the KITTI dataset by half and improves small object detection by approximately 2% in AP on the Waymo dataset. For 3D semantic segmentation, Occupancy-MAE outperforms training from scratch by around 2% in mIoU. For multi-object tracking, Occupancy-MAE enhances training from scratch by approximately 1% in terms of AMOTA and AMOTP.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) sixth generation (6G)-vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network having a FD base station (BS) simultaneously communicating with an uplink (UL) and a downlink (DL) mobile vehicles with the aid of two RISs, one for each link. We provide an analytical framework to investigate the performance of this network and, consequently, formulate an optimization problem to jointly optimize the phase shift matrices at both the RISs that maximize the achievable sum-rate. Thereafter, due to the non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a low complexity proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that solves the problem in continuous action spaces by reducing the overall training overhead and provides optimum values of phase-shift matrix at each RIS. Further, we extend the analysis considering multiple transmit and receive antennas at the BS that simultaneously serves multiple UL and DL vehicles. We present exhaustive simulations-based graphical results to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm compared to deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and successive refinement (SR)-based solutions. Accordingly, we demonstrate the dominance of the considered FD system over its half-duplex (HD) counterpart. We also discuss the impact of the number of elements at each RIS, each vehicle&#39;s velocity and their distance from the RIS and the BS on the performance of the respective links. Moreover, we also highlight the impact of imperfect self-interference cancellation and discuss the trade-off between the UL and DL performances due to this imperfection.},

Ongoing research focuses on these models to further improve scene perception and decision-making, aiming to develop adaptive systems for robot navigation and autonomous driving.

To enhance the accuracy of the global model while considering the mobility characteristics of vehicles, we leverage an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) algorithm. The problem of optimal resource allocation is formulated to achieve the best allocation of frequency, computation, and caching resources while complying with the delay restrictions. To solve the non-convex problem, a multi-agent actor-critic type deep reinforcement learning algorithm called DMAAC algorithm is introduced. Additionally, a cooperative caching scheme based on the AFL framework called Co-Ca is proposed, utilizing a Dueling Deep-Q-Network (DDQN) to predict frequently accessed contents and cache them efficiently.

The DMS employs a combination of infrared sensors and a pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm with advanced facial recognition capabilities. It aims to monitor and control the driver&#39;s distraction and drowsiness level during daytime and nighttime driving conditions by accurately detecting head pose and eye status. If the system detects the driver is drowsy or distracted from the road, a warning system will be activated by sending an electrical signal to the aforementioned car SECU. The designed SECU initiates a car seat vibration and triggers an audible signal to alert the driver of a dangerous situation by managing the seat movement process and protection features. It provides the basic drive and control of the seat motor drivers and position sensors. The most important consideration of this SECU is meeting the following requirements: real-time control of various motors, fast processing speed, low power, low heat dissipation, low quiescent current, and low Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). The two systems were integrated into a single compact device that includes a night vision camera mounted on the steering column to record data without obstructing the driver&#39;s view. The system has high precision at a maximum detection rate of 45 Frames Per Second (FPS) in real-time. Furthermore, the system is robust under actual driving conditions without being affected by the time of day, facial expressions, or eye occlusions.},

  abstract     = {Four-dimensional (4D) radar–visual odometry (4DRVO) integrates complementary information from 4D radar and cameras, making it an attractive solution for achieving accurate and robust pose estimation. However, 4DRVO may exhibit significant tracking errors owing to three main factors: 1) sparsity of 4D radar point clouds; 2) inaccurate data association and insufficient feature interaction between the 4D radar and camera; and 3) disturbances caused by dynamic objects in the environment, affecting odometry estimation. In this paper, we present 4DRVO-Net, which is a method for 4D radar–visual odometry. This method leverages the feature pyramid, pose warping, and cost volume (PWC) network architecture to progressively estimate and refine poses. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature extraction network called Radar-PointNet++ that fully considers rich 4D radar point information, enabling fine-grained learning for sparse 4D radar point clouds. To effectively integrate the two modalities, we design an adaptive 4D radar–camera fusion module (A-RCFM) that automatically selects image features based on 4D radar point features, facilitating multi-scale cross-modal feature interaction and adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we introduce a velocity-guided point-confidence estimation module to measure local motion patterns, reduce the influence of dynamic objects and outliers, and provide continuous updates during pose refinement. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our method and the effectiveness of each module design on both the VoD and in-house datasets. Our method outperforms all learning-based and geometry-based methods for most sequences in the VoD dataset. Furthermore, it has exhibited promising performance that closely approaches that of the 64-beam LiDAR odometry results of A-LOAM without mapping optimization.},

Despite recent progresses in developing highly accurate object detectors based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they still remain prone to detection errors, which can lead to fatal consequences in safety-critical applications such as ADS. An effective remedy to this problem is to equip the system with run-time monitoring, named as introspection in the context of autonomous systems. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel introspection solution, which operates at the frame level for DNN-based 2D object detection and leverages neural network activation patterns. The proposed approach pre-processes the neural activation patterns of the object detector&#39;s backbone using several different modes. To provide extensive comparative analysis and fair comparison, we also adapt and implement several state-of-the-art (SOTA) introspection mechanisms for error detection in 2D object detection, using one-stage and two-stage object detectors evaluated on KITTI and BDD datasets. We compare the performance of the proposed solution in terms of error detection, adaptability to dataset shift, and, computational and memory resource requirements. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed introspection solution outperforms SOTA methods, achieving an absolute reduction in the missed error ratio of 9% to 17% in the BDD dataset.},

We design an innovative neural network (NN) structure with two independent encoders and an attention-based decoder to predict the trajectory sequence. The loss function accounts for discrepancies from both the physical car-following model and the NN predictions. Numerical experiments are conducted using simulated and real world (i.e., NGSIM) datasets under different data noise levels with varying weights between the learning loss and the model loss. Testing results show the proposed approach outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines under real and high noise levels. The optimal integrating weight between the model and learning component is significantly influenced by data quality, which affects both prediction accuracy and safety metrics.},

In the method, we iteratively refine the parameters of a ground plane model and identify regions imaged by a LiDAR as traversable and non-traversable. The method excels in delivering rapid, high-precision obstacle detection, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method addresses the need to distinguish between surfaces with varying traversability, such as vegetation or unpaved roads, depending on the specific application. To achieve this, we integrate a shallow neural network, which operates on features extracted from the ground model. This enhancement not only boosts performance but also maintains real-time efficiency, without the need for GPUs. The method is rigorously evaluated using the SemanticKitti dataset and its practicality is showcased through real-world experiments with an urban last-mile delivery autonomous robot.},

A safety-critical parallel control architecture is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of MASSs. Specifically, an artificial MASS system is constructed based on a data-driven learning predictor where real-time and historical navigation data are both utilized to achieve the estimation of the unknown weights of Taylor polynomials and Fourier series. Then, a parallel trajectory tracking control law is designed based on the artificial system such that the MASS is capable of track the reference trajectory positively. Finally, integral control barrier functions are employed to encode input and safety constraints. A safety optimization signal is augmented to the designed parallel control law to achieve the collision avoidance of all ocean obstacles. Based on the stability and safety analyses, the tracking errors of the actual MASS system are verified to be uniformly ultimately bounded and the MASS system is safe. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the designed safety-critical parallel trajectory tracking control scheme for the MASS.},

Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to learn egomotion and depth from monocular images in a self-supervised manner, without requiring highly precise labels to train the networks. However, monocular vision methods suffer from a limitation known as scale-ambiguity, which restricts their application when absolute-scale is necessary. To address this, we propose SelfOdom, a self-supervised dual-network framework that can robustly and consistently learn and generate pose and depth estimates in global scale from monocular images. In particular, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy that enables the metric scale to be recovered in a two-stage process. Furthermore, SelfOdom is flexible and can incorporate inertial data with images, which improves its robustness in challenging scenarios, using an attention-based fusion module. Our model excels in both normal and challenging lighting conditions, including difficult night scenes. Extensive experiments on public datasets have demonstrated that SelfOdom outperforms representative traditional and learning-based VO and VIO models.},

This study proposes a decision-making framework that takes motion prediction into account while considering predicted motion uncertainty. First, a multi-modal trajectory prediction method is introduced by combining the motion trend of the ego vehicle to reduce trajectory uncertainty. Then a two-dimensional dynamic risk assessment approach based on the Gaussian distribution is developed to quantify potential collision risk by analyzing occupancy relationship in space-time. Additionally, elementary motion patterns of automated driving in dynamic traffic environments are analyzed, and a decision-making method integrating finite state machines and the Markov decision process is established. Taking into account future motion uncertainty, it can dynamically adjust the ego vehicle&#39;s driving state in advance to ensure driving safety. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework is verified under different driving scenarios extracted from the NGSIM dataset, demonstrating satisfying results in avoiding potential driving risks.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud completion concentrates on completing geometric and topological shapes from incomplete 3D shapes. Nevertheless, the unordered nature of point clouds will hamper the generation of high-quality point clouds without predicting structured and topological information of the complete shapes and introducing noisy points. To effectively address the challenges posed by missing topology and noisy points, we introduce SPOFormer, a novel topology-aware model that utilizes surface-projection optimization in a progressive growth manner. SPOFormer consists of three distinct steps for completing the missing topology: (1) Missing Keypoints Prediction. A topology-aware transformer auto-encoder is integrated for missing keypoint prediction. (2) Skeleton Generation. The skeleton generation module produces a new type of representation named skeletons with the aid of keypoints predicted by topology-aware transformer auto-encoder and the partial input. (3) Progressively Growth. We design a progressive growth module to predict final output under Multi-scale Supervision and Surface-projection Optimization . Surface-projection Optimization is firstly devised for point cloud completion, aiming to enforce the generated points to align with the underlying object surface. Experimentally, SPOFormer model achieves an impressive Chamfer Distance- $\ell _{1}$ (CD) score of 8.11 on PCN dataset. Furthermore, it attains average CD- $\ell _{2}$ scores of 1.13, 1.14, and 1.70 on ShapeNet-55, ShapeNet-34, and ShapeNet-Unseen21 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) of 0.523 on the real-world KITTI dataset. These outstanding qualitative and quantitative performances surpass previous approaches by a significant margin, firmly establishing new state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) has attracted much attention as it provides promising solutions to improve traffic performance in many scenarios, especially unsignalized intersections. However, as for unsignalized intersections where both CAV and Human-driven Vehicle (HDV) exist, to reduce the impact of HDV uncertain behaviors, existing related research tend to simplify the scenario or HDV behavior characteristics at unsignalized intersections, or ensuring passing safety without collaborative decision-making on traffic efficiency optimizations. To address these problems, this paper presents a method of reservation-prioritization-based mixed-traffic cooperative control at unsignalized intersections. Firstly, reservation rights of CAVs are prioritized by solving minimization problems, to optimize the reservation order of CAV on the behalf of traffic efficiency. Secondly, a reservation and speed planning mechanism considering HDV behaviors is designed, which develops and re-decides CAV&#39;s reservation result based on HDV free-driving behavior, and plans speed for CAVs based on their reservation results by solving constrained nonlinear programming problems. The proposed method is evaluated under different traffic volumes and CAV penetration rates on SUMO platform. Results show that the proposed reservation-prioritization-based method gains higher intersection throughput and averaged velocity under all scenarios, including a maximum throughput improvement rate of 17.77% and a maximum averaged velocity improvement rate of 66.37% compared with the comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {Simulators play a crucial role in autonomous driving, offering significant time, cost, and labor savings. Over the past few years, the number of simulators for autonomous driving has grown substantially. However, there is a growing concern about the validity of algorithms developed and evaluated in simulators, indicating a need for a thorough analysis of the development status of the simulators. To address existing gaps in research, this paper undertakes a comprehensive review of the history of simulators, proposes a utility-based taxonomy, and investigates the critical issues within open-source simulators. Analysis of the past thirty years&#39; development trajectory reveals a trend characterized by an increase in open-source simulators and an expansion of their functionality scope. The categorization of simulators based on feature functionalities delineates five primary classes: traffic flow, sensory data, driving policy, vehicle dynamics, and comprehensive simulators. Furthermore, the paper identifies critical unresolved issues in open-source simulators, including concerns regarding the fidelity of sensory data, representation of traffic scenarios, and accuracy in vehicle dynamics simulation, all of which have the potential to undermine experimental confidence. Additionally, challenges in data format inconsistency, labor-intensive map construction processes, sluggish step updating, and insufficient support for Hardware-In-the-Loop testing are discussed as hindrances to experimental efficiency. In light of these findings, the survey furnishes task-oriented recommendations to aid in the selection of simulators, taking into account factors such as accessibility, maintenance status, and quality, while highlighting the inherent limitations of existing open-source simulators in validating algorithms and facilitating real-world experimentation.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of autonomous racing among teams of cooperative agents that are subject to realistic racing rules. Our work extends previous research on hierarchical control in head-to-head autonomous racing by considering a generalized version of the problem while maintaining the two-level hierarchical control structure. A high-level tactical planner constructs a discrete game that encodes the complex rules using simplified dynamics to produce a sequence of target waypoints. The low-level path planner uses these waypoints as a reference trajectory and computes high-resolution control inputs by solving a simplified formulation of a racing game with a simplified representation of the realistic racing rules. We explore two approaches for the low-level path planner: training a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policy and solving a linear-quadratic Nash game (LQNG) approximation. We evaluate our controllers on simple and complex tracks against three baselines: an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed racing line, and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line.

  abstract     = {In modern vehicles, there are hundreds of sensors, and many of them are safety-critical, which means a malfunction in their operation can cause catastrophic consequences. The conventional approach for the fault tolerance of these sensors is to use redundant sensors, which inevitably increases costs and overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a new perspective for redundant sensors, which we refer to as cyber-approximate sensors. The idea is that instead of relying solely on physical redundancy, we devise sensors favoring existing cyber facilities to create redundancy. Furthermore, recognizing that the redundant sensors do not need to be as accurate as the primary ones, we exploit an approximation-based model that incurs low overhead. To this end, our sensors employ inherent dependencies among vehicle sensors in two steps: i) identifying related dependencies and ii) designing a regression model. As a case study, we applied the cyber redundancy approach to a fuel control system and conducted fault injection experiments using the Hardware-in-the-Loop platform to analyze the fault tolerance. Since the performability metric, unlike reliability, can consider performance degradation, we employed the performability metric to evaluate fault tolerance. Indeed, reliability follows a binary nature, where a system is either correct or failed. However, vehicle sensors can exhibit varying degrees of functionality between perfect operation and complete failure. They might experience partial degradation, which can still be acceptable. Our experiments show that the proposed cyber redundancy approach not only reduces high-cost physical overhead (by roughly 50%) but also enhances performability (by approximately 7%).},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory tracking is unrealistic in real-world scenarios, however, which is commonly assumed to facilitate motion planning algorithm design. In this paper, a safe and reliable motion planning and control framework is proposed to handle the tracking errors caused by inaccurate tracking by coordinating the motion planning layer and controller. Specifically, motion space is divided into safe regions and risky regions by designing the movement restraint size dependent on tracking error to construct the repulsive potential field. The collision-free waypoint set can then be obtained by combining global search and the proposed waypoint set filtering method. The planned trajectory is fitted by an optimization-based approach which minimizes the acceleration of the reference trajectory. Then, the planned trajectory is checked and modified by the designed anti-collision modification to ensure safety. Using invertible transformation and adaptive compensation allows the transient trajectory tracking errors to be limited within the designed region even with actuator faults. Because tracking error is considered and margined at the planning level, safety and reliability can be guaranteed by the coordination between the planning and control levels under inaccurate tracking and actuator faults. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed motion planning and control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

Based on a low-frequency learning technique, a fuzzy predictor is presented to approximate the unknown vehicle kinematics induced by uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances. By decoupling the cooperative target encircling into an encircling task and a spacing task, an encircling control law and a spacing control law are designed based on fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for achieving the private control objective of each ASV. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is proven via cascade analysis.

  abstract     = {Data augmentation is an effective approach to enhance generalization of object tracking models, which has been widely applied into intelligent transportation to handle the challenging factors, such as lighting changes from day to night. However, current object tracking methods primarily employ pixel-level data augmentation techniques. These techniques only generate a limited number of samples with some fixed styles, making them difficult to cope with the complex scenario changes in intelligent transportation. To this end, we propose a learnable data augmentation approach for object tracking that is able to continuously augment the image amplitude features via a diffusion model, yielding numerous style-rich image feature representations. Specifically, we first employ fast Fourier transform (FFT) to decompose the spatial domain features into frequency domain features, which consist of phase components and amplitude components. The phase components encode the semantic information while the amplitude components encode the scene-style information. Especially, to generate diverse scene style features, we introduce a learnable diffusion model. During the training phase, we gradually introduce corresponding perturbation noise to the magnitude features and then use a U-Net network to progressively remove noise from the normal distribution variables. This allows us to learn the data distribution of the target and capture its data semantic structural information. By continuously adding noise to and denoising amplitude information, we enhance the tracker&#39;s ability to handle complex and style-rich scenes. Experiments show that the proposed method obtains the best generalization and tracking performance on multiple public datasets.},

Data-driven microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving testing due to 1) availability of high-fidelity traffic data; 2) its advantages of enabling large-scale testing and scenario reproducibility; and 3) its potential in reactive and realistic traffic simulation. However, a comprehensive review of this topic is currently lacking. This paper aims to fill this gap by summarizing relevant studies. The primary objective of this paper is to review current research efforts and provide a futuristic perspective that will benefit future developments in the field. It introduces the general issues of data-driven traffic simulation and outlines key concepts and terms. After overviewing traffic simulation, various datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used are reviewed. The paper then offers a comprehensive evaluation of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, deep generative and deep learning methods, summarizing each and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages in detail.

Many semantic segmentation networks based on bilateral architecture have been proven effective. However, semantic segmentation networks based on this architecture has the risk of pixel classification errors and small objects being overwhelmed. In this paper, we solve the problem by proposing a novel three-branch architecture network called LCFNets. Compared to existing bilateral architecture, LCFNets introduce compensation branch for the first time to preserve the features of original images. Through two efficient modules, Lightweight Detail Guidance Fusion Module (L-DGF) and Lightweight Semantic Guidance Fusion Module (L-SGF), detail and semantic branches are allowed to selectively extract features from this branch. To balance the three-branch features and guide them to fuse effectively, a novel aggregation layer is designed. Depth-wise Convolution Pyramid Pooling module (DCPP) and Total Guidance Fusion Module (TGF) enable the aggregation layer to extract the global receptive field and realize multi-branch aggregation with fewer calculation complexity. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets have shown that our family of LCFNets provide a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. With the full resolution input and no ImageNet pre-training, LCFNet-slim achieves 76.86% mIoU at 114.36 FPS and LCFNet achieves 77.96% mIoU at 92.37 FPS on Cityscapes. On the other hand, LCFNet-super achieves 79.10% mIoU at 47.46 FPS.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative perception can significantly improve the perception performance of autonomous vehicles beyond the limited perception ability of individual vehicles by exchanging information with neighbor agents through V2X communication. However, most existing work assume ideal communication among agents, ignoring the significant and common interruption issues caused by imperfect V2X communication, where cooperation agents can not receive cooperative messages successfully and thus fail to achieve cooperative perception, leading to safety risks. To fully reap the benefits of cooperative perception in practice, we propose V2X communication INterruption-aware COoperative Perception (V2X-INCOP), a cooperative perception system robust to communication interruption for V2X communication-aided autonomous driving, which leverages historical cooperation information to recover missing information due to the interruptions and alleviate the impact of the interruption issue. To achieve comprehensive recovery, we design a communication-adaptive multi-scale spatial-temporal prediction model to extract multi-scale spatial-temporal features based on V2X communication conditions and capture the most significant information for the prediction of the missing information. To further improve recovery performance, we adopt a knowledge distillation framework to give explicit and direct supervision to the prediction model and a curriculum learning strategy to stabilize the training of the model. Experiments on three public cooperative perception datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in alleviating the impacts of communication interruption on cooperative perception. V2X-INCOP outperforms state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and has a cooperative perception gain up to 14.06%, 13.9%, and 12.07% over individual perception on average of different packet drop rates on OPV2V, V2X-Sim, and Dair-V2X datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of road negative obstacles (i.e., potholes and cracks) is important to the safety of autonomous driving. Although existing RGB-D fusion networks could achieve acceptable performance, most of them only conduct binary segmentation for negative obstacles, which does not distinguish potholes and cracks. Moreover, their performance is susceptible to depth noises, in which case the fluctuations of depth data caused by the noises may make the networks mistakenly treat the area as a negative obstacle. To provide a solution to the above issues, we design a novel RGB-D semantic segmentation network with dual semantic-feature complementary fusion for road negative obstacle segmentation. We also re-label an RGB-D dataset for this task, which distinguishes road potholes and cracks as two different classes. Experimental results show that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing well-known networks.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning methods have shown the ability to solve challenging scenarios in unmanned systems. However, solving long-time decision-making sequences in a highly complex environment, such as continuous lane change and overtaking in dense scenarios, remains challenging. Although existing unmanned vehicle systems have made considerable progress, minimizing driving risk is the first consideration. Risk-aware reinforcement learning is crucial for addressing potential driving risks. However, the variability of the risks posed by several risk sources is not considered by existing reinforcement learning algorithms applied in unmanned vehicles. Based on the above analysis, this study proposes a risk-aware reinforcement learning method with driving task decomposition to minimize the risk of various sources. Specifically, risk potential fields are constructed and combined with reinforcement learning to decompose the driving task. The proposed reinforcement learning framework uses different risk-branching networks to learn the driving task. Furthermore, a low-risk episodic sampling augmentation method for different risk branches is proposed to solve the shortage of high-quality samples and further improve sampling efficiency. Also, an intervention training strategy is employed wherein the artificial potential field (APF) is combined with reinforcement learning to speed up training and further ensure safety. Finally, the complete intervention risk classification twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient-task decompose (IDRCTD3-TD) algorithm is proposed. Two scenarios with different difficulties are designed to validate the superiority of this framework. Results show that the proposed framework has remarkable improvements in performance.},

Incorporating human decision-making insights enables AVs to more effectively anticipate the potential actions of other vehicles, significantly improving prediction accuracy and responsiveness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction (HLTP) model, which adopts a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework inspired by human cognitive processes. The HLTP model incorporates a sophisticated teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The “teacher” model, equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the visual processing of the human brain, particularly the functions of the occipital and temporal lobes. The “student” model focuses on real-time interaction and decision-making, drawing parallels to prefrontal and parietal cortex functions. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation to changing driving scenarios, capturing essential perceptual cues for accurate prediction. Evaluated using the Macao Connected and Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset, along with the NGSIM and HighD benchmarks, HLTP demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, particularly in challenging environments with incomplete data.},

This research also explores how adhering strictly to one constraint may compromise other constraints. A comprehensive control strategy using MPC is adopted to formulate eco-driving as nonlinear programming and to achieve a realistic and optimal solution. The proposed strategy has successfully achieved eco-driving along with satisfying all the conflicting constraints in uncertain environmental conditions. Furthermore, results are compared with PMP to validate the optimal solution. SoH analysis indicates that the inclusion of battery-related constraints improves the battery&#39;s health.

Even though, the literature highlights the growing security threats of this technology, where attackers can easily compromise the existing authentication and data preservation schemes.

  abstract     = {In-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles (IWM-EVs) provide more potential to enhance vehicle stability performance. However, traditional stability control relies on the current status fed back by sensors for stability judgment and control, only taking effect after the vehicle has already become unstable. In response to this issue, this paper proposes a pre-stability control strategy based on a hybrid dynamic state prediction method to predict dangerous driving conditions and intervene in vehicle stability control in advance. First, a driver-vehicle model is established to characterize the driver&#39;s driving intention and obtain the vehicle&#39;s ideal motion responses. Then, the methodology for implementing vehicle pre-stability control is introduced, which mainly includes sideslip angle estimation utilizing the extended Kalman filter, a hybrid dynamic state prediction approach based on vehicle model and data trends, and a vehicle pre-stability judgment method. Subsequently, a vehicle hierarchical controller is designed to achieve pre-stability control. The upper-level controller focuses on calculating the required additional yaw moment, and the lower-level controller aims to optimize torque distribution among the four wheels. Finally, the proposed pre-stability control strategy is validated by the hardware-in-the-loop test bench. The results show that the proposed control strategy can intervene in dangerous driving conditions in advance, and its mean errors of the yaw rate and sideslip angle are reduced by over 17.1% and 23.5%, respectively, compared with the traditional method, which significantly enhances vehicle stability and driving safety.},

  abstract     = {The escalating density of airspace has led to sharply increased conflicts between aircraft. Efficient and scalable conflict resolution methods are crucial to mitigate collision risks. Existing learning-based methods become less effective as the scale of aircraft increases due to their redundant information representations. In this paper, to accommodate the increased airspace density, a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) method is presented to efficiently learn deconfliction strategies. A time-evolving conflict graph is exploited to represent the local state of individual aircraft and the global spatiotemporal relationships between them. Equipped with the conflict graph, GRL can efficiently learn deconfliction strategies by selectively aggregating aircraft state information through a multi-head attention-boosted graph neural network. Furthermore, a temporal regularization mechanism is proposed to enhance learning stability in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on an OpenAI Gym-based flight simulator. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods, the results demonstrate that GRL can save much training time while achieving significantly better deconfliction strategies in terms of safety and efficiency metrics. In addition, GRL has a strong power of scalability and robustness with increasing aircraft scale.},

Firstly, the energy-efficient driving task is formulated as the optimal control problem (OCP) with multiple constraints under the model predictive control (MPC) scheme and is solved by using Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle. Then, considering the difference between the optimal and driver&#39;s action, and the real-time implementation of the control strategy, a novel energy-saving DAS is proposed, in which a quadratic form OCP is further formulated to find the optimal torque distribution. Furthermore, to achieve a better interaction between the system and the driver, a human machine interface (HMI) hardware is developed to provide drivers with visual and auditory prompts, meanwhile, the driver&#39;s demanding torque is adjusted dynamically for eco-driving. Finally, the energy-saving DAS is deployed on an EV, and on-road experiments demonstrate that the proposed system can help save an average of 5.19% energy compared to normal driving by improving the efficiency of the driving motor and the regenerative braking energy (RBE).},

However, since traditional monocular or binocular geolocalization methods are typically implemented by depth estimation or parallax computation, suffering from large errors when targets are far away, and thus hard to be directly applied to outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a visual servo-based global geolocalization system, namely VSG, which takes the target position information in the binocular camera images as the control signals, automatically solves the global positions according to the gimbal rotation angles. This system solves the problem of long-range static and dynamic target geolocalization (ranging from 220 m to 1200 m), and localizes the farthest target of 1223.8 m with only 3.5 $\%$ localization error. VSG also realizes full-process automation by combining the deep learning-based objection detection, and its localization performance has been proved by series of experiments. This system is the longest-range global geolocalization method with preferred accuracy reported so far, and can be deployed in different geomorphology with great robustness.},

  abstract     = {The substantial resource usage required to create ample scenarios for testing Autonomous Vehicles (AV) presents a bottleneck in their implementation. At present, research relies on sampling the driving behaviour of Surrounding Vehicles (SV) based on naturalistic datasets in simulation. However, these methods still generate huge amounts of scenarios, making it impossible to synthetically evaluate AV intelligence in a very small number of tests (especially in real-world situations). Simultaneously, the unknown distribution of critical scenarios leads to the problem that more critical scenarios cannot be accurately sampled. In this article, a novel optimization problem is described and a dynamic scenario sampling method is proposed to cover more critical scenarios with finite samples. First, the sampling space is constructed by extracting the behavioural model parameters of the SVs. Second, multiple rounds of sampling are carried out successively to learn the distribution of critical scenarios, which in turn gradually improves the coverage of the critical scenarios. To do this, in each round, we divide the sampling space into several subspaces using two-step sampling, sample the scenarios using Random Quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC), evaluate the criticality of the subspace, and then use the evaluation results to guide the selection of the sampling space for the next round. The purpose of RQMC is to uniformly sample in the critical subspace rather than Standard Monte Carlo (SMC). Experimental results show that our method can better narrow the gap with the distribution of critical scenarios and discover more critical scenarios when compared to the baseline method.},

By employing variation rates of controls, the developed deep-ETPC method is capable of indicating communication loss and comfortable driving indices in the reward, and then enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn comfortable ETC driving policies directly. Moreover, the communication loss, which reflects ETC, is integrated into the reward, so there is no need to additionally design/train triggering conditions, which can be considered a type of multi-tasking learning. Furthermore, an ETPC-oriented DDPG algorithm is developed to achieve the developed deep-ETPC method, making DDPG applicable to ETC.

  abstract     = {Teleoperation is increasingly used in the operation of delivery robots and is beginning to be utilized for certain autonomous vehicle intervention applications. This paper addresses the challenges in teleoperation of an autonomous vehicle due to latencies in wireless communication between the remote vehicle and the teleoperator station. Camera video images and Lidar data are typically delayed during wireless transmission but are critical for proper display of the remote vehicle&#39;s real-time road environment to the teleoperator. Data collected with experiments in this project show that a 0.5 second delay in real-time display makes it extremely difficult for the teleoperator to control the remote vehicle. This problem is addressed in the paper by using a predictive display (PD) system which provides intermediate updates of the remote vehicle&#39;s environment while waiting for actual camera images. The predictive display utilizes estimated positions of the ego vehicle and of other vehicles on the road computed using model-based extended Kalman filters. A crucial result presented in the paper is that vehicle motion models need to be inertial rather than relative and so tracking of other vehicles requires accurate localization of the ego vehicle itself. An experimental study using 5 human teleoperators is conducted to compare teleoperation performance with and without predictive display. A 0.5 second time-delay in camera images makes it impossible to control the vehicle to stay in its lane on curved roads, but the use of the developed predictive display system enables safe remote vehicle control with almost as accurate a performance as the delay-free case.},

Thus, this study proposes and formulates a new driving aggressiveness model after analyzing asymmetric interactions behaviors among vehicles with different types. Subsequently, aims to verify the capability of generating asymmetric interaction, the driving aggressiveness model is applied on lane-change decision-making and planning. Concretely, the aggressiveness-sensitive lanes-selection model is designed based on game theory, and the uncertainty-aware trajectory planning is developed by utilizing stochastic model predictive control (MPC) and the asymmetric driving aggressiveness. Finally, two naturalistic driving scenarios are utilized to verify the performance of the decision-making and planning model. The outcomes of simulations illustrate that the driving aggressiveness model introduces a novel perspective to assess the asymmetric driving threat.

  abstract     = {Decision-making for urban autonomous driving is challenging due to the stochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of road structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making schemes are promising to handle urban driving scenarios, they suffer from low sample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose the Scene-Rep Transformer to enhance RL decision-making capabilities through improved scene representation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation. Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model not only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors but also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is employed to distill future predictive information into the latent scene representation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training. The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as input the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer and generates decisions. The framework is validated in five challenging simulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested quantitatively by substantial improvements in data efficiency and performance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. Qualitative results reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor agents, enabling better decision-making and more diversified driving behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating visual cues to anticipate and describe future events holds significant promise for enhancing user-friendly early warning systems in emergency response scenarios. However, a notable limitation in existing video captioning techniques is their predominant focus on describing ongoing events within observed videos. The challenging task of predicting captions for unobserved videos based on observed visual cues remains largely unaddressed. In response to this gap, we introduce a novel neural network architecture termed the Anticipation Video Captioning Transformer, which is built upon the transformer architecture and comprises three essential modules. The first module serves as a video feature extractor, harnessing the capabilities of a video transformer to extract spatiotemporal features from the observed video data. The second module is a multimodal mask language model to learn the intricate correlations between video content and corresponding captions. The third module is a decoder, generating observed and anticipation video captions. In assessing the efficacy of our proposed method and its potential applicability in emergency scenarios, we have developed a specialized dataset dedicated to aerial refueling anticipation video captioning. Our experimental evaluations encompass a diverse range of qualitative and quantitative analyses, all of which consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in furnishing user-friendly anticipation captions. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in video captioning, extending its capabilities beyond merely describing the present state of affairs to encompass the anticipation of future events. This innovation can potentially enhance early warning systems and improve emergency response procedures.},

Most of the current literature on IBVS for moving targets often consider restrictive assumptions on the target dynamics that limits its generalizability for any arbitrary motion. We propose a model-free target velocity estimator augmented kinematic controller based on appropriately derived feature dynamics in a virtual image plane. We show how the inner-loop mismatch affects the kinematic controller performance through a comprehensive theoretical analysis based on the Lyapunov direct method. We prove that the system errors converge exponentially to an ultimate bound in general and asymptotically to zero for the purely translational and constant target motions and vanishing inner-loop mismatch. Extensive simulations, including model-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop settings, along with experimental validation in an outdoor environment, confirm the utility of the proposed visual servoing technique.},

  abstract     = {Digital twins (DTs) have driven major advancements across various industrial domains over the past two decades. With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, integrating DTs into vehicular platforms is anticipated to further revolutionize smart mobility systems. In this paper, a new smart mobility DT (SMDT) platform is proposed for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) over next-generation wireless networks. In particular, the proposed platform enables cloud services to leverage the abilities of DTs to promote the autonomous driving experience. To enhance traffic efficiency and road safety measures, a novel navigation system that exploits available DT information is designed. The SMDT platform and navigation system are implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and roadside units (RSUs), and emerging technologies, e.g., cloud and cellular V2X (C-V2X). In addition, proof-of-concept (PoC) experiments are conducted to validate system performance. The performance of SMDT is evaluated from two standpoints: (i) the rewards of the proposed navigation system on traffic efficiency and safety and, (ii) the latency and reliability of the SMDT platform. Our experimental results using SUMO-based large-scale traffic simulations show that the proposed SMDT can reduce the average travel time and the blocking probability due to unexpected traffic incidents. Furthermore, the results record a peak overall latency for DT modeling and route planning services to be 155.15 ms and 810.59 ms, respectively, which validates that our proposed design aligns with the 3GPP requirements for emerging V2X use cases and fulfills the targets of the proposed design.},

Previous surveys have covered dynamics models for standard autonomous vehicles or, alternatively, concentrated on planning and control methods in autonomous racing with vehicle dynamics models briefly mentioned.

Recognizing the vital role of vehicle dynamics modeling in an autonomous racecar&#39;s prediction, planning, and control modules, this survey seeks to ascertain to what degree the nominal full-scale racecar dynamics can be streamlined without sacrificing accuracy for simplicity. Furthermore, this survey provides essential guidance for organizers of virtual autonomous races, helping them choose vehicle dynamics models that meet the required level of precision. This paper begins with a review of previous surveys on vehicle dynamics modeling, highlighting their limitations in the context of autonomous racing. Following this, it investigates the existing dynamics models for autonomous racing vehicles, along with a comprehensive examination of the existing physical/virtual testing platforms.

The integrated framework with constraint adaptation resolves possible conflicts of the multi-actuated system for lateral stabilization, while trajectory tracking on various surface conditions.

To address this issue, Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) has been proposed to collect data from CPSS by harnessing the collective intelligence of a diverse workforce. Our first and second Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Crowdsensing Intelligence (DHW-CSI) have focused on principles and high-level processes of organizing and operating CSI, as well as the participants, methods, and stages involved in CSI. This perspective reports the outcomes of the latest DHW-CSI, focusing on Autonomous Crowdsensing (ACS) enabled by foundation intelligence and its associated technologies such as decentralized autonomous organizations and operations, large language models, and human-oriented operating systems. Specifically, we explain what ACS is and explore its distinctive features in comparison to traditional crowdsensing. Moreover, we present the “6A-goal” of ACS and propose potential avenues for future research.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a distributed fault-tolerant formation control scheme for a team of car-like vehicles with actuator faults. The proposed method includes a fault diagnostic scheme using a high-order sliding mode observer and a reconfigurable controller based on the super-twisting algorithm. The results showed that by the proposed controller, each vehicle can detect, diagnose, and accommodate actuator faults by itself. Two control strategies are proposed: 1) When a vehicle is exposed to a partial fault, the controller accommodates the fault and enables the vehicle to continue the mission with the rest of the team members in the formation. Furthermore, it allows healthy vehicles to re-adjust their motion and move in the way for compensating the reduced capability of the faulty vehicle with degraded performance in the formation mission; 2) In severe fault conditions, the proposed controller excludes the faulty vehicle and re-assigns its task to the rest of the healthy members to complete the mission. The re-assignment task for the team formation is formulated as an optimal assignment problem and is solved by the Simplex algorithm. The experimental tests have been conducted on the latest Quanser self-driving car (QCar) platform to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and ensure its capability to avoid accidents between team members.},

We leverage Pointcheval-Sanders (PS) signatures to design a privacy-preserving authentication protocol that supports user traceability and revocation of malicious users. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary data processor (DP) in our model to analyze VANET data with explicit and implicit linkability. The DP is capable of linking messages on the same or different topics, enabling minimal privacy disclosure during Big Data analysis. We provide a detailed proof and demonstrate that our scheme satisfies the required properties. Finally, performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {With the advent of intelligent and connected vehicle technology, the simultaneous optimization of speed trajectory and power management for autonomous hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has become a significant research hotspot to enhance energy efficiency further. Especially for off-road scenarios, restricted by complex road conditions, vehicle nonlinear dynamics, and different time scales between speed planning and power split optimization, finding these control variables in one optimal problem is quite challenging. Thus, this article proposes a bi-level optimal control strategy for autonomous HEV to reduce computational burden by separating simultaneous optimization into two subproblems. In the upper layer, a vehicle stability constraints system is designed with consideration of both external road characteristics and the vehicle&#39;s lateral stability to determine the longitudinal speed boundary to ensure the vehicle&#39;s driving safety in off-road scenarios. Then, speed planning is formulated as a MPC problem with time-varying constraints, and solved by roll optimization. In the bottom layer, an explicit MPC (EMPC) is developed to obtain explicit solutions to achieve real-time energy management. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method decreases equivalent fuel by 4.06% compared with ECMS, significantly improving computational efficiency with a slight sacrifice on fuel economy, compared with MPC and DP.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of active safety systems and advanced driver assistance systems has enhanced the control authority over the vehicle dynamics through specialized actuators, enabling, for instance, independent wheel torque control. During emergency situations, these systems step in to aid the driver by limiting vehicle response to a stable and controllable range of low longitudinal tire slips and slip angles. This approach makes vehicle behavior predictable and manageable for the average human driver; however, it is conservative in case of driving automation. In fact, past research has shown that exceeding the operational boundaries of conventional active safety systems enables trajectories that are otherwise unattainable. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for path tracking (PT), which integrates steering, front-to-total longitudinal tire force distribution, and direct yaw moment actuation, and can operate beyond the limit of handling, e.g., to induce drift, if this is beneficial to PT. Simulation results of emergency conditions in an intersection scenario highlight that the proposed solution provides significant safety improvements, when compared to the concurrent operation of PT algorithms and the current generation of vehicle stability controllers.},

However, existing conditional privacy protection schemes have limitations and do not consider authentication and location privacy leakage. Traditional public key infrastructure and identity-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols require the storage and management of extensive public key certificates and key escrow. Furthermore, the K-anonymity and cryptography-based IoV privacy-preserving schemes have high communication overhead and risks of leaking users&#39; privacy. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and privacy-secure blockchain and collaborative service-based conditional privacy-preserving (BCS-CPP) scheme for IoV, which utilizes a smart contract-based CPPA method to overcome the limitations of public key certificate management and key escrow, facilitating an efficient and privacy-secure location-based service. The proposed BCS-CPP scheme enjoys minor computational and communication overhead. It maintains a constant communication overhead as users increase when they initiate a location-based service query. Moreover, it has higher collaborative efficiency. The security analyses and experiments demonstrate that it outperforms existing loV conditional privacy protection schemes in terms of efficiency and security.},

However, OBUs or RSUs may be compromised, in other word, these existing schemes have their limitations to preserve vehicular identity privacy. Furthermore, in some schemes, the confidentiality of vehicular messages is not considered, clear-text vehicular messages may also disclose vehicular identity privacy. Therefore, we propose a secure and lightweight vehicular privacy preservation scheme for IoVs, in which fog servers use partial vehicular identity information to authenticate their legitimacy so as not to disclose vehicular identity privacy; lightweight and outsourcing decrypting attribute-based encryption methods are employed to achieve access control on sensitive vehicular messages and reduce resource-limited vehicular computation costs; moreover, an innovative conditional identity privacy preservation method is proposed to reveal the real identity of malicious vehicles without disclosing the real identity of honest vehicles even if there are some compromised fog servers or malicious vehicles.

To address the issues mentioned above, this article proposes a novel approach of utilizing structural lines to assist in monocular visual-inertial-wheel odometry, coupled with online optimization of IMU-wheel extrinsic optimization on $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ manifold. To compensate for the failure of simple point features in strong exposure scenarios, our system incorporates structural line measurements into a sliding-window pose estimator. Moreover, different movements have different observability effects on the extrinsic parameters of sensors. We consider the observability of the extrinsic parameters between IMU-odometers and introduce online optimization of these parameters to improve the robustness of the system. Compared with other VIO and VIWO methods based on point features, experimental results on KAIST&#39;s Complex Urban Dataset and campus dataset show that our method has better performance on accuracy and robustness.},

This article presents a computationally efficient adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach that can not only rapidly calculate optimal control actions but also iteratively update the approximated value function (AVF) according to the actual fuel and electricity consumption with limited computation resources. Exploiting the AVF, the engine on/off switch and torque split problems are solved by one-step lookahead approximation and Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP), respectively. To raise the training speed and reduce the memory space, the tabular value function (VF) is approximated by carefully selected piecewise polynomials via the parametric approximation. The advantages of the proposed EMS are threefold and verified by processor-in-the-loop (PIL) Monte Carlo simulations. First, the fuel efficiency of the proposed EMS is higher than that of an adaptive PMP and close to the theoretical optimum. Second, the new method can adapt to the changed driving conditions after a small number of learning iterations and thus has higher fuel efficiency than a non-adaptive dynamic programming (DP) controller. Third, the computation efficiencies of the proposed AVF and a tabular VF are compared. The concise data structure of the AVF enables faster convergence and saves at least 70% of onboard memory space without obviously increasing the average CPU utilization.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging cloud computing resources and previews in intelligent transportation systems to improve electric city buses (ECBs) energy system performance is an emerging topic. However, internet connectivity will expose the ECB to cyberattacks, which will cause service interruption and downstream financial implications. In this study, detection and protection systems are designed under a proposed architecture for ECBs with Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity to address the denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The analysis conducted in this article shows that the distributed DDoS attack is most crucial because it is easy to be launched and hard to be defended. By overwhelming traffics with spam, DDoS attacks can easily cut off the vehicle connection to cloud servers and disable all (compromised and surviving) ECBs that rely on vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. The simulation results indicate that, even though 99.9% of ECBs in the system are compromised and converted to attacking sources, with the proposed security systems in the cloud, the blocking probability between servers and surviving filed devices is kept below 28.08%. Besides, for a surviving field device protected by the proposed approach, harsh DDoS attacks only degrade the energy efficiency and battery life performance of the tested energy management system by 0.2288% when compared to the benchmark results.},

Despite breakthroughs in trajectory prediction technology in recent years, challenges remain in world state representation, social interaction modeling, real-time computing, and road agent heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose a new model that employs hierarchical convolutional networks and multi-task learning to predict agents&#39; trajectories. The model first achieves effective and unified representation of agent and scene context by rendering heterogeneous world states in a top-down multi-channel raster map. Based on this representation, we propose hierarchical convolutional networks to extract global interaction and local features of all agents simultaneously, enabling the model to predict multiple agents&#39; trajectories in real-time in a single forward inference. In addition, we specifically design multi-task learning branches with dynamic adaptive anchors to capture differences in behavioral patterns of heterogeneous agents, allowing a single model to accurately predict multimodal trajectories of multi-class agents. Extensive experiments on public nuScenes and Lyft datasets demonstrate top model performance. Importantly, our model is faster (2.2x) and more computationally stable than state-of-the-art models, making it well-suited for mass-produced self-driving systems that require both performance and computational efficiency.},

In the takeover process, we define the takeover behavior mode, which is the inherent mode of completing the takeover task, as the behavioral theoretical framework that drivers should follow when taking over. We conducted a driving simulation experiment to analyze driver takeover behavior in the fog zone, where non-driving-related tasks were external variables. First, we constructed the takeover behavior mode (situation awareness - decision and reaction - takeover performance). Second, we analyzed the characteristics of each stage and the correlation between each stage of the takeover behavior mode accordingly. The result shows that drivers’ performance in each stage differed significantly under different non-driving-related tasks. For example, their saccade and gaze duration were longer on the entertainment task than on the work task, and the driver prioritized the longitudinal stability after taking control of the automated vehicle. Results show that there is a correlation between different stages of takeover behavior mode. In this study, we propose the takeover behavior mode, aiming to help beginners and researchers in this field understand the driver takeover process more intuitively and provide behavioral theoretical support for subsequent studies. In addition, the takeover behavior mode can provide support for training drivers in real-world driving situations.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection plays an important role in the field of automatic driving. Conventional convolutional operations typically focus on local block-like region, while lane often span across multiple image regions as strip lines. How to make up for the limitations of ordinary convolution in extracting lane information and make the network focus on the strip lanes is a challenging problem. For this purpose, we propose an oblique convolution idea to effectively extract the information of the whole lane. Specifically, an Oblique Rotation Module (ORM) is proposed to rotate the lane feature map into a vertical orientation, enabling better lane positioning and recognition by using row anchors. Additionally, we introduce a Strip Spatial Attention Module (SSAM) to extract global features of the entire lane and employ deformable convolutions to adapt to curved lane lines. Finally, we restore the feature map using Anti-oblique Rotation Module (AORM) and obtain lane detection results through classification-based predictions. During training, we incorporate a multi-scale auxiliary classification loss to predict the presence of lane lines at different network levels, aiding the network in learning the structural information of lane lines. A large number of experiments on the lane detection benchmark dataset show that our method can achieve advanced performance, and we have achieved good results in public datasets. The accuracy on the Tusimple dataset is 96.50%, the F1 on the CULane dataset is 79.33%. Both results rank in the top 10 on the leaderboard, and the inference speed reaches 35 FPS.

In particular, a UAV works as an aerial secondary relay to assist in securing transmissions from a terrestrial secondary source to secondary users in the presence of terrestrial eavesdroppers by sharing the licensed wireless spectrum designated for terrestrial primary systems. The minimum average secrecy rate (MASR) of the secondary users is taken as the main criterion to evaluate the security of the system under the assumption that the location information of the eavesdroppers and successive interference cancellations are imperfect. To maximize MASR, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize key system parameters while keeping interference powers within tolerable limits. Since the total MASR problem is non-convex, the successive convex approximation technique is applied to find efficient approximate solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially improves the MASR of the system in comparison to benchmark schemes and the orthogonal multiple access system.},

  abstract     = {Modeling driving behavior plays a pivotal role in advancing the development of human-like autonomous driving. In light of this, this paper proposes a car-following behavior modeling method with sample-based deep inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL). Due to the challenges associated with feature extraction and the limited fitting capacity of linear functions, traditional IRL, which employs feature-based linear functions to represent reward functions, exhibits low modeling accuracy. Accordingly, DIRL leverages deep neural networks to represent reward functions. However, the requirement for reinforcement learning to determine the optimal policy for DIRL&#39;s reward function makes the training and inference processes computationally resource-intensive and inefficient. To address this issue, this paper proposes the sample-based DIRL. Through solution space discretization, sample-based DIRL streamlines the integration calculation of the partition function into a summation, resulting in improved computational efficiency. Specifically, it is a three-stage framework: sampling candidate trajectories, evaluating candidate trajectories, and selecting the trajectory with the highest reward. In order to evaluate DIRL at both the level of driving behavior and the reward function, the MPC-based virtual driver with the explicit reward function is utilized to collect driving data for training and assessing the convergence of the learned reward function. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can accurately model the car-following behavior, and acquire the driver&#39;s reward function from the driving data.},

Although, compared with the GNSS and loosely coupled integration, a tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration can improve the positioning reliability by using raw observations, it still suffers from external challenging environments such as the multipath effect. Therefore, the fault detection algorithm is a premise and guarantee to realize quality control of GNSS/INS integration. Inspired by the application of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm in GNSS fault detection, this article proposes a RANSAC-based fault detection and exclusion algorithm for single-difference tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration. Here, a between-receiver single-difference (BRSD) model was designed to prevent the consumption of GNSS observations and reduce the waste of effective parameters, and the global proportion statistics of faults were introduced into the typical RANSAC algorithm to further ensure detection reliability. In this study, the effect of the main parameters on the proposed detection algorithm was analyzed and verified by artificial cycle slips. Multiple filed tests, including typical urban scenarios, were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The comprehensive test results show that the north and east positioning accuracy in terms of cumulative distribution function (CDF, CDF = 95%) are improved by 45% and 42% over the tightly coupled mode without the proposed detection method.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles have the potential to impact traffic flow dynamics. To better understand the impacts of ACC vehicles on traffic flow, an accurate microscopic car-following model for ACC vehicles is essential. Most of the ACC car-following models utilize a continuous function to describe vehicle acceleration and braking, e.g., the optimal velocity relative velocity (OVRV) model. However, these models do not necessarily describe car-following behavior with sufficient accuracy. Recent studies have proposed switching models to better describe realistic ACC dynamics. However, they often fail to accurately capture the driving behavior around the switching points, where a vehicle switches between acceleration and deceleration. In this study, we develop a two-condition, continuous asymmetric car-following (TCACF) model to capture ACC driving behavior in a physically interpretable manner, while preserving numerical soundness. The proposed TCACF model and multiple other car-following models are calibrated based on a real-world ACC trajectory dataset. The results show that the TCACF model better describes the asymmetric driving behavior of ACC vehicles than any of the commonly used car-following models, especially at switching points. The results indicate that the TCACF model considerably increases model accuracy by up to 32.46% when compared with other switching models and by up to 36.98% when compared to commonly used car-following models. The TCACF model is expected to offer new insights into modeling and simulating emerging ACC car-following dynamics with a higher degree of accuracy and can be used in applications where correctly simulating acceleration behavior is important.},

  abstract     = {In the context of autonomous driving systems, SLAM and dynamic object tracking represent pivotal challenges. Autonomous driving scenarios frequently demand the simultaneous acquisition of ego-pose and comprehensive motion information from the surrounding environment to enhance decision-making and scene comprehension.Given the inherent interdependence between these two challenges, a viable approach is to integrate SLAM and object tracking into an interconnected system referred to as SLAMMOT. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions rely on a single motion model for object tracking, which may inadequately capture complicated dynamics of real-world motions. In practice, object motion patterns can change from time to time, not conforming neatly to a single model. To handle existing challenges, this paper proposes the IMM-SLAMMOT, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-based SLAMMOT system that utilizes instance semantic segmentation and IMM modelling for dynamic object tracking. Ego-pose and dynamic object states are jointly optimized in an innovative graph optimization framework intimately integrated with the IMM algorithm. Comparative analysis against our baseline, which employs a single motion model for object tracking, demonstrates that the IMM-SLAMMOT outperforms at motion-pattern-transition moments and consistently achieves competitive results in SLAM and multi-object tracking tasks throughout the entire trajectory.},

Nevertheless, conventional approaches often address these two problems independently, employing separate models for each task. This approach poses practical limitations in real-world scenarios, particularly when computational resources are scarce or real-time performance is imperative. Hence, in this article, we introduce S $^{3}$ M-Net, a novel joint learning framework developed to perform semantic segmentation and stereo matching simultaneously. Specifically, S $^{3}$ M-Net shares the features extracted from RGB images between both tasks, resulting in an improved overall scene understanding capability. This feature sharing process is realized using a feature fusion adaption (FFA) module, which effectively transforms the shared features into semantic space and subsequently fuses them with the encoded disparity features. The entire joint learning framework is trained by minimizing a novel semantic consistency-guided (SCG) loss, which places emphasis on the structural consistency in both tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on the vKITTI2 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint learning framework and its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art single-task networks.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the active front-wheel steering technique makes it possible to pursue precise, fast, and reliable path-tracking control for autonomous vehicles. To mitigate the impact of time-varying model parameters and system disturbances on the control performance, this article proposes a continuous-time solving scheme for the autonomous path- tracking problem, which combines the robust model predictive control (RMPC) technique, non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) method, and polytopic model. First, considering the time-varying longitudinal vehicle velocity, a polytopic model is utilized to construct a vehicle path-tracking system with a simpler structure. Then, a state-feedback controller for the continuous system model is developed based on the non- PDC method. By using the Lyapunov stability proof to transform the optimal control problem into the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) solving form, an RMPC method is used to ensure path-tracking accuracy. Moreover, a robust compensation control is introduced to improve the anti-disturbance and transient response of the system. The virtual simulation by Carsim/ Simulink and field vehicle tests are conducted to assess the proposed controller. Both the simulation and field vehicle tests prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving the path-tracking performance.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-Camera fusion-based 3D object detection is one of the main visual perception tasks in autonomous driving, facing the challenges of small targets and occlusions. Image semantics are beneficial for these issues, yet most existing methods applied semantics only in the cross-modal fusion stage to compensate for point geometric features, where the advantages of semantic information are not effectively explored. Further, the increased complexity of the network caused by introducing semantics is also a major obstacle to real-time. In this article, we propose a Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Interaction Network(SACINet) to achieve real-time 3D object detection, which introduces high-level semantics into both key stages of image feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we design a Lightweight Semantic-aware Image Feature Extractor(LSIFE) to enhance semantic samplings of objects while reducing numerous parameters. Additionally, a Semantic-Modulated Cross-modal Interaction Mechanism(SMCIM) is proposed to stress semantic details in cross-modal fusion. This mechanism conducts a pairwise interactive fusion among geometric features, semantic-aware point-wise image features, and semantic-aware point-wise segmentation features by the designed Conditions Generation Network(CGN) and Semantic-Aware Point-wise Feature Modulation(SAPFM). Ultimately, we construct a real-time(25.2fps) 3D detector with minor parameters(23.79 MB), which can better achieve the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark illustrate that SACINet is effective for real-time 3D detection, especially on small and severely occluded targets. Further, we conduct semantic occupancy perception experiments on the latest nuScenes-Occupancy benchmark, which verifies the effectiveness of SMCIM.},

A novel localization frame by building two-layer visual maps from two-camera views (i.e., front and side views) is proposed in this paper. Among these two views, we build the dense map layer by extracting handcraft features from the front-view to achieve accurate localization. We build the sparse map layer by extracting both holistic and local semantic features with a Siamese Network from the side-view to improve localization reliability. These two types of map layers together with the 3D information are integrated to formulate the visual map. In the localization stage, we propose a map-based localization scheme, and a novel method to fuse the holistic and local semantic features matching results. By two-view matching within the pre-built visual map, we can measure the poses of the vehicle and achieve both accurate and reliable localization. The proposed mapping and localization methods have been tested in two experimental scenes about 3500 m 2 and 2000 m 2 . Experimental results demonstrate that the final localization has a better performance after using the proposed method.},

However, it necessitates accurate relative pose transformations, which are challenging to obtain with existing navigation systems. Therefore, we propose a distributed object-level collaborative perception framework called GraphPS. The graph matching method is designed to identify correspondences between co-visible bounding boxes from different perspectives, allowing for the calculation of optimal pose transformations to correct localization errors. Furthermore, to address issues of insufficient extension of the perception range and unreliable collaboration due to the lack of co-visible objects in multi-agent object-level fusion, we introduce a framework for multi-hop perception fusion based on graph pair sequences derived from graph similarity computation. This framework extends the perception range while ensuring collaboration reliability. We conduct extensive experiments on simulated datasets in V2X and V2V scenarios. Our method demonstrates robust performance under varying degrees of position and heading errors, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy. GraphPS substantially enhances the object association accuracy and relative pose calibration precision of the baseline methods in multi-agent collaboration, showcasing its practicality in real-world complex traffic scenarios.},

The IPDB model integrates the fundamental physical laws and data snapshots in a moving-window framework, which possesses the properties of physical interpretations and adaptiveness simultaneously. Building upon our prior work on the IPDB approach, the recursive algorithm is derived to improve the computational efficiency. The recursive IPDB method updates the data-based system transition matrices using new data points rather than full-length data snapshots in the moving window. Besides, the proposed recursive IPDB method is proven that its modeling accuracy and data-based system representation are equivalent to the moving-window IPDB method. More importantly, the computational complexity is found to be independent of the moving window length, which allows handling larger window lengths with more data points to increase online modeling accuracy. Simulations by CarSim and experiments on commercial passenger vehicles are performed in various driving scenarios, where the recursive IPDB method is implemented and compared against the conventional IPDB approach. The results verify that the recursive IPDB method accurately captures nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of lateral dynamics, and produces equivalent modeling accuracy as the moving-window IPDB method but with greatly reduced computation times.},

We propose a novel tube-based nonlinear model predictive control (TNMPC) scheme that combines the strengths of MPC and boundary layer sliding control (BLSC) to drive the controlled vehicle along a real-time and high-performance trajectory while simultaneously ensuring practical satisfaction of constraints. Specifically, our approach uses an extended kinematic vehicle model with slip angle parameters to provide explicit expressions for modeling error, thereby facilitating the design of BLSC gains. We then reveal an inequality relation between the slip angles and acceleration, which allows the BLSC gains to be represented as functions of the optimization variables. This innovative approach enables the inclusion of constraints on the BLSC gains into the TNMPC motion planning problem, striking a balance among performance, modeling error, and practical control capability. The feasibility of the kinematic model is also guaranteed without the need for the commonly adopted acceleration constraint. Moreover, tightening of the state and input constraints in TNMPC is achieved through coordinate transformation of the tubes, interval analysis, and robust optimization theory. Simulations in racing scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed TNMPC scheme, illustrating its ease of adaptability across various road friction conditions.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, vision oriented intelligent vehicle systems such as autonomous driving or transportation assistance can be optimized by enhancing the visual visibility of images acquired in bad weather conditions. The presence of haze in such visual scenes is a critical threat. Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on both synthetic and real dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for image dehazing algorithms and have the potential to be deployed in real transportation systems.},

This paper aims to investigate the issue of multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance and search (MCRS) to ensure ample coverage of the mission area and precise localization of static targets. The MCRS problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem, taking into account the credibility of search results. To achieve this, we design a belief probability map based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, comprising an uncertainty map and two target maps. This representation enables a clear depiction of both the presence of the target and the uncertainty within the map. Subsequently, we reformulate this multi-objective optimization problem within the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP). To address this reformulation, a new deep reinforcement learning approach called Double Critic Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DCDDPG) is proposed. Specifically, we introduce both a centralized critic and a local critic for each UAV agent to estimate the action-value function. This approach helps balance the bias in the action-value function estimation and the variance in the policy updates, thereby improving the coordination effect. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that DCDDPG outperforms existing techniques in terms of search efficiency and coverage.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the higher performance-cost ratio and installation convenience, the visible-light imaging camera has become one of the most widely-used onboard sensors for safe vehicle navigation. However, the captured images inevitably suffer from color distortion, contrast reduction, or loss of fine details under severe weather conditions (such as haze, low-lightness, rain, and snow). The quality-degraded visual information will lead to limited perceptual accuracy and range, resulting in the increased navigation risk for intelligent marine vehicles. To suppress the influences of severe imaging conditions on navigation safety, this work proposes an all-in-one low-visibility enhancement network (termed AiOENet) to improve the visual perception for marine surface vehicles under different weather scenarios. Specifically, our AiOENet mainly consists of a VGG16-driven scene discriminator, an encoder, parameter-shared Transformer blocks, and a decoder. The scene discriminator is exploited to classify four degradation types of low-visibility images. According to the classification results, the low-visibility images are fed into the corresponding encoders for coarse feature extraction. The multiple Transformer blocks are then employed to separate and extract the smaller-scale features. The latent normal-visibility images are finally generated through the corresponding decoders. Therefore, our AiOENet has the capacity of flexibly and adaptively restoring diverse low-visibility images using a uniform encoder-decoder network architecture. Compared with the state-of-the-art imaging methods, the AiOENet achieves comparable or even superior enhancement results in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. In addition, our method can contribute to more accurate and stable object detection with improved visual perception in maritime low-visibility scenes.},

The generated trajectories are G $_{2}$ -continuous except at the inflection points, and points of local curvature maxima appear exactly at path points and nowhere else. The local curvature control ensures that the trajectories keep high fidelity with the original paths, thus maintaining key properties of the original paths, such as free collision and gentle turns. Furthermore, we develop a joint optimization method for both fidelity and continuity, which has an efficient analytical solution for each iteration. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real scenarios validate that 1) the smoothed trajectories can deviate less than 10 cm from the original paths, 2) the average curvature differences at junctures are under 1e-4 (1/m), 3) the smoothing time reduced by about 50% versus high-order bézier methods, showing superior performance of the proposed method in terms of fidelity, continuity, efficiency, and practicability.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the online path planning problem for autonomous underwater vehicle, which is constrained by the limited hardware computation and energy-carrying capabilities, is studied under the interference of dynamic ocean currents. To address this issue, an online lightweight neural dynamics approach is proposed to plan paths with low time and energy consumption in ocean currents scenarios. Firstly, the lightweight rapid propagation neural dynamics network, which involves the low complexity structure and the rapid propagation mechanism, is constructed. The proposed low connection-computation complexity neural dynamics network structure can reduce the number of adjacent neurons and the computation of neural connection weights by the customized division. The proposed rapid propagation mechanism can enhance the propagation directionality to speed up the convergence of the neural dynamics network. Then, the fused-ocean-currents path-generation mechanism is proposed to fuse the local adjacent ocean currents information into the neural activity values to reconstruct the neural activity value gradient, which can timely reflect the low time and energy consumption paths. In this way, the relatively advantageous ocean currents can be fully utilized and the relatively adverse ocean currents can be actively avoided to efficiently save the navigational time and energy. Furthermore, the event-trigger-based path-screening mechanism is proposed to adaptively avoid detecting unnecessary ocean currents information, thereby reducing the detecting energy consumption. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed approach is verified by the numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made remarkable achievements in the research of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, much of the current research on UAVs focuses on a single task, which limits its applicability in many scenarios. Therefore, we have conducted research on UAV target tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks. The DRL-based solutions integrate the objectives of multi-tasks into a common reward function making the training unstable and difficult to converge, resulting in the loss of objectives or collisions. To that end, we propose a novel target following and obstacle avoidance solution based on policy distillation of the task attention mechanism. First, we train the two tasks of UAV target following and UAV obstacle avoidance respectively. Both networks are trained using Dueling Double Deep Q Network to learn the corresponding policy in an end-to-end manner. Then we extract the two policies that have been trained separately into a memory buffer. Meanwhile, we can perceive the collision risk through the state of the current environment of the UAV to assign the weights of the two tasks in the attention mechanism. Therefore, our method can adaptively focus on the corresponding tasks according to the current state. We conducted simulation experiments using the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform. Our study presents compelling experimental findings: (1) Our novel approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior tracking accuracy and extended tracking durations across diverse environments, all while mitigating collision incidents. (2) The distilled policy we have developed exhibits robust generalization capabilities when applied to previously unencountered environments.},

  abstract     = {Remote driving plays an essential role in coordinating automated vehicles in some challenging situations. Due to the changed driving environment, the experiences and behaviors of remote drivers would undergo some changes compared to conventional drivers. To study this, a continuous real-life and remote driving experiment is conducted under different driving conditions. In addition, the effect of steering force feedback (SFF) on the driving experience is also investigated. In order to achieve this, three types of SFF modes are compared. According to the results, no SFF significantly worsens the driving experience in both remote and real-life driving. Additionally, less force and returnability on steering wheel are needed in remote driving, and the steering force amplitude appears to influence the steering velocity of remote drivers. Furthermore, there is an increase in lane following deviation during remote driving. Remote drivers are also prone to driving at lower speeds and have a higher steering reversal rate. They also give larger steering angle inputs when crossing the cones in a slalom manoeuvre and cause the car to experience larger lateral acceleration. These findings provide indications on how to design SFF and how driving behavior and experience change in remote driving.},

A gain-scheduled LPV/ $H_{\infty }$ strategy for ICVs is proposed to improve tracking performance, driving stability and robustness of controller. While establishing lateral-yaw-roll dynamics, a steering and braking coordination control strategy based on scheduling parameters is designed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw-roll stability under different driving conditions. The robust performance has been guaranteed in the $H_{\infty }$ robust controller by considering the parameter uncertainties in lateral-yaw-roll dynamic model, unmodeled subsystem as well as ground mechanics and aerodynamics disturbance comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of time-varying parameters and determination of robust boundary is addressed through a LPV polyhedral structure and a novel Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model respectively, which reduces the conservativeness of $H_{\infty }$ robust controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse disturbances are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically, which ensures the feasibility of system. The results of simulations on MATLAB-Trucksim platform demonstrate that the proposed controller can significantly enhance tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robustness, which guarantees the feasibility and capability of driving in diverse scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Drifting, or cornering with rear tires that exceed slip limits, represents a trade-off of stability for controllability while operating at the limits of friction. Recent work has demonstrated exceptional performance by autonomous systems of stabilization and path tracking a vehicle around an unstable drifting equilibrium. However, safely navigating unexpected or challenging road conditions that require an autonomous vehicle to operate at the limits of friction is likely to require dynamic, non-equilibrium maneuvers. These trajectories activate underlying dynamics, such as weight transfer and wheelspeed, which significantly affect the forces acting on the vehicle. In this paper, we present a modeling and control framework for dynamic drifting trajectories. First, a novel vehicle model is proposed that strikes an appropriate balance of fidelity and complexity. Then, this vehicle model is embedded into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control policy that can maintain stability and path tracking while performing dynamic drifting maneuvers. This work is validated experimentally using “Takumi”, an autonomous Toyota Supra, that demonstrates root mean squared path tracking error of 13 centimeters and a peak error of just 47 cm. Finally, a simulation study suggests parameter uncertainty, rather than additional model fidelity, is the primary limitation of further increasing controller performance.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-Camera fusion can effectively provide the complementary geometric and appearance information for 3D object detection task of autonomous driving system. However, current dominant methods designed for urban scenes often fuse multi-modal information into a Bird&#39;s-Eye-View (BEV) feature representation and have a relatively short perception range, which limits their application in surface mine. To achieve long-range perception in surface mine, we utilize a solid-state LiDAR (i.e. Livox Horizon) that has a large perception range (over 200 meters). Accordingly, we propose PVFusion, a novel 3D object detection method that only fuses LiDAR and camera information in Perspective View (PV). Specifically, we first generate the multi-channel depth map via point cloud projection and Depth Map Densification (DMD). Then, we extract visual-depth features and local geometry features from depth-enhanced camera image and point cloud respectively. To better fuse multi-modal information, we propose an Attentional Feature Fusion (AFF) module to dynamically fuse visual-depth features and local geometry features into fused PV features. Moreover, we design a three-branch detection head that leverages a Depth Decoupling Strategy (DDS) to improve the depth estimation for distant objects. We conduct extensive experiments on our surface mine dataset and verify the effectiveness of the proposed PVFusion.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the technologies deployed on vehicles, there is a significant increase in the amount of data, which comes from various applications, such as battery management, VR, autopilot, etc. However, privacy is a critical obstacle to utilizing such information since many vehicle-based applications involve locations, conversations, driving behaviors, etc. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technology perfect for filling the gap, as it keeps users&#39; data in their devices, which gives rise to Federated Vehicular Networks (FVN). As a distributed paradigm, communication efficiency is an essential issue for researchers, since it impacts every aspect of FVN. This article presents a communication-efficient federated vehicular network called FedAGL integrating A daptive parameter control, G enetic Algorithm (GA), and L ong Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This is a framework designed to accelerate the training process of FVN by minimizing communication overhead and latency. In this article, we introduce a parameter-control algorithm to alleviate transmission burdens, thereby reducing communication overhead. This approach does not involve freezing the parameters of the entire layer but identifies certain parameters with minor updates. Further, we employ the GA to allocate communication bandwidth for each vehicle, considering the varying sizes of vehicles&#39; active parameters. Thus, the maximum transmission time in each FL round decreases. In addition, due to the complexity of the genetic algorithm, the LSTM model is developed to accelerate the bandwidth allocation with quick response and sufficient precision, which uses data from the genetic algorithm as training labels. Abundant experiments indicate that the proposed framework achieves up to 10.44% and 22.62% reduction in communication overhead and latency, respectively, outperforming the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of the 6G era, addressing the increasing demand for mobile computing has become crucial. In the next-generation Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), widespread deployment of edge servers ensures low delay and high reliability for vehicular applications. However, densely deployed edge servers are designed to accommodate peak traffic. This results in unnecessary resource wastage, high maintenance costs, and energy consumption during off-peak hours. Enabling the sleep function of edge servers and dynamically controlling their operating mode is crucial for reducing energy consumption and enabling green IoVs. In this paper, we study the dynamic sleep problem of edge servers in the IoV network and propose traffic-aware intelligent sleep decision-making algorithms based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We propose a Centralized DRL-based Dynamic Sleep (CDDS) algorithm, which leverages the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to learn the optimal decision policy through environmental interaction. To enhance the stability of agent learning and mitigate the impact of environmental changes, we propose a baseline transformation strategy based on the greedy algorithm. Additionally, to overcome the limitations of CDDS, we combine federated learning with DRL and propose a Federated DRL-based Dynamic Sleep (FDDS) algorithm. This approach speeds up model training and improves the model&#39;s generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experimental verification using real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that both CDDS and FDDS successfully learn the optimal sleep control policy, leading to system cost reduction of 11.06% to 45.36% and 8.71% to 43.77%, respectively, compared to the baselines.},

Unlike previous studies, our work focuses on videos of finite lengths and incorporates dynamic cache replacement, optimizing this alongside the delivery of individual video chunks. Considering the challenge of obtaining complete network state information at a central unit (e.g., macro base station), we adopt a MADRL framework to enable roadside units (RSUs) to autonomously decide on video caching and delivery strategies, leveraging partial information from neighboring RSUs. We evaluate the proposed method using various quality-of-service (QoS) metrics. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our scheme consistently delivers high average video quality while reducing playback stalls, replacement costs, and backhaul usage.},

The stochastic and repetitive interactions among IVs is modeled as a Markov game process. In this way, the optimization of the joint offloading policy is transformed to approximate a Markov perfect equilibrium in a general-sum Markov game. Moreover, we argue that training in the practical VEC networks using the classical centralized training and decentralized executing (CTDE) framework involves challenges of privacy and computational complexity. Motivated by these, we propose a reward-shared distributed policy optimization (RSDPO) method for the considered VEC networks to optimize the joint offloading policy.

Differing from linear and nonlinear MPC structures, the core concept of FI-MPC involves incorporating the unmodeled nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle or tires into a linear framework to achieve optimal iterative control solutions. The goal is to mitigate the mismatch between linear and high-fidelity nonlinear dynamics models, thus achieving real-time high-precision tracking control of nonlinear vehicle dynamics under challenging conditions. In addition, rule-based convergence criteria are designed to enhance the iteration mechanism of FI-MPC, further conserving the computational resources of the onboard controller by reducing unnecessary iteration steps. To validate the effectiveness of the FI-MPC algorithm, this study investigates the trajectory tracking problem for a four-wheel-drive AV for a weave test scenario. Co-simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing results at various speeds confirm that FI-MPC enables high-precision control of nonlinear dynamics while ensuring excellent real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vehicle trajectories is crucial to ensuring automated vehicle operation efficiency and safety, particularly on congested multi-lane highways. In such dynamic environments, a vehicle&#39;s motion is determined by its historical behaviors as well as interactions with surrounding vehicles. These intricate interactions arise from unpredictable motion patterns, leading to a wide range of driving behaviors that warrant in-depth investigation. This study presents the Graph-based Interaction-aware Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (GIMTP) framework, designed to probabilistically predict future vehicle trajectories by effectively capturing these interactions. Within this framework, vehicles&#39; motions are conceptualized as nodes in a time-varying graph, and the traffic interactions are represented by a dynamic adjacency matrix. To holistically capture both spatial and temporal dependencies embedded in this dynamic adjacency matrix, the methodology incorporates the Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN), thereby providing a graph embedding of both historical states and future states. Furthermore, we employ a driving intention-specific feature fusion, enabling the adaptive integration of historical and future embeddings for enhanced intention recognition and trajectory prediction. This model gives two-dimensional predictions for each mode of longitudinal and lateral driving behaviors and offers probabilistic future paths with corresponding probabilities, addressing the challenges of complex vehicle interactions and multi-modality of driving behaviors.

Intelligent control of such a micromobility vehicle is significantly sensitive to discrete events of short duration and high-intensity road disturbances and shocks. Sudden bumps, potholes, pavement or kicks typically cause these events. Our approach combines adaptive disturbance observer (DOB) with two other techniques to achieve better and more robust nonlinear control of a ballbot drive vehicle (BDV) against small to large external disturbances. The proposed hybrid DOB-Based combined control system (DOB-CCS) stabilizes the body position via a DOB-based partial feedback linearization (PFL) strategy while enabling ball movement on the floor by introducing a DOB-based sliding mode control (SMC). The control scheme consists of linearly combined components responsible for maintaining an upright posture about unstable equilibrium points and tracking the motion under disturbances. Simulations, real-platform experiments and respective comparative studies show the efficacy of the proposed method for a BDV to reject external disturbances. The practical performance of the proposed DOB-CCS strategy is experimentally validated and compared with a CCS method. The experimental results indicate less than 0.7 and 1.5 degrees of ballbot&#39;s orientation error and robust rejection of disturbances under kicks during balancing and transferring modes, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a recognized sampling-based approach for finite horizon optimal control problems. However, the efficacy and computational efficiency of prevailing MPPI methods are heavily reliant on the quality of rollouts. This is problematic because it is hard to sample a low-cost trajectory using random control sequences, thereby leading to inferior performance and computational efficiency, especially under constrained resources. To address this issue, we propose a data-efficient MPPI method called reinforcement learning-driven MPPI (RL-driven MPPI), which significantly reduces the dependency on the quantity and quality of samples. RL-driven MPPI employs an offline-online policy learning scheme, where the offline policy learned by RL serves as the initial solution and the initial rollout generator of MPPI, effectively combining the strengths of both RL and MPPI. The rollouts generated by RL typically correspond to a lower cost-to-go compared to random sampling, which significantly boosts the sample efficiency and convergence speed of MPPI. Moreover, the value function learned by RL offers an accurate estimation for infinite-horizon cost-to-go, enabling it to serve as a terminal term for the cost criteria of MPPI. This approach empowers MPPI to approximate an infinite-horizon cost with a shorter prediction horizon, thus enhancing real-time performance at each time step. An unmanned aerial vehicle control task is conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Results indicate that the proposed RL-driven MPPI method exhibits superior control performance and sample efficiency.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a crucial and complex undertaking in the realm of 3D scene comprehension. Monocular-based 3D detectors, in comparison to LiDAR 3D detectors that utilize point clouds as input, often exhibit a significant performance gap. Incorporating guidance from LiDAR-based detectors has led to notable advancements in monocular 3D detection. Nevertheless, some current approaches focus solely on transferring feature or response knowledge from LiDAR data, neglecting the valuable geometric structural information present in the LiDAR data. As a result, there is untapped potential to fully exploit the geometric relationships within the LiDAR data to further improve monocular 3D detection performance. In this paper, we propose a High-order Structural Relation Distillation Networks, which establishes the geometric structure information in the BEV feature level and distills the relation from LiDAR Detectors to Monocular Image Detectors. Specifically, to better align the structural relation with the LiDAR BEV features, we propose the Image BEV Feature Enhancing Module, which can capture essential spatial depth context via explicitly modeling the interdependence between the depth channels of BEV features to improve the representations. In addition, instead of only distillation at feature level, our distillation model contains point, line, and surface relation distillation, which captures high-order structural relations from LiDAR BEV features and enhances the detection of the image-based student model, particularly for non-rigid object detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in the case of non-rigid Cyclist class.},

A neural network (NN) identifier is constructed to learn uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Unlike the typical architecture of actor-critic networks, a single-critic network is employed to obtain the approximate solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By introducing an additional stability term and experience replay (ER) technique, we present a novel critic weight update rule, such that (i) the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition is relaxed, and (ii) the request of an initial admissible control is alleviated. Subsequently, a performance-guaranteed adaptive optimal tracking control algorithm is developed to guarantee the prescribed transient behavior of tracking errors and minimize the cost function simultaneously. A rigorous theoretical analysis indicates that the developed controller guarantees semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop adaptive system with prescribed performance.

Cooperative perception has been widely studied as an effective approach to addressing the shortcomings of single-vehicle perception. However, the practical limitations of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have not been adequately investigated. In particular, current cooperative fusion models rely on supervised models and do not address dynamic performance degradation caused by arbitrary channel impairments. In this article, a self-supervised adaptive weighting model is proposed for intermediate fusion to mitigate the adverse effects of channel distortion. The performance of cooperative perception is investigated in different system settings. Rician fading and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are also considered. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive weighting algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmarks without weighting. Visualization examples validate that the proposed weighting algorithm can flexibly adapt to various channel conditions. Moreover, the adaptive weighting algorithm demonstrates good generalization to untrained channels and test datasets from different domains.},

To address this gap, we propose a hybrid hierarchical competitive game-based optimal pricing and service scheduling model with a single-leader-multiple-followers scheme for seaport-ships coordination systems. Specifically, the interaction between the port and the shipowners is represented as a hierarchical Stackelberg game, while the followers&#39; subgame is formulated as a generalized Nash game with coupling constraints. To guarantee the optimal strategies for all participants, the existence and uniqueness of the proposed hierarchical game equilibrium are proven. Furthermore, an accelerated distributed augmented lagrangian (ADAL)-based distributed algorithm is developed for the global Stackelberg equilibrium to protect the privacy of each entity.

Next, an improved Gaussian Process(GP)-based modeling method is designed to model the traversable regions with a leading speed, and the obstacle point clouds are refined with a composite filter.

As regards the limited capacity of the network bandwidth, this article designs a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the transmission burden. By taking the whole disturbances into account, distributed disturbance observers are established to eliminate the negative influence for each UAV. By means of Kronecker product technique, an integrated controller is conducted for each UAV, which can achieve the consensus for the formation switched system and compensate for the unknown disturbances. On these basis, a closed-loop system with the designed controller and switching law is proved to be exponentially stable. Additionally, the explicit expressions of the controller and disturbance observers gains are determined, respectively.

  abstract     = {Radar sensors are vital for autonomous driving due to their consistent and dependable performance, even in challenging weather conditions. Semantic segmentation of moving objects in sparse radar point clouds is an emerging task that contributes to improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, the methods still need to be explored since radar points in driving scenes are distributed sparsely and irregularly. Typical methods address the sparsity by aggregating multi-scan data to generate dense point clouds, where the temporal correlation is ignored. Inputting consecutive frames of point clouds can preserve temporal information, but the irregular distribution makes it difficult to achieve interframe communications. In this article, we propose a scheme to process points of multi-scan data into a single frame with the availability of temporal features. Our novel network, called Spatial and Temporal Awareness Network (STA-Net), enables points at different times to interact and establish their spatiotemporal connections to comprehend the surroundings of these points. Furthermore, we design a shallow feature extraction method based on the radar measurements of points, which enhances the representation of local features. To further improve the capability of the network to distinguish between various moving objects, we also introduce a prompt layer inspired by prompt-based learning. This layer instructs the network to generate a discriminative representation for each type of moving object. Our experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods designed on the RadarScenes dataset. In particular, it shows a remarkable ability to segment small objects such as pedestrians.},

  abstract     = {Driving fatigue impairs the driver&#39;s hand-foot coordination, a significant factor in traffic accidents. However, the functional brain connectivity underlying driver coordination remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a monotonous long-distance driving experiment (approximately 2 hours) with thirty participants, who rated their fatigue level every 6 minutes using the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS). We then categorized the ratings into three fatigue levels: alertness or slight fatigue (AF), moderate fatigue (MF), and severe fatigue (SF). Emergency avoidance scenarios occurred randomly during the experiment, requiring the driver to brake and steer simultaneously to prevent collisions. The multi-band brain functional connectivity network and the critical connections were utilized for global-regional brain functional connectivity analysis and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) analyses. We found that inter-region connectivity between cognitive and motor regions in the frontal-central and frontal-parietal regions decreased as the driver&#39;s fatigue increased to MF. Simultaneously, intra-region connectivity within the central region decreased, impairing intra-motor region connectivity. These diminished the driver&#39;s coordination ability. However, profound fatigue triggered an inter-regional and intra-regional reorganization of the brain functional network, reflecting anti-fatigue characteristics but insufficient to enhance driving performance. The XAI results indicated that the beta-band brain functional connection network dataset achieved the highest accuracy (0.941) on the Resnet18 model and revealed fatigue differences in the cognitive and motor regions of the dataset. Our study demonstrated that the driver&#39;s hand-foot coordination had distinct brain functional connectivity characteristics under different fatigue states, which could inform the design of neural network detection algorithms for driving fatigue.},

  abstract     = {3D detection task plays a crucial role in the perception system of intelligent vehicles. LiDAR-based 3D detectors perform well on particular autonomous driving benchmarks, but may poorly generalize to other domains. Existing 3D domain adaptive detection methods usually require annotation-related statistics or continuous refinement of pseudo-labels. The former is not always feasible for practical applications, while the latter lacks sufficient accurate supervision. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive framework, namely A daptation V ia P roxy ( AVP ), that explicitly leverages cross-domain relationships to generate adequate high-quality samples, thus mitigating domain shifts for existing LiDAR-based 3D detectors. Specifically, we first train the detector on source domain with the curriculum example mining (CEM) strategy to enhance its generalization capability. Then, we integrate the profitable instance knowledge from the source domain with the contextual information from the target domain, to construct the instance-aware proxy, which is a data collection with diverse training scenes and stronger supervision. Finally, we fine-tune the pre-trained detector on the proxy data for further optimizing the detector to overcome domain gaps. To build the instance-aware proxy, two components are proposed, i.e., the multi-view multi-scale aggregation (MMA) method for producing high-quality pseudo-labels, and the hybrid instance augmentation (HIA) technique for integrating the knowledge from source annotations to enhance supervision. Note that AVP is architecture-agnostic thus it can be easily injected with any LiDAR-based 3D detectors. Extensive experiments on Waymo, nuScenes, KITTI and Lyft demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches for different adaptation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Robots have become increasingly prevalent in dynamic and crowded environments such as airports and shopping malls. In these scenarios, the critical challenges for robot navigation are reliability and timely arrival at predetermined destinations. While existing risk-based motion planning algorithms effectively reduce collision risks with static and dynamic obstacles, there is still a need for significant performance improvements. Specifically, the dynamic environments demand more rapid responses and robust planning. To address this gap, we introduce a novel risk-based multi-directional sampling algorithm, Multi-directional Risk-based Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Multi-Risk-RRT). Unlike traditional algorithms that solely rely on a rooted tree or double trees for state space exploration, our approach incorporates multiple sub-trees. Each sub-tree independently explores its surrounding environment. At the same time, the primary rooted tree collects the heuristic information from these sub-trees, facilitating rapid progress toward the goal state. Our evaluations, including simulation and real-world environmental studies, demonstrate that Multi-Risk-RRT outperforms existing unidirectional and bi-directional risk-based algorithms in planning efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This article is related to the coordinated formation control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with con-fined communication resources under a path-following context. To fulfill path following without any temporal limitations, an individual robust heading control law is derived for UAVs to approximate the predefined orbit characterized by implicit functions free from operational times, whereas a concise and computationally efficient observation option, i.e., unknown sys-tem dynamics estimator (USDE) is incorporated to online resist the wind perturbations through an ideal invariant manifold and low-pass filtering. To enable coordination behaviors under lim-ited communication bandwidths, an USDE-based cooperative formation protocol with aperiodic communication is constructed to achieve time requirements and velocity assignment, where an event-based communication scheduling policy including a con-tinuous-time state predictor is presented, rendering that infor-mation exchange only occurs at pre-specified discrete instants and local control updates are independent of neighbors’ triggering sequences, such that high-frequency communication occupa-tion and controller execution can be successfully eliminated. Additionally, a coordinated argument corresponding to the projective arc length is skillfully devised to achieve velocity agreement even navigating along the curvilinear path. The sign-ificant benefit is that spatial-temporal decoupling formation coordination can be accomplished with decreased communication cost and lessened control consumption. The convergence of entire path-following system is demonstrated to be bounded while Zeno behavior is circumvented. The feasibility and benefits are evaluated through simulation outcomes.},

Based on the YOLOX object detection model, a lightweight neural network for traffic object detection is proposed. First, we propose S-PANet (Simple Path Aggregation Network) structure based on the YOLOX_S baseline model. The purpose of the S-PANet structure is to reduce the parameters number of models and the amount of floating-point computation in training. Second, we propose to add CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to the network based on the S-PANet. Adding CBAM attention mechanism can improve the detection accuracy of models, but has less computation added. It is a compensation of the simplification on feature pyramid. Final, we carry out the lightweight experiments on three kinds of models, including S, Tiny, and Nano. The proposed methods are verified on KITTI and PASCAL VOC datasets. Our S model can achieve 92.9% mAP @0.5 and 21.33 FPS on KITTI dataset. The Tiny and Nano models can achieve 84.3%, 79.4% mAP @0.5 and 33.07, 41.67 FPS respectively. Compared with the baseline models, the detection accuracies mAP @0.5 have less difference and the parameters number of the models are reduced.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving is producing various novel achievements in integrating different control technologies with machine learning to control intelligent vehicles, i.e., learning-based control. Yet, few work formally consider the confidence of learning-based models and their residual model uncertainties. As a result, existing methods lack safety guarantees in real-world applications. To address this issue, this work proposes a Linear-Bayesian-Regression-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) method for vehicles with unknown dynamics and subject to possibly unbounded disturbances. Model parameters can be obtained by using posterior calculations via prior estimations and systems’ historical data. The expected value of resulting posterior distribution is chosen as linear model&#39;s parameters for controller design. Furthermore, the corresponding posterior distribution can be used to derive an upper bound for the variance of residual model uncertainties. In analogy to the concept of Tube-MPC, this work introduces a dynamic feedback gain which is combined with the standard nominal MPC method. It derives provable security guarantees with respect to state and input chance constraints for complex unknown dynamical systems in the form of probabilities. A convex-reformulation-based optimization method is proposed to enable efficient computation of control laws and ensure the recursive feasibility. Simulations of a Vander Pol&#39;s oscillator&#39;s control and a vehicle&#39;s tracking control illustrate the design procedure and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation plays a critical role in enabling intelligent vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments. However, deep learning-based methods usually perform poorly in domain shift scenarios due to the lack of labeled data for training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques have emerged to bridge the gap across different driving scenes and enhance model performance on unlabeled target environments. Although self-training UDA methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, the challenge of generating precise pseudo-labels persists. These pseudo-labels tend to favor majority classes, consequently sacrificing the performance of rare classes or small objects like traffic lights and signs. To address this challenge, we introduce SAM4UDASS, a novel approach that incorporates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into self-training UDA methods for refining pseudo-labels. It involves Semantic-Guided Mask Labeling, which assigns semantic labels to unlabeled SAM masks using UDA pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we devise fusion strategy aimed at mitigating semantic granularity inconsistency between SAM masks and the target domain. SAM4UDASS innovatively integrate segmentation foundation model SAM with UDA for semantic segmentation in driving scenes and seamlessly complements self-training UDA methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real, normal-to-adverse, and pinhole-to-panoramic driving datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. It brings more than 3% mIoU gains on GTA5-to-Cityscapes, SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC when using DAFormer and achieves SOTA when using MIC.},

Additionally, a large-scale cooperative perception dataset V2V-Set is further augmented with a variety of driving conditions, thereby providing extensive knowledge for model pretraining.

Firstly, a dual-line laser SLV is developed, and a new underwater pipeline positioning method is proposed, which can simultaneously obtain the lateral deviation, height deviation and heading deviation of underwater vehicle and underwater pipeline under weak light water environment. Then, by combining laser stripe image feature points, refracted underwater SLV model and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) information, underwater pipeline tracking and dense 3D reconstruction are realized. Finally, by integrating the self-designed underwater SLV sensor with the underwater vehicle BlueROV, an underwater pipeline tracking and 3D reconstruction system is developed.

However, most of the current approaches for fusion-based 3D detection follow symmetrical fusion paradigms and adopt early fusion, middle fusion as well as late fusion styles, which ignore the unequal status of data with different modalities. In this paper, according to the timing of fusion, we adopt an asymmetric cascade fusion network to exploit both the structural information from point clouds and the complementary semantic information from images. A multi-stage cascade design of 3D object detection is proposed to iteratively refine predictions and several late image features (comprised of detection clues, segmentation clues, and deep features from encoders) are incorporated into different stages of the LiDAR branch to maintain the integrity of image features and enable deep multimodal interactions. Besides, to mitigate the effects of the down-sampling of voxelized features and possible mismatching of multimodal data, we propose proxy-based cross-modality sampling to utilize the high-density point clouds coordinates and develop an image degeneration process to simulate the noise in cross-modality matching for robust training. Extensive experiments are conducted on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by dynamic object detection from point clouds has been widely studied in recent years to achieve accurate and robust LiDAR odometry for autonomous driving. Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by detecting and removing the object points in the urban environment. However, it is still not clear how dynamic objects numerically affect the performance of LiDAR odometry. In addition, the existing solutions tended to directly remove the LiDAR features belonging to the dynamic object, which can lead to the degradation of the geometry constraints of the surrounding features. This paper aims to give answers to these problems by evaluating the effects of dynamic objects as well as reweighting both dynamic objects and static objects. Three factors affecting the performance of LiDAR odometry in highly dynamic scenarios, including the number , geometry distribution , and velocity of the dynamic objects , are first extensively studied using generated scenarios by leveraging real data. Instead of brutely removing the dynamic features, this paper proposes to adaptively assign weightings to the dynamic features. Then both the dynamic and static features are employed to estimate the LiDAR odometry. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using UrbanNav and nuScenes datasets that include numerous dynamic and static objects. To benefit the community, the implementation of the dynamic vehicle simulator and the code for the proposed method are both open-sourced.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave radar semantic segmentation has proven successful in autonomous driving environment perception tasks. However, relying solely on range-angle (RA) images excludes Doppler information, which is crucial for dynamic target recognition. Despite various fusion method proposals, they consistently encounter issues with interfering RA information and poor fusion results. We introduce a novel learnable-query-guided multi-scale fusion network (LQCANet) for radar semantic segmentation, leveraging learnable-query for effective multi-scale cross-attention fusion. The cross-attention fusion module (CAF) initializes queries randomly, interacting with range-Doppler (RD) and angle-Doppler (AD) information via multi-layer cross-attention. Subsequently, the original RA features integrate with the generated queries to achieve multi-scale feature fusion. This approach prevents interference with RA information and ensures efficient fusion. Additionally, for enhanced feature extraction capabilities, this study introduces the pointwise multi-head self-attention down module (PMD), integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Transformer to extract both local and global features. Furthermore, pointwise convolution serves as an implicit positional coding method, addressing the limitation that explicit positional coding is not applicable to millimeter-wave radar images. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LQCANet on the CARRADA dataset. In comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) fusion-network TMVA-Net, the LQCANet exhibits a significant improvement of 2.7 in mean intersection over union (mIoU) and 3.4 in mean dice similarity coefficient (mDice), while maintaining a computational complexity of only 27% (27.6 GFLOPs) of TMVA-Net. LQCANet achieves a superior trade-off between detection accuracy and speed, rendering it more suitable for environment perception tasks.},

The whole augmentation pipeline can be separated into two different parts: scene augmentation and instance augmentation. To simplify the selection of deformation functions and ensure control over augmentation outcomes, we propose three effective strategies: residual mapping, space decoupling, and function periodization, respectively. We also propose an effective prior-based location sampling algorithm to paste instances on a more reasonable area in the scenes.

The target formation can be in any plane with any non-horizontal orientation in 3D space, which, combined with the complicated nonlinear dynamics of vehicles, makes the problem difficult. We design a distributed control law to solve this problem. The control law has three nice properties. The first is that it can be transformed into the local frame of each vehicle, and the resulting form is independent of any global values, which means it is fully distributed. The second is that the control law requires no distance measurements, which facilitates practical application. The third is that our controller generates bounded values of control inputs. To validate it, we carry out theoretical analysis using Lyapunov function and graph theory, where we show successively that the vehicles will move to the target plane, the target circle, and the desired spacing. Finally, we execute numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed control law and further perform formation tasks in our built multi-UAV simulation platform to demonstrate the applicability.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for a class of unmanned surface vehicles subject to unknown uncertainties, output constraints and input quantization. Adaptive neural networks (NNs) are applied to handle the uncertainties and quantization while output-dependent universal barrier functions are used to cope with output constraints. Due to limited communication bandwidths, the uniform quantizer is used to quantize input signals before being sent. Based on state feedback, an adaptive NN-based control strategy is proposed to solve the tracking problem with time-invariant output constraints, and then another NN-based control law is developed to deal with the time-varying output constraints. It is proved that the desired output constraints can be achieved and the tracking errors can converge to zero asymptotically. Further, the proposed control law is extended to the case without output constraints. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Realtime model learning is a challenging task for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) sailing in a variable sea environment. Deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs) takes advantage of high representative capabilities. However, it is difficult to achieve stable learning control performance due to modeling errors or model bias. On the other hand, extended state observer (ESO) takes advantage of fast reconstructing unknown disturbances. In this paper, an online deep learning control method is presented for an ASV to achieve trajectory tracking. Specifically, a general DNN is constructed at first to learn the unknown ASV dynamics online with the collected data one by one at each time to improve scalability. Then, an ESO is designed to estimate the modeling errors of the DNN for improving the model learning accuracy further. Finally, a stable online deep learning trajectory tracking control law is designed based on the learned ASV dynamics from the DNN and the reconstructed modeling errors from the ESO. By using the cascade theory, it is proven that the closed-loop trajectory tracking control system is input-to-state stable and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results of the circular trajectory tracking show that the proposed method improves the transient tracking performance compared with the DNN-based and ESO-based control methods. Moreover, an “8-type” trajectory tracking simulation is further provided to demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the proposed method for new trajectories and new environments.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (ReID) is a hot topic in intelligent city surveillance. With the development of smart cameras and vehicular edge computing (VEC), numerous media data has opened up new possibilities for enhancing the applications of vehicle ReID. However, traditional vehicle re-identification systems face the following challenges: 1) it is difficult to recognize the identities of the vehicles in various views and similar appearance, 2) the current system is hard to be extended to large-scale of cameras in a low-trust VEC environment. To solve these problems, we propose a Blockchain-based Collaborative Vehicle ReID (BCV-ReID) system in this paper. It contains two core parts including Viewpoint-identity Query Net (VQNet) and VehicleChain (VChain). By utilizing the viewpoint information and local details simultaneously, VQNet can distinguish the vehicle identities in various cross-camera scenes. It employs viewpoint queries and spatial self-attention to learn the inherent correlation of the vehicle parts, enhancing the ability to distinguish vehicles among various viewpoints. Then, we integrate VChain with VQNet to realize a collaborative vehicle ReID system. The ReID task is illustrated from the perspective of blockchain transactions. All transactions are validated by a deeply integrated ReID consensus to counter potential malicious attacks. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves comparable results in three famous ReID datasets, as well as outstanding performance in real applications.},

The core idea of our model is to encode single-agent&#39;s spatial-temporal information in the first stage and explore multi-agents&#39; spatial-temporal interactions in the second stage. By comprehensively utilizing attention mechanism, long short-term memory, graph convolutional network, and temporal transformer to decouple spatial and temporal features on both the single agent and the multiple agents level, our model is able to learn rich dynamic and interaction information of all agents. Our model achieves the highest performance when comparing with existing map-free methods and exceeds most map-based state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets.

A velocity domain-based approach decomposing the pursuit-encirclement issue into velocity planning problem and velocity tracking problem is proposed to deal with this scenario, while considering obstacle avoidance and incomplete information. Firstly, the developed neural network (NN)-based unscented kalman filter (UKF), which is sufficiently real-time and adaptable to environmental features, is established to predict the velocity of the observed USVs. Subsequently, optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) is employed to transform the pursuit-encirclement problem into the velocity domain, which enables the planning of optimal velocities that are collision-free while accomplishing the pursuit and encirclement mission. Furthermore, the velocity tracking problem for planned optimal velocity is considered as an optimization problem, where a cost function is designed and solved with adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed pursuit-encirclement control method.},

  abstract     = {Currently, most Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) algorithms used for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking primarily focus on improving the tracking model. However, in UAV tracking, the tracked targets are typically small in size and frequently undergo scale variations, making singular improvements to tracking models less effective. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel feature preprocessing approach. Specifically, for the extracted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Color Names (CN) features, we simulate their transformations at different scales and electively enhance the target region features based on global features to obtain multi-scale enhanced features. By implementing these procedures, the tracker improves its ability to recognize targets and exhibits increased adaptability in challenging tracking scenarios. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional approach used by most UAV algorithms, which unidirectionally incorporate historical filters into model updates to prevent filter divergence, we introduce dual second-order difference terms that correspond to features and filters. This integration enables a more effective fusion of historical information with current frame data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the filtering process. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed tracker against other state-of-the-art trackers using the DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and UAVDT datasets. The experimental results affirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {In public roads, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the challenge of frequent interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which render uncertain driving behavior due to varying social characteristics among humans. To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S $^{\text{4}}$ TP) framework. Specifically, S $^{\text{4}}$ TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV&#39;s planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S $^{\text{4}}$ TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs&#39; trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S $^{\text{4}}$ TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within low-risk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left-turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S $^{\text{4}}$ TP in terms of safety and rationality. S $^{\text{4}}$ TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.},

  abstract     = {Time series vehicle state modelling is crucial in various real-world applications, such as fault detection, fault tolerance, optimization, and cyber security for intelligent vehicles (IVs). In this study, we propose a novel parallel time series modelling framework (PTSM) to forecast and detect vehicle braking cylinder pressure states, thereby enhancing the safety of the braking system. Specifically, the PTSM consists of two branches: LightNet and DarkNet. The LightNet learns time-series (TS) representations of real-world signals to forecasts and identifies vehicle states. On the other hand, the DarkNet employs a novel multi-task learning and dual Relativistic Generative Adversarial Network (dual-RaGAN) framework to reconstructs healthy sequential states, detects faults, and forecasts future vehicle states using synthesized faulty sequences. To develop the PTSM framework, we introduce a novel data processing and random fault synthesizing method. We evaluate the performance of the dual-RaGAN model using real-world data and compare it with non-adversarial approaches, demonstrating the efficiency of the multi-task generative sequential representation. Extensive experimental results show that by integrating knowledge from the dark side, real-world time-series modelling (TSM) for forecasting and fault detection can be significantly improved, with a 34.7% enhancement in forecasting and an 11% improvement in fault recognition. The results indicate that signal reconstruction leads to more accurate sequence forecasting and fault recognition in both the dark and light sides. This proposed study not only introduces a novel time-series modelling framework but also establishes a new approach for vehicle testing, fault detection, and cyber security research for intelligent vehicles.},

In driving scenarios, MTC can occur due to harsh conditions like tunnels, extended driving periods, high temperatures, object movements, and even desert driving. However, addressing MTC poses a significant challenge as it can lead to catastrophic forgetting (CF) issues due to domain shifts. To enhance robustness without encountering CF, we propose the unified stem block for corruption (USB-C). This approach overcomes CF by utilizing complete edge (CE), which not only represents the external edges of objects but also captures internal information. In addition, we introduce the DC-Converter, facilitating efficient CE extraction under MTC conditions using lightweight parameter isolation. Our method not only enhances robustness without CF-induced performance degradation but also achieves over 20 FPS on a single consumer-grade GPU with minimal additional memory usage. The performances are demonstrated through experiments on COCO-C and BDD100K benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates a model-agnostic property as it can be applied to two representative detectors, RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely utilized in intelligent vehicle systems, particularly in the field of driver distraction detection. However, existing methods in this application tend to focus solely on appearance or cognitive state as indicators of distraction, while neglecting the significance of temporal modeling in accurately identifying driver actions. This oversight can result in limitations such as difficulty in comprehending context, incapability to recognize gradual changes, and failure to capture complex behaviors. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a new framework based on the concept of Driver Digital Twin (DDT). The DDT framework serves as a digital replica of the driver, capturing their naturalistic driving data and behavioral models. It consists of a transformer-based driver action recognition module and a novel temporal localization module to detect distracted behaviors. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-labeled multi-task learning algorithm that includes driver emotion recognition as supplementary information for recognizing distractions. We have validated the effectiveness of our approach using three publicly available driver distraction detection benchmarks: SFDDD, AUCDD, and SynDD2. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both driver action recognition and temporal localization tasks. It outperforms the leading methods by 6.5 and 0.9 percentage points on SFDDD and AUCDD, respectively. Furthermore, it ranks in the top 5% on the SynDD2 leaderboard.},

This challenge is particularly critical in applications for autonomous vehicles where achieving multiple objectives while enforcing a certain number of system constraints is essential. We first revisit and design a control algorithm tailored to the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem. The developed algorithm consists of two distinct implicit MPCs, each addressing a specific control mode, namely velocity and space control. Multiple control objectives and constraints are integrated into the algorithm synthesis to ensure satisfactory control performance. We further adopt supervised learning with deep neural networks to reduce the computational cost of MPC, thereby making MPC more accessible for practical use. Simulation results affirm that the DNN-based approximated policy can match the control performance in terms of both tracking precision and constraint satisfaction of state-of-the-art solvers dedicated to optimization problems. Remarkably, the execution time of the approximated policy is approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of implicit MPCs, while its memory footprint is significantly lower than those of its counterparts, thereby emphasizing its distinct advantages.},

  abstract     = {As a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation accelerates, intelligent connected vehicles have emerged as carriers for advanced technology integration across industries and multiple fields. The intelligent cockpit serves as a comprehensive application space for various new technologies of intelligent connected vehicles, fostering integration among intelligent technology, products, and markets to form a virtuous circle. Developing intelligent cockpits helps to enhance the overall competitiveness and innovation capabilities of the industry, driving the growth of the intelligent automotive industry ecosystem. This paper proposes the definition of the intelligent cockpit for automobiles, classifying it into five levels from “functional cockpit” to “fully cognitive intelligent cockpit” based on the human-machine-environment perspective. The article also provides a preliminary description of the “3-horizontal-3-vertical” technical architecture of the intelligent cockpit and outlines the development roadmap. Additionally, the paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation index system and method for assessing the intelligence of automotive cockpits. By addressing these key aspects, we hope to shed light on the potential of intelligent cockpits in advancing the field of intelligent connected vehicles.},

In terms of kinematics, a distributed guidance law is introduced to track the time-varying trajectory of USV. In terms of kinetics, a fuzzy adaptive quantization control method rooted in an event-triggered mechanism is proposed. Uncertainties within the ship model are estimated through a fuzzy logic system, and a linear analytical model is employed to elucidate the input quantization process. This approach reduces the actuator&#39;s execution frequency, alleviates the communication burden and conserves valuable communication resources. The boundedness of the internal signals and quantization errors in the closed-loop system are substantiated by presenting some theoretical lemmas. Furthermore, the stability of the proposed control strategy is proved through Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed fuzzy adaptive quantization control strategy based on event-triggered mechanism are verified by simulation experiments.},

This letter aims at pushing the boundary of smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. We first summarize the current widely-used foundation models and the foundation intelligence needed for smart sensing of intelligent vehicles. We then explain Sora-based Parallel Vision to boost the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and final generalized intelligence (3.0).

In order to address this challenge for longitudinal control problems, we propose a scheme that integrates a performance-based controller with a safety-oriented controller in a seamless manner. This safe integration scheme operates instantaneously, and it is compatible with a large class of controllers. We first link this practical integration method to the theoretical framework of control barrier functions that endows controllers with formal safety guarantees. Then, through this scheme we safely integrate a predictive-type controller minimizing energy consumption (predictive cruise control—PCC) with a safety-oriented cruise controller structure relying on connectivity (connected cruise control—CCC). Importantly, the efficacy of the safe and seamless integration between the PCC and the CCC is demonstrated using on-road experiments with a full-scale connected automated truck. Initial experimental campaign is held on a closed test track, and safe driving is achieved thanks to the CCC while up to 18% energy saving is obtained thanks to the PCC. Finally, experiments are extended to a public highway, and similar results are obtained with up to 4.3% energy saving.},

  abstract     = {Controlling automated vehicles on large lane-free roundabouts is challenging because of the geometrical complexity and frequent conflicts among entering, rotating, and exiting vehicles. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to control the vehicles within the roundabout and the connected road branches. The developed real-time vehicle movement strategy relies on offline-computed wide overlapping movement corridors, one for each Origin-Destination (OD) movement, which delineate the admissible movement zones of corresponding OD vehicles. Also, space-dependent desired orientations are determined by destination, so as to mitigate potential vehicle conflicts and reduce trip distance. A distributed (per vehicle) movement control strategy, using two nonlinear feedback controllers (NLFC), for circular and straight movements, respectively, is employed to navigate each vehicle within the respective OD corridor toward its destination, accounting for the desired orientation and avoiding collisions with other vehicles; while boundary controllers guarantee that the corridor boundaries will not be violated, and the exit will not be missed. As an overly complicated case study, we consider the famous roundabout of Place Charles de Gaulle in Paris, featuring a width of 38 m and comprising a dozen of bidirectional radial streets, hence a total of 144 ODs. The pertinence and effectiveness of the presented method is verified via microscopic simulation and evaluation of macroscopic data.},

In this article, we tackle the problem of workload estimation from driving performance data. First, we present a novel on-road study for collecting subjective workload data via a modified peripheral detection task in naturalistic settings. Key environmental factors that induce a high mental workload are identified via video analysis, e.g. junctions and behaviour of vehicle in front. Second, a supervised learning framework using state-of-the-art time series classifiers (e.g. convolutional neural network and transform techniques) is introduced to profile drivers based on the average workload they experience during a journey. A Bayesian filtering approach is then proposed for sequentially estimating, in (near) real-time, the driver&#39;s instantaneous workload. This computationally efficient and flexible method can be easily personalised to a driver (e.g. incorporate their inferred average workload profile), adapted to driving/environmental contexts (e.g. road type) and extended with data streams from new sources. The efficacy of the presented profiling and instantaneous workload estimation approaches are demonstrated using the on-road study data, showing $F_{1}$ scores of up to 92% and 81%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a disturbance-parametrized (DP) robust lattice-based motion-planning framework for nonlinear systems affected by bounded disturbances. A key idea in this work is to rigorously exploit the available knowledge about the disturbance, starting already offline at the time when a library of DP motion primitives is computed and ending not before the motion has been executed online. Given an up-to-date-estimate of the disturbance, the lattice-based motion planner performs a graph search online, to non-conservatively compute a disturbance aware optimal motion plan with formally motivated margins to obstacles. This is done utilizing the DP motion primitives, around which tubes are generated utilizing a suitably designed robust controller. The sizes of the tubes are dependent on the upper bounds of the disturbance appearing in the error between the actual system trajectory and the DP nominal trajectory, which in turn along with the overall optimality of the plan is dependant on the user-selected resolution of the available disturbance estimates. Increasing the resolution of the disturbance parameter results in smaller sizes of tubes around the motion primitives and can significantly reduce the conservativeness compared to traditional approaches, thus increasing the performance of the computed motion plans. The proposed strategy is implemented on an Euler-Lagrange dynamics based ship model which is affected by a significant wind disturbance and the efficiency of the strategy is validated through a suitable simulation example.},

To overcome these shortcomings, the original model of the non-ego vehicle is translated into three separate models for speed, orientation, and position. Three stable observers are designed for these models which are all shown to be stable and robust to uncertainties, in addition to requiring low computational effort. The new estimation algorithm outperforms previous observers in both simulations and experimental results. The developed observer can be especially valuable for use with low-cost sensors in collision prediction and avoidance applications.},

One common perception task is 3D object detection, which aims at perceiving location and attributes of dynamic objects. This task is typically evaluated on different benchmark datasets, which each propose different metrics. However, these different metrics generally lack consistency and bear no relation to safety. Most notably, there is a lack of consistent definitions of pass/fail criteria for any given detection metric. In this work, the issue is addressed by systematically considering safety and human performance across different aspects of the object detection task. This approach yields interpretable detection metrics as well as thresholds for pass/fail criteria. Furthermore, a validation approach leveraging a prediction network is introduced and successfully applied to the requirements. A comparison of existing detectors shows that current perception algorithms exhibit failures for a majority of objects on the nuScenes dataset. Therefore, the results indicate the necessity of explicit safety consideration in the development of perception algorithms for the automated driving task.},

  abstract     = {TheNormal Distribution Transform Occupancy Map (NDT OM) is a mapping algorithm able to represent a dynamic 3D environment. The resulting map has fixed boundaries, thus a robot with unbounded displacement might fall outside of the map due to memory limitation. In this paper, a recentering algorithm called NDT RC is proposed to avoid this issue. NDT RC extends the use of NDT OM for vehicles with unbounded displacements. NDT RC provides a seamless translation of the map as the robot gets far from the center of the previous map. The influence of NDT RC on the precision of the estimated trajectory of the robot, or odometry, is examined on two publicly available datasets, the KITTI and Ford datasets. An analysis of the sensitivity of the NDT RC to its tuning parameters is carried out using the Ford dataset, while the KITTI dataset is used to measure the influence of the density of the input point cloud. The results show that the proposed recentering strategy improves the accuracy of the odometry calculated by registering the latest lidar scan on the generated map compared to other NDT based approaches (NDT OM, NDT OM Fusion, SE-NDT). In particular, the proposed method, which does not perform loop closure, reduces the mean absolute translation error by 16% and the runtime by 88% compared to the NDT OM Fusion on the Ford dataset.},

This article presents a satisfactory driving mode classification that enhances the driver&#39;s satisfaction by providing a suitable driving mode to the driver. Unlike the conventional algorithm based on driving style recognition, the proposed approach determines the changes required for the current driving mode, such as mode-up, -stay, -down. Features suitable for classification are extracted from the driver&#39;s pedal operation characteristics during specific situations, such as launch, acceleration while driving. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through nested cross-validation, compared with conventional algorithms based on driving style recognition, demonstrating its superiority, generality. The proposed algorithm is event-based, operates in real-time while driving. As a result, it provides a more reliable, effective solution for enhancing driver satisfaction by providing an appropriate driving mode.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in vehicle safety, roadway accidents remain a substantial danger. To bring about safer vehicles, researchers and manufacturers continue to develop new systems to assist drivers in dangerous situations. Current approaches often implement several independent systems, each of which can assist in only specific situations, leaving open critical paths for accidents to occur. We propose a general approach to driver assistance based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). This system can intervene in both lateral and longitudinal commands to keep the vehicle safely within the boundaries of the road, but allows the driver freedom to maneuver the vehicle as they wish when they act safely. This work builds on previous MPC approaches by incorporating a notion of safe operating speed. Properly modulating speed ensures the vehicle&#39;s limits are never exceeded, and not reached unless necessary. Experimental results on a full-size steer-, brake-, and throttle-by-wire vehicle, validate the performance of this system. These experiments show that the controller effectively matches the driver&#39;s commands when possible but will deviate from those commands when necessary for safe operation.},

Camera Placement Optimization (CPO) methods tailored for multi-camera networks to maximize a vehicle&#39;s surrounding view coverage are limited. While existing CPO methods tend to sample the simulation space to work in the discrete domain using integer programming-based problem formulation, this article proposes a novel approach to optimize for camera poses for vehicle surround-view in the continuous domain using gradient-free blackbox optimization techniques by defining a non-linear objective function. Experimental results on more than 100 instances of real world 3D models of vehicles of various shapes and sizes show that the proposed method is effective in maximizing coverage for vehicle surround-view by a multiple camera network in a reasonable amount of time. Comparisons against a discrete CPO formulation show that the proposed method significantly improves coverage accuracy by optimizing poses of multiple cameras for vehicle surround-view.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving detection is crucial for avoiding serious traffic accidents. Changes in sleep conditions affect the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and, subsequently, heart rate variability (HRV), which is fluctuation in the R-R interval (RRI) in an electrocardiogram (ECG). HRV is easy to measure with a wearable sensor, and it may be possible to use HRV to detect drowsy driving. In conventional HRV-based drowsy driving detection methods, some HRV features are extracted from RRI data for analysis, but it may result in the loss of time-series characteristics of the RRI data. This study proposes a new driver drowsiness detection method that can detect abnormal changes in the RRI data caused by drowsiness. The proposed method employs a self-attention autoencoder (SA-AE), which is a type of neural network that can utilize time series characteristics. An experiment with a driving simulator was performed to evaluate the drowsiness detection performance of the proposed method. In this experiment, RRI data were collected from 20 participants (nonprofessional drivers) while driving, whose sleep conditions were scored by a sleep specialist based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. The experimental result showed that the proposed RRI-based drowsiness detection method detected 16 out of 18 sleep-related events while driving (sensitivity of 88%), and a false-positive rate of 0.60 times per hour was achieved. In addition, we validated the proposed method employing 18 middle-aged professional drivers. The proposed drowsiness detection method would contribute to preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving in the future.},

  abstract     = {Conditional Imitation learning is a common and effective approach to train autonomous driving agents. However, two issues limit the full potential of this approach: (i) the inertia problem, a special case of causal confusion where the agent mistakenly correlates low speed with no acceleration, and (ii) low correlation between offline and online performance due to the accumulation of small errors that brings the agent in a previously unseen state. Both issues are critical for state-aware models, yet informing the driving agent of its internal state as well as the state of the environment is of crucial importance. In this article we propose a multi-task learning agent based on a multi-stage vision transformer with state token propagation. We feed the state of the vehicle along with the representation of the environment as a special token of the transformer and propagate it throughout the network. This allows us to tackle the aforementioned issues from different angles: guiding the driving policy with learned stop/go information, performing data augmentation directly on the state of the vehicle and visually explaining the model&#39;s decisions. We report a drastic decrease in inertia and a high correlation between offline and online metrics.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, estimating the position of an ego-vehicle and the distance between the vehicle and detected obstacles are very important. Visual-based methods have been used to estimate a camera pose equipped in the vehicle with successive images. Until now, Perspective-n-Point (PnP) based methods for estimating the position of a camera by calculating the world coordinates of three or more feature points and corresponding 3-dimensional object points have been used. This article proposes a novel camera center estimation method based on an Essential matrix and Perspective one Point (EP1P). This method employing epipolar geometry and geometrical constraints overcomes the limitation of the translation matrix, which is derived from the essential matrix to estimate camera center coordinates. To solve this problem, we performed coordinates formulation and derivation of equations for three consecutive images. To verify the accuracy of the proposed EP1P method and equations, simulations and experiments for the proposed method and several PnP-based methods have been performed. The results show that the proposed method has better performance than the existing methods. Since the proposed EP1P method needs only one feature point and a corresponding 3-dimensional object point, and the approach is different from the existing PnP-based methods with complex calculations, this would be a good alternative to estimate the vehicle position and surrounding objects’ position using the camera in limited situations.},

Our approach incorporates a hybrid machine learning approach that combines asynchronous federated learning (AFL) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to jointly optimize task completion rate, energy consumption, and delay parameters, enhancing overall system efficiency. We instantiate a DT infrastructure within a UAV-assisted IoV network for V2V and V2I task offloading with three task processing modes and three types of tasks. The DT network is composed of three distinct DTs: task vehicles, service vehicles, and roadside units. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the system efficiency while concurrently minimizing delay and total energy consumption. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we introduce a multi-agent DRL algorithm named MARS for resource allocation within the DT-assisted IoV network. This innovative algorithm, MARS, is trained to utilize a hybrid AFL approach referred to as HAFL. MARS optimizes the allocation of resources across various modes of computation, striving to maximize the system&#39;s overall utility. Finally, our proposed approach&#39;s effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulation results, where it is compared against various benchmark schemes for evaluation.},

Previous studies that imitate NMPC have proven its control performance and computation efficiency. However, there were limitations in applying to vehicle collision avoidance systems. Despite its dangerous situation, data set for imitation should be obtained by experiments using the controlled plant, and weaknesses in handling model parameters were shown. Therefore, this article proposes a novel IL-based control structure suitable for collision avoidance systems that overcame such limitations by building a feedforward feedback structure so that the data set trained for imitation can be made offline and applying an input dimensionalization process to ensure robustness to parameter changes.

Planning a collision-free trajectory that includes velocity and path is one of the most challenging objectives. Optimization-based trajectory planners have been proposed in many previous studies because they offer a high degree of freedom and can handle various situations. However, most previous trajectory planners used nonlinear programming due to the nonlinearity or non-convexity of the optimization problem. These methods come with a high computational load. The trajectory planner requires the real-time ability to cope with dynamically changing environments. This article focuses on the trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles through quadratic programming (QP), which requires a low computational load. To achieve this, we introduce the longitudinal-lateral decomposition method. In addition, collision-free constraints are expressed as linear constraints through proposed ingenious dual functions. The proposed weak duality optimization problem has a QP form and optimized trajectory and obstacle avoidance timing through only one QP problem. This study verified that the proposed trajectory planner could plan smooth collision-free maneuvers for several driving situations by simulations.},

To address this type of scenario, a key technology called Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged, which enables the training of optimal cooperative policies among agents. However, traditional value decomposition methods suffer from unstable convergence when the number of agents increases. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel algorithm based on centralized learning that employs a self-advice module to replace the joint action, thereby reducing the algorithmic complexity. The proposed algorithm uses the Joint Action Learning (JAL) concept to find an optimal approach and a collision controller module that was designed to further mitigate the risk of collisions. A comparison of the algorithm proposed is carried out with two benchmark algorithms. The first one focuses on decomposing the reward signal and the second one trains a different actor-critic network for each agent. Furthermore, multiple target points are defined to enhance cooperative scenarios during the learning process. According to the results, the proposed approach outperforms the two benchmarks by 8% and 49%, thus highlighting the effectiveness of the centralized learning approach in multi-agent systems.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, an accurate understanding of the environment, e.g., the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-lane interactions, plays a critical role in many driving tasks, such as trajectory prediction and motion planning. Environment information comes from high-definition maps and historical trajectories of vehicles. To interpret and utilize such information for the two aforementioned driving tasks, both learning-based models and mathematical methods have been proposed, while these existing approaches suffer from the following issues. Specifically, due to the heterogeneity of the map data and trajectory data, many learning-based models extract vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-lane interactions in a separate and sequential manner, which may capture biased interpretations of interactions, causing lower prediction and planning accuracy. As for the mathematical models, the environment information is mainly used to characterize the collision-free space, while the interactions are largely ignored. To address the above issues, we propose an environment representation, called Temporal Occupancy Flow Graph (TOFG). Specifically, TOFG unifies the map information and vehicle trajectories into a homogeneous data format and enables a consistent prediction. We incorporate TOFG with a graph attention (GAT) based neural network and propose TOFG-GAT to demonstrate the benefit of TOFG to learning-based trajectory prediction and motion planning. Moreover, we design and implement an interaction-aware sampling strategy based on TOFG to improve the mathematical sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Extensive experiment results show that our proposed TOFG can contribute to the trajectory prediction and motion planning tasks by improving the quality of the generated trajectory and computation efficiency for both the learning-based and mathematical models.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the trajectories of pedestrians is critical for developing safe advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving systems. Most existing models for pedestrian trajectory prediction focused on a single dataset without considering the transferability to other previously unseen datasets. This leads to poor performance on new unseen datasets and hinders leveraging off-the-shelf labeled datasets and models. In this article, we propose a transferable model, namely the “Spatial-Temporal-Spectral (STS) LSTM” model, that represents the motion pattern of pedestrians with spatial, temporal, and spectral domain information. Quantitative results and visualizations indicate that our proposed spatial-temporal-spectral representation enables the model to learn generic motion patterns and improves the performance on both source and target datasets. We reveal the transferability of three commonly used network structures, including long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers, and employ the LSTM structure with negative log-likelihood loss in our model since it has the best transferability. The proposed STS LSTM model demonstrates good prediction accuracy when transferring to target datasets without any prior knowledge, and has a faster inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art models. Our work addresses the gap in learning knowledge from source datasets and transferring it to target datasets in the field of pedestrian trajectory prediction, and enables the reuse of publicly available off-the-shelf datasets.},

To tackle the uncertainty, the exogenous system in augmented form is constructed that includes all the available information of elements in the known finite set.

Combined with the sector property of nonlinear function in the exogenous system, sufficient conditions guaranteeing the exponential stability of unconstrained error variable of the closed-loop system with the designed controller are derived.

  abstract     = {Cooperative driving in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment has received increasing attention over the years due to its ability to enhance driving safety and efficiency. For a cooperative driving task that requires speed adaptation, the recommended speed is displayed through human-machine interface (HMI). The design of HMI is expected to affect drivers’ compliance and understanding of recommended speed and thus impact the driving performance. However, the effects of HMI design on cooperative driving performance are yet to be explored. In this study, three HMIs were designed: $\Delta {\bm{v}}$ HMI (baseline, displays the speed difference between optimal and current driving speed), $\Delta {\bm{t}}$ HMI (displays the time difference between optimal and estimated arrival time), and $\Delta {\bm{v}}$ -graphic HMI (displays the speed difference using a variable graphic form). The HMI designs follow the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) taxonomy. To test the effects of the HMI design on cooperative driving performance, we developed a multi-driver driving co-simulation platform, which can simulate a cooperative driving environment and thus verify the HMI design. Driving simulator experiment shows that the $\Delta {\bm{t}}$ HMI deteriorated the speed adaptation accuracy, while the $\Delta {\bm{v}}$ -graphic HMI improved the driving performance. The questionnaire data revealed that the participants preferred the $\Delta {\bm{v}}$ -graphic HMI, as it was highly rated in terms of system usability and user experience. The findings of this study provide insights for the HMI design for cooperative driving applications.},

  abstract     = {Key-point-based scene understanding is fundamental for autonomous driving applications. At the same time, optical flow plays an important role in many vision tasks. However, due to the implicit bias of equal attention on all points, classic data-driven optical flow estimation methods yield less satisfactory performance on key points, limiting their implementations in key-point-critical safety-relevant scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a points-based modeling method that requires the model to learn key-point-related priors explicitly. Based on the modeling method, we present FocusFlow, a framework consisting of 1) a mix loss function combined with a classic photometric loss function and our proposed Conditional Point Control Loss (CPCL) function for diverse point-wise supervision; 2) a conditioned controlling model which substitutes the conventional feature encoder by our proposed Condition Control Encoder (CCE). CCE incorporates a Frame Feature Encoder (FFE) that extracts features from frames, a Condition Feature Encoder (CFE) that learns to control the feature extraction behavior of FFE from input masks containing information of key points, and fusion modules that transfer the controlling information between FFE and CFE. Our FocusFlow framework shows outstanding performance with up to ${+}44.5\%$ precision improvement on various key points such as ORB, SIFT, and even learning-based SiLK, along with exceptional scalability for most existing data-driven optical flow methods like PWC-Net, RAFT, and FlowFormer. Notably, FocusFlow yields competitive or superior performances rivaling the original models on the whole frame.},

In this article, we propose the decentralized onboard in-depth coordination method. As a premise, we anticipate that each UAV could receive the states of the neighboring UAVs in a wide range with advanced wireless communication devices. Therefore, each UAV is able to determine the surroundings of itself and the UAVs that conflict with it. A two-layered in-depth coordination method is proposed. In the first layer, each conflict-involved UAV determines the maneuver constraints and conflict avoidance responsibilities of itself and its neighbors based on the rules-based coordination method. In the second layer, each UAV determines appropriate conflict avoidance maneuvers according to the in-depth coordination mechanism independently. The safe separation requirements of the neighboring UAVs are considered. Furthermore, we extend the in-depth coordination method to the bio-inspired UAV flocks coordination method with reference to the behaviors of biological flocks. The virtual UAVs are constructed to promote the connections between UAVs in terms of conflict resolution, so that the boundary UAVs would take appropriate heading maneuvers to make room for the practical conflict-involved UAVs. We validate our approach on representative scenarios, and the results demonstrate that our method is beneficial in reducing the impact on the air traffic, and is capable of dealing with complex conflict scenarios.},

Furthermore, a linear weighted shared driving strategy is designed to dynamically allocate the driving weight based on the level of driving risk and human-machine conflict.

It can adapt its prediction ability according to the severity of the weather, and gives high priority to the importance classes (such as road, person and car) when the conditions are too severe to maintain the accuracy of all classes. Importance biased module uses multi-branch decoder to divide the segmentation task into simplified sub-problems, and this divide-and-conquer strategy improves the robustness of the model especially under the severe hazardous conditions; class crosstalk module explicitly represents the sematic-level correlations between the classes, which enhances the information sharing among sub-problems. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Especially for severe weather conditions, 5∼6% accuracy improvements have been obtained for the important classes on both synthetic and real data.},

Generally, due to inaccurate data associations and the existence of outliers, it is a challenging task to estimate ego-motions reliably and efficiently given sparse and complexly distributed point clouds in outdoor environments. In this article, we propose an unsupervised method for LiDAR odometry, named HPPLO-Net, to predict the relative pose of a LiDAR sensor in a hierarchical way. Specifically, we achieve accurate 6-DoF (Degree of Freedom) pose estimation between the source and target point clouds using a differentiable Point-to-Plane solver with the assistance of scene flow. The novel Point-to-Plane solver consists of a multi-scale aggregation (MSA) normal estimation layer and a differentiable weighted Point-to-Plane SVD module. The MSA layer is introduced to find reliable normal vectors of the pseudo target point cloud by aggregating multi-scale contextual information. The differentiable weighted Point-to-Plane SVD is embedded in the network to solve the pose matrix and alleviate the problem of lacking accurate data association in two LiDAR scans, which exists in the point-to-point alternatives. To reduce the impact of noises and outliers, our method can learn and update the inlier mask and the (residual) flow uncertainty at each layer of the hierarchy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the KITTI Odometry Dataset, Ford Campus Vision and Lidar DataSet, and the Apollo-SouthBay Dataset. Our method has achieved superior performance than recent unsupervised learning-based methods and some traditional geometry-based methods and has also achieved promising performance close to A-LOAM with mapping optimization.},

  abstract     = {Merge scenarios on highway are often challenging for autonomous driving, due to its lack of sufficient tacit understanding on and subtle interaction with human drivers in the traffic flow. This, as a result, may impose serious safety risks, and often cause traffic jam with autonomous driving. Therefore, human-like autonomous driving becomes important, yet imperative. This article presents an interaction-aware decision-making and planning method for human-like autonomous driving in merge scenarios. Rather than directly mimicking human behavior, deep inverse reinforcement learning is employed to learn the human-used reward function for decision-making and planning from naturalistic driving data to enhance interpretability and generalizability. To consider the interaction factor, the reward function for planning is utilized to evaluate the joint trajectories of the autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) and traffic vehicles. In contrast to predicting trajectories of traffic vehicles with the fixed trajectory of ADV given by the upstream prediction model, the trajectories of traffic vehicles are predicted by responding to the ADV&#39;s behavior in this article. Additionally, the decision-making module is employed to reduce the solution space of planning via the selection of a proper gap for merging. Both the decision-making and planning algorithms follow a “sampling, evaluation, and selection” framework. After being verified through experiments, the results indicate that the planned trajectories with the presented method are highly similar to those of human drivers. Moreover, compared to the interaction-unaware planning method, the interaction-aware planning method behaves closer to human drivers.},

For autonomous driving vehicles, efficiently and timely processing the ever-increasing data is critical. In real traffic scenes, the task-processing efficiency is closely related to the traffic flows. However, the traffic flow modeling is always ignored or considered roughly in the most existing studies. For this issue, a traffic model based on a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to simulate a real traffic environment of autonomous driving vehicles. To reduce the cost of processing tasks, a distributed computation offloading scheme based on mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed by soliciting nearby vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) with rich computing resources. For the average cost minimization optimization problem, we divide the NP-hard problem into several sub-problems and take advantage of the Lagrange multiplier with KKT constraints to solve by optimizing task splitting ratios. We compare the proposed traffic model with some common ones and also consider the pros and cons of different computation offloading strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms other benchmarks and the proposed modeling method is rational.},

  abstract     = {Multi-vehicle coordinated motion planning has always been challenged to safely and efficiently resolve conflicts under non-holonomic dynamic constraints. Constructing spatial-temporal corridors for multi-vehicle can decouple the high-dimensional conflicts and further reduce the difficulty of obtaining feasible trajectories. Therefore, this article proposes a novel hierarchical multi-vehicle coordinated motion planning method based on interactive spatio-temporal corridors (ISTCs). In the first layer, based on the initial guidance trajectories, Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming is designed to construct ISTCs capable of resolving conflicts in generic multi-vehicle scenarios. And then in the second layer, Non-Linear Programming is settled to generate in-corridor trajectories that satisfy the vehicle dynamics. By introducing ISTCs, the multi-vehicle coordinated motion planning problem is able to be decoupled into single-vehicle trajectory optimization problems, which greatly decentralizes the computational pressure and has great potential for real-world applications. Besides, the proposed method searches for feasible solutions in the 3-D $(x,y,t)$ configuration space, preserving more possibilities than the traditional velocity-path decoupling method. Simulated experiments in unsignalized intersection and challenging dense scenarios have been conducted to verify the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian and Vehicle Detection (PVD) is important to auto-driving. However, existing deep-network-based PVD methods suffer from a low inference speed due to large redundancy computations. In order to ensure detection accuracy while increasing the computing efficiency of PVD, we propose an orthogonal re-parameterized method. First, we design a Ghost Structural Re-parameterized (GS-ReP) module, which is an efficient multibranch structure that combines the low computational ghost method to generate rich features and the structural re-parameterization to simplify the multi-branch structure into a single-branch structure. Second, we propose a Feature Orthogonal Loss (FOL) function to further reduce redundancies between features from different branches of GS-ReP, producing low redundancy features useful for detection accuracy. Third, we integrate our GS-ReP to the small version of the fifth You Only Look Once (YOLOv5-s) model to raise Orthogonal Re-parameterized Networks (ORNet). Extensive experiments show that our ORNet method obtains state-of-the-art results. On the public KITTI dataset, ORNet&#39;s mean average precision reaches 91.01%, and only costs 5.5 M parameters. On the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX embedded device, for 640 × 640 sized images, the Frames Per Second (FPS) of ORNet varies in [25.9, 31.7] depending on the batch size setting.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic, accurate, and predictive conflict detection is crucial for ensuring collision-free movement and efficient route planning for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Timely alarms based on detection enable AGVs to efficiently plan collision-free routes. However, existing conflict detection methods typically do not consider the above elements simultaneously, either making assumptions that reduce the accuracy of applications, such as assuming constant vehicle speed (value of velocity), or focusing on real-time physical collisions but ignoring the future vehicle moving state. In this article, we propose a dynamic AGV conflict detection scheme with time windows to detect possible AGV conflicts timely. The proposed scheme fully considers the accuracy, dynamics, and predictability requirements of detection, which encompasses the following three components: preliminary conflict detection, potential motion trajectory generation, and conflict detection and alarm. In particular, for conflict detection and alarm where potential conflicts trigger corresponding alarm reminders, we have observed that the AGV conflict occurrence conditions within a specific time window can be mathematically expressed as a binary quadratic inequality, then conflict alarms between two AGVs can be efficiently calculated. Our proposed scheme could help dynamically and accurately detect potential AGV conflicts within the planned time window, and the speed fluctuation of the AGV is also fully considered. Experiment results on several sets of simulation scenarios prove the applicability and effectiveness of our scheme.},

This context is common for ground vehicles, especially those traveling on urban roads, leading to a significant deterioration in translational calibration performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel targetless Lidar-camera calibration method based on cross-modality structure consistency.

Moreover, it achieves highly accurate translation calibration even in challenging scenarios.

However, traditional monocular VO methods always suffer from sparse environment maps which cannot be directly used for navigation because of the lack of structural information. In this article, we propose a navigation-oriented LiDAR-guided monocular visual odometry and mapping (NALO-VOM) to obtain scale-consistent camera poses and a semi-dense environment map which is more suitable for navigation of UGVs. The structure representation ability of the 3D LiDAR point cloud is learned by a major-plane prediction network and then transferred into the monocular VO system in NALO-VOM. As a result, NALO-VOM can construct a more dense and high-quality map using only a monocular camera. To be specific, the major-plane prediction network is trained offline using 3D LiDAR geometric information, which predicts major-plane mask (MP-Mask) for each frame of the visual image during the localization. Then, MP-Mask is used for scale optimization and semi-dense map building. Experiments are performed on the public dataset and self-collected sequences. The results show the competitive performance on the localization accuracy and mapping quality compared with other visual odometry methods.},

First, a graph attention network is constructed to encode the motion state and local interactions between vehicles at each historical timestamp. Then a bi-axial Transformer is introduced to alternately update the global interaction and vehicle motion features. At the same time, a multi-scale structure is proposed to fuse the high-level behavior logic and low-level motion primitives of the agent vehicle. Finally, a trajectory decoder is used to output multi-modal vehicle trajectories. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the Argoverse1 Forecasting dataset. The experimental results show that all metrics of this method were better than the no-HD map ablations of mainstream prediction models, and even better than some mainstream prediction methods with HD map encoding. In addition, a Lidar-based physical perception platform was set up on an experimental vehicle, and the generalization capability of the proposed method was validated in real traffic scenes.},

However, the challenge lies in effectively representing and learning from the interactions between heterogeneous traffic agents, as well as the complex traffic states they produce. To address this, we propose the Multi-View Graph Convolution Network Reinforcement Learning (MVGRL) algorithm for the decision-making and control of CAVs in mixed traffic scenarios. First, multi-view graphs are constructed based on multiple logical correlations and the perception-communication relationship of heterogeneous vehicles in mixed traffic. This enables us to represent the dynamic vehicle networks and gain insights into vehicle behavior. Then, the features of multi-view vehicle network graphs are derived by multi-view graph convolutional network reinforcement learning. Finally, the lane change decisions of CAVs are obtained based on complex traffic state learning. In the highway scenario, the model is able to control the CAVs to complete the ramp exit task and maintain an overall efficient traffic flow. Various test scenarios were formed by adjusting the traffic conditions under a highway off-ramp scenario for comparison experiments. The results show that the proposed MVGRL algorithm model outperforms in decision-making and robustness than the baseline models.},

In order to mitigate motion sickness in automated vehicles, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm that minimizes the distribution of acceleration energy within the frequency range that is found to be the most nauseogenic. The algorithm is formulated into integral and receding-horizon variants and compared with a commonly used alternative approach aiming to minimize accelerations in general. The proposed approach can reduce frequency-weighted acceleration by up to 11.3% compared with not considering the frequency sensitivity for the price of reduced overall acceleration comfort. Our simulation studies also reveal a loss of performance by the receding-horizon approach over the integral approach when varying the preview time and nominal sampling time. The computation time of the receding-horizon planner is around or below the real-time threshold when using a longer sampling time but without causing significant performance loss. We also present the results of experiments conducted to measure the performance of human drivers on a public road section that the simulated scenario is actually based on. The proposed method can achieve a 19% improvement in general acceleration comfort or a 32% reduction in squared motion sickness dose value over the best-performing participant. The results demonstrate considerable potential for improving motion comfort and mitigating motion sickness using our approach in automated vehicles.},

Focused on predicting a five degree-of-freedom extrinsic pose, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN) that implements the regression of rotation angles of two cameras. The proposed method increases regression accuracy using the information inherent in the entire image. To this end, the CNN divides the image into patches of a certain size, extracts detailed features and context features of the patches, and extracts attention information for patches belonging to the left and right images. Training and evaluating the CNN requires many stereo images with variations from the initial setup of the cameras. We solve this problem using miscalibration. In miscalibration, angles expected to be rotated for the three axes of the left and right cameras are randomly sampled within a range of ±2.5°, and a pair of rectified images are transformed using the sampled angles. The CNN uses these transformed images to infer the angle at which the camera axis is expected to have been rotated. Then, the pair of transformed images are corrected with these inferred angles. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated using the KITTI odometry dataset and the GY dataset we built.},

  abstract     = {Although the existing autonomous driving systems (ADS) can implement lane-change behaviors without human operation, they still rely on the lane-change decisions made by human drivers in a complex traffic environment. The reason is that human drivers can reasonably estimate the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance, and decide their own driving trajectory according to their driving experiences. Therefore, the future ADS needs to learn the ability of human beings to predict the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles. Alternatively, it needs to make safer lane-change decisions than human beings without sacrificing the possibility as much as possible. This article develops a Lane-Change Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (LC-RSS) model to improve the safety of lane-change decisions and solve the above research gap. A novel lane-change trajectory planning method is proposed, which considers multiple interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles with realistic position constraints and fuel consumption optimization. Specifically, it combines the lane-change prediction of surrounding vehicles to provide a more reasonable recommended lane-change trajectory for the ego vehicle, therefore, could enhance the safety constraints from the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model introduced in the latest published 2846-2022-IEEE Standard. The simulation results have shown that by considering lane-changing prediction in the trajectory planning module, LC-RSS not only enhances the safety of a single vehicle&#39;s recommended trajectory but also increases the traffic flow speed of the urban transportation system.},

  abstract     = {Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is an emerging technology that has the potential to significantly improve traffic safety and efficiency through various applications such as pedestrian alerts, traffic hazard warnings, signal timing information broadcasting, etc. With the help of the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s agreement to waive restrictive rules on C-V2X deployment, extensive real-world testing and implementation of C-V2X is on the horizon. However, the performance of C-V2X in urban environments remains unclear as existing studies have been focusing on evaluating it in either simulated or highway environments. To facilitate the understanding of its performance in urban environments, this study has conducted a systematic evaluation of the efficiency and reliability of C-V2X using various metrics based on real-world data collected through roadside units (RSUs) and onboard units in urban environments. Experimental results indicate that C-V2X has relatively stable efficiency (i.e., latency) under different conditions. However, its reliability (i.e., packet error rate and spatial delivery rate) is significantly affected by multiple factors, including the distance from the vehicle to the RSU and to its surrounding buildings. Moreover, this study has proposed a concept of machine learning-assisted RSU planning to facilitate the planning and deployment of C-V2X in urban areas. An XGBoost model is developed to accurately estimate the probability of the delivery of V2X messages using C-V2X. Results from explaining the model suggest that the planning of RSUs should consider the spacing of RSUs and the density of buildings in the area.},

  abstract     = {Collecting relevant and high-quality data is critical to machine-learning-based application development in automotive industry. It is highly desired to concentrate the connected vehicle data collection efforts on a set of useful data to avoid irrelevant or redundant data. For a given machine learning (ML) task, without a priori information, it can be challenging to determine what features to collect. In this work, we propose an efficient data collection workflow featuring a loop involving a connected vehicle fleet, a ML algorithm and a feedback-based dynamic feature selection strategy. The feature selection process is embedded in the data collection workflow, therefore it is more efficient than the traditional workflow where feature selection is applied after all data are collected. The proposed workflow reduces data transmission and storage cost. A feature selection algorithm that exploits and explores feature sets using an upper-confidence-bound-based method is designed for the trade-off between collecting known useful data and collecting potentially useful data. Validations are performed on two classification tasks to mimic the connected vehicle data collection: a synthetic problem based on a public ML dataset, and a robot ground surface classification problem with experiment data in a simulated data collection environment. The proposed method is tested against several baseline methods, including collecting all available data before feature selection, collecting random features, and running the data collection procedure episodically with embedded feature selection. Results show that the proposed algorithm in the closed-loop procedure achieves adequate performance with relatively few irrelevant and redundant data.},

  abstract     = {When a vehicle hits a pothole, the reaction force of the pothole on the tire causes an imbalance in the driving forces on both sides of the vehicle and may cause the wheels to jump, potentially resulting in path deviation and roll instability. To address these issues, a cooperative control system for path tracking and driving stability is proposed. Roll stability is achieved by the roll moment generated by reasonably distributing the driving torque among the four IWMs. The necessary roll moment is calculated by the designed robust sliding mode control (RSMC), which enhances the transient performance of H ∞ by 48.9%. The path tracking is ensured by active front steering (AFS) based on model predictive control (MPC), and the front wheel angle is used as the disturbance of the stability control. Simulation and bench test results demonstrate that the developed controller can maintain vehicle stability even when the greatest path deviation is 0.03 m, whereas conventional direct yaw-moment control (DYC) and AFS controllers fail to achieve the same level of control. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and serve as a reference for cooperative control on potholed roads.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Bird&#39;s-Eye-View (BEV) representation has gained increasing attention in multi-view 3D object detection, demonstrating promising applications in autonomous driving. Although multi-view camera-based systems can be deployed at a low cost, high-performance multi-view BEV object detectors still require significant computational resources. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the most practical techniques to train smaller yet accurate models. Different from image classification tasks, BEV 3D object detection approaches are more complicated and consist of several components. Therefore, in this article, we propose a unified framework named BEV-LGKD to transfer knowledge in a teacher-student manner. However, directly applying the teacher-student paradigm to BEV features fails to achieve satisfying results due to heavy background information in RGB cameras. To solve this problem, we propose to leverage the localization advantage of LiDAR points. Specifically, we transform the LiDAR points into BEV space and generate the view-dependent foreground masks for the teacher-student paradigm. It is noted that our method only uses LiDAR points to guide the KD between RGB models. As the quality of depth estimation is crucial for BEV perception, we further introduce depth distillation to our framework. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on nuScenes dataset, bringing a maximum improvement of +3.5% mAP and +6.2% NDS for the student model.},

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol has smoother control input since the fractional gain is adaptive, and it is more robust since it is not time-based. The results of the simulation show that the convergence rate is faster and both the initial and the magnitude of the control input are smaller under our protocols.

Based on an adaptive backstepping technique along with specific Lyapunov functions, a novel adaptive fuzzy output feedback FTC design is presented. To eliminate the need for knowing efficiency indexes, a fault compensation strategy is also developed by utilizing parameter estimation technique. In the presence of electromagnetic actuator failure, all vertical vibration states of the active suspension system remain stabilized.

Then, from the physical principles of vehicle motions, the nonlinear lateral dynamics are expressed in the LPV formulation, where the scheduling parameters are the longitudinal speed and slip ratio. After that, a data-based LPV representation is formulated based on a small set of data points satisfying the condition of persistent excitation. The system evolution of nonlinear lateral dynamics can be precisely recovered by parametric matrices formed by these data snapshots. Simulation data from CarSim and experimental data from multiple commercial vehicles are utilized to validate the proposed physics-informed data-based LPV model.

More existing methods use the sparse direct method to calibrate multi-cameras, which can ensure both accuracy and real-time performance and is theoretically achievable. However, this method requires a better initial value, and the initial estimate with a large error is often stuck in a local optimum. To this end, we introduce a robust automatic multi-cameras (pinhole or fisheye cameras) calibration and refinement method in the road scene. We utilize the deviable coarse-to-fine random-search strategy, and it can solve large disturbances of initial extrinsic parameters, which can make up for falling into local optimal domainin nonlinear optimization methods. In the photometric optimization stage, we add the weight of image adaptive binarization to solve the error caused by different camera exposure problems. To address the impact of non-roads on optimization, we use a road segmentation module instead of artificially specified fixed optimization regions.

Integer variables and convex relaxation are introduced in optimal model construction process to linearize time-accumulated constraints of cyclic pneumatic brake application and regularize the nonconvex relationship between operation time and speed. With the aforementioned deduction and matrix construction, the trajectory optimization problem can be constructed as mixed integer programming model with quadratic constraints (QCMIP) and solved by mature solvers.

However, the minimal likelihood of exposure to risky events can result in an extremely time-consuming testing process. To address this issue, we applied a surrogate-based method to expedite scenario-based simulated safety testing for HAVs. Model-based surrogates can quickly approximate the results of untested scenarios, thereby facilitating the search for risky scenarios. Car-following and Cut-in scenarios were chosen as two representative Operational Design Domains (ODDs) with different dimensions for case study. Thus, the capabilities of various Surrogate Models (SMs) can be examined in depth. Utilizing the HighD data, two testing ODDs were constructed to be consistent with naturalistic distribution. We demonstrated that the performances of six mainstream SMs differ significantly as the frequency of risky scenarios decreases. Additionally, we conducted multiple rounds of tests to compare the stability of SMs. We also presented a proposal on SMs selection according to the complexity of ODDs and the rarity of risky scenarios. Compared with random testing, the surrogate-based method can search for 4 times as many high-risk Car-following scenarios with only 4% of the test resources, showing great potential in accelerating the testing process. Notably, when the targeted scenarios are not rare in high-dimensional ODD, the calculation simplicity of SMs is the most important factor. Even random testing can be a viable option in such circumstances.},

  abstract     = {Pillar-based feature learning patterns have demonstrated high efficiency for 3D object detection, fostering the research of environmental perception for autonomous vehicles. However, aggressive downsampling during pillarization leads to a problem of lacking explicit geometry clues in pillar vectors. To address this limitation, we consider infusing more geometric information as prior knowledge for pillar-based feature abstraction. Our approach, termed CAFI-Pillars, employs a centroid-aware feature interaction (CAFI) unit as a core component, which explores a combined representation of pillar-wise semantical features and point-wise geometry clues. Concretely, CAFI-Pillars adopts a novel two-pathway topology consisting of a semantic branch and a geometric branch. Intra-branch feature abstraction relies on a sparse-to-dense manner, with a hybrid CNN-Transformer (HCT) detection neck utilized on densified features to enrich the diversity of feature representation. Meanwhile, inter-branch feature completion is facilitated by a task-guided bilateral feature fusion (TGBFF) module, which serves as a bridge for feature sharing and exchange. These innovative techniques enable CAFI-Pillars to obtain competitive results on the WOD and KITTI 3D detection benchmarks, highlighting its superior engineering potential for environmental perception tasks of autonomous vehicles.},

To achieve the goal of reducing system implementation complexity, the method of exploiting a single transmitting end node to construct virtual anchor nodes for target positioning is adopted. The proposed VFO algorithm is applied to solve the positioning objective function constructed by geometric relations to obtain the estimated position of the target vehicle. Additionally, the Direction of Arrival (DOA) parameter is introduced and matrix reconstructed estimation of signal parameters by rotational invariance technique (MR-ESPRIT) algorithm is employed for reducing the computational complexity and further improving the performance of the positioning algorithm. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed VFO algorithm based on multiple RISs can achieve better positioning performance with relatively low system complexity.},

  abstract     = {Driver models play a vital role in developing and verifying autonomous vehicles (AVs). Previously, they were mainly applied in traffic flow simulation to model driver behavior. With the development of AVs, driver models attract much attention again due to their potential contributions to AV safety assessment. The simulation-based testing method is an effective measure to accelerate AV testing due to its safe and efficient characteristics. Nonetheless, realistic driver models are prerequisites for valid simulation results. Additionally, an AV is assumed to be at least as safe as a careful and competent driver, which is modeled by driver models as well. Therefore, driver models are essential for AV safety assessment from the current perspective. However, no comparison or discussion of driver models is available regarding their utility to AVs in the last five years despite their necessities in the release of AVs. This motivates us to present a comprehensive survey of driver models in the paper and compare their applicability. Requirements for driver models as applied to AV safety assessment are discussed. A summary of driver models for simulation-based testing and AV benchmarks is provided. Evaluation metrics are defined to compare their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, potential gaps in existing driver models are identified, which provide direction for future work. This study gives related researchers especially regulators an overview and helps them to define appropriate driver models for AV safety assessment.},

Dual-motor 4WD electric vehicles (EVs), a configuration already in mass production, can enable speed control when operating beyond the stability limits. This article presents a dynamic inversion-based path/speed tracking control law for this drivetrain topology, solving the nonlinear model inversion in a less computationally troublesome iterative way. The characteristics of vehicle input couplings are exploited to make this unified controller comprehensibly track the desired sideslip only when the sideslip dynamic is unstable. To allow the potentials of 4WD EVs to be fully unleashed, the prioritisation between path-tracking and yaw stabilisation, and the lower bounds of speed when the vehicle operates beyond the limits, are discussed. The framework is then validated in simulation for a reference path with both slowly changing segments and highly dynamic segments.},

Based on the dynamic model of the T-MUT vehicle, the lane-keeping control system of a T-MUT vehicle is designed with Model Predictive Control (MPC). In order to consider the uncertainty of the weight change at each trailer, a model uncertainty analysis is performed through the transfer functions for each hitch angle. For lane-keeping performance, the geometry constraints on each unit of the T-MUT vehicle are described to prevent the vehicle from lane invasion. Also, by applying the constraint tightening method to the output of the controller, a robust MPC is designed against model uncertainty, such as weight changes at each trailer.

Therefore, the downstream decision-making components may generate unsafe outputs leading to system failure or accidents, if the preceding perception component provides highly uncertain information. To mitigate this issue, this article proposes a coherent safe perception-planning framework that quantifies and transfers DL-based perception uncertainties. Following the Bayesian Deep Learning paradigm, we design a probabilistic 3D object detector that extracts objects from LiDAR point clouds while quantifying the corresponding aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. A chance-constrained motion planner is designed to formulate an explicit link between DL-based perception uncertainties and operation risk and generate safe and risk-bounding trajectories. The proposed framework is validated through various challenging scenarios in the CARLA simulator. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework can effectively capture the uncertainties in DL, and generate trajectories that bound the risk under DL perception uncertainties. It also outperforms counterpart approaches without explicitly evaluating the uncertainties of DL-based perception.},

One of the major issues is coordinating multi-UAV to navigate safely in complicated and unknown 3D environments. The current decentralized navigation systems suffer from the challenges of partially observable properties in unknown environments and unstable environments, resulting in poor learning effects. In this article, we proposed a new multi-agent recurrent deterministic policy gradient (MARDPG) algorithm based on the depth deterministic policy gradient algorithm for controlling the navigation action of multi-UAV. Specifically, each critic network learns centrally so that each UAV can estimate the policies of other UAVs, thereby resolving the problem of slow convergence caused by the unstable environment. Decentralized execution eliminates the need for communication resources between UAVs. Sharing parameters in critics network accelerates training. The added LSTM network enables UAVs to use historical exploration information to improve the prediction of action values without being trapped by local traps. Finally, thorough simulation results in a realistic simulation environment were provided to demonstrate the superiority in terms of convergence and efficacy over the state-of-the-art DRL approach.},

However, there are no general and flexible methods to fuse the information represented by those models. Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an efficient tool to fuse empirical or physical dynamic models with data-driven models. To take full advantage of various information sources, we propose a model fusion scheme based on PINN. It is implemented by developing a semi-empirical semi-physical Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to model the degradation dynamics of Li-ion batteries. When there is little prior knowledge about the dynamics, we leverage the data-driven Deep Hidden Physics Model (DeepHPM) to discover the underlying governing dynamic models. The uncovered dynamics information is then fused with that mined by the surrogate neural network in the PINN framework. Moreover, an uncertainty-based adaptive weighting method is employed to balance the multiple learning tasks when training the PINN.

Adhering to acceleration limits is achieved by self-organizing to a common constrained group behavior that prevents reaching acceleration limits. In the presence of communication failures, resilience is achieved by self-organizing to a common group observer to estimate the missing information. Stability and string stability of the self-organization mechanism are studied analytically, and correctness with respect to traffic actions (e.g. emergency braking, cut-in, merging) is realized through a provably-correct safety layer.

Most existing approaches integrate the features of accident-relevant agents with spatial information for accident anticipation. However, these approaches ignore the actual spatio-temporal state of missing agents, whether they are occluded or left, which is relevant to accident occurrence. To address this issue, we propose a G raph and S patio-temporal C ontinuity based framework for accident anticipation called GSC, which takes the missing agents into account. Specifically, the proposed GSC maintains the spatio-temporal continuity of missing agents, which are in the occluded spatial state in the process of the graph convolution operation. Besides, we define a novel adjacent matrix to add dynamic features to graph learning. In particular, our adjacent matrix utilizes the historical trajectory of each agent to integrate dynamic information into the original static interaction, which improves the quality of the spatial relation feature for accident anticipation. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the correctness of identifying an accident, which is found to reach over 60%.},

Mainstream localization approaches in autonomous vehicles (AV) are limited by the reliability of onboard sensors, which could be vulnerable to sensor failure, such as signal outages of the camera and signal spoofing of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Different from these active or passive sensors, the vehicle dynamic model (VDM), which is the application of physical laws to a vehicle in motion, is environmentally independent and is capable of providing vehicle motion estimation continuously. However, the performance of the VDM-based motion estimation is dominated by the accuracy of the system dynamics model. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a sensor-free localization method VDM-SI by integrating system identification into the design of vehicle dynamic models (VDM). A system identification process based on low-order process models is proposed to identify the system dynamics of the AV, where the identified system responses are taken as the control input of VDM to estimate the vehicular positioning. The localization experiments in two scenarios show that the mean absolute translation error of VDM-SI can be reduced by 70% compared to conventional VDM methods. In addition, VDM-SI is experimentally proven to improve the localization performance of sensor fusion-based localization systems with high noise levels. Furthermore, in the application of re-localization after sensors fail and recover, VDM-SI shows strength in enhancing the security of AVs in extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {The robustness of scene segmentation can be enhanced with the aid of other modality information, e.g., thermal or/and depth, under poor environmental conditions. In this context, RGB-X semantic segmentation is becoming prevalent. Most existing RGB-X semantic segmentation models focus on the fusion strategy between different modalities or between multiple stages, but ignore feature recovery at the decoder side. This makes it difficult to recover the information loss due to downsampling, and also overlooks the pixel connections between segmented objects. To solve these problems, we propose a Shape and Semantic Enhancements Module (SASEM) in this article, which is characterized by innovations on the decoder side. More specifically, we divide the decoder into a shape supervision branch and a semantic supervision branch. The former reinforces the shape information of the category by using a signed distance map. A multi-stage enhancement structure is designed to further strengthen the shape information of features. The latter directly enhances the semantic extraction capability of the decoder by employing a channel-level semantic enhancement module, which reduces the interference of the semantic information by the shape supervision branch. The two branches work together to enhance the inter-pixel relationship, thus making the decoder more capable of recovering the fused encoded features. Our proposed SASEM serves as an excellent plug-and-play module for different networks, as is evident by the experiments on various RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth datasets, where our module can be easily integrated and help to improve the performance consistently.},

To overcome the problems of low algorithm efficiency and insufficient scenario adaptation in urban environments, this article proposes a trajectory prediction framework based on the rule and learning-based frameworks fusion (TP-FRL). By augmenting the observed trajectory under the guidance of a physically possible trajectory set, the proposed framework improves algorithmic adaptation in the presence of disturbed trajectory observations. Meanwhile, rule-based spatio-temporal semantic corridors are used to vectorize agent trajectory-related regions, which improves the rationality of each agent region division and enhances the adaptability in different scenarios. Finally, based on the trajectory-related region modeling of each agent, the interest region of the central agent is learned by a graph convolutional network, and only the scenario elements in the interest region are encoded to improve the trajectory prediction efficiency of the transformer multi-head attention network. Traffic data from Argoverse and ApolloScape datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the TP-FRL model. Specifically, the TP-FRL model shows efficient performance and strong adaptability on datasets from two countries, which shows the promise of predicting trajectories under various scenarios.},

Firstly, the mechanical structure design, electrical system configuration, and software system development of the Shark AUV are introduced, highlighting its cost-effectiveness, compact size, and streamlined torpedo shape to enhance the flexibility of underwater inspections. Secondly, the dynamic model of the Shark AUV is established, and the hydrodynamic coefficients are numerical estimated utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Thirdly, considering that the developed Shark AUV is underactuated in the sway degree of freedom, a novel heading control model is developed that reasonably tackles the motion coupling between sway and yaw. This model facilitates the design of a robust $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ controller to regulate the heading angle of the Shark AUV for vision-based underwater inspections. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed hovering control method and vision-based underwater inspection system are validated in both a 3D simulation platform and a laboratory test pool. The experimental results demonstrate that the Shark AUV prototype can achieve satisfactory vision-based underwater inspection performance within a pixel error of 5 × 5, and the proposed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ heading controller consistently provides superior performance in handling motion coupling, parametric uncertainty, and external disturbances.},

Autonomous driving presents a promising approach to enhancing safety. Among autonomous technologies, this article presents a framework for an autonomous vehicle tracking control algorithm utilizing tube-based robust model predictive control (RMPC). The primary objective is to achieve precise path tracking while ensuring performance, safety, and robustness even with modeling errors. The framework adopts a lumped dynamics model for articulated vehicles, which reduces computational complexity while preserving linearity. Specific constraints of articulated vehicles are integrated to guarantee stability, safety, and adherence to actuator limits. The tube-based RMPC technique reliably satisfies constraints under worst-case scenarios, thereby addressing robustness against modeling errors. The proposed algorithm employs tube-based RMPC to ensure the safety and robustness of autonomous articulated vehicles. In the design of the tracking controller, error tube analysis between the actual plant and the prediction model plays a vital role. An error tube analysis method and framework are introduced through simulation. Performance evaluations of the proposed algorithm and previous tracking controllers are conducted through comparative simulations. Previous algorithms exhibited tracking errors exceeding 50 cm, posing potential safety risks. In contrast, the proposed algorithm demonstrates tracking errors of less than 50 cm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits notable stability. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables accurate and safe tracking of complex autonomous articulated vehicles.},

Conventional Kalman filter-based fault detection methods mainly focus on satellite measurement faults and presume that the test statistics follow the chi-square distribution. These methods ignore the adverse effect of undetected faults occurring previously, and the detection performance would be restrained under a mis-matched distribution assumption. To solve these issues, an enhanced fault detection method is proposed in this article, which combines the Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The MCC is introduced to derive a robust extended Kalman filter to deal with the undetected faults. Simultaneously, a specific Kernel Bandwidth (KB) for each measurement is calculated by the innovation and innovation covariance matrix to handle the inherent restriction of a fixed KB. Moreover, the LOF is used to reconstruct the test statistics, and the threshold is calculated by an offline model. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed method under different fault scenarios. The results illustrate that the adaptive robust estimation reduces the negative influence of undetected faults, which makes the filter innovation follow the actual fault amplitudes. The proposed algorithm effectively improves the fault detection rate and positioning accuracy.},

In face of the co-existence of automated vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), a decision making framework of AVs is proposed for safe lane keeping or changing. The decision making is based on the HDVs&#39; future motion predicted by a learning-based Long Short-Term Memory model. To quantify the uncertainties in prediction, an error ellipse is used to capture the model deviations from the ground truth to ensure driving safety. This article develops a novel method that leverages lower-order parametric curves to efficiently generate feasible, safe, and comfortable lateral movements for AVs. The planner is complemented by maneuver replanning that can guide the AV back to the original lane when confronted with unexpected blockages from surrounding vehicles. Based on real-world datasets, simulation results show that the proposed method achieves curvature compatibility, shorter trajectory length in lateral maneuvers, accurate trajectory tracking, and effective collision avoidance in lane changing.},

  abstract     = {The latest electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly complex and resource-intensive owing to their advanced functional capabilities and autonomy. In this study, EVs are considered as cyber-physical systems (CPS), and a novel event-triggered sliding mode controller (ET-SMC) with a hierarchical framework is developed to enhance lateral stability and reduce communication resource consumption in EVs through torque vectoring control (TVC). The high-level controller of the ET-SMC is designed based on a nonlinear vehicle model, and its stability is rigorously proven using the Lyapunov and input-to-state stable (ISS) theorems. Additionally, a traditional periodic sliding mode controller (SMC) is developed as a benchmark controller. The Sine-with-Dwell (SwD) test scenario, an internationally recognized method for verifying lateral stability, is employed to evaluate the control performance using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test bench. The experimental results demonstrate that the ET-SMC can not only maintain similar control performance in enhancing lateral stability but also reduce controller communication resource consumption by approximately 30% compared to the periodic SMC in this typical driving scenario. These results show that the proposed control algorithm is promising for future EVs.},

  abstract     = {Virtual coupling is a novel railway transport concept that allows trains to split and join on-the-fly by switching from mechanical to virtual couplers. One of the main challenges in applying virtual coupling in metro railways is to reduce the tracking distance between trains without compromising safety. This article proposes a relative operation-based train separation model to reduce the safe distance between trains. This model applies a fault tolerance principle. The principle is that the preceding train normally operates for a time interval from its last-known state before initiating an emergency brake to stop the train. A difficulty in applying the proposed model is to predict the boundary of all possible time-position trajectories of the preceding train, which is the reachability problem of a hybrid system. To solve this problem, we formalise the operation of the preceding train by a parameterized hybrid automaton. A polytope-based algorithm is then developed for computing an over-approximated reachable set of the automaton. We compare our approach with a state-of-the-art relative braking distance-based train separation model for virtual coupling on a concrete metro line in Chengdu, China, and evaluate the method with several benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the relative operation-based model substantially reduces the safe distances between trains. Compared to conventional approaches, the proposed model provides a considerable 90.7% decrease in unnecessary waiting time at railway stations for virtually coupled trains and a 4.9% increase in the capacity of the given railway lines.},

  abstract     = {Various unfavourable conditions such as fog, snow and rain may degrade image quality and pose tremendous threats to the safety of autonomous driving. Numerous image-denoising solutions have been proposed to improve visibility under adverse weather conditions. However, previous studies have been limited in robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability as they were designed for specific scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce an interpretable image denoising framework via Dual Disentangled Representation Learning (DDRL) to enhance robustness and interpretability by decomposing an image into content factors (e.g., objects) and context factors (e.g., weather conditions). DDRL consists of two Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) blocks. In each DRL block, an input image is deconstructed into the latent content distribution and the weather distribution by minimizing their mutual information. To mitigate the impacts of weather styles, we incorporated a content discriminator and adversarial objectives to learn the decomposable interaction between two DRL blocks. Furthermore, we standardized the weather feature space, enabling our method to be applicable to various downstream tasks such as diverse degraded image generation. We evaluated DDRL under three weather conditions including fog, rain, and snow. The experimental results demonstrate that DDRL shows competitive performance with good generalization capability and high robustness under numerous weather conditions. Furthermore, quantitative analysis shows that DDRL can capture interpretable variations of weather factors and decompose them for safe and reliable all-weather autonomous driving.},

To this end, this article proposes a hierarchical shared steering control framework based on the human-machine mutual trust evaluation. The upper level of the framework aims to evaluate the human-machine mutual trust level. The driver&#39;s trust level in the machine is evaluated by the human-machine steering difference. And the machine&#39;s trust level in the driver is evaluated by driver skills. The lower level is to dynamically optimize the authority allocation considering varying human-machine mutual trust states. The fuzzy method is adopted to calculate the reference value of the human-machine authority based on the mutual trust level. Through minimizing the lateral acceleration and tracking error, the fuzzy rule database for the authority reference level is further tuned offline. Furthermore, to improve the smoothness of authority transfer and path tracking, the model prediction control is used to optimize the human-machine authority levels online. The proposed authority allocation strategy is verified with the driver-in-the-loop test bench. The results show the effectiveness of improving driving performance under different human-machine mutual trust levels.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a critical task in the field of robotics and autonomous driving. Although recent light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based 3D object detection techniques have been well-studied and achieve high detection accuracy, the cost of the LiDAR sensor itself proposes a high premium for its practical implementation. Recently introduced Pseudo-LiDAR based methods that utilize image data to detect 3D information show great prospects for their high cost-effectiveness. However, existing Pseudo-LiDAR methods tend to be intensive computations for the adaption of complex stereo matching algorithms, and therefore can not meet the real-time requirement. To tackle this issue, we propose a lightweight Pseudo-LiDAR 3D detection system that achieves both high accuracy and high responsiveness. Specifically, we adopt a highly efficient depth estimator with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) to exploit timely depth prediction. To mitigate the accuracy degradation issue caused by the quantization of the BNNs, we introduce several promoting schemes into the depth estimation procedure, including continuous depth approximation, geometric constraints of virtual planes, and training scope restriction, to enhance its performance. Moreover, we further provide an in-depth analysis to the architecture of 3D detector orienting to the Pseudo-LiDAR task and develop effective modules to gain solid accuracy improvement while maintaining low runtime demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark and online leaderboard show that our system can conduct the 3D detection within a mere 36 ms, while simultaneously achieving competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In our design, a cross-modal attention fusion module mines complementary information from two modalities. Subsequently, a cascaded fusion module decodes the multi-level features in an up-bottom manner. Noting that each pixel is labeled with the category of the region to which it belongs, we present a region-based module that explores the relationship between pixel and region. Moreover, in contrast to previous methods that employ only the cross-entropy loss to penalize pixel-wise predictions, we propose an additional loss to learn pixel–pixel relationships.

  abstract     = {Obeject detection as a fundamental task of environmental perception systems in autonomous vehicles (AVs), is significant for intelligent driving safety that precise detection results improve control accuracy. Facing the cross-domain adaptation scenarios, the generalization capability of the detector is poor due to the lack of target supervised information and the influence of covariate shift among domains especially. To takle such an issue, this article proposes a reliable domain adaptation method based on refined knowledge transferring and mined guidance for cross-domain detection in AVs. Two domain adaptation modules are integrated on baseline detection framework from the perspective of global rough semantic information and local specific content. One module combines the hierarchical domain feature information and transfer network by domain feature refinement to avoid the interference of background information in coarse domain features. The other promotes the alignment and learning of the foreground features in the target domain through the semantic guidance obtained from the potential information mining component and the designed global-local semantic consistency measure. Benefiting from these adaptation methods, the foreground knowledge of source doamin can be effectively transferred to target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on typical cross-domain detection scenarios and the proposed method is proved to outperform previous approaches.},

This study employs bibliometric approaches to uncover knowledge bases and prevailing research perspectives within the VGI field. We collected 2821 publications from the SCIE and SSCI databases for the literature survey. A visual analysis is conducted from five distinct perspectives to reveal the overall distribution of these publications. Two analytical techniques (document co-citation and keyword co-occurrence) are utilized to highlight highly co-cited publications and popular research topics. According to the analysis of the document co-citation, six representative knowledge bases are identified: string stability of vehicle platoons, wireless communication of vehicle platoons, cooperative driving in merging areas, the influence of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) platoon on traffic flow, platoon management of heavy-duty vehicles, and cooperative control of multi-agent systems. These knowledge bases have provided significant contributions to the exploration and development of the VGI field. Based on the knowledge mapping related to the keyword co-occurrence, the core research trends include five categories: vehicle platooning in different traffic scenarios, cooperative merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), active safety control of vehicle groups, stability analysis of vehicle platoons, and wireless communication of cooperative driving. Furthermore, we illustrate potential research opportunities at four levels, including control architectures, issues in the application of vehicle platoons, cooperative strategies of vehicle groups, and communication protocols and security.

Therefore, more and more researchers are turning to synthetic datasets to easily generate rich and changeable data as an effective complement to the real world and to improve the performance of algorithms. In this paper, we summarize the evolution of synthetic dataset generation methods and review the work to date in synthetic datasets related to single and multi-task categories for the autonomous driving perception study. We also discuss the role that synthetic datasets play in the evaluation, gap test, and positive effect of autonomous driving-related algorithm testing, especially on trustworthiness and safety aspects, and provide examples of evaluation experiments. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future directions of synthetic datasets.

In the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) paradigm, energy-efficient task scheduling is critical to achieving optimal completion time and energy consumption. Although extensive research has been conducted in this field, challenges remain in meeting the requirements of time-sensitive services and adapting to dynamic traffic environments. In this context, a novel algorithm called Multi-action and Environment-adaptive Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (MEPPO) is designed based on the conventional PPO algorithm and then a joint task scheduling and resource allocation method is proposed based on the designed MEPPO algorithm. In specific, the method involves three core aspects. Firstly, task scheduling strategy is designed to generate task offloading decisions and priority assignment decisions for the tasks utilizing PPO algorithm, which can further reduce the completion time of service requests. Secondly, transmit power allocation scheme is designed considering the expected transmission distance among vehicles and edge servers, which can minimize transmission energy consumption by adjusting the allocated transmit power dynamically. Thirdly, the proposed MEPPO-based scheduling method can make scheduling decisions for vehicles with different numbers of tasks by manipulating the state space of the PPO algorithm, which makes the proposed method be adaptive to real-world dynamic VEC environment. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive simulation and on-site experiments.},

The mainstream methods mainly rely on point clouds to achieve geometry matching between target template and search area. However, textureless and incomplete point clouds make it difficult for single-modal trackers to distinguish objects with similar structures. To overcome the mentioned limitations of geometry matching, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-level Fusion Tracker (MMF-Track), which exploits the image texture and geometry characteristic of point clouds to track 3D target. Specifically, we first propose a Space Alignment Module (SAM) to align RGB images with point clouds in 3D space, which is the prerequisite for constructing inter-modal associations. After that, in feature interaction level , we present a Feature Interaction Module (FIM) based on dual-stream structure, which enhances intra-modal features in parallel and constructs inter-modal semantic associations. Meanwhile, in order to refine each modal feature, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Interaction Module (CFIM) to realize the hierarchical feature interaction at different scales. Finally, in similarity fusion level , we introduce a Similarity Fusion Module (SFM) to aggregate geometry and texture similarity from the target. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on KITTI and NuScenes datasets.},

Furthermore, unknown external disturbances are taken into consideration, as they stem from diverse uncertainties associated with environmental loadings and are encountered in various practical situations. Considering the inherent nonlinear dynamics and the state and input constraints, a new kind of distributed model predictive control (MPC) based controllers is developed to achieve collision free formation navigation. Specifically, in light of the unavailability of accurate USV dynamics caused by unknown external disturbances, time-delay observers are constructed to estimate these disturbances. This estimation process facilitates the creation of a reliable predictive model, which in turn enables the design of an effective MPC controller. Subsequently, a class of distributed collision avoidance MPC formation navigation control strategies is presented and utilized such that the control inputs of USVs can be determined synchronously. It is shown that the time-delay observers can effectively estimate the external disturbances and lead to satisfactory performance of the distribute MPC based controller. At last, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the present control strategy and to demonstrate its advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Detecting dangerous traffic agents in videos captured by vehicle-mounted dashboard cameras (dashcams) is essential to ensure safe navigation in complex environments. Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the driving-related Big Data, and the transient pre-accident process is highly dynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar in their appearance. These make risky traffic agent localization in the driving video particularly challenging. To this end, this article proposes an attention-guided multistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic agents from dashcam videos ahead of potential accidents. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object bounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames to capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing risky traffic agents. An attention module, coupled with the GRUs, learns to identify traffic agents that are relevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of global and object-level features, AM-Net predicts the riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study, the article also introduces a new benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization (ROL). The dataset contains spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations of the accident, object, and scene-level attributes. The proposed AM-Net achieves a promising performance of 85.59% AUC on the ROL dataset. Additionally, the AM-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art for video anomaly detection by 3.5% AUC on the public DoTA dataset. A thorough ablation study further reveals AM-Net&#39;s merits by assessing the impact of its constituents.},

In this article, we present a solution to this problem that accounts for the realistic conditions necessary for autonomous driving. Specifically, we identify velocity and environment as possible causes for the decline in domain generalization. Then, we propose incorporating a module for velocity refinement as a solution to the velocity issue. As a response to the environmental issue, we propose both self-distillation and an environment-specific loss. Our new model is named Lane Transformer++, with one plus representing velocity issues and the other representing environmental concerns.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, robust and accurate odometries, as the foundation technology of navigation systems, gains significance in autonomous driving and robotic navigation fields. Although odometries, especially visual odometries (VOs), have made substantial progress, their application scenarios are still limited by the normal cameras&#39; frame rate limitations and their low robustness to motion blur. The event camera, a recently proposed bionic sensor, seeks to tackle these challenges, offering new possibilities for VO solutions to overcome extreme environments. However, integrating event cameras into VO faces challenges like the RGB-event modality gap and the requirement for efficient event processing. To address these research gaps to some extent, we propose a novel visual-event odometry, namely MC-VEO (Motion Compensated Visual-Event Odometry). Specifically, by introducing the temporal Gaussian weight into the standard contrast maximization framework, we propose the first effective 6-DoF motion compensation method that generates deblurred event frames from event data without additional sensors. The generated frames then be aligned with the RGB images through Event Generation Model (EGM) in MC-VEO, so as to overcome the RGB-event modality gap. Additionally, during the optimization of the EGM-based motion estimation algorithm, our decoupling and pre-calculation, matrix representation, and parallel solving further accelerate the per-point processing of events, which enables MC-VEO to show satisfactory speed performance even when facing large amounts of events and candidate points. The superior performance of MC-VEO is evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative experimental results. To ensure that our results are fully reproducible, all the relevant data and codes have been released publicly.},

Generally, AVs are bound to operate in diverse scenarios. However, state-of-the-art spoofing attack algorithms can identify vulnerable periods of MSF systems and execute aggressive GNSS spoofing in certain specific scenarios with high success rates. The present study proposes a security defense algorithm for MSF systems based on an enhanced Kalman filter, incorporating the Measurement Variance Monitoring (MVM) and Minimum Constraint of Covariance Matrix (MCCM) model. MVM effectively constrains the impact of GNSS signals with large positioning errors, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by spoofing attacks. MCCM fully leverages LiDAR information between two consecutive GNSS signals to enhance the credibility of LiDAR measurements, thus improving the positioning correction capability. Furthermore, considering the diverse application environments of AVs, this paper primarily focuses on sensor uncertainty variation and validates different models in varying scenarios. Ultimately, real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-spoofing model, which can significantly mitigate positioning errors caused by GNSS spoofing attacks without affecting navigation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel time-energy optimal control approach with applications in cooperative eco-driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in urban traffic networks. Safely approaching and departing signalized intersections requires the satisfaction of both spatial equality constraints determined by intersection locations and temporal inequality constraints in compliance with the green light phases. To generate time- and energy-optimal trajectories, the optimal crossing times at intersections are firstly treated as characteristic time constraints, which makes the problem tractable. Then the direct multiple shooting method and time transformation technique are applied to find a numerical solution. The contribution of this article is twofold. The first one is the development of a novel time- and energy-optimal control approach that ensures a trade-off between minimizing energy and time for a general class of optimal control problems with multiple characteristic times. The second contribution is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of multi-CAVs&#39; cooperative eco-driving control, in which multiple vehicles must simultaneously minimize travel time and energy consumption in the presence of spatio-temporal constraints. Simulation analysis over real-world urban route scenarios shows that the proposed eco-driving control strategy can save up to 8.2% of energy or reduce up to 6.7% of travel time compared to a baseline method. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy can be implemented in real-time.},

  abstract     = {3D semantic segmentation is a key technology of scene understanding in the self-driving field, which remains challenging problems. Recent 3D segmentation methods have achieved competitive results in indoor or typical urban traffic scenes. However, in complex and changeable scenarios where structured features are sparse and irregular, few of these methods could achieve well segmentation results, especially causing blurry and inaccurate boundary distinctions between inter-class objects, drivable areas, and backgrounds. In order to fully harvest boundary information and accurately distinguish the category of points on road and object boundaries in real-time, we present an efficient multi-level boundary-semantic-enhanced model for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which comprehensively discover boundary features in three aspects: first, boundary channels are extracted directly from LiDAR range images as the inputs of boundary-branch; second, the boundary attention module is designed to deeply fuse boundary information into the main segmentation branch; third, a modified discriminator is utilized to raise the perception of boundary information by minimizing the gap between the predicted and true boundaries. Besides, we add a semantic-enhanced module using the similar discriminator to optimize semantic segmentation results in the output end. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are performed on both structured and unstructured real-world datasets including urban dataset SemanticKITTI, off-road dataset Rellis3D and our unstructured test set. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in improving efficiency, accuracy and scene-adaptivity.},

First, due to the difficulty of modeling the precise dynamics of vehicles, a policy gradient (PG) is derived to learn the optimal control gain by minimizing a predefined infinite-horizon performance index, where the knowledge of the system drift dynamics of vehicles is no longer needed. Then, to further remove the limitation of the initial admissibility of the control policy, a two-stage DPG-based RL optimal control algorithm is proposed, in which a novel finite-horizon performance index is employed in the pre-learning stage such that the control gain does not require to be initially admissible. It should be pointed out that the derived PGs in the two algorithms are based on an explicit form only using a single sampling data for each calculation rather than an estimated form via randomly perturbing feedback gains, which reduces the sampling and computational complexity of the algorithms. Finally, the simulations of the lateral path-tracking control of vehicles have verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DPG-based RL algorithms compared with existing methods.},

In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is used in the RF channel to reflect the signals of the terrestrial user to the relay with a fixed amplification gain, while free-space optical (FSO) is applied to the relay-satellite link to obtain a high speed transmission. For such a dual-hop system, assuming that the FSO channel experiences $\mathcal {M}$ -distributed fading with pointing errors, the expressions for the outage probability (OP) and average bit error rate (ABER) are evaluated in closed-forms. In addition, the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analyses for the OP and ABER are developed and the lower and upper bounds on the average channel capacity (ACC) are calculated to obtain further insights. Results show that the diversity order of the proposed system is $\min \lbrace k_{w},m_{w}\rbrace$ , where these two parameters are related to the Nakagami- m distribution parameters and the number of RIS elements. Finally, we take the shadowing effects into consideration, and it can be seen that the shadowing effects significantly degrade the system performance.},

Conventional level- $k$ reasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision making due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it provides. To fill this gap in the literature, we expand the framework to a continuous domain that enables a continuous-policy-space, consisting of infinitely many driver policies. Through the approach detailed in this article, more accurate and realistic driver models can be obtained and employed for creating high-fidelity simulation platforms for the validation of autonomous vehicle control algorithms.

Secondly, the cumulative error of LiDAR positioning cannot be ignored due to its incremental positioning method. To circumvent aforementioned problems, a reliable position estimation methodology based on multi-source information is proposed. Initially, a deep neural network based on multi view features multi-head self-attention fusion is designed to estimate the relative heading value to offer initial value for LiDAR positioning. Then, the cooperative positioning multilayer perceptron (CPMLP) is proposed to obtain reliable cooperative position observation just by one road side unit to suppress the cumulative error especially in the environment without prior information.

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable positioning is of great importance for the realization of intelligent vehicles (IV). Factor graph optimization (FGO) has been popularized in the field of robotics for state estimation. As a ubiquitous sensor, the IMU is widely used for vehicular positioning based on the preintegration theory using FGO. However, the existing preintegration model fails to consider the earth&#39;s rotation, which challenges the attitude and positioning performance of vehicles equipped with high-precision inertial measurement units (IMU). To fill this gap, an accurate IMU factor that accounts for the earth&#39;s rotation rate is designed in this article. First, an exact preintegration measurement model is derived based on a high-precision inertial navigation system (INS) mechanization. The proposed factor is more accurate and it enables the application of the FGO more suitable for inertial-based integrated navigation with different precision IMUs. In both simulation and field tests, the INS/ Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) integration, as a representative of inertial-based integrated navigation, is used to verify the performance of the proposed preintegration factor. The navigation results using our experimental car reveal that the proposed model leads to a more accurate estimation, outperforming the traditional preintegration models, especially in the aspect of attitude estimation.},

Compared with the rigid structure, the performance of the elastic propulsion structure such as flexible caudal fin and passive compliant joint has been improved, yet the effective frequency range is limited due to the single mechanism. The optimal propulsion can only be produced in a certain frequency range. In this article, a biological passive peduncle joint integrated with the composite mechanism of elasticity and shear damping is proposed, solving the problem of the narrow frequency range of effective propulsive capacity. Through the optimal regulation of the elastic function at a certain frequency range and characterization of the damping function which increases with frequency, the response features of the passive joint are optimized over a wide range of frequencies, thereby improving the propulsive performance of the composite-mechanism bioinspired underwater vehicle (CMBUV). A dynamic model is built and the deformation analysis of the compliant caudal fin is carried out. The propulsive efficiency is characterized, and the results indicate that the compliant caudal fin modulates the power transmission for enhancing thrust production. Extensive simulations and experiments reveal that the CMBUV achieves both high swimming speed with 4.42 body length per second and low cost of transport with 90.33 J kg $^{-1}$ m $^{-1}$ . Bioinspired propulsion from this study takes advantage of undulating propulsion of natural fish, offering valuable insights into performing marine tasks in ocean environments.},

  abstract     = {A control system of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) is generally very complex when they complete a task in a closely-cooperative manner, e.g. two UAVs cooperatively transport a package of goods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution for such a complex control. However, MARL heavily relies on trial-and-error explorations, facing a big challenge in gathering real-world training data. Simulation environments are commonly used to overcome this challenge, i.e., a control policy is trained in a simulation environment and then transferred into a real-world system. But there often exists a gap between simulation and reality and thus a successful transfer is not guaranteed easily. The domain randomization method provides a workable way to bridge this gap. Nevertheless, the traditional one used in a policy training often suffers from slow convergence and results in an unstable decision policy. To address these issues, this article proposes an adversarial domain randomization method. It utilizes an adversarial generator as a “nature player” to generate a more reasonable training environment so that the trained decision policy can deal with complex situations. Additionally, we improve the prioritized experience replay method by which we can sample those critical experiences, increasing the convergence speed of a training without decreasing the performance of the trained policy. We apply our method to a real-world task of dual-UAV cooperative transportation, and experiments illustrate its effectiveness compared to traditional ones.},

Recently, great efforts have been made to achieve accurate and robust 3D semantic segmentation results through LiDAR-camera fusion, due to the complementary information of images like color and texture. However, current LiDAR-camera fusion methods still lag behind LiDAR-only methods in complex and varied scenarios containing sparse and similar geometric features. Three main factors limit their performance: sparse mappings between two modalities, the contribution of different modality features, and the gap between results of two modalities. Addressing that, we present a multi-phase LiDAR-camera fusion method, which comprehensively fuses information of two modalities in three phases: first, a context sampler block is proposed to fuse low-level image contextual features into LiDAR points; second, a cross dimensional fusion block is designed to implement the interaction of shared features for hierarchical supervision while retaining private features for jointly refining their predictions; third, a modality perceptual conformance loss is induced to make them learn from each other in an explicit manner by minimizing the gap between two modality predictions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are performed on urban dataset SemanticKITTI, off-road dataset RELLIS-3D and our unstructured test set.

  abstract     = {Source-free domain adaptive object detection (source-free DAOD) seeks to adapt a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to annotated source domain data. To address challenges posed by domain shifts, current source-free DAOD approaches mainly rely on the self-training paradigm, where pseudo labels are predicted and employed to fine-tune the detector on unlabeled target domain. However, these methods often encounter issues related to intra-class variation, resulting in category-specific biases and noisy pseudo labels. In response, we present an effective Multi-Prototype Guided source-free DAOD method, dubbed MPG, consisting of two key components: multi-prototype guided pseudo labeling (MPPL) and multi-prototype guided consistency regularization (MPCR) modules. In the MPPL module, we construct category-specific multiple prototypes to better represent the category with intra-class variations. Specifically, multiple prototypes with adaptive cluster centroids are introduced for each category to effectively capture the intra-class variations. Through the implementation of the proposed MPPL module, we derive more accurate pseudo labels by assessing the proximity of instance features to multiple category prototypes. In the MPCR module, we introduce multi-level consistency regularization, including prototype-based consistency and prediction consistency, which encourages the model to overlook style perturbations and learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on five public driving datasets demonstrate that MPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in adapting object detectors to target domains.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, behavioral decision-making and trajectory planning remain huge challenges due to the large amount of uncertainty in environments and complex interaction relationships between the ego vehicle and other traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a novel fixed-horizon constrained reinforcement learning (RL) framework to solve decision-making and planning problems. Firstly, to introduce lane-level global navigation information into the lane state representation and avoid constant lane changes, we propose the constrained A-star algorithm, which can get the optimal path without constant lane changes. The optimality of the algorithm is also theoretically guaranteed. Then, to balance safety, comfort, and goal completion (reaching targets), we construct the planning problem as a constrained RL problem, in which the reward function is designed for goal completion, and two fixed-horizon constraints are developed for safety and comfort, respectively. Subsequently, a motion planning policy network (planner) with vectorized input is constructed. Finally, a dual ascent optimization method is proposed to train the planner network. With the advantage of being able to fully explore in the environment, the agent can learn an efficient decision-making and planning policy. In addition, benefiting from modeling the safety and comfort of the ego vehicle as constraints, the learned policy can guarantee the safety of the ego vehicle and achieve a good balance between goal completion and comfort. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance than existing rule-based, imitation learning-based, and typical RL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling intelligent vehicles to perceive and understand their surroundings. However, datasets used for semantic segmentation often suffer from data imbalance, where the number of pixels belonging to different classes varies significantly. To address this challenge, various novel loss functions have been proposed at the class or pixel level to counterbalance the data imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel approach to mitigate this problem from a subclass perspective. Specifically, we identify subclasses within each class based on the similarity of feature maps. These subclasses are then reweighted according to their distribution. Our approach can seamlessly transition into widely used loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss and class-weighted cross-entropy loss, in extreme cases. The proposed loss function is compatible with existing semantic segmentation methods, serving as a plug-in component for both current and future methodologies. We conducted extensive experiments on challenging datasets, namely SemanticKITTI and Cityscapes, to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our subclassified loss. Our experiments involved LiDAR-based and image-based methods, including RangeNet++, KPRNet, PointRend, STDC, and SegFormer, resulting in substantial improvements in terms of intersection-over-union (IoU) for segmentation.

However, directly applying LiDAR-related algorithms to radar and camera fusion leads to significant challenges, such as radar sparsity, absence of height information, and noise, resulting in substantial performance loss. To address these issues, our proposed method, SparseFusion3D, utilizes a dual-branch feature-level fusion network that fully models sensor interactions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of radar sparsity and noise on modality association. Additionally, to enhance modal correlations and accuracy while alleviating radar point cloud sparsity and measurement ambiguity, we introduce MSPCP, which compensates for point cloud offset. Moreover, we integrate Radar Painter to leverage image information and further enhance MSPCP. SparseFusion3D exhibits competitive performance compared to previous radar-camera fusion models, achieving approximately 1.5x inference speedup with similar performance to dense query methods, while also improving by 20.1% compared to the baseline approach.},

In this article, a scalable 3D object detection pipeline CenterSFA and a series of new modules are proposed to improve the detection performance. In contrast to previous point-level fusing models, semantic and geometric cues from images are sequentially utilized in a center-based paradigm. The object centers are accurately predicted with semantic guidance and selectively employed as the basis for feature aggregation and property regression. Specifically, the attention mechanism is utilized in the semantic and spatial similarity calculation, enabling the surrounding feature aggregation for multi-scale objects. An instance-level correlation is established between the camera feature and the BEV feature for cross-modal feature aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale nuScenes dataset to verify the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model, especially for occluded objects and far-range detection. The proposed model outperforms the competitive CenterPoint by 10.4% in mAP and 5.4% in NDS, as well as the representative fusion method MVP by 2.8% in mAP and 1.6% in NDS on val set, indicating its superiority in accurate 3D detection.},

First, we design a Collaborative Attention Fusion (CAF) module that dynamically captures inter-vehicle interactions through channel and spatial attention. By incorporating the CAF module into the CAF network, we effectively aggregate shared deep learning-based features from neighboring vehicles, resulting in a fused feature map that contains rich contextual information. Second, we propose an adaptive multi-teacher knowledge distillation method that adaptively assigns weights to different teacher models based on their current performance, effectively transferring valuable knowledge from multiple excellent teacher models to the student model. Experimental results on the OPV2V and V2XSim 2.0 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy while exhibiting excellent comprehensive performance between detection accuracy and efficiency.

The 3D-to-2D perspective inconsistency and global attention lead to a weak correlation between foreground tokens and queries, resulting in slow convergence. We propose Focal-PETR with instance-guided supervision and spatial alignment module to adaptively focus object queries on discriminative foreground regions. Focal-PETR additionally introduces a down-sampling strategy to reduce the consumption of global attention.

In this work, we consider a formation tracking problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of a physical attacker. The safety/performance constraint functions are environment-aware and dynamic in nature, whose formulation depends on certain path parameters and presence of the attacker. The dependence on path ensures adaptation to the dynamic operation environment. The dependence on the attacker ensures swift adjustment based on the relative distances between the attacker and agents. UAV desired paths and desired path speeds can also be both path- and attacker-dependent. Composite barrier functions have been proposed to address the constraint requirements. Neural network is used to approximate unknown attacker velocity, where the ideal weight matrix is learned by adaptive laws. Besides, unknown system parameters and external disturbances are estimated by adaptive laws. The proposed formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all constraint requirements met.

Therefore, in the task planning problem, one needs to synthesize control and sensing decisions jointly in order to achieve the tasks. In this paper, we formulate and solve a control-sensing co-synthesis problem for linear temporal logic (LTL) tasks. The objective is to synthesize an active-sensing controller such that a given LTL formula accepted by a deterministic Büchi automaton can always be satisfied with a provably correct formal guarantee. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach integrating offline computations with online executions. Based on the winning regions pre-computed offline, the autonomous system can generate both control and sensing decisions online to drive the system. We show that the proposed approach is both sound and complete.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles demand reliable, continuous, and accurate positioning capability. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-inertial odometry (LIO) provides precise continuous relative pose estimation but suffers from drift over large-scale operations. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) offers drift-free absolute positioning capability but the accuracy is strongly affected by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions and multipath effects arising from the reflections of the surrounding environments. The tightly-coupled integration of the GNSS and LIO is highly complementary. However, how to fully utilize the complementariness of LiDAR measurements and the GNSS model is still an open question. More importantly, an open-sourced implementation of their integration is highly expected. To fill these gaps, this article proposes the GLIO, a GNSS/LiDAR/IMU integrated estimator that tightly fuses GNSS pseudorange, Doppler, LiDAR, and IMU measurements using factor graph optimization (FGO). In particular, the corrections from the reference station are adopted to remove the systematic errors involved in the GNSS pseudorange measurements. To fully exploit the complementariness of the LiDAR and GNSS measurements, two stages of the optimization scheme are utilized to achieve global consistent and continuous pose estimation. In the first stage of optimization, the sliding-window-based FGO is employed to integrate the GNSS-related factors, IMU pre-integration factor, and scan-to-map-based LiDAR factor for efficient odometry estimation. In the second stage of optimization, the LiDAR factor is employed as a scan-to-multiscan scheme to maintain global consistency and improve the robustness of the system to the GNSS outlier by large-scale batch optimization. We evaluate the proposed method and verify its effectiveness through the challenge dataset UrbanNav involving highly urbanized areas. The proposed system achieves more than 70% improvement in positioning accuracy compared with the traditional GNSS positioning method and LIO standalone system.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving will be widely deployed in the near future which can efficiently reduce the workload on human drivers. Unlike complicated urban driving conditions, fully autonomous driving is expected to be implemented in closed and relatively simple environments, e.g., mines. Autonomous driving in mines holds substantial practical value that can significantly reduce mining costs and enhance operational efficiency. To ensure vehicle safety, unmanned driving systems should be rigorously tested before deployment. With the rapid development of digital twin technology, offline testing in cyberspace has gained increasing significance. While numerous driving simulators have been recently released, none of them can support simulation tests in mines. In addition, due to the ignorance of human factors in the system, the digital twin in CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) is inadequate for developing next-generation intelligent testing systems. To address these issues, we propose PMWorld (Parallel Mines World) based on parallel intelligence in this paper, which is a novel parallel testing platform for autonomous mining vehicles. It not only considers human behaviors during testing but also constitutes a closed loop between physical and virtual systems, allowing for more efficient testing methods. We also introduce the key technical infrastructures for constructing the PMWorld platform and present various testing functionalities supported by PMWorld, including HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) test, RIL (Road-In-the-Loop) test, virtual-real interactive test, and integrated test with the scheduling system.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide various valuable and advanced services to manufacturers, owners, mobility service providers, and transportation authorities. As a result, a large number of CAV applications have been proposed to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of the transportation system. With the increasing connectivity and automation, cybersecurity of the connected and automated transportation system (CATS) has raised attention to the transportation community in recent years. Vulnerabilities in CAVs can lead to breakdowns in the transportation system and compromise safety (e.g., causing crashes), performance (e.g., increasing congestion and reducing capacity), and fairness (e.g., vehicles fooling traffic signals). This paper presents our perspective on CATS cybersecurity via surveying recent pertinent studies focusing on the transportation system level, ranging from individual and multiple vehicles to the traffic network (including infrastructure). It also highlights threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) tools and evaluation platforms, particularly for analyzing the CATS cybersecurity problem. Finally, this paper will provide valuable insights into developing secure CAV applications and investigating remaining open cybersecurity challenges that must be addressed.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is an important function of autonomous vehicles. However, most of the current state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models rely heavily on map information. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing models, our paper proposes a map-free trajectory prediction model and names it TR-Pred (Trajectory Relative two-stream Prediction). The trajectory stream employs LSTM to embedding the trajectory information of each agent. Subsequently, it utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) to extract latent traffic information in the current scenario, such as lane lines, drivable areas, and traffic control conditions. The relative stream utilizes temporal transformer to capture the local relative movement among agents. Subsequently, it employs GNN to extract the interaction information of all target agent. We augment the temporal transformer through refine initialization of its class token. This refined thereby enable enhanced modeling of inter-agent relative motion correlations between the agents. The decoder predicts the target agent by incorporating the historical interaction information among agents with latent traffic information. We validate TR-Pred on the Argoverse dataset, the highD dataset and the rounD dataset. The results show that TR-Pred performs better in the minimum Average Displacement Error compared to the main map-base model use in 2020, 2021. Experiments on Argoverse results show that our framework achieves a 16.3%/19.7%/24.4% improvement in minADE/minFDE(minimum Final Displacement Error)/MR(Miss Rate) compared to CRAT-Pred. The experimental results on highD and rounD show that, compared to the map-free version HiVT, our framework achieves improvements of 18.8%/18.8%/25.0% and 8.3%/8.5%/7.4% in minADE/minFDE/MR, respectively.},

To address this challenge, we propose RealtimeSeg, one of the first semantic segmentation models to be searched by neural architecture search(NAS), capable of running at real-time speed on edge devices. In our neural architecture search, we incorporate the inference time and FLOPs (floating-point operations) of the target edge devices and the semantic segmentation accuracy as objectives. In this way, we construct a multi-objective neural architecture search. Specifically, the multi-objective NAS&#39;s loss function is decomposed into three sub-objective loss functions, which are weighted and summed. We employed knowledge distillation to further enhance the accuracy, latency, and FLOPs of the discovered network architecture during the search process. As a result, we successfully obtained our RealtimeSeg model. Lastly, we utilized NVIDIA TensorRT to accelerate RealtimeSeg and deployed the accelerated RealtimeSeg on the target platform for real-time semantic segmentation. Using a single NVIDIA Titan XP GPU, RealtimeSeg can be obtained within 1.5 days. The experimental results demonstrate that RealtimeSeg achieved an accuracy of 71.7 mIoU(%) while maintaining a frame rate of 25.25 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson NX, using the input resolution of 1024 × 2048. And the RealtimeSeg has a lower FLOPs value of 1.52 G, which is 17-18× less than SOTA methods.

In addition, the delay-dependent convergence of the first-level controller and finite-time tracking of the second-level controller are rigorously analyzed, respectively.

  abstract     = {The safety and reliability of the railway vehicle door system are critical to ensure passengers’ safety and transportation efficiency. Fault diagnosis is essential for such a purpose. However, due to various uncertainties in the models and measurements, as well as the existence of incipient faults, traditional fault diagnosis methods often suffer from high false alarms. In this study, an incipient fault diagnosis method is developed using an information fusion strategy, which can greatly reduce false alarms and hence improve the reliability and accuracy of fault diagnosis results. The proposed fault diagnosis method is a data-driven approach, where current, rotational speed, rotational angle/distance signals collected from the driven motor and vibration signals collected from the supporting elements and door leaves are used for fault diagnosis. Initially, features are extracted from the signals to train two classifiers. Subsequently, these classifiers generate probabilities for different fault types. Then fault diagnosis model is developed using an information fusion strategy where evidence belief divergence and fuzzy preference relationship are employed to handle conflicts between different evidence. The principal contributions center on the elimination of information uncertainties within the railway door system, enabling precise diagnosis of incipient faults. To validate the methodology, verifications are conducted on a vehicle door test bench. Comparative experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed method in comparison to approaches that do not incorporate information fusion or address information conflicts. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances diagnosis accuracy by at least 10%.},

The multi-modal prediction uncertainties, containing both the maneuver and trajectory uncertainties of surrounding vehicles, are considered in computing the reference targets and designing the collision-avoidance constraints of MPC for resilient motion planning of the ego vehicle. The MPC achieves safety awareness by incorporating a tunable parameter to adjust the predicted obstacle occupancy in the design of the safety constraints, allowing the approach to achieve a trade-off between performance and robustness. Based on the prediction of the surrounding vehicles, an optimal reference trajectory of the ego vehicle is computed by MPC to follow the time-varying reference targets and avoid collisions with obstacles.

  abstract     = {Target-driven visual navigation presents great potentials in scientific and industrial fields. It takes the target and environment observations as input. However, during training, we found that the agent sometimes got stuck in specific locations. Based on the analysis on visual information from a novel causal perspective, one of the most critical hurdles is the neglect of confounders in environments, which often leads to spurious correlations. Mitigating the confounding effect helps to discover the real causality and therefore are taken into consideration in other fields such as object detection. In this article, we propose Causal Intervention Visual Navigation (CIVN), based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and causal intervention. We realize causal intervention using front-door adjustment as most confounders are hard to model explicitly. Specifically, CIVN is implemented by Causal Attention, which is a reasonable approximation of causal intervention for visual navigation. Causal attention provides high-quality representation, which is leveraged by DRL and reduces the number of “stuck”. It is worth mentioned that causal intervention is for the first time applied by us in solving the confounding effect in target-driven visual navigation. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR demonstrate that CIVN achieves better performance than prior arts. Specifically, the generalization for unknown targets and scenes is improved by a large margin, which is a basic research topic in visual navigation. Moreover, to obtain better generalization, we propose a novel experiment utilizing pre-trained models firstly.},

Different from the existing RRT-based methods, the AM with a larger connection distance is introduced in this paper to optimize the performance of robot motion planning in dynamic environments with obstacles. On this basis, the bidirectional search sampling strategy is employed to reduce the search time. Further, we present a new rewiring method to shorten path lengths. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed Bi-AM-RRT* are proved through comparative experiments in different environments. Experimental results show that the Bi-AM-RRT* algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of path length and search time, and always finds near-optimal paths with the shortest search time when the diffusion metric is used as the AM.},

  abstract     = {Point Cloud Registration (PCR) has been viewed as an essential part of photogrammetry, remote sensing, and autonomous robot mapping. Existing methods are either sensitive to rotation transformations, or rely on feature learning networks with poor generalization. We propose a novel outdoor point cloud registration algorithm, including preprocessing, yaw angle estimation, coarse registration, and fine registration (in short, PYRF-PCR). Specifically, the preprocessing effectively eliminates the interference of ground point clouds to PCR. The proposed yaw angle estimator solves large yaw-angle matching via a cross-correlation function that converts the focus from the yaw angle estimation to the LiDAR horizontal angular resolution analyses. Then, by using frequency distribution histograms, we improve the fast point feature histogram algorithm to filter the point clouds with a more stable density. For the fine registration, an improved iterative closest point based on target centroid distance is proposed, which reduces the running time and the search range between two point clouds. To validate the widespread applicability of PYRF-PCR, we experimented on both the open-source dataset (KITTI) and the local campus scene dataset. On the KITTI dataset, experimental results illustrate that the PYRF-PCR can achieve state-of-the-art results compared with the existing best methods. On the local scene datasets, the higher quality matching in different types of target point clouds reflects the generalization ability of PYRF-PCR.},

  abstract     = {As the level of vehicle intelligence increases, the amount of communication data is also constantly increasing. At the same time, there is parameter uncertainty and unknown disturbances in the vehicle system modeling poses challenges to the precise control of vehicle states. To address these challenges, an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control is presented. The fuzzy logic system (FLS) approximates the boundary of uncertain parameters and nonlinearity in the control system, which ensures control accuracy and robustness of the system. Additionally, to reduce the communication burden of the vehicle, an event-triggering strategy with relative threshold values is designed. This controller ensures that the control error converges to a neighborhood near the zero point while avoiding the Zeno behavior. The experimental results indicate that the control strategy ensures the control accuracy and reduces the communication burden. This approach provides an effective solution for designing lateral motion controllers for autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has attracted extensive attention and researchers have proposed various approaches. However, existing approaches are limited to small-scale isolated scenarios and gaps remain in network-wide cooperative driving, especially in routing. In this article, we decompose the network-level cooperative driving problem into two dominant sub-problems and accordingly propose a bi-level network-wide cooperative driving approach. The dynamic routing problem is considered in the upper level and we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based routing model. The model can promote the equilibrium of network-wide traffic through distributed self-organized routing collaboration among vehicles, thereby improving efficiency for both individual vehicles and global traffic systems. In the lower level, we focus on the right-of-way assignment problem at signal-free intersections and propose an adaptive cooperative driving algorithm. The algorithm can adaptively evaluate priorities of different lanes, and then uses the lane priorities to guide the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for better right-of-way assignments. Essentially, the upper level determines which conflict areas the vehicles will pass through, and the lower level addresses how the vehicles use the limited road resources more efficiently in each conflict area. The experimental results show that the upper and lower levels complement each other and work together to significantly improve the network-wide traffic efficiency and reduce the travel time of individual vehicles. Moreover, the results demonstrate that microscopic and mesoscopic cooperative driving behaviors of vehicles can significantly benefit the macroscopic traffic system.},

Integrating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication with AVs is beneficial since it provides information beyond the onboard sensors&#39; FoVs. To achieve safe driving behaviors in occlusion scenarios, we present a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) behavior planner enhanced with V2X communication. Our approach leverages the perception data from onboard sensors and V2X communications independently, eliminating the need for fusing them. The planner first employs onboard sensors to identify the occlusion areas. Then, it generates phantom road users within those areas to represent and consider the collision risk of potentially occluded real road users. Following this, we introduce a V2X communication module to provide the most promising detection result in the occluded area, taking factors like observation area coverage, communication latency, and sensor reliability into account. The detection result is subsequently applied to enhance presence and movement estimations for the phantom road users. Lastly, the detected real objects and phantom road users are integrated into the state space of a POMDP planner to provide safe driving policies. Various qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach delivers safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in challenging occlusion scenarios when compared to the baseline method, which uses only onboard sensors, and the method that fuses onboard and V2X perceptions.},

The proposed TPMO framework consists of two parts. The first part is to establish the STSC for each AGV based on the mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) algorithm. The proposed STSC method ensures collision avoidance in the environment of static and dynamic obstacles, and provides a longitudinal and lateral coupled trajectory (LLCT) for trajectory planning. The second part is to design a motion optimization methodology, which considers the constraints of AGV geometry as well as longitudinal and lateral coupled motion characteristics. Moreover, our formulation provides a theoretical guarantee that the entire trajectory is optimal under collision avoidance.

  abstract     = {Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems to make driving decisions and improve traffic safety. This paper proposes a novel Temporal Multi-task Mixture Of Experts (TMMOE) model for simultaneously predicting the vehicle trajectory and driving intention, considering interconnections among tasks. As for the methodology, the proposed model consists of three layers: a shared layer, an expert layer, and a fully connected layer. In more detail, the first layer utilizes Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to extract temporal features whereas the expert layer incorporates the gating mechanism to memorize and filter the temporal dependence of sequences and, finally, the fully connected layer is applied to integrate and export prediction results. Furthermore, the homoscedastic uncertainty algorithm is used to construct the multi-task loss function. The open data source CitySim dataset is chosen to validate the performance of the proposed TMMOE model; moreover, a novel lane line reconstruction method is introduced to mitigate measurement errors of the dataset. Two-part information, including the history of the vehicle&#39;s trajectory and the interaction indicators, are employed as the input variables. The result indicates that the TMMOE algorithm exhibits superior performance when compared to the other five models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, TCN, and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), while considering varying input sequence lengths are 3 s, 6 s, and 9 s respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that considering driving intentions in vehicle trajectory prediction can significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of vehicle trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based approaches hold great potential for autonomous urban driving motion planning. Compared to traditional rule-based methods, they offer greater flexibility in planning safe and human-like trajectories based on human driver demonstration data and diverse traffic scenarios. Frenet planning is widely applied in autonomous driving motion planning due to its simple representation of self-driving vehicle information. However, it is challenging to select proper terminal states and generate human-like trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based Frenet planning network (LF-Net) that learns a policy to sample and select the most human-like terminal states and then generate safe trajectories. The LF-Net includes 1) a Transformer-based sub-network that encodes environmental and vehicle interaction features, 2) a classification and scoring sub-network based on cross-attention mechanisms that captures the relationship between potential terminal states and environmental features to generate the optimal terminal states set, and 3) a trajectory generator based on LQR that fits a trajectory between the selected terminal state and the initial state. Experimental results on the real-world large-scale Lyft dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can plan safe and human-like driving behavior, and performs better than baseline methods.

Current methods mostly focus on minimizing the travel time or path length of AGVs and often overlook the fact that the AGVs could fail in many ways during the operation due to stochastic and rough terrain conditions. The objective of this article is to not only generate a proper path for the vehicle but also ensure that the planned path is overall reliable and safe for the vehicle with complex terrain conditions. To achieve this goal, this article develops a reliability-based mission planning method for off-road AGVs subject to two failure modes in terms of mobility (the maximum attainable speed and vehicle vertical acceleration) induced by the uncertain ground properties of the terrain. A physics-based vehicle dynamics simulation model is first employed to predict vehicle mobility for any given terrain conditions of a path. Mobility reliability of an AGV is then analyzed using surrogate modeling methods considering uncertainty sources in the off-road terrain conditions. After that, the reliability constraints for the two failure modes are integrated with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm to identify an optimal path, which is the shortest path while satisfying the reliability requirements of the two considered failure modes. Results of a case study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for path planning with the consideration of uncertainty in the deformable terrain.},

Addressing this, we introduce a mobile edge computing framework utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. This framework incorporates real-time vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and intelligent speed control algorithms into a mobile app, targeting speed optimization at signalized intersections to alleviate the negative impacts of stop-and-go traffic at urban intersections. The framework comprises three components: a cyberinfrastructure-based messaging system for real-time traffic and signal data from IoT-connected signal controllers and traffic sensors; a speed optimization algorithm generating speed advisories using phone-based sensor data (like GPS and driving directions), signal phase and timing information, and roadside vehicle detector data; and an ad-hoc mobile computing environment turning smartphones into edge devices for hosting the algorithm. This enables intelligent speed advisory along signalized corridors. The paper presents the detailed design and implementation of the proposed framework, highlighting its practicality, utility, and energy-saving potential. Our studies, including traffic simulations, real-vehicle lab experiments, evaluation surveys, and field tests, demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness.

In order to interact with the preceding vehicle, the target vehicle usually collects the driving data of the preceding vehicle. However, data acquisition devices often face malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, resulting in missing value problems. This may cause the target vehicle to make wrong control decisions. Given this situation, a new car-following(CF) model considering missing data based on Transformer-Generative Adversarial Networks (TransGAN) is proposed. Firstly, Transformer Network with multi-head attention is used to deeply extract the potential features from incomplete vehicle state data, which can filter important information from the input and focus on these, while capturing long distance dependencies. Secondly, a Generative Adversarial Network is constructed. The Generator generates the future multi-step control states of the target vehicle based on the features extracted by Transformer Network. The Discriminator with a fully connected network is applied to simultaneously ensure the generation accuracy. Finally, our proposed model was trained and tested on a publicly available NGSIM I-80 dataset. Compared with other existing advanced works, our model can fit the actual control states of the target vehicle with higher accuracy under different data missing rates of the preceding vehicle, which demonstrates that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of vehicle longitudinal car-following control under missing data.},

  abstract     = {Platooning control is a promising scheme to alleviate traffic congestion while maintaining the safety of road traffic. Vehicles&#39; cooperation deeply depends on the capability of communication infrastructure suffering from bandwidth constraints. This paper focuses on the platooning control problem of a class of nonlinear automated vehicles under constrained bit rate. A neural network (NN)-based observer is constructed to estimate the vehicular state, where a coding-decoding scheme is presented to alleviate the communication burden and an NN with carefully designed tuning laws is adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinearity. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition is received for realizing the required formation with the given constant inter-vehicle spacing. Based on this condition, the desired gains of NN-based observers and decoder-based controllers are accessible by resolving matrix inequalities insensitive to the number of vehicles. Furthermore, the upper bound of platoon tracking errors dependent on bit rate is analytically derived. Finally, an illustrative example shows the validity of the developed control scheme.},

The fuzzy state observers are designed to estimate the unmeasurable velocity and yaw velocity of USVs. An improved potential function is designed to establish the condition of collision avoidance of the follower vehicle and its potential obstacles. Then, based on the improved potential function, an observer-based fuzzy adaptive finite-time event-triggered FC method is developed by the event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By using finite-time stable, it is proved that the multi-USV systems are semi-global finite-time stable, the follower vehicles&#39; output can track to the leader vehicle&#39;s output and the follower vehicle and its leader vehicle are free of collision.

  abstract     = {Simulation testing based on virtual scenarios can improve the efficiency of safety testing for high-level autonomous vehicles (AVs). In most traffic scenarios, such as merging scenarios, the interactions between vehicles are a game process. Therefore, a critical factor is to accurately simulate the game and interaction processes between the background vehicle (BV) and AV in the test environment. With the increasing availability of natural driving data, a data-driven approach can be introduced to identify the underlying driving behavior patterns in actual driving data. Thus, this article proposes a data-driven method for modeling BV behavior for AV testing in virtual scenarios. The method describes the vehicle decision process in the merging scenario as a standard Markov decision process (MDP). Based on game theory, we considered the BV as a game subject to illustrate the vehicle interaction process. Furthermore, a deep maximum entropy-inverse reinforcement learning combined with the game matrix is proposed to identify the reward function that describes BV behavior. The obtained reward function is used to design a deep Q-network algorithm to simulate the behavior of BV. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with natural driving data. Moreover, we performed comparative tests with the other two baseline methods; the results show that the proposed method can accurately simulate the interaction behaviors between vehicles in the virtual scenarios.},

First, a fault-tolerant unscented Kalman filter (FTUKF) is developed for estimating longitudinal and lateral tire forces in the condition of sensor signal loss. Then, longitudinal and lateral TRFCs are estimated separately with FTUKF based on tire forces information. Next, an event-driven multi-model fusion method based on the degree of data loss is designed to perform a weighted fusion of longitudinal and lateral TRFCs to further improve the estimation accuracy. Experiments with different working conditions are performed to demonstrate the validity of the fault-tolerant estimation framework.

However, despite these advancements, the inaccurate detection of multi-object (small objects) remains challenging in the traffic environments. In this article, we propose a new architecture called YOLOM, which is specifically designed to achieve enhanced multi-object (small objects) detection precision. YOLOM incorporates several innovative features: a multi-spatial pyramid (MSP), an optimized focal loss (OFLoss) function, and an objectness loss that incorporates effective intersection over union (EIoU) calculations. These features collectively yield enhanced accuracy and reduce the miss rate of small objects, particularly in the multi-object cases. According to the sizes of receptive field features with different spatial scales with pooling layers, we propose the MSP module. We optimize the focal loss as a classification function instead of the cross-entropy loss, which solves some class imbalance problems caused by anchor-free detection when encountering disparate datasets. Due to the superior performance of EIoU in confidence scoring, we use EIoU to participate in the objectness loss calculation of our work. Therefore, our method substitutes EIoU for YOLOX&#39;s objectness loss. The experimental results demonstrate that our strategies significantly outperform some end-to-end object detection methods.},

With the technological development of autonomous intelligent systems, collective navigation has been an important application in the field of intelligent vehicles. However, many of the existing collective behavior approaches rely on communication exchanges between individuals and focus on the emergence of collective motion, which limits the application in specific mission scenarios and lacks robustness against interference. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel flocking-inspired approach of collective navigation for aerial vehicle swarms flying synchronously to the desired region. Firstly, flocking without communication is achieved based on bionic visual projection field (VPF), ensuring the normal operation of the swarm in communication-denied unknown environments. Secondly, each aerial entity is assigned a hidden identity as informed or uninformed, but only the informed agents are allocated information about the migration destination. Under such an architecture, the trade-off between informed and uninformed individuals in the group enables few-to-many control and fast navigation. Finally, simulation and experiments are both conducted within multiple scenarios, in terms of adaptability to different environments, swarm scalability, and robustness to vehicle failures. Results validate the effectiveness of the developed bio-inspired collective navigation algorithm.},

The energy and radio frequency (RF) for the operations of backscatter devices are supported by UAV, and finite block length data are transmitted via uplink. The block error rate (BLER), throughput, goodput, reliability, latency, and age of information (AoI) are used to evaluate the proposed system performance, where the closed-form BLER expressions are approximated by the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) probabilities. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the throughput subject to the number of transmit bits and the UAV altitude and to minimize BLER subject to the UAV altitude, then solve them by using the one-dimensional search method. Monte Carlo simulations verify the accuracy of analysis results. The results show that using multi-antennas and maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) significantly improves the BLER. In addition, choosing a suitable altitude of UAV and relevant transmission bit can provide the best BLER and throughput or goodput.

  abstract     = {Ego-pose estimation and 3D object tracking are two critical problems that autonomous driving systems must solve. The solutions to these problems are usually based on their respective assumptions, i.e., the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption in object tracking. However, these assumptions may not hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking are closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a tightly-coupled dynamic LiDAR SLAM and 3D object tracking method that addresses both problems simultaneously. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment in a unified optimization framework. First, we use object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, LiDAR odometry is performed using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we propose a sliding window-based 3D multi-object tracking method considering the historical trajectories of the tracked objects. The states of the ego-vehicle, stationary objects, and dynamic objects are jointly estimated by the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization to achieve SLOT. True stationary objects are restored from the potentially dynamic object set to join the optimization. Finally, a global pose graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and 3D object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually beneficial, and dramatically improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.},

The proposed system achieves this control by utilizing the differential longitudinal forces between the left and right sides. The system model incorporates the lateral motion and wheel steering models to consider the effect of the differential longitudinal forces. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted for the model representing the changes in the front wheel steering angle. As a result, the parameters are mapped with respect to the vehicle speed which has the most significant impact. A model-based state observer based on Kalman filter estimates the unobservable vehicle states. A controller based on a linear quadratic regulator is developed to accurately perform the steering motion of the vehicle according to the driver&#39;s intention.

Firstly, a more general physical security model is established to characterize the impacts of sensor and actuator attacks on measurements and control actions. Then, feedback linearization method based on Lie derivative is exploited to linearize the established nonlinear attacked model. Thus, the nonlinear path following control is transformed into a linear case which will facilitate to the following networked-based analysis and design. Based on the established secure model, the event-triggered control scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden under sampled-data control framework. Furthermore, the sliding control design is augmented to mitigate the malicious impacts caused by such false data injection attacks due to its inherent robustness to abnormal attack signal. Remarkably, the proposed secure sliding control can be plugged into the original control scheme rather than changing its existing control structure. Criteria for formal stability analysis and controller design are also provided and expressed in terms of some numerically tractable linear matrix inequalities. Finally, both simulation and experimental verification cases are shown to verify the composite control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Bird&#39;s eye view (BEV) perception is becoming increasingly important in the field of autonomous driving. It uses multi-view camera data to learn a transformer model that directly projects the perception of the road environment onto the BEV perspective. However, training a transformer model often requires a large amount of data, and as camera data for road traffic are often private, they are typically not shared. Federated learning offers a solution that enables clients to collaborate and train models without exchanging data but model parameters. In this article, we introduce FedBEVT, a federated transformer learning approach for BEV perception. In order to address two common data heterogeneity issues in FedBEVT: (i) diverse sensor poses, and (ii) varying sensor numbers in perception systems, we propose two approaches – Federated Learning with Camera-Attentive Personalization (FedCaP) and Adaptive Multi-Camera Masking (AMCM), respectively. To evaluate our method in real-world settings, we create a dataset consisting of four typical federated use cases. Our findings suggest that FedBEVT outperforms the baseline approaches in all four use cases, demonstrating the potential of our approach for improving BEV perception in autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have shown great potential in improving the energy efficiency of road transportation. Energy savings, however, greatly depends on driving behavior. Therefore, the controllers of CAVs must be carefully designed to fully leverage the benefits of connectivity and automation, especially if CAVs travel amongst other non-connected and human-driven vehicles. With this as motivation, we introduce a framework for the longitudinal control of CAVs traveling in mixed traffic including connected and non-connected human-driven vehicles. Reactive and predictive connected cruise control strategies are proposed. Reactive controllers are given by explicit feedback control laws. Predictive controllers, on the other hand, optimize the control input in a receding-horizon fashion, by predicting the motions of preceding vehicles. Beyond-line-of-sight information obtained via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is leveraged by the proposed reactive and predictive controllers. Simulations utilizing real traffic data show that connectivity can bring up to 30% energy savings in certain scenarios.},

Firstly, the constraint problem of the tracking error is transformed into an unconstrained problem based on the performance function, then the NNs are employed to approximate the uncertainties, and the ETESO with NNs is designed to estimate the combination of the approximation error and the external disturbance. Secondly, the perturbation of the controller gain is described by an external system, which is estimated by a fault observer. To avoid the problem of the differential explosion, the resilient controller is designed by the backstepping control method based on the command filter. Through the Lyapunov stability analysis, all signals of the entire system are uniformly ultimate bounded. Finally, the flight control experiment is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the control scheme.},

However, the performance still lags far behind LiDAR-based depth completion algorithms. This is because the completion algorithms not only utilize the RGB image, but also have the prior of sparse depth collected by LiDAR. To reduce this performance gap, we propose a novel initiative that incorporates the concept of pseudo-LiDAR into depth estimation. The pseudo-LiDAR depends only on the camera and thus achieves a lower cost than LiDAR. To emulate the scan pattern of LiDAR, geometric sampling and appearance sampling are proposed. The former measures the vertical and horizontal azimuths of 3D scene points to establish the geometric correlation. The latter helps determine which “pseudo-LiDAR rays” return an answer and which do not. Then, we build a sparse pseudo-LiDAR-based depth estimation framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art competitors on the KITTI, NYU-Depth-v2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become important tools in the ocean exploration and have drawn considerable attention. Precise control for AUVs is the prerequisite to effectively execute underwater tasks. However, the classical control methods such as model predictive control (MPC) rely heavily on the dynamics model of the controlled system which is difficult to obtain for AUVs. To address this issue, a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework for AUV path-following control is proposed in this article. Specifically, we propose a novel actor-model-critic (AMC) architecture integrating a neural network model with the traditional actor-critic architecture. The neural network model is designed to learn the state transition function to explore the spatio-temporal change patterns of the AUV as well as the surrounding environment. Based on the AMC architecture, a RL-based controller agent named ModelPPO is constructed to control the AUV. With the required sailing speed achieved by a traditional proportional-integral (PI) controller, ModelPPO can control the rudder and elevator fins so that the AUV follows the desired path. Finally, a simulation platform is built to evaluate the performance of the proposed method that is compared with MPC and other RL-based methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than other methods, which demonstrate the great potential of the advanced artificial intelligence methods in solving the traditional motion control problems for intelligent vehicles.},

While estimating the odometry from LiDAR and cameras has progressed recently, it remains to be seen how to estimate the odometry from a 4D radar, an emerging sensor with unique advantages over cameras and LiDAR. In this study, a deep-learning-based 4D radar odometry method, named 4DRO-Net, is proposed. The method employs a coarse-to-fine hierarchical optimization technique based on a sliding window to estimate and refine an autonomous vehicle&#39;s pose in an iterative manner. A feature-extraction network for 4D radar point clouds is proposed to achieve efficient learning of sparse point clouds. An initial pose-generation module is constructed to obtain the initial pose, which is used to warp the first point cloud and bridge the distance to the second point cloud. A velocity-aware attention cost volume module is then developed to correlate the warped first point cloud with the second point cloud to obtain point-motion information. The velocity information of the radar points is used to learn the attention weights to increase the robustness of the motion information estimation. Motion information is used to regress the corrected pose, which is then used to refine the initial pose to obtain a more accurate final pose. The superior performance and effectiveness of our 4D radar odometry method are demonstrated on both the View-of-Delft and an in-house dataset.},

In UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs), caching necessary data in RSU/UAV reduces task execution delay and bandwidth cost significantly. However, for the constrained storage and computation capacities of UAV and the dynamic requests of users, the efficient caching data selection and replacement schemes are needed. In this article, we propose a novel joint hybrid caching and replacement scheme in a scene that a single UAV assists RSU to cover a set of vehicle users with large number of iterative calculation tasks. In particular, both the content caching and service caching are considered for the RSU and UAV. To minimize the whole task completion delay of users, we joint optimize the hybrid caching data selection of UAV and the task offloading strategy of users, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based solution is proposed to improve the utility of UAV. Then, we design an optimal evaluation function, and propose a caching replacement scheme for both the RSU and UAV. For RSU and UAV can update its caching data separately, a double-DQN (DDQN)-based solution is proposed. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have good convergence, and the designed schemes reduce the task completion delay efficiently.},

Specifically, we propose a floating-point sparse octree as the structure for storing map information and aligning local maps by transforming three vertices in the octree. To ensure more accurate and efficient map fusion, our backend employs place recognition, implicit alignment, and removal of redundant data.

Compared with common event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), it enables monitoring periodically and increases effectively the lower bound of event intervals. Second, in order to evaluate the impact of DoS attacks and periodic ETM on the platoon, a switched system model is established which combines periodic sampling and DoS attacks scenarios uniformly. Furthermore, by using a novel piecewise Lyapunov functional, the co-design criterion is obtained for event-triggered parameters and resilient platooning controller. Such functional not only matches the sawtooth constraint but also accommodates the adverse impacts of DoS attacks.

To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that considers driving priors and Social Coordination Awareness (SCA) to optimize the behavior of AVs. The framework integrates a driving prior learning (DPL) model based on a variational autoencoder to infer the driver&#39;s driving priors from human drivers&#39; trajectories. A policy network based on a multi-head attention mechanism is designed to effectively capture the interactive dependencies between AVs and other traffic participants to improve decision-making quality. The introduction of SCA into the autonomous driving decision-making system, and the use of Coordination Tendency (CT) to quantify the willingness of AVs to coordinate the traffic system is explored. The unsignalized intersection serves as a representative experimental scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can not only improve the decision-making quality of AVs but also motivate them to produce social behaviors, with potential benefits for the safety and traffic efficiency of the entire transportation system.},

  abstract     = {The 4D millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar is a promising technology for vehicle sensing due to its cost-effectiveness and operability in adverse weather conditions. However, the adoption of this technology has been hindered by sparsity and noise issues in radar point cloud data. This article introduces spatial multi-representation fusion (SMURF), a novel approach to 3D object detection using a single 4D imaging radar. SMURF leverages multiple representations of radar detection points, including pillarization and density features of a multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture distribution through kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE effectively mitigates measurement inaccuracy caused by limited angular resolution and multi-path propagation of radar signals. Additionally, KDE helps alleviate point cloud sparsity by capturing density features. Experimental evaluations on View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of SMURF, outperforming recently proposed 4D imaging radar-based single-representation models. Moreover, while using 4D imaging radar only, SMURF still achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art 4D imaging radar and camera fusion-based method, with an increase of 1.22% in the mean average precision on bird&#39;s-eye view of TJ4DRadSet dataset and 1.32% in the 3D mean average precision on the entire annotated area of VoD dataset. Our proposed method demonstrates impressive inference time and addresses the challenges of real-time detection, with the inference time no more than 0.05 seconds for most scans on both datasets. This research highlights the benefits of 4D mmWave radar and is a strong benchmark for subsequent works regarding 3D object detection with 4D imaging radar.},

  abstract     = {A tiltrotor aircraft (TRA) can both hover in the air (hover flight state) and cruise quickly (level flight state). Transition flight is a transitional state between these two flight states, during which tiltable rotors rotate, forming a unique state for TRA. Revolving of the tiltrotor shaft leads to strong nonlinearity and time-varying uncertainty, which weakens the stability of attitude control with linearization in transition flight. The safety of TRA is critical, but it can be easily harmed due to the weak control stability. This study is to regulate the TRA attitudes agilely and precisely simultaneously, by ensuring fast convergence speed and small convergence error, i.e., a prescribed transient and steady state performance (PTSSP). A constraint-based adaptive robust prescribed performance control (CARPPC) is proposed for TRA to follow the desired attitude while guaranteeing PTSSP, with no approximations or linearizations invoked. The desired attitudes and PTSSP are respectively described as equality and inequality servo constraints. A constraint-based control with state transformation is introduced to render both equality and inequality constraint-following. An adaptive law is established for online estimation of unknown uncertainty bounds to compensate time-varying uncertainty. Both theoretical proofs and simulation results demonstrated that CARPPC can realize agile and precise attitude control robustly in transition flight.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving essentially transforms the role of human drivers from active decision-makers to passive supervisors. The change in gaze patterns elicited by such a transformation may influence vehicle control during manual takeover, thereby altering the visual risk perception. However, the specific impact of automated driving on visual risk perception remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the visual risk perception of automated driving tasks by analyzing the gaze pattern dispersion, which reflects the coverage of visual attention distribution. Ten participants perform manual and automated driving tasks. Each driving task includes acceleration, maintaining constant speeds, and deceleration phases. The constant speeds were set to 40, 60, and 80 km/h, and the deceleration rates were set to −2.5, −5.0, and −7.5 m/s 2 . The probability density estimation method is proposed to calculate gaze density regions that reflect the gaze patterns dispersion. The results indicate that automated driving causes more dispersed gaze patterns in the initial acceleration and lower speed phases. However, gaze patterns are not significantly dispersed in the highest speed and all deceleration phases during automated driving. Furthermore, gaze patterns are highly constrained by the increasing deceleration rates during manual driving. Conversely, automated driving does not constrain gaze patterns among the three deceleration rates. The dispersed gaze patterns during automated driving suggest that the visual risk perception may be decreased, potentially resulting in the weakening of takeover control. Therefore, it is necessary to judiciously design the takeover control of automated driving to ensure driving safety during initial acceleration and lower speeds.},

The trend of self-driving car will affect the design of vehicles that incorporates with numerous intelligent modules (e.g., traffic sign recognition). In contrast to a typical AI task (e.g., digit recognition), self-driving car will have countless situations in the real world. Therefore, the self-driving car system requires a long-term development process or even endless maintenance activities. We have to address the newly discovered image corruption rapidly for a robust recognition system. Hence, we proposed our agile development framework for AI system, which is inspired from agile software development paradigm. Our agile framework of AI system aims to speed up the development cycle for each newly discovered image corruption. We denote the training time of each incremental development cycle as the marginal cost of AI system development. We proposed an agile development paradigm called modular learning that incorporates with knowledge distillation to reduce the marginal cost. The acceleration of our method is up to $49\times$ while the recognition accuracy degradation is around 1%. We found that the studies for long-term AI system development are rarely addressed in the literature. We expect our preliminary and promising results can inspire more efforts in this direction.},

In this context, unlike a traditional ship fleet dispatching problem which only focuses on logistics, a joint optimal energy management and logistic scheduling is proposed in this article, taking into account the navigation risk. To minimize the operation costs while ensuring the logistics service quality, a hierarchical coordinated optimization framework is proposed to jointly optimize the logistics scheduling and energy management, adhering to navigation safety guidelines. Within this framework, novel risk-aware port-to-port paths are determined using a specific graph search algorithm tailored for multi-port maritime transportation, guaranteeing the safety and reliability of each all-electric ship (AES). The optimal logistics scheduling, including spatial-temporal trip chains for AESs in the fleet, is performed to reduce turnaround time. Furthermore, in order to improve the operational performance of ship fleets, an advanced energy management integrated with voyage speed adjustment is employed to minimize fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for each AES. Numerical results reveal that with the help of the proposed coordinated optimization algorithm, both economic costs and carbon emissions are efficiently reduced with high-quality logistics services.},

This study presents a hierarchical control scheme to simultaneously guarantee the vehicle energy conservation and handling stability. In the upper layer, the tire nonlinear characteristics are reconstructed by the polytopic method to facilitate the controller design. Then a robust controller is developed to address the model uncertainties and ensure the vehicle handling stability by integrating the direct yaw moment control (DYC) system and the active front wheel steering (AFS) system. Furthermore, the stability performance of independently driven electric vehicles is analyzed and quantified with different regions in the tire slip angles phase plane. Considering the uncertain longitudinal velocity, the lower layer utilizes a linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTV-MPC) to develop the torque allocation strategy and realize energy conservation. The control authority for stability performance and energy conservation is dynamically adjusted by assessing the vehicle safety state. Hardware-in-the loop (HIL) tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness. The test results demonstrate the proposed method is feasible to balance different control objectives.},

Considering the limitations of robot&#39;s vision field and communication distance, a universal barrier function and the prescribed performance technique are introduced to achieve collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance. Furthermore, in order to save the resources of information transmission and reduce the number of actuators executions reasonably, an event-triggered mechanism is designed. The robots can interact with their leader at event-triggering time, and also quickly track the leader&#39;s time-varying trajectory in finite time. With the aid of dynamic surface technique, an adaptive finite-time event-triggering (FTET) formation control scheme is further proposed, which guarantees that formation tracking errors converge into a small neighborhood of zero in finite-time and all signals in the controlled systems are bounded. Ultimately, we demonstrate the feasibility of the FTET formation control scheme for nonholonomic multirobot systems.},

Therein, the information of the virtual aerials can be mapped from a virtual ship. Further, the desired attitude angles are derived under the cooperative virtual guidance framework.

A payload velocity observer is designed to ensure its status is always available. Furthermore, in order to meet the needs of transporting objects of varying weights, the system utilizes data feedback from the force sensor to autonomously adapt to various payload masses. Based on the payload state estimation, a payload trajectory tracking controller that only relies on onboard sensing to achieve outdoor operation is designed. And multiple sets of simulations and real-world outdoor experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the controller.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Planning-inspired Hierarchical (PiH) trajectory prediction framework that selects path and goal intentions through a hierarchical lateral and longitudinal decomposition. For path selection, we propose a hybrid lateral predictor to choose fixed-distance lateral paths from a candidate set of map-based road-following paths and cluster-based free-move paths. For goal selection, we propose a lateral-conditional longitudinal predictor to choose plausible goals by sampling from the selected lateral paths. Finally, we incorporate lateral-longitudinal information to generate final future trajectories based on a category distribution of path-goal intentions.

However, the actual system is essentially dynamic, and the generalized force or torque driven by the design meets the actual requirements. Given this consideration, the fixed-time posture and velocity leader-following consensus problem is investigated for a class of nonholonomic robots, namely, the tractor-trailer vehicles with dynamics control. A nonlinear leader system capable of generating reference postures and velocities applicable to tractor-trailer vehicles is first formulated. Utilizing the newly proposed distributed observer capable of estimating the state and output matrix of the leader system in fixed time and the distributed internal model capable of reconstructing information in fixed time, all the tractor-trailer vehicles can acquire and construct the necessary reference information through the communication network in fixed time. Then, by combining the dynamic gain and state constraint methods, a fixed-time velocity ideal controller capable of overcoming nonholonomic constraints, exerting the desired control over postures, and with first-order derivability capable of being tracked by the actual velocity through the design of the control torque is devised at the kinematic level, which ensures that the fixed-time dynamics controller designed around it accomplishes the control objectives while sidestepping potential singularity issues that may arise from the use of existing non-smooth fixed-time control strategies.},

In some researches, the risk is modeled as the effect of each environment element on the ego vehicle. However, the overall understanding of the whole scenario is not achieved. In order to get a comprehensive understanding of the overall scenario, some researchers analyzed risk with 2D field. However, the analysis of surface-level dense risk distribution has heavy computational burden. In view of this, we proposed the boundary-based risk assessment method and corresponding decision-making mechanism, as a light-weighted way of understanding the overall risk distribution for intelligent vehicles. First, different environment elements are generally modeled as the unified environment boundary representing space occupation, semantic type and motion status. Then, the risk in different directions is analyzed according to the environment boundary in the ego-centered polar coordinate. Furthermore, considering the perception uncertainty, the safe boundary is set to serve for decision-making as boundary constraint. Experiment results proved that the proposed boundary-based risk assessment method has significantly reduced computational burden than surface-level dense risk assessment with similar decision performance.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel online adaptive method for estimating the process and measurement noise covariance matrices in Kalman filters (KFs) to address the challenge of varying noise characteristics in practical applications. Specifically, the proposed method decomposes the noise covariance matrix into an element distribution matrix and a noise intensity and employs an improved Sage filter to estimate the element distribution matrix. Additionally, a calibration and correction method is introduced to accurately determine and adaptively correct the online bias of the noise intensity. The unbiasedness and convergence of the proposed method are mathematically proven under the condition that the system is detectable. Moreover, this method is applied to multiobject tracking (MOT) based on KFs and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and it is evaluated on the KITTI dataset and the official KITTI server. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly improved MOT performance based on KFs and outperforms other LiDAR-based methods on the KITTI leaderboard. This method provides a new approach for enhancing the performance of KFs and assisting with MOT, and it has practical feasibility for real-world applications.},

Both academic research and commercial applications of autonomous driving vehicles require extensive simulation and real-world testing. The challenge lies in effectively transferring driving knowledge from the virtual simulation world to the reality world, known as the reality gap (RG). This gap arises due to differences in lighting, textures, vehicle dynamics, and agents&#39; behaviors between the two environments. To address this issue, researchers have explored three main approaches: sim2real, digital twins (DTs), and parallel intelligence (PI) technologies. This article reviews these solutions and examines their applications and innovations in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we delve into the state-of-the-art algorithms, models, and involved simulators, and discuss the developmental process from sim2real to DTs and PI.

Moreover, sophisticated energy management strategies (EMSs) not only augment the efficacy of energy-saving control but also ensure adaptability under varied driving conditions. In this article, a learning-and-tube-based robust model predictive control (LTRMPC) strategy is proposed for a 4-wheel-drive PHEV (4WD PHEV). The suggested strategy enhances the economic efficiency of the intricate powertrain while preserving control robustness across diverse driving scenarios. Firstly, instead of utilizing a mathematical state predictive model to mirror state changes, a novel state observer is proposed, which uses a deep learning technique named Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The novel state observer boasts an enhanced feature fusion ability, thereby reflecting state changes accurately within the predictive horizon. Secondly, to mitigate the negative effects of state observation errors on control outcomes, a tube-based cost function is integrated into the learning-MPC framework to restrain the state changes into a certain range to further reinforce the control robustness. Finally, a simulation evaluation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test validate that the proposed method can improve economic performance across various lengths of the predictive horizon and the energy-saving capability is stable compared with other baselines, showcasing its promising performance.},

  abstract     = {The development of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, as well as the progress of unmanned aerial vehicle swarm technology, has significantly enhanced the intelligence and autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles in search missions, resulting in greater efficiency when searching unknown areas. However, as search scenarios become more complex, the existing unmanned aerial vehicle swarm search method lacks scalability and efficient cooperation. Furthermore, due to the increasing scale of search scenarios, the accuracy and real-time performance of global information are difficult to ensure, necessitating the provision of local information. This paper focuses on the large-scale search scenario and split it to provide both local and global information for running unmanned aerial vehicle swarm search algorithms. Since the search environment is often unknown, dynamic, and complex, it requires adaptive decision-making in a constantly changing environment, which is suitable for modeling as a Markov decision process. Considering the sequential-based scenario, we propose a distributed collaborative search method based on a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, which can operate efficiently in complex and large-scale scenarios. Additionally, the proposed method can utilize a convolutional neural network to process high-dimensional map data with almost no loss of the structure information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can collaboratively search unknown areas, avoid collisions and repetitions, and find all targets faster compared with the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Transformer-based methods have demonstrated superior performance for monocular 3D object detection recently, which aims at predicting 3D attributes from a single 2D image. Most existing transformer-based methods leverage both visual and depth representations to explore valuable query points on objects, and the quality of the learned query points has a great impact on detection accuracy. Unfortunately, existing unsupervised attention mechanisms in transformers are prone to generate low-quality query features due to inaccurate receptive fields, especially on hard objects. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel “Supervised Scale-aware Deformable Attention” (SSDA) for monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, SSDA presets several masks with different scales and utilizes depth and visual features to adaptively learn a scale-aware filter for object query augmentation. Imposing the scale awareness, SSDA could well predict the accurate receptive field of an object query to support robust query feature generation. Aside from this, SSDA is assigned with a Weighted Scale Matching (WSM) loss to supervise scale prediction, which presents more confident results as compared to the unsupervised attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate that SSDA significantly improves the detection accuracy, especially on moderate and hard objects, yielding state-of-the-art performance as compared to the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Object detection is an important research topic in traffic scenes. Although object detection based on deep learning has made some progress, it is still a challenge to improve the accuracy of multiple objects in complex traffic scenes. One-to-one matching is the key for Sparse R-CNN to achieve end-to-end object detection, enables detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove redundant boxes. However, the matching strategy makes the number of learnable proposal boxes assigned as positive samples low, and significantly reduces the training efficiency of positive samples. Therefore, we use a hybrid matching strategy, which combines the original one-to-one matching branch with a new one-to-many matching branch during training to improve the accuracy of detection, and uses the original one-to-one matching during inference, thus maintaining the end-to-end advantages and the same inference efficiency. Meanwhile, we propose the gated channel space attention (GCSA) to build more powerful backbone extraction features, and dynamic space multi-scale fusion (DSMSF) to fuse multi-scale and multi-location spatial information to obtain richer global features. Due to the complexity of the traffic scenes, we not only validate the performance of the model with the KITTI dataset and Mini-COCO-Traffic dataset, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of the model with the COCO 17 dataset and the VOC dataset. The experimental results show that our model improves the accuracy significantly on all four datasets, including 2.4% AP and 2.6% AP.S with a model complexity of 137.8 GFLOPs on the KITTI dataset, and a object detection model with a Resnet50 backbone achieves 62.4% AP@0.5 on the COCO dataset.},

Depth estimation with multi-spectrum images has the potential for more reliable depth estimation under varying illumination conditions. However, most of the existing multi-spectrum depth estimation methods rely on the supervision of ground-truth depth information or other additional complex labels or equipment, resulting in limited convenience for practical application. To address these challenges, we propose a new unsupervised all-day depth estimation framework with multi-spectrum stereo images, specifically, a thermal image (acting as the right view) and a visible-light image (acting as the left view), and they are denoted as a single frame of multi-spectrum stereo sequences. The network uses multiple frames of multi-spectrum stereo images as input during training and a single frame of multi-spectrum stereo images as input for testing. We improve the depth estimation accuracy by combining the intra-spectrum temporal consistency and the cross-spectrum spatial consistency. A unique self-teacher structure is integrated to augment the quality of nighttime depth estimation using daytime image data. Simultaneously, we release a large multi-spectrum stereo dataset, which includes TIR-VIS stereo images collected during the day and night. Experimental results reveal that our method achieves a significant improvement in all-day depth estimation by effectively utilizing multi-spectrum stereo images.},

  abstract     = {Dense semantic scene understanding of the surrounding environment in top-view is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles. Recent LiDAR-based semantic perception works mainly focus on point-wise predictions of the LiDAR points instead of dense predictions of the environment, making them not appropriate for path-planning tasks. Pillar and voxel representations can achieve dense predictions, but the generation of data representation and data processing are usually time-consuming. In this article, we propose a top-view semantic completion network to produce accurate dense grid-wise predictions with real-time performance. Specifically, we propose an online distillation strategy, consisting of two parts: a student model using 2D range-view and top-view representations, and a teacher model using range-view, top-view, and voxel representations. To realize information transfer between different representations, we propose a cross-view association (CVA) module, by which the range-view features and 3D voxel features are converted into the ones in the top-view. The proposed method can avoid the difficulty of direct dense semantic segmentation in the top-view, with the point-wise sparse semantic segmentation module acting as a guide for the dense grid-wise semantic completion in a semantic-completion way. It can also alleviate the computational complexity by using only the voxel representation and 3D convolution in the teacher model. The experimental results on the SemanticKITTI dataset (46.4% mIoU) and nuScenes-LidarSeg dataset (47.3% mIoU) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sparse guidance and online distillation strategies.},

For reducing communication costs and the negative effect of bounded inputs and the unknown uncertainties, a hierarchical reinforcement learning control (HRLC) algorithm based on the cloud-supported communication is proposed, where the cloud-supported estimator is constructed such that the estimated states approach the leader&#39;s states with the less communication costs.

  abstract     = {Event-triggered model predictive control (eMPC) is a popular optimal control method with an aim to alleviate the computation and/or communication burden of MPC. However, it generally requires a priori knowledge of the closed-loop system behavior along with the communication characteristics for designing the event-trigger policy. This paper attempts to solve this challenge by proposing an efficient eMPC framework and demonstrates successful implementation of this framework on the autonomous vehicle path following. First of all, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to learn the optimal event-trigger policy without the need for a complete dynamical system and communication knowledge in this framework. Furthermore, techniques including prioritized experience replay (PER) buffer and long short-term memory (LSTM) are employed to foster exploration and improve training efficiency. In this paper, we use the proposed framework with three deep RL algorithms, i.e., Double Q-learning (DDQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to solve this problem. Results show that all three deep RL-based eMPC (deep-RL-eMPC) can achieve better evaluation performance than the conventional threshold-based and previous linear Q-based approach in the autonomous path following. In particular, PPO-eMPC with LSTM and DDQN-eMPC with PER and LSTM obtain a superior balance between the closed-loop control performance and event-trigger frequency.},

This article presents a loosely coupled method based on generalized probability data association (GPDA) to fuse INS and UWB, and on the basis of traditional GPDA, a GPDA based on modified verification gate (MVG) is proposed. The proposed algorithm correlates the difference between INS and UWB position estimation with GPDA algorithm. Finally, the difference is used for amend the INS localization estimation. The algorithm quality is improved. In the UWB part, GPDA is used again to fuse three different position estimation methods, which alleviates the NLOS error and enhances robustness.

  abstract     = {Lane changes require dynamic decision-making and rapid behavior planning, which are challenging for traffic modeling. We propose a two-dimensional following lane-changing framework (2DF-LC) that exploits the benefits of car-following (CF) models for computational efficiency, collision avoidance, and human-like behavior. This framework uses a sigmoid-based intelligent driver model (SIDM) with both longitudinal and lateral following. To avoid excessive acceleration at start-up, we develop an SIDM that ensures a smooth start-up. In the longitudinal plane, we introduce a transition function to create a double-target car-following model (DT-SIDM) that can handle sudden acceleration changes due to target switching, thereby guaranteeing stable longitudinal motion and dynamic collision avoidance. In the lateral plane, we develop a lateral movement car-following model (LM-SIDM) inspired by a social force model. The LM-SIDM defines both lane and gap forces, resulting in effective lateral motion and collision avoidance during lane changes. Simulations and tests in three typical scenarios show that 2DF-LC has high computational efficiency: it completes calculations within milliseconds. Compared with the widely used hierarchical motion planning system (HMPS) and integrated model and learning combined algorithm (IMLC) methods, 2DF-LC based on real trajectories reduces the errors by 49.5% and 16.1%, respectively, and achieves a 28.63% lower time-integrated anticipated collision time (TI-ACT) than the original trajectories, indicating improved safety. Moreover, 2DF-LC produces a smooth acceleration curve, with an average jerk value of 0.358 m/s 3 . The lane-change trajectory generated by 2DF-LC can also be followed and executed effectively in CarSim tests.},

  abstract     = {To design an effective intelligent control algorithm for performance improvement of the MR semi-active suspension for intelligent vehicles, there is a demand to considerably shorten and precisely model the MR damper response time. A rapid response current source is developed to shorten the output current response time, and the corresponding experimental method is proposed to provide measurement data to accurately model both the MR damper&#39;s rising and descending response times. Firstly, a unilateral series pre-charged capacitor based current source and the corresponding receding design method are presented. Subsequently, the experimental scheme is designed to test the MR damper&#39;s rising and descending response times under both different exciting sine displacement frequencies and square-waved control current amplitudes. Consequently, both the MR damper&#39;s rising and descending response times are precisely modeled. Analyses of experimental results corroborate effectiveness of the self-manufactured rapid response current source and precision of the testing data based models for the MR damper&#39;s rising and descending response times. Especially by adopting the newly developed current source, when both the exciting displacement frequency and control current change, the MR damper&#39;s rising and descending response times are reduced to less than 9 ms subjected to the control current amplitude of 3 A, and the maximum model error is less than 2%.},

This network utilizes sparse convolutions to learn the local detail of the voxel-wise features and proposed lightweight grouped efficient attention mechanisms to capture the global representations of the point-wise features. To enhance the discrimination of the global descriptors, these two kinds of features are fused in an interactive way to take advantage of point-wise features without information loss and voxel-wise ones robust to local noises. In addition, a positive-ranking guided triplet loss is proposed, which further considers the consistency of distance ranking between different anchor-positive pairs in both Euclidean and feature space. Experiments on the benchmark, KITTI, NCLT, and one self-collected dataset show that HVP-Net achieves state-of-the-art results and can effectively improve the generalization ability for unseen environments.},

A Multi-Cross Hybrid Former (MCHFormer) of point-image is proposed for 3D object detection in autonomous driving, which cross-fuses LiDAR with cameras at multiple levels. Specifically, the voxelized point cloud is firstly extracted through a Dual-Stream Feature Extraction (DSFE) network. Local fine-grained area information is integrated into the global feature information, which results in a multi-layered Bird&#39;s Eye View (BEV). Meanwhile, the raw coordinates of points are incorporated into point-wise features through position coding. Then, point features are projected onto image and BEV features to obtain highly coupled multimodal information, which achieves alignment of point cloud with image information. Finally, a multi-cross Transformer fuses multiple unimodal data into a hybrid representation with more spatial awareness, which achieves accurate 3D object detection. MCHFormer are conducted extensive comparative experiments with other State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) algorithms on the KITTI, NuScenes, Waymo datasets and real road scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has better accuracy and generalization capability, but also has accurate detection effect on real road scenarios.},

By introducing a pre-filter, the large heading change rate can be avoided and the robustness of controller is improved. Then, a fuzzy adaptive observer (FAO) is developed, based on which an adaptive mechanism is given to estimate the unmeasurable states, sideslip angle, and fault signals simultaneously. Furthermore, utilizing the online estimation information provided by FAO, a FAO-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller is designed to mitigate the effects of sideslip angle and fault.

  abstract     = {Motion planning is a process of constant negotiation with the rest of the traffic agents and is highly conditioned by their movement prediction. Indeed, an incorrect prediction could cause the motion planning algorithm to adopt overly conservative or reckless behaviors that can eventually become a dangerous driving situation. This article presents a framework integrating motion planning and interaction-aware motion prediction algorithms, which interact with each other and are able to run in real-time on complex areas such as roundabouts or intersections. The proposed motion prediction strategy generates a multi-modal probabilistic estimation of the future positions and intentions of the surrounding vehicles by taking into account traffic rules, vehicle interaction, road geometry and the reference trajectory of the ego-vehicle; the resulting predictions are fed into a sampling-based maneuver and trajectory planning algorithm that identifies the possible collision points for every generated trajectory candidate and acts accordingly. This framework enables the automated driving system to have a more agile behavior than other strategies that use more simplistic motion prediction models and where the planning stage does not provide feedback. The approach has been successfully evaluated and compared with a state-of-art approach in highly-interactive scenarios generated from public datasets and real-world situations in a software-in-the-loop simulation system.},

However, existing ground segmentation algorithms primarily focus on dense point cloud data and often struggle to achieve satisfactory accuracy when applied to sparse point cloud data. In light of this challenge, we propose a novel ground segmentation method, LR-Seg, specifically tailored for sparse point cloud data. Our method aims to address the limitations observed in previous approaches and provide improved performance, particularly on sparse point cloud data. To achieve faster processing speed, the method first divides the original point cloud into sub-regions of different sizes based on the distribution characteristics of the sparse point cloud data in the XOY plane. Then, the point clouds are appropriately assigned, and most of the non-ground points in each sub-region are removed using the PCA plane fitting method. Finally, the point cloud geometric feature information within each sub-region is used to reduce over-segmentation. The experimental results show that our method can perform ground segmentation quickly on flat and slope road sections, and the average F1 score can be maintained above 90% with an average time of 3 ms, which is suitable for various road environments.},

To do so, we performed a driving simulator study with 43 participants. Results show that users with a more positive attitude towards technology prefer more infrastructure information. Furthermore, users familiar with Automatic Cruise Control prefer less system limit information, while higher experience with Steering Assists relates to higher preference in this regard. These findings add concrete mechanisms to the theory of personalized AD UIs and inform product development on how to create more personalized user experiences.

However, the limited onboard energy inhibits the UAV from serving for a longer duration. Therefore, this article studies a UAV-aided network where multiple UAVs are launched to collect data from the mobile nodes. In particular, we aim to maximize the service time of the UAVs by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the UAVs and resources allocated to each node by the UAVs such that each mobile node receives a minimum specified data rate. To facilitate a solution, we construct an equivalent problem that considers the UAV&#39;s energy consumption. In particular, we minimize the maximum energy consumed by the UAVs in each time slot. To solve the problem, an iterative approach is presented that decouples the problem into two sub-problems. The optimal location of the UAVs is computed in the first sub-problem, while resource allocation is carried out in the second sub-problem. These two sub-problems are solved in an iterative manner using the alternating optimization approach. We show that the proposed approach improves the service time of the network by 20% on average compared to the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Security risk analysis and quantification for automotive systems is a challenging task. This challenge is exacerbated when physical systems are integrated with computation and communication networks to form Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The complexity arises from the multitude of attack possibilities within the overall system. This work proposes an attack index based on redundancy in the system and the computational sequence of residual generators. This work considers a nonlinear dynamic model of an automotive system with a communication network. The approach involves using system dynamics to model attack vectors, which are based on the vulnerabilities in the system that are exploited through open network components (like On-Board-Diagnosis (OBD-II)), network segmentation (due to improper gateway implementation), and sensors that are susceptible to adversarial attacks. The redundant and non-redundant parts of the system are identified by considering the sensor configuration and unknown variables. Then, an attack index is derived by analyzing the placement of attack vectors in relation to the redundant and non-redundant parts, using the canonical decomposition of the structural model. The security implications of the residuals are determined by analyzing the computational sequence and the placement of the sensors. Thus, this work promotes the notion of security by design by proposing sensor placement strategies to enhance the overall security index. Finally, it is verified how the proposed attack index and its analysis could be used to enhance automotive security using Model-In-Loop (MIL) simulations.},

Based on a human-centered control approach, the proposed shared control design takes into account the driver&#39;s activity and availability, as well as the surrounding risk to dynamically adapt the driving assistance level via an adaptive cost function. To this end, we propose a method to characterize in real-time the driver&#39;s activity, which allows for an appropriate assistance level according to the driving conditions. Linear parameter-varying (LPV) control technique is leveraged to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed and the level of assistance. The uncertainties of the lateral tires forces are taken into account in the control design via a norm-bounded representation. Using Lyapunov stability theory, the control design conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved by semidefinite programming techniques. User-test experiments are performed with the SHERPA dynamic car simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed shared control method from both objective and subjective viewpoints.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles equipped with four independent in-wheel motors bestow salutary design flexibility and render the system over-actuated. The strategy percolated for torque allocation dictates the system&#39;s performance and marks its energy consumption. In this paper, two complete novel control architectures are developed and contrasted from the viewpoint of vehicle performance and energy consumption. A cascaded control strategy is employed by incorporating two distinct control levels. The high level is differentiated by a centralized approach based on the optimal $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ control in the framework of the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems, and a decentralized approach based on problem decoupling where a solution is proposed using the Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (STSM) control. Both approaches are supervised by a decision layer to promote the stability objective in critical driving situations. At the low level, stability control based on Direct Yaw Control (DYC) along with speed control are both achieved using an original torque allocation strategy. A comprehensive set of four multi-objective strategies has been devised, centered around a proposed torque allocation configuration. These strategies encompass dynamic online optimization, expertly solved using the highly efficient Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method, as well as a unique offline optimization based on a data-driven implemented algorithm. The proposed architectures are tested and validated in a joint simulation between Simulink/MatLab and SCANeR $^{\text{TM}}$ Studio vehicle dynamics simulator. The simulation findings demonstrate substantial improvements in stability, comfort, and energy efficiency at both the high and low levels of the autonomous in-wheel-driven electric vehicle.},

In particular, we consider that the RIS is close to the transmitter vehicle while the STAR-IOS is near the receiver vehicles. In addition, it is assumed that the STAR-IOS exploits the energy-splitting (ES) protocol for communication and the fading channels between the RIS and STAR-IOS follow composite Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ distribution. Under such assumptions, we first use the central limit theorem (CLT) to derive the PDF and the CDF of equivalent channels at receiver vehicles, and then, we derive the closed-form expression of outage probability (OP) under NOMA/OMA scenarios. Additionally, by exploiting Jensen&#39;s inequality, we propose an upper bound of the ergodic capacity (EC) and subsequently develop an analytical expression of the energy efficiency (EE) for both NOMA and OMA cases. Further, our analytical results, which are double-checked with the Monte-Carlo simulation, reveal that applying RIS/STAR-RIS in V2V communications significantly enhances the communication performance of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Besides, the results indicate that considering the NOMA scheme provides better performance in terms of the OP, EC, and EE as compared with the OMA case for the considered V2V communication system.},

Our work addresses the challenging problem of online speed planning along a predefined traverse path based on an interaction-aware prediction algorithm between autonomous and human-driven vehicles in unsignalized intersections. The algorithm is executed in three sequential steps at each instant: (i) An LSTM and a graph neural network (GNN) are trained to predict the sequence of vehicles crossing the collision point based on their interactions, acting as an expert driver. Our future behavior predictor achieved an accuracy of 90.5%, outperforming the alternative approach, which achieved 88%. (ii) Another GNN estimates the approximate time window required for the self-driving car to traverse the collision point safely, based on the sequence of passage obtained in the previous stage. (iii) The algorithm calculates an acceleration value that not only ensures crossing the collision point within the time window but also avoids dangerous situations in subsequent collision points. By considering both the immediate and subsequent collision points, the algorithm promotes a more comprehensive and cautious driving behavior in autonomous vehicles. We ran our algorithm on 250 real-world scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset, and the self-driving vehicle safely passed the intersection in all cases, even more cautiously than human-driven cars. We presented three case studies to illustrate the algorithm&#39;s effectiveness. The algorithm is executed every 100 ms, and the average computational time is 28 ms.},

Given that eliminating accidents is impossible, an achievable goal is to design AVs in a way so that they will not be blamed for any accident in which they are involved in. In this paper, we propose BlaFT Rules – or Bla me- F ree hybrid T raffic motion planning Rules . An AV following BlaFT Rules is designed to be cooperative with HVs as well as other AVs, and will not be blamed for accidents in a structured road environment. We provide proofs that no accident will happen if all AVs are using a BlaFT Rules conforming motion planner, and that an AV using BlaFT Rules will be blame-free even if it is involved in a collision in hybrid traffic. We implemented a motion planning algorithm that conforms to BlaFT Rules called BlaFT . We instantiated scores of BlaFT controlled AVs and HVs in an urban roadscape loop in the SUMO simulator and show that over time that as the percentage of BlaFT vehicles increases, the traffic becomes safer even with HVs involved. Adding BlaFT vehicles increases the efficiency of traffic as a whole by up to 34% over HVs alone.},

The odometry algorithm is under the realm of direct methods, and it exploits properties of the Fourier transform for decoupling the changes in orientation from the changes in translation. In the first step, the Radon transform along with phase-correlation, outlier removal, robust measure of central tendency, keyframe selection and graph optimization are used in order to achieve a robust method for estimating the change in orientation, next the translation is estimated with the support of phase-correlation. The algorithm&#39;s performance was evaluated with real world data.

As a widely used method for road scene understanding, occupancy grid mapping is leveraged to detect obstacles and predict drivable road areas. Because of its robustness under harsh conditions, low cost, and large perceptual range, radar sensor is becoming increasingly important to achieve various critical perception tasks. However, for radar-based occupancy grid mapping, current inverse sensor model (ISM) relies on detection data and is most hand-crafted. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven ISM that employs the range-Doppler matrix as the input. With a systematic evaluation and comparison of our model with classic, hand-crafted ISM and the data-driven, detection-based Occupancy Net using RADIal dataset, we find that data-driven models are far superior to their hand-crafted counterpart. Furthermore, although both data-driven models are on par within near range ( $&amp;lt;\! 50 \,\mathrm{m}$ ), our model outperforms Occupancy Net by a large margin in far range ( $ [50 \,\mathrm{m},100 \,\mathrm{m}]$ ). Specifically, our model has about a 0.3 and 0.4 improvement in distant range for the intersection over union (IoU) and $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ score, respectively. In addition, leveraging adjacent occupancy grid map prediction, we propose a radar-based occupancy flow to precisely distinguish moving objects.},

The proposed framework not only offers notable improvements in Lidar-based SLAM methodologies but also provides a solution to the significant cost associated with high-resolution Lidar sensors. Particularly, our method can be adopted by a number of vehicles coordinated with a server towards learning a regularizer - a neural network - for capturing the dependencies of the Lidar data. To tackle this adaptive federated optimization problem effectively, we initially propose a deep unrolling framework, converting our solution into a well-justified deep learning architecture. The learnable parameters of this architecture are directly derived from the solution of the proposed optimization problem, thus resulting in an explainable architecture. Further, we extend the capabilities of our deep unrolling technique by incorporating a federated learning strategy. Our federated deep unrolling model employs an innovative Adapt-then-Combine strategy, where each vehicle optimizes its model and, subsequently, their learnable regularizers are combined to formulate a robust global regularizer, equipped to handle diverse environmental conditions. Through extensive numerical evaluations on real-world Lidar based SLAM applications, our proposed model demonstrates superior performance along with a significant reduction in trainable parameters, with 99.75% fewer parameters compared to state of the art lidar super-resolution deep neural networks. Essentially, this study is the first initiative to combine deep unrolling with federated learning, showcasing an efficient, and data-secure approach to automotive Lidar super-resolution SLAM applications.},

  abstract     = {Reliable smart charging requires forecasting the charging behavior of EVs. Deep learning algorithms could present a solution. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) require a large number of samples for training. Although there are available datasets for EV charging, such data is not available for newly committed EVs with limited historical charging records. Therefore, forecasting the charging behavior of a new EV owner suffers from the cold-start forecast problem. This paper aims to forecast two essential parameters of charging events for new EVs: plug-out hour and required energy. To this end, a transfer learning-based framework is proposed to address the cold-start forecast. In the proposed framework, we freeze the middle layers of the pre-trained DNNs and make a shortcut between the output layer and input layer during the backpropagation. Moreover, this paper proposes to use a deep generative model, i.e., generative adversarial network (GAN), to improve the accuracy of forecasting. Plug-out hours of charging events are primarily forecasted by the proposed framework and then the plug-out hour is used as an auxiliary feature to forecast the required energy. Numerical results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework where forecasting results are improved by more than 31% for the plug-out hour and 34% for the required energy compared to alternative machine learning and deep learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The reduction of energy usage and the enhancement of comfort indices within electric vehicles stand as key areas of focus for modern research. Numerous approaches have been devised to address these concerns, yet each of these models exhibit certain constraints; some effectively reduce energy usage yet do so at the cost of comfort, whereas others succeed in elevating comfort at the price of increased energy consumption. Our research introduces a comprehensive model that leverages optimization, machine learning, data smoothing, and control protocols to defeat these challenges. The purpose of the proposed model is two folds: firstly, to reduce energy use, and secondly, to enhance the comfort of the user. Our proposed model comprises three main modules: the smoothing, the optimization, and control modules. In the smoothing module, the alpha-beta filter, the simplest and most effective filter, has been used to remove noise and smooth the data. The optimization module is segmented into two additional modules: the FA-GA module and the support vector machine module. The purpose of the support vector machine in the optimization module is to make the system fully automatic and dynamic by setting user parameters in the objective function of the FA-GA module. Within the control module, Mamdani fuzzy logic is employed to deliver the appropriate energy to the respective actuators.

  abstract     = {A practical and reliable online vehicle mass estimation scheme is crucial to effectively control an automated and intelligent vehicle. The Recursive Least Squares with Multiple Forgetting Factors (RLSMFF) algorithm has been shown to demonstrate great accuracy and computational efficiency in estimating vehicle mass. Nevertheless, our analysis on the convexity and convergence of the RLSMFF algorithm revealed significant inaccuracies at low sampling rates, as well as an estimation bias when the initial estimate is poor. Thus, the RLSMFF needs high-frequency data and an accurate initial estimate (both which could be challenging to obtain) to generate an accurate estimate. Additionally, the robustness of the RLSMFF algorithm to impulsive disturbances (such as braking, which is a common and inevitable driving maneuver) remains a challenge. To address the aforementioned issues, this article proposes a robust Recursive Least M-Squares with Multiple Forgetting Factors (RLM-SMFF) algorithm for reliable vehicle mass estimation in the presence of impulsive disturbance. In particular, a restructured longitudinal dynamics model and a bias reduction strategy are introduced to enhance the accuracy of the mass estimation even when the sampling rate is low. An M-estimator is incorporated to suppress the effects of the impulsive disturbance. The stability of our proposed algorithm is also verified mathematically. We evaluated our proposed algorithm using extensive simulations, which showed that our method demonstrates superior accuracy compared to existing mass estimation algorithms, at low computational demand.},

  abstract     = {The difficulty of calculating the speed of Four Wheel Drive (4WD) vehicles in off-road terrain is well known, especially at a low speed. This difficulty stems from the common occurrence of wheel slippage because all wheels are driven and the unpaved terrain interacts with the vehicle during driving. To address this issue, this article presents a robust vehicle speed estimation algorithm based on dual attention networks for 4WD off-road vehicles. The algorithm identifies important signals and time in order to capture the interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Instead of estimating vehicle speed directly, the algorithm estimates wheel slip ratios, which are then used to calculate the vehicle speed, providing interpretability and comprehension of how the vehicle speed is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-world driving data collected in various off-road terrains, such as sand, mud, and rock, and verified through comparative studies and real-time estimation. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is capable of estimating vehicle speed without the need for external sensors, reducing costs.},

By incorporating landing cone constraints, the safety of the quadrotor during landing is ensured. The LC method transforms the original nonconvex optimal control problem (OCP) into a convex optimization problem, enabling the efficient computation of a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) safe landing trajectory. The designed SCP algorithm utilizes the 3-DoF trajectory as an initial guess and iteratively solves convex subproblems to obtain a safe, agile, and accurate landing trajectory for the complete 6-DoF quadrotor dynamics. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging technology and a relatively affordable device, the 4D imaging radar has already been confirmed effective in performing 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, the sparsity and noisiness of 4D radar point clouds hinder further performance improvement, and in-depth studies about its fusion with other modalities are lacking. On the other hand, as a new image view transformation strategy, “sampling” has been applied in a few image-based detectors and shown to outperform the widely applied “depth-based splatting” proposed in Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS), even without image depth prediction. However, the potential of “sampling” is not fully unleashed. This article investigates the “sampling” view transformation strategy on the camera and 4D imaging radar fusion-based 3D object detection. In the proposed LiDAR Excluded Lean (LXL) model, predicted image depth distribution maps and radar 3D occupancy grids are generated from image perspective view (PV) features and radar bird&#39;s eye view (BEV) features, respectively. They are sent to the core of LXL, called “radar occupancy-assisted depth-based sampling”, to aid image view transformation. We demonstrated that more accurate view transformation can be performed by introducing image depths and radar information to enhance the “sampling” strategy. Experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods by a significant margin without bells and whistles. Ablation studies demonstrate that our method performs the best among different enhancement settings.},

  abstract     = {Current safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) studies are focused on perception limitations, decision uncertainties, and human-machine interaction, while it tends to overlook the impact of the control system on SOTIF. This letter seeks to address this gap by establishing a lifetime management framework for vehicle dynamics control (VDC) systems. At first, we provide an introduction to the fundamental composition and control architecture of a VDC system. Furthermore, we identify representative hazard scenarios, trigger conditions and performance deficiencies in VDC. Building upon data-driven fault-tolerant control theory, a comprehensive framework consisting of adaptive filter, iterative learning, fault diagnosis and identification, and fault-tolerant control modules is presented. The proposed framework is specifically designed to address trigger conditions such as driving environment variations, integration of multiple control systems, performance degradation due to components aging and maintenance. The framework features online driving state supervision, driving risk measurement, and intervention for mitigation of the SOTIF issues. As a summary of a part of Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL), the letter reports the development of an intelligent vehicle lifetime management framework with a strong focus on SOTIF issues.},

  abstract     = {This perspective paper delves into the concept of foundation intelligence that shapes the future of smart infrastructure services as the transportation sector transitions into the era of Transportation 5.0. First, the discussion focuses on a suite of emerging technologies essential for foundation intelligence. These technologies encompass digital twinning, parallel intelligence, large vision-language models, traffic simulation and transportation systems modeling, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, and decentralized/distributed systems. Next, the paper introduces the present landscape of Transportation 5.0 applications as illuminated by the foundational intelligence, and casts a vision towards the future including cooperative driving automation, smart intersection/infrastructure, parallel traffic management, virtual drivers, and mobility systems planning and operations, laying out prospects that are poised to redefine the mobility ecosystem. Last, through a comprehensive outlook, this paper aspires to offer a guiding framework for the intelligent evolution in data generation and model calibration, digital twinning and simulation, scenario development and experimentation, feedback loop for management and control, and continuous learning and adaptation, fostering safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in the future smart transportation infrastructure.},
