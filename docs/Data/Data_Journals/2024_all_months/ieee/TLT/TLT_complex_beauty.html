  abstract     = {There are many important and interesting academic competitions that attract an increasing number of students. However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students&#39; abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a Big Data platform is constructed to collect students&#39; various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student&#39;s utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of our proposed team building method not only has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT), the task of tracking the knowledge state of a student over time, has been assessed actively by artificial intelligence researchers. Recent reports have described that Deep-IRT, which combines item response theory (IRT) with a deep learning method, provides superior performance. It can express the abilities of each student and the difficulty of each item such as IRT. Nevertheless, its interpretability is inadequate compared to that of IRT because the ability parameter depends on each item. Deep-IRT implicitly assumes that items with the same skills are equivalent, which does not hold when item difficulties for the same skills differ greatly. For identical skills, items that are not equivalent hinder the interpretation of a student&#39;s ability estimate. To overcome those difficulties, this study proposes a novel Deep-IRT that models a student response to an item using two independent networks: 1) a student network and 2) an item network. The proposed Deep-IRT method learns student parameters and item parameters independently to avoid impairing the predictive accuracy. Moreover, we propose a novel hypernetwork architecture for the proposed Deep-IRT to balance both the current and the past data in the latent variable storing student&#39;s knowledge states. Results of experiments with six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy by about 2.0%, on average. In addition, experiments for the simulation dataset demonstrated that the proposed method provides a stronger correlation with true parameters than the earlier Deep-IRT method does at the $p&amp;lt; 0.5$ significance level.},

  abstract     = {Immersive technology has received extensive attention in both L1 and L2 writing education. Its unique capabilities to offer virtual experiences alongside real-world experiences can create authentic learning environments that support students&#39; experiential learning and enable the observation of events beyond the confines of traditional classrooms. However, there has been a lack of systematic analysis of recent publications in this area. To address this gap and improve the research and practice of writing education, a systematic review was conducted to examine the literature on immersive technology in writing education (ITWE). In this review, 37 articles (30 SSCI-indexed papers from the Web of Science database and seven additional articles from a meticulous forward–backward scan of the references of these studies) were analyzed. The analysis focused on theoretical foundations, participants, types of adopted immersive technology, methods, and research findings. Our review shows that although most studies revealed positive outcomes, a significant number lacked a solid theoretical foundation to interpret the findings in many ITWE studies. Moreover, there is a pressing need for further research on ITWE in middle schools, especially within the realm of English as a foreign language courses. In addition, the review identified some potential negative effects of ITWE, which were often attributed to poorly designed instructional activities. It was observed that conventional research methods like questionnaire surveys and interviews, were commonly used in ITWE. However, the potential benefits of emerging areas like learning analytics and AI in education (e.g., logged actions, facial emotion detection, electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis were rarely used. The article is concluded with the current research evidence on emerging directions and opportunities for future trends in empowering writing education with immersive technology.},

This set of learning materials mainly comprises digital notebook-like documents, which are stored, backed, and delivered from cloud services and eventually displayed in students&#39; web browsers. As we demonstrate in this article, the advent of cloud architectures and the COVID-19 pandemic (which forced worldwide long-term distant academic environments) fortuitously teamed up with this learning and methodological trend by easing its use and fostering its adoption. With more detail, we have quantitatively measured the impact that the COOLER paradigm has had on the teaching realm by analyzing five years of logged data gathered by its current major player in the ecosystem: MyBinder. Among other results, we show how this growth in the production and delivery of notebooks made an important leap during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave (July–September 2020). However, the general usage trend seems to have strongly decreased after the end of the most recent seventh wave (September 2022), coinciding with the official end of the global health crisis and all the lockdown episodes. From these examined data, we conclude that COOLER and recent massive online learning scenarios have been very intimately linked. This fact may represent a flaw in the adoption of these exciting and useful learning materials.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in using different technologies, such as educational robotics in classrooms. However, in many cases, teachers have neither the necessary background to efficiently use these kits nor the information about how students are using robotics in classroom. To support teachers, learning environments with robotics tools should monitor the students&#39; interaction data while they are interacting with the different resources provided. With the analysis of this data, teachers can obtain valuable information about students&#39; learning progress. In previous work, we presented integrated didactic educational environment (IDEE), an integrated learning environment that uses robotics to support physics laboratories in secondary education. Students&#39; interactions with IDEE are stored and analyzed using the additive factor model to show the teachers the most significant skills in the learning process and those students who have difficulties with these skills. Now, our goal is to enhance the information given to the teachers to allow them to focus on the specific needs of each student on every different skill involved in the activities and not only the significant skills. To this end, we use a conjunctive knowledge tracing model based on a hidden Markov model. In this article: first, we describe how the CKT model has been adapted to the pedagogical model of IDEE, second, we show that this model can identify the skills that each student masters, and thus, support teachers in identifying learning criticalities in students.},

In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students&#39; academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.},

This study investigates the feasibility of deploying this agent in an educational setting to support the learning of OOP. This study first examines the low-speed inference problem of the deep learning model. A fast inference algorithm is proposed for the model, which achieves a speedup of eighty times. This study further explores integrating a human–machine collaborative learning process with the deep learning agent. Students were surveyed about their perceptions of the agent in supporting learning. Student responses are interpreted within the learning partnerships model (LPM) framework to show how the agent&#39;s technical automation and autonomy features support student-agent learning partnerships.

  abstract     = {Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in digital learning systems, as they allow for automating the assessment process. However, owing to the increased digital literacy of students and the advent of social media platforms, MCQ tests are widely shared online, and teachers are continuously challenged to create new questions, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. A particularly sensitive aspect of MCQ creation is to devise relevant distractors, i.e., wrong answers that are not easily identifiable as being wrong. This article studies how a large existing set of manually created answers and distractors for questions over a variety of domains, subjects, and languages can be leveraged to help teachers in creating new MCQs, by the smart reuse of existing distractors. We built several data-driven models based on context-aware question and distractor representations and compared them with static feature-based models. The proposed models are evaluated with automated metrics and in a realistic user test with teachers. Both automatic and human evaluations indicate that context-aware models consistently outperform a static feature-based approach. For our best-performing context-aware model, on average, three distractors out of the ten shown to teachers were rated as high-quality distractors. We create a performance benchmark, and make it public, to enable comparison between different approaches and to introduce a more standardized evaluation of the task. The benchmark contains a test of 298 educational questions covering multiple subjects and languages and a 77k multilingual pool of distractor vocabulary for future research.},

  abstract     = {High-quality programming projects for education are critically required in teaching. However, it is hard to develop those projects efficiently and artificially constrained by the lecturers&#39; experience and background. The recent popularity of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great number of applications in the field of education, but concerns persist that the output might be unreliable when dealing with intricate requirements. In this study, we design a customized role-based agent (CRBA), which can be configured for different roles specializing in specific areas of expertise, making the LLM yield content of higher specialization. An iterative architecture of multi-CRBAs is proposed to generate multistep projects, where CRBAs automatically criticize and optimize the LLM&#39;s intermediate outputs to enhance quality. We propose ten evaluation metrics across three aspects to assess project quality through expert grading. Further, we conduct an A/B test among 60 undergraduate students in a programming course and collect their feedback through a questionnaire. According to the students&#39; rating results, the LLM-generated projects have comparable performance to man-made ones in terms of project description, learning step setting, assistance to students, and overall project quality.

  abstract     = {In recent years, lifelong learning has gained prominence, necessitating a continuous commitment from learners to enhance their skills and knowledge. During the lifelong learning process, it is essential to precisely assess the cognitive states of lifelong learners, as this will provide a learning report and further support subsequent learning activities. In the literature, researchers have proposed various cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) to estimate the cognitive states based on learners&#39; responses. However, learners&#39; responses are noisy for different reasons, including guessing, slipping, accidentally clicking, and network issues. Rashly fitting the CDMs with noisy responses would yield imprecise cognitive state estimation. To tackle this problem, we first unify all types of noise underlying learners&#39; responses. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based cognitive diagnosis framework ( DiffCog ) to extend existing CDMs and enhance their effectiveness and robustness. DiffCog does so by addressing the following two technical challenges in denoising: 1) the hard-to-track problem and high computational cost in discrete and sparse responses and 2) the unknown extent of noise underlying responses. Specifically, DiffCog tackles these technical challenges by: 1) introducing responses encoders to project responses to continuous cognitive states for case of adding easy-to-track noise and reducing computation cost and 2) incorporating a time extractor and a denoise module to trace the noisy cognitive states back to the noise-free ones in a personalized way. We conduct extensive and sufficient experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed DiffCog not only elevates the performance ceiling of existing CDMs but also enhances their robustness to noise.},

  abstract     = {The automatic generation of reading comprehension questions, referred to as question generation (QG), is attracting attention in the field of education. To achieve efficient educational applications of QG methods, it is desirable to generate questions with difficulty levels that are appropriate for each learner&#39;s reading ability. Therefore, in recent years, several difficulty-controllable QG methods have been proposed. However, conventional methods generate only questions and cannot produce question–answer pairs. Furthermore, such methods ignore the relationship between question difficulty and learner ability, making it challenging to ascertain the appropriate difficulty levels for each learner. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a method for generating question–answer pairs based on difficulty, defined using a statistical model known as item response theory. The proposed difficulty-controllable generation is achieved by extending two pretrained transformer models: bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and text-to-text transfer transformer. In addition, because learners&#39; abilities are generally not knowable in advance, we propose an adaptive QG framework that efficiently estimates the learners&#39; abilities while generating and presenting questions with difficulty levels suitable for their abilities. Through experiments involving real data, we confirmed that the proposed method can generate question–answer pairs with difficulty levels that align with the learners&#39; abilities while efficiently estimating their abilities.},

Yet, little is known about how learners respond to such reformulations. Here, we employed a three-stage writing task (composing-comparison-rewriting) to investigate how learners notice, integrate, and perceive ChatGPT&#39;s reformulations as feedback in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom context. We collected learners’ written notes made during the comparison of their original texts and the reformulations, categorizing them based on the language-related type of noticing (vocabulary, discourse, and form) and quality of noticing (depth of processing: low, intermediate, and high). We also analyzed the instances of reformulations integrated into learners’ rewriting and their answers to a questionnaire. The results showed that: 1) the reformulations directed learners’ attention to the gaps in their original writing, especially in word choice, and prompted them to integrate ChatGPT-generated changes in their rewriting; 2) the number of instances integrated into the rewriting was directly related to the quantity, type, and quality of noticing in the comparison stage; and 3) learners generally appreciated the pedagogical value of ChatGPT in EFL writing, particularly during the revision stage, although they believe occasionally ChatGPT might misinterpret their intentions. The study suggests that ChatGPT&#39;s reformulations should be complemented with peer and teacher feedback to create a comprehensive and personalized learning environment.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) is essential in intelligent tutoring systems for tracking learners&#39; knowledge states and predicting their future performance. Numerous prevailing KT methods prioritize modeling learners&#39; behavioral patterns in acquiring knowledge and the relationship among interactions. However, due to the sparsity problem, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively uncovering latent contextual features embedded within the learning sequences. This limitation may impose certain constraints on the predictive performance. In light of this concern, this article focuses on extracting latent features from learning sequences to enhance the assessment of knowledge states. Consequently, we design optimized pretraining mechanisms and introduce an enhanced deep KT method, optimized pretraining deep KT (OPKT). In the pretraining phase, the self-supervised learning approach is effectively employed to train comprehensive contextual encodings of the learning sequences. During fine-tuning, the contextual encodings are transferred to the downstream KT model, which then generates the knowledge states and makes predictions. Through our experiments, the superiority of our method over six existing KT models on five publicly available datasets is demonstrated. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the rationality and effectiveness of every component of the OPKT architecture.},

Therefore, the development of an ethically founded privacy literacy, defined as the formation of a personal value system, constitutes a central developmental task. The Privat-o-Mat supports this CAYA age group to reflect on their behavior when facing privacy risks on the Internet. Based on the principles of human-centered design and ethics by design, it confronts users with 15 everyday scenarios to identify their personal type of data protection. We conducted an empirical evaluation of the Privat-o-Mat consisting of a survey followed by a qualitative content analysis according to P. Mayring and found that this learning technology enabled a sample of three different groups of students from the German state of Baden-Württemberg to reflect on their own attitudes toward privacy on the Internet. This effect was especially strong among respondents who considered their previous level of reflection on privacy to be low.

It helps students improve their understanding of reading materials, metacognitively monitor their comprehension, and self-correct comprehension gaps. Internet technologies have been used to facilitate SQG process through intensive peer support. However, the availability, level of task commitment, and capabilities of student peers have emerged as significant concerns, particularly in light of the global pandemic and the subsequent postpandemic era. Thus, this article presents a student–artificial intelligence (AI) cocreation tool called CoAsker for supporting question generation. Following recent human-computer interaction (HCI) research in human-AI collaborative writing, CoAsker first allows students to provide question clues and answers and then uses a state-of-the-art pretrained language model, T5-PEGASUS, to generate questions. Finally, the student can use this AI question directly or perform reflection by comparing his or her questions with the AI question. An empirical study was conducted to examine the quality of AI questions and the effect of this tool on student engagement and reading comprehension. The results of the study show that students using this tool (treatment) were more engaged in generating low-level cognitive questions and performed better in acquiring knowledge than those using a traditional online question generation tool (control). These results indicate that student-AI question cocreation is beneficial to SQG training and educational assessment for reading comprehension, such as repeated practices.},

The weighted loss function in the first stage ensures low prediction error by weighing loss associated with the minority class label (in our case the at-risk label). The short-term gated LSTM in the second stage, on the other hand, models short-term variations in academic performance to suppress any residual false alarms. Experiment results using three datasets obtained from over 20 000 students across 17 undergraduate courses show that the proposed model achieves a 28.8% improvement in F1 score compared to the LSTM model for at-risk detection.

Despite the large variety of dashboards, the students’ centric perspective and the ability to adapt the dashboard to their personal needs is not a common practice.

However, current personalized recommendation techniques struggle with the precise extraction of complex mathematical semantics, hindering accurate perception of learners&#39; cognitive states and relevance of recommendations. This article proposes a framework for extracting complex mathematical semantics and providing personalized exercise recommendations. We design a tree-based position encoding method to enhance the accuracy of positional representation for mathematical expressions in the pretrained model, aiming to improve the performance of downstream tasks. We propose an automatic method for extracting knowledge attributes based on expert annotations, enabling interpretable cognitive diagnosis. Furthermore, we employ sequential pattern mining to discover the knowledge usage patterns in exercises, generate learning paths using a multilayer knowledge graph, and leverage cognitive diagnostic results to enhance the relevance of recommendations. Experimental results show a 2.0% improvement in mathematical symbol embedding on mathematical formula retrieval tasks and knowledge attribute extraction accuracy ranging from 66.5% to 81.7%. Learners&#39; posttest scores significantly improve during group testing with good consistency between online cognitive diagnosis and self-diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Cooking is a multitasking and rule-based task that can benefit from augmented reality (AR). This article introduces sAR Kitchen , an AR-based cooking assistant designed to incorporate spatial AR (sAR) into culinary training. We investigated the effects of instructions provided through our proposed sAR system compared to a monitor display featuring video tutorials in a task involving making playdough, which serves as a representation of a cooking task. We assessed perceived workload, usability, and performance measures (including task completion time, product quality, and cooking station messiness) through a user study involving 22 participants. We conducted a statistical comparison between the two methods to explore significant differences. In addition, we analyzed open-ended questions to provide further insights based on the participants&#39; statements. The results indicated that sAR significantly reduced the perceived workload and improved the system&#39;s usability. Furthermore, the AR instructions for training proved to be as effective as conventional methods of instruction while also addressing some of the limitations associated with standard displays and enhancing the overall user experience. This study has the potential to pave the way for more efficient learning and training methods by incorporating sAR.},

In this article, we developed a multilayer structured virtual reality (VR) system to provide students with training in automotive engine (Buick Verano) assembly and disassembly. The VR training system is designed to have several major features, including replaceable engine parts and reusable tools, friendly user interfaces and guidance, and bottom-up designed multilayer architecture, which can be extended to various engine models. The VR system is evaluated with controlled experiments of two groups of students. The results demonstrate that our VR training system provides remarkable usability in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, our VR system has been demonstrated and employed in the courses of Chinese colleges to train students in automotive engine assembly and disassembly.

The traditional manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive, resulting in decreased insights and pedagogical impact. To address the problems, researchers use natural language processing techniques that apply the fields of machine learning, statistics and artificial intelligence to the feedback datasets for various purposes. These purposes include predicting sentiment, opinion research, insights into students&#39; views of the course, and so on. The aim of this study is to identify themes and categories in academic research reports that use natural language processing for student feedback. Previous review studies have focused exclusively on sentiment analysis and specific techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning. Our study put forward a comprehensive synthesis of various aspects, from the data to the methods used, to the data translation and labeling efforts, and to the categorization of prediction/analysis targets in the literature. The synthesis includes two tables that allow the reader to compare the studies themselves and present the identified themes and categorizations in one figure and text. The methods, tools and data of 28 peer-reviewed papers are synthesized in 20 categories under six themes: aim and categorization, methods and models, and tools and data (size and context, language, and labeling).

  abstract     = {Educational virtual environments (EVEs) can enable effective learning experiences on various devices, including smartphones, using nonimmersive virtual reality (VR). To this purpose, researchers and educators should identify the most appropriate pedagogical techniques, not restarting from scratch but exploring which traditional e-learning and VR techniques can be effectively combined or adapted to EVEs. In this direction, this article explores if test questions, a typical e-learning technique, can be effectively employed in an EVE through a careful well-blended design. We also consider the active performance of procedures, a typical VR technique, to evaluate if test questions can be synergic with it or if they can instead break presence and be detrimental to learning. The between-subject study we describe involved 120 participants in four conditions: with/without test questions and active/passive procedure performance. The EVE was run on a smartphone, using nonimmersive VR, and taught hand hygiene procedures for infectious disease prevention. Results showed that introducing test questions did not break presence but surprisingly increased it, especially when combined with active procedure performance. Participants’ self-efficacy increased after using the EVE regardless of condition, and the different conditions did not significantly change engagement. Moreover, participants who had answered test questions in the EVE showed a reduction in the number of omitted steps in an assessment of learning transfer. Finally, test questions increased participants’ satisfaction. Overall, these greater-than-expected benefits support the adoption of the proposed test question design in EVEs based on nonimmersive VR.},

Due to its human-like cognitive abilities, the AGI system has great potential to help instructors provide detailed, comprehensive, and individualized feedback to students throughout the educational process. ChatGPT, as a preliminary version of the AGI system, has the potential to improve programming education. In programming, students often have difficulties in writing codes and debugging errors, whereas ChatGPT can provide intelligent feedback to support students’ programming learning process. This research implemented intelligent feedback generated by ChatGPT to facilitate collaborative programming among student groups and further compared the effects of ChatGPT with instructors’ manual feedback on programming. This research employed a variety of learning analytics methods to analyze students’ computer programming performances, cognitive and regulation discourses, and programming behaviors. Results indicated that no substantial differences were identified in students’ programming knowledge acquisition and group-level programming product quality when both instructor manual feedback and ChatGPT intelligent feedback were provided. ChatGPT intelligent feedback facilitated students’ regulation-oriented collaborative programming, while instructor manual feedback facilitated cognition-oriented collaborative discussions during programming. Compared to the instructor manual feedback, ChatGPT intelligent feedback was perceived by students as having more obvious strengths as well as weaknesses. Drawing from the results, this research offered pedagogical and analytical insights to enhance the integration of ChatGPT into programming education at the higher education context. This research also provided a new perspective on facilitating collaborative learning experiences among students, instructors, and the AGI system.},

In addition, semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 students from Experimental Group A to gather qualitative data on their perceptions of AGI-assisted PBL.

While AR offers potential in aviation weather education and instructors desire to use it in the classroom, they face challenges due to limited digital proficiency and complexity of authoring tools. Many existing AR authoring tools prioritize technical aspects over user experience. To address these challenges, a no-programming-required AR authoring tool was developed based on instructor-informed requirements, such as incorporating features of flight waypoints and weather phenomena. A total of 41 participants tested the tool by crafting three AR learning modules. After using the tool, there was a significant increase in participants’ confidence in AR content creation (+30%), AR authoring process (+51%), and interactive AR development (+50%). In addition, there was a significant decrease in their concerns about technical complexity (–19%), mental effort (–30%), and time consumption (–30%). Participants rated the incorporated functions highly preferable and indicated the tool has high usability. Participants completed the most challenging task quickly and with a low cognitive load. The findings demonstrate the tool&#39;s effectiveness in enabling participants to competently and efficiently author AR content, reducing technical concerns. Such tools can facilitate the integration of AR technology into the classroom, offering students improved access to interactive 3-D visualizations of dynamic subjects, such as aviation weather, which require students to mentally visualize weather conditions and understand their manifestations.},

This article presents such a model and corresponding interaction designs for the coaches and learners (respectively, a monitor-and-control dashboard and mobile app with supportive communications trough a virtual agent), all deployed and tested in a system for child diabetes self-management training. We developed a domain-independent upper ontology to structure learning goals and related concepts (such as achievements and tasks) and a domain ontology that specifies the knowledge base (for, in our case, diabetes self-management training). With this approach, we relate knowledge elements (e.g., skill) to educational tasks and to learners&#39; knowledge development (e.g., achievements). The ontology was implemented in a multimodal tutoring system consisting of mobile educative games, a health diary, an embodied conversational agent (ECA), and a web application for authoring and monitoring. We show that our model provides a coherent and concise foundation for: 1) the formalization of learning in the diabetes self-management domain, but also for other domains such as mathematics; 2) personal goal setting and thereby personalization of the educational process including ECA&#39;s guidance; and 3) creating awareness of progress on the personal educational path. We found that a motivational tutoring system requires a rich set of learning activities and accompanying materials of which a subset is offered to the learner based on personal relevance. The implemented model proved to accommodate the personal agent-guided learning paths of children with diabetes, under different treatments from hospitals in Italy and the Netherlands.},

Therefore, a high “return on investment” is expected regarding their potential to improve teaching and learning. Whereas many studies have been conducted to assess the impact of educational escape rooms on learning, results have been so far inconclusive. Several studies have reported positive learning gains, whereas others have not demonstrated such learning gains. To provide a synthesis of the existing empirical body of knowledge, we performed a meta-analysis by pooling the effect sizes across 33 published studies (5322 observations). Our results suggest that educational escape rooms are highly effective learning activities (Cohen&#39;s d = 1.4). The impact on learning was consistent across diverse fields and educational levels, regardless of team size and technology involved. Yet, educational escape rooms conducted remotely yielded smaller learning gains than those conducted face-to-face. Studies comparing educational escape rooms to other educational activities —while scarce— did not suggest a significant superiority of these activities to traditional learning activities, e.g., lectures.},

Through this pilot study, we validated whether task difficulty can predict cognitive load as measured by TEPRs corrected for the light reflex and if these TEPRs correlate with cognitive load self-ratings and performance. A total number of 14 students in health sciences performed observation tasks in two conditions: difficult versus easy tasks while watching a VR scenario in home health care. Then, a cognitive load self-rating ensued. We used a VR system with a built-in eye tracker and a photosensor installed to assess pupil diameter and light intensity during the scenario. Employing a method from the human–computer interaction field, we determined TEPRs by modeling the pupil light reflexes using a baseline. As predicted, the difficult task caused significantly larger TEPRs than the easy task. Only in the difficult task condition did TEPRs positively correlate with the performance measure. These results suggest that TEPRs are valid measures of cognitive load in VR training when corrected for the light reflex. It opens up possibilities of using real-time cognitive load for assessment and instructional design for VR training. Future studies should test our findings with a larger sample size, in various domains, involving complex VR functions such as haptic interaction.},

  abstract     = {Personalized exercise recommendation is a challenging task in the field of artificial intelligence in education due to several problems. First, the mainstream approaches focus more on the exercises that students have not mastered, while overlooking their long-term needs during the learning process. Second, it is difficult to capture students&#39; knowledge states caused by sparse interactions with exercises. Moreover, most recommendation methods are dedicated to the performance of the recommendation w.r.t. accuracy, disregarding the students&#39; learning ability. We introduce a new framework called contrastive personalized exercise recommendation with reinforcement learning (RCL4ER) to tackle these issues. Our framework augments the standard recommendation model with an output layer of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The reinforcement allows the supervised layer to focus on specific rewards, acting as a regularizer. The self-supervised layer provides a powerful signal for parameter updating. Three data augmentation methods are used to provide additional data, which are leveraged to conduct contrastive learning and incorporated into reinforcement learning as supplementary information. In addition, we adopt a trained deep knowledge tracing model to capture the changes in students&#39; knowledge states, so as to establish a dynamic reward mechanism. Experiments of our framework based on four recommendation backbones on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RCL4ER, which successfully promotes students&#39; capacity and improves the recommendation performance.},

  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) can have a positive impact on students&#39; motivation and cognitive performance in varied age levels and different contexts. However, its use is still far from widespread in education. One of the reasons mentioned in the literature is the lack of AR authoring tools that consider the educational perspective, which means they do not usually take pedagogic aspects into account. This work investigates what characteristics are important for AR authoring in education in the form of design principles. We aimed to identify how teachers would like to create AR experiences based on their pedagogic needs through design-based research (DBR) with the participation of an interdisciplinary team to investigate and propose design principles for AR educational authoring. We followed the four steps of DBR in two cycles. We worked with multiple teachers, mostly English teachers, to understand their educational needs when authoring AR experiences. Based on that, we defined and prototyped an application focused on language learning for children and teenagers, which we evaluated in two test rounds. As a result, we proposed 11 design principles divided into three aspects: infrastructure, AR, and pedagogy. These principles were evaluated positively by teachers. To help us understand the options currently available for teachers, we analyzed the existing AR authoring tools that do not require programming to see if they meet the proposed design principles. Most of them lack important features for teachers, specifically pedagogical ones. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the context and application of those principles.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are a kind of widely adopted approaches in learning assessment. Recently, the automatic generation of MCQs has become a popular research area. In this task, distractor ranking (DR) is one of the most meaningful and challenging subtasks, where the DR models learn to select high-quality distractors from numerous candidates. Currently, some DR methods adopt a two-stage ranking strategy, which brings about a complex process and error propagation. Others directly use the single-encoder-based model to improve the overall performance, which, however, suffers from low efficiency. To tackle these problems, we propose a retrieval distractor ranking (ReDR) task to meet the requirements for practical distractor retrieval scenarios, in which the models should achieve relatively high performance within an acceptable time. In this research, we develop an end-to-end way based on the dual-encoder framework to solve the ReDR task. Besides, we propose multiple kinds of relevance scores, including context–context, context–distractor, and distractor–distractor, which have been employed in two strategies: 1) multisource soft labeling, which assigns each candidate an appropriate soft label from multiple kinds of relevance scores to better simulate the sample distribution of the ReDR task and 2) multisource hard negative sampling, which selects the hard negative samples according to multiple kinds of relevance scores and further distinguishes the difference between them and the positive samples. The extensive experiments on two well-known MCQ benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Visual feedback can enhance motor learning in golf; however, so far, this has mostly been time-delayed. Using extended reality (XR), learners can receive visual feedback in real time without relying on an external perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel XR-based method of real-time feedback for golf putt training. Thirty-two subjects were divided between an XR group and a technique instruction (TI) training group, completing three weeks of training each, and a no-training control group. XR training included a virtual club projected into the real training environment via HoloLens 2. Real-time information was provided on the precalculated targeted club alignment and velocity. The TI method included written technical instructions already used in golf putt training. Before and after the training, all subjects performed a pre-, post-, and retention test, and two transfer tests with shorter (2 m) and longer (4 m) putting distances than during training (3 m). Results showed a significant increase in the number of hits and a significant decrease in the radial error after training in all groups. The number of hits remained the same during the retention test and at shorter putting distance, but decreased at longer distance. The radial error decreased even more during the retention test and revealed no difference between putting distances. Our study shows that the acquisition of golf putting skills can be enhanced not only through proven TI training, but also by incorporating visual real-time feedback via XR. Future studies could examine the extent to which the effects of this method exceed those of TI training over a longer period when learners can familiarize themselves with it more.},

Despite this growing trend, previous research has largely overlooked the influence of prompt engineering on students&#39; use of ChatGPT and effective strategies for improving the quality of information retrieval in learning settings. To address this research gap, this study examines the information quality obtained from ChatGPT in a flipped classroom by evaluating its effectiveness in task completion among 26 novice undergraduates from the same major and cohort. The experimental results provide evidence that proficient mastery of prompt engineering improves the quality of information obtained by students using ChatGPT.

  abstract     = {Fostering productive engagement within teams has been found to improve student learning outcomes. Consequently, characterizing productive and unproductive time during teamwork sessions is a critical preliminary step to increase engagement in teamwork meetings. However, research from the cognitive sciences has mainly focused on characterizing levels of productive engagement. Thus, the theoretical contribution of this study focuses on characterizing active and passive forms of engagement, as well as negative and positive forms of engagement. In tandem, researchers have used computer-based methods to supplement quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate teamwork engagement. Yet, these studies have been limited to information extracted primarily from one data stream. For instance, text data from discussion forums or video data from recordings. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based automatic system that detects productive and unproductive engagement during live teamwork sessions. The technical contribution of this study focuses on the use of three data streams from an interactive session: audio, video, and text. We automatically analyze them and determine each team&#39;s level of engagement, such as productive engagement, unproductive engagement, disengagement, and idle. The AI-based system was validated based on hand-coded data. We used the system to characterize productive and unproductive engagement patterns in teams using deep learning methods. Results showed that there were $&amp;gt;$ 91% prediction accuracy and $&amp;lt; $ 7% mismatches between predictions for the three engagement detectors. Moreover, Pearson&#39;s $r$ values between the predictions of the three detectors were $&amp;gt;$ 0.844. On a scale of $-$ 1 (unproductive engagement) to 1 (productive engagement), the scores for all teams were 0.94 $\pm$ 0.04, suggesting high productive engagement. In addition, teams tended to mostly be in productive engagement before transitioning to disengagement ( $&amp;gt;$ 90.34% of the time) and to idle ( $&amp;gt;$ 93.69% of the time). Before transitioning to productive engagement, we noticed almost equal fractions of teams being in idle and disengagement modes. These results show that the system effectively detects engagement and can be a viable tool for characterizing productive and unproductive engagement patterns in teamwork sessions.},

This activity may challenge designers, learning designers, and researchers since they must base their choice on personal aspects that require a deep understanding. Therefore, this article aims to assist game designers, learning designers, and researchers in selecting user classification strategies to customize and personalize game-based and gamified learning environments. By conducting systematic literature mapping, we consolidate the most common strategies and explore their applications in games and gamification. Our analysis, based on 25 publications, reveals that we can classify the strategies according to user interaction, user personality, learning style, and motivation for learning. Strategies based on user interactions emerge as the most popular, while questionnaires and log data systems are commonly used instruments for identifying user profiles.

  abstract     = {Recently, using videos as a learning resource has received a lot of attention and turned widely exploited as an effective learning tool. With the rapid spread of instructional videos, the number of these tools in all disciplines is becoming very high. It is fractious for learners to find video courses adapted to their needs. Recommender system is an important tool; it can help learners for better navigation and better guidance to access and reach information and interesting videos content and restrict the number of choices provided. This article presents results of a systematic literature review on video-based learning recommender systems. This systematic literature review included the papers indexed in five scientific digital libraries and published between 2009 and 2023. Our review focuses on examining both the technical and pedagogical aspects of video-based learning recommender systems. In terms of technical aspects, we analyze the most commonly used recommendation approaches in video-based learning, as well as additional methods and techniques employed to enhance the effectiveness of video-based learning recommendations. We also explore the variables and data sources that have been investigated in the process of recommending videos for learning purposes, along with the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these systems. Regarding the pedagogical aspects, we investigate the learning environments where these systems have been implemented, the subjects and educational programs that hold primary importance in video-based learning recommendations, and the overall learning process.},

  abstract     = {Graded reading is one of the important ways of English learning. How to automatically judge and grade the difficulty of the English reading corpus is of great significance for precision teaching and personalized learning. However, the current rule-based readability assessment methods have some limitations, such as low efficiency and poor accuracy. In particular, these traditional methods usually lack semantics, which is crucial for students to understand the reading material. Meanwhile, they are difficult to be mapped to the difficulty level, which is not conducive to flexible application in actual personalized teaching. In this study, a method for grading the difficulty of the English reading corpus is proposed. This approach makes use of a pretrained language model and feature fusion embedding to make the most of multifeature data when training. First, based on linguists&#39; evaluations of the variables influencing the difficulty of English reading corpus, three primary statistical features—sentence length, word length, and the number of prepositions—are taken into consideration. Then, the semantic features and part-of-speech features of the text are learned by a pretrained language model and long short-term memory, respectively, to capture polysemy features and fine-grained semantic representations that are difficult to represent with traditional models. Finally, multifeature embedding extractions are fused to grade the difficulty of the English reading corpus. Extensive experimental comparisons on a self-built dataset and two datasets that are freely accessible with various models indicate that our method outperforms the others in the task of grading the difficulty of English reading corpora.},

  abstract     = {As one of the fundamental tasks in the online learning platform, interactive course recommendation (ICR) aims to maximize the long-term learning efficiency of each student, through actively exploring and exploiting the student&#39;s feedbacks, and accordingly conducting personalized course recommendation. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has witnessed great application in ICR, which can gradually learn student&#39;s dynamic preference through multiple-round interactions, and meanwhile optimize the long-term benefit of students. However, when modeling the student&#39;s hidden and unknown interest, so-called latent interest, the existing DRL-based recommendation schemes did not fully characterize and utilize the relationships among courses and other associated objects, such as teachers of courses and courses’ concepts, which may hamper the system&#39;s learning of student&#39;s latent interest and lead to suboptimal recommendation. To address the above-mentioned issue, this article proposes a novel DRL-based personalized ICR scheme enhanced with the heterogeneous graph, HGCR, which smoothly combines the graph neural network with advanced deep Q-learning neural network. Specifically, this article&#39;s contributions are threefold. First, the heterogeneous graph is explicitly built to characterize the relationships among courses, concepts, and teachers. Second, the course representation is formulated through graph attention network. Then, a student&#39;s latent interest is characterized with her/his interactive courses, which is then fed into the double dueling deep Q-network for ICR. Finally, thorough experiments on two real educational datasets demonstrate the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art DRL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The metaverse is a network of interoperable and persistent 3-D virtual worlds where users can coexist and interact through mechanisms, such as gamification, nonfungible tokens, and cryptocurrencies. Although the metaverse is a theoretical construct today, many collaborative virtual reality (CVR) applications have emerged as potential components of the metaverse. The demand for distance learning in higher education grew rapidly with COVID-19, but it has many challenges such as low motivation, low interest, and lack of suitable environment. We investigated the suitability of CVR applications for higher education by analyzing 9 existing CVR applications and then conducting a mixed-method user study on the Spatial CVR application with 41 university students (24 females, 17 males, mean age: 23.5). The results revealed 14 challenges, 13 affordances, and 20 ideas for using CVR in higher education. Moreover, lack of instructions, cybersickness, discomfort, limited embodiment, and limited sensory stimulation were among the identified issues that may inhibit the sense of presence in Spatial. Based on the findings, we proposed 13 guidelines to facilitate providing CVR learning in higher education and concluded that CVR has some use cases in higher education to complement conventional methods. These results can be useful for researchers, developers, and educators who seek to be at the forefront of adopting CVR as a part of the metaverse to come.},

For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students&#39; grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much.

The degree of model generalizability across courses may depend on aspects, such as the similarity of the course setup, course material, the student cohort, or the teacher. Which of these contextual factors affect generalizability and to what extent is yet unclear. The current study explicitly compares model generalizability within course versus within cohort of predictive models. This study considered 66 behavioral indicators, which are commonly used in the literature. Indicators regarding frequency and duration of online study time, accessing study material, time management, assignments and quizzes, and weekly measures, were extracted from the university&#39;s learning management system. Numerical and binary predictive models were generated via recursive feature selection. Model generalizability was evaluated in terms of both model stability and model performance. The results showed that model stability was better for numerical models generalized within course compared to models generalized within cohort or across course and across cohort. Nevertheless, model stability was low for the binary models and only moderate for numerical models under all the conditions. Concerning model performance, the increase in estimation error after model generalizability depends on the initial model performance for models generalized within course and within cohort. Contrary to previous research, with respect to performance, we found no difference between model generalizability within cohort and within course. We suspect that performance reduction after any form of model generalizability depends on initial performance.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a controlled case study focused on implementing and using generative artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), in physiotherapy education to assist instructors with formulating effective technology-mediated feedback for students. It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants&#39; usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy.

In this study, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of the hide-and-seek virtual reality system (HSVRS) in improving gaze fixation abilities in children with ASD. Our hypothesis is that engaging in a hide-and-seek game within a virtual environment, particularly with a customized avatar resembling a familiar figure, would significantly enhance gaze fixation skills compared to traditional interventions without supplementary virtual reality (VR) intervention. In total, 36 children with ASD were involved in this pilot study in three groups: the avatar customized group, the avatar uncustomized group, and the control group. The control group only received human intervention, while the avatar group received additional VR-assisted interventions. The effect of HSVRS was measured by a six-point Likert subjective questionnaire and demonstrated significant improvements in gaze fixation abilities in the VR-assisted intervention groups compared to the control group ( $P$ = 0.006, 0.001). Moreover, the avatar customized group, which interacted with a familiar-looking avatar, obtained noticeable increments in gaze fixation metrics ( $P$ = 0.036, 0.005, 0.001). Experimental results show the effectiveness of utilizing VR technology to complement regular interventions in terms of improving gaze fixation abilities for young children with ASD.},

However, the availability of quantitative models for personalized playback speed control considering the learner&#39;s personal traits is still an open question. The work aims to develop a model to control the personalized playback speed of audio information for beginners and experienced learners for intelligent tutoring systems. Analysis of the data from the experimental study using traditional machine learning methods did not allow us to classify the preferred playback rate with accuracy higher than 60%. Therefore, we developed the three-level hierarchical logistic model that predicts the preferred playback speed of audio material on the scale from “very low speed” to “high speed” for beginners and experienced learners with 80% accuracy. The model uses a combination of cognitive and psychomotor traits of individual learners and aims to maximize audio listening convenience and satisfaction. We explained the influence of the learners&#39; selected personal traits on the preferred speed of audio playback. We calculated the convenience of listening to the audio materials without and with the model. By using the model, the convenience of listening to audio materials increased by an average of 13% at a low speech speed and 37% at a high speech speed. The model extends the control theory of multimedia information in e-learning systems by describing the influence of selected psychophysiological traits of learners on the preferred playback speed of audio materials.},

Although this technique can be described straightforwardly, fully comprehending it might be challenging. It is typically taught in the classroom using the 2-D formats, such as paper or a blackboard. We propose using immersive environments for incrementing the understanding of ray tracing. We focus on improving the knowledge of the technique in experienced users, particularly Master of Computer Science students minoring in a computer-graphics-related area. We argue that exploring the ray tracing process in an immersive visualization environment can further improve the understanding of ray tracing acquired using conventional means. With that objective, this study starts by presenting RayTracerVR , a virtual reality prototype tool for learning the mechanisms of ray tracing. This tool can be used to visually explore and interact with the different aspects of the technique. It allows users to observe the progression of the rays throughout the sequential stages of the ray tracing process and analyze its corresponding computer pseudocode. The study includes user evaluation where RayTracerVR is employed to assess improvements in ray tracing understanding. The prototype&#39;s usability is also assessed.

As part of the research, the application was evaluated by 75 participants, which included students, parents, and educators, ensuring that the views of the main stakeholders in the educational process are considered. Before the intervention, an online questionnaire was completed by the participants, who then watched a video about the function of the application and/or used the actual application. After the intervention, the participants completed an online questionnaire with similar questions. The results indicate that the use of student action recognition systems is feasible in online courses and accepted by teachers, students, and parents. Based on the results, most participants believe that the proposed application can contribute to the enhancement of the efficiency of distance education with regard to the student active participation, concentration level, learning results, teacher–student interaction, students&#39; interest, and students&#39; evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Understanding student cognitive states is essential for assessing human learning. The deep neural networks (DNN)-inspired cognitive state prediction method improved prediction performance significantly; however, the lack of explainability with DNNs and the unitary scoring approach fail to reveal the factors influencing human learning. Identifying and understanding these factors remain a challenge. Thus, this article proposes the temporal fuzzy cognitive map (tFCM) model, which combines the prediction power of DNNs with the interpretability of fuzzy cognitive maps. In the proposed tFCM model, cognitive states are modeled as fuzzy, multidimensional, and interrelated vectors, which are input to a long short-term memory network for prediction. This integration allows the proposed model to combine the exceptional ability of DNNs to uncover latent factors with the distinct benefits of fuzzy cognitive maps&#39; ability to reveal potential correlations. A comparative experiment was designed and conducted on a large-scale dataset to assess the predictive performance and interpretability of the proposed tFCM model. The results demonstrate tFCM&#39;s superior performance and interpretability compared to existing models. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a multidimensional quantitative model to represent cognitive states and an interpretable model architecture for state prediction.},

  abstract     = {Automating the classification of instructional strategies from a large-scale online tutorial dialogue corpus is indispensable to the design of dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems. Despite many existing studies employing supervised machine learning (ML) models to automate the classification process, they concluded that building a well-performed ML model is nontrivial since the sample size is commonly limited for model training. Based on this fact, we posited that the model performance can be further optimized by the design of input features and the selection of informative instances for model training. By reviewing the existing dialogue-related research, we found that contextual information (i.e., the content of preceding utterances) was a potential feature in many text classification tasks but underexplored in the classification of an instructional strategy. In addition, training a well-performed ML model (e.g., deep neural network) to recognize instructional strategies usually requires a large amount of manually annotated data, which are labor intensive. To alleviate the demand of manual annotation, researchers proposed the use of statistical active learning methods to select informative instances, but this method was rarely used for recognizing the instructional strategy in online tutoring dialogue. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the improvement of automating the classification of dialogue acts—a popular approach to the detection of instructional strategies—from two perspectives. First, we explored whether and to what extent the incorporation of contextual information can boost a model&#39;s prediction performance. Then, we investigated the extent to which the recent active learning methods can alleviate the labor-intensive issues in training the ML model for recognizing the instructional strategies. Our study showed that: 1) the ML models trained on the features that included the contextual information achieved better performance than that of the models excluding it; 2) the effectiveness of the contextual information decayed after the ML model achieved an optimal performance; and 3) compared with the random baseline, active learning methods can select informative samples from the training dataset to train ML models, which can alleviate the labor-intensive issues.},

  abstract     = {As an excellent means of improving students&#39; effective learning, knowledge tracking can assess the level of knowledge mastery and discover latent learning patterns based on students&#39; historical learning evaluation of related questions. The advantage of knowledge tracking is that it can better organize and adjust students&#39; learning plans, provide personalized guidance, and thus, achieve the purpose of artificial intelligence-assisted education. However, existing methods, for instance, convolutional knowledge tracing, lacking consideration of graph structure and multivariate time-series prediction, result in poor prediction accuracy. Inspired by recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we present a novel multivariate graph knowledge tracking (MVGKT) framework to address these limitations. Specifically, a multivariate time-series knowledge tracking system based on spatio-temporal GNN is designed to model student learning trajectories in different spatial and temporal dimensions and capture both temporal dependencies and interstudent correlations. MVGKT incorporates a gate recurrent unit attentive mechanism and graph Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, and graph convolution network to increase the predictive accuracy of the student performances. In addition, we design a question difficulty extraction system to obtain information on the difficulty of the questions, and thus, enhance the data features. Numerous experiments on the ASSISTments dataset have demonstrated that MVGKT is superior to existing knowledge-tracking methods on four metrics and has shown that our approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of student performance.},

We present a nuanced comparative evaluation of the RF and FTT models, highlighting their predictive accuracy and interpretative capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in managing student attrition, with FTT models outperforming RF models in terms of predictive accuracy and achieving a sensitivity rate of 81%. Significantly, the inclusion of historical academic data enhances the models&#39; ability to identify students at increased risk of dropping out. Furthermore, we apply advanced explanatory techniques, such as shapley additive explanations, to investigate the discriminative power of these models across different student profiles. This provides valuable insights into the key variables influencing dropout risk, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the issue.

The integration of haptic feedback in this context makes it possible to make virtual objects tangible, increasing immersion and ultimately learning success. The application presented, SkillsLab+, uses augmented reality and haptic feedback via a data glove to provide a digitized version of the analog SkillsLab medical training programme. SkillsLab+ was evaluated using standardized questionnaires (Igroup Presence Questionnaire, presence, and haptic questionnaires). In order to determine the learning outcomes of the students, an AB test was carried out comparing the final grades. At the same time, a subjective questionnaire was used to assess whether students felt better prepared for the exam. In this context, this article aims to evaluate the learning success and compare the results with the previous proof of concept study of 2022. The results of the comparison show an improvement in the responses to the SkillsLab+ questionnaire in 2023. The result of the examination also improved compared to the group without AR experience. This shows the improvement in application and learning with the help of augmented reality and haptic feedback. They were more confident, had better results, and felt better prepared for the exams.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies over traditional statistical methods for predicting student performance in e-learning contexts. Notably, many researchers have adopted AI techniques without conducting a comprehensive investigation into the most appropriate and accurate approach to employ. Additionally, determining the optimal input parameters for each AI technique remains a pertinent question in this domain. This study employs machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict student grades within a programming tutoring system. The experiment involved university students whose interaction data with the e-learning system were analyzed and used for predictions. By identifying the structural relationships between the properties of the input data, this research aims to determine the most efficient AI method for accurately predicting student performance in e-learning systems. The structure of the input data in these systems is described by variables related to individual student activities, so correlations between variables were a natural starting point for further theoretical considerations. In this manner, by applying a filtering technique based on the minimum redundancy–maximum relevance (mrMR) criterion, it was shown that correlations among predictors and between predictors and the target variable play a significant role in defining the appropriate model for predicting student grades. The results showed that ANN (the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm with Bayesian regularization) outperformed ML methods, achieving the highest prediction accuracy. The results obtained from this study can be of great importance for learning technologies engineering and AI in general.},

At the course level, teachers recommend learning paths (RLPs) for students to guarantee the achievement of their learning outcomes. In terms of performance, these kinds of approaches are deemed more effective than others based uniquely on performing a collection of independent activities. However, there is neither systematic means to validate if following the learning path (LP) is effective, nor to assess whether and to what extent students adhere to these recommendations. This article introduces a novel technique for modeling recommended LPs, including not only an evaluation of path utility, but also a quantitative measure of student adherence thereto using process mining, and more precisely, log skeletons. Following an event abstraction process regarding real student-recorded activity, a scoping process is employed to retain the trajectories that adhere to the prescribed LP. The method based on process mining is translated into practice by considering an online university mathematics course. Results confirm the applicability of the method and, in this case, reveal that adhering to the suggested path correlates positively with final grades. Few students strictly follow the prescribed LP, although the vast majority support it.

  abstract     = {This article presents a general-purpose method for detecting cheating in online courses, which combines anomaly detection and supervised machine learning. Using features that are rooted in psychometrics and learning analytics literature, and capture anomalies in learner behavior and response patterns, we demonstrate that a classifier that is trained on labeled data of users who performed a certain type of cheating (copying using multiple accounts) can detect users who performed a different type of cheating (unauthorized collaboration), as well as to detect cheaters in different contexts—future runs of the same course and another course that is on a different subject matter. This exploits the fact that we have dedicated algorithms for detecting these two methods of cheating, which enable us to compute ground truth labels on real student interaction data and, then, use these labeled data to validate the proposed general-purpose algorithm. The empirical setting is based on five runs of two MITx massive open online courses in physics and biology from 2014 to 2016. The main contribution of this article is twofold: first is proposing, for the first time, a general method for detecting cheating in online courses; and second is providing a validation that is based on real cheating data, as opposed to previous research on cheating detection, that with the absence of ground truth, relied on either simulations or indirect measures.},

  abstract     = {The use of robots in education has the potential to engage students in learning activities and aims to form lasting relationships with them. To encourage sustainable, long-term human–robot interactions, a promising approach is to cultivate a pet-like, interdependent relationship. However, the potential of such relationships in education remains unclear, and the limited availability of robots in classrooms necessitates flexible and scalable designs. To address these challenges, this study leverages digital twin technology to facilitate ubiquitous engagement with pet robots, thereby prolonging interdependent relationships through a SeamlessPet robot learning approach. Here, students engaged with both virtual and physical pet robots, enabling realistic and continuous interactions akin to communicating directly with a physical robot. This integration ensured consistent availability and authentic interactions, enhancing educational outcomes demonstrated in situational presentations. An experiment with 70 university students in a Japanese Hospitality Management Program in Taiwan demonstrated that this approach resulted in better learning achievements and fostered a positive learning experience. The pet-like features embedded within the digital twin robots played a vital role in fostering prolonged learning participation, empowering students to take ownership of their learning, stay motivated, and feel supported at any time and from anywhere in the learning process. Educators and curriculum developers are encouraged to consider this approach, particularly in courses with a final project presentation that uses a robot to demonstrate study results.},

  abstract     = {Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner&#39;s foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.},

For this purpose, we conducted a manual content analysis by classifying paragraphs of literature review sections into their corresponding categories that are based on Kwan&#39;s model, which is a labeling scheme for structuring literature reviews. We then asked ChatGPT to perform the same categorization and compared both outcomes. Numerical results do not imply a satisfactory performance of ChatGPT; therefore, writers cannot fully depend on it to edit their literature reviews. However, the AI chatbot displays an understanding of the given prompt and is able to respond beyond the classification task by giving supportive and useful explanations for the users. Such findings can be especially helpful for beginners who usually struggle to write comprehensive literature review sections since they highlight how users can benefit from this AI chatbot to revise their drafts at the level of content and organization.

In spite of the growing effort to expand social media literacy among youngsters, social media interventions still rely on conventional methods that tend to prioritize cognitive skills while overlooking important socio-emotional competencies. To bridge this gap and offer innovative solutions to social media education, this article presents the narrative scripts (NS) approach implemented in a learning technology environment that integrates pedagogical strategies of authentic learning, narratives, and scripted collaborative learning within a simulated educational social media platform. A longitudinal study with 370 high school students in urban schools in Barcelona (Spain) was designed to assess NS in an intervention to foster the development of social media self-protection skills. The findings demonstrated that NS supported the development of social media self-protection skills, while the students expressed positive perceptions of their overall learning experience. The intervention notably enhanced the socio-emotional competencies of responsible decision-making, self-awareness, and social awareness. This research makes a valuable contribution to the design and development of technology aimed at facilitating authentic learning experiences for social media education, with a specific focus on interventions targeting socio-emotional competencies.},

  abstract     = {The amount of news on the web often confuses the ideas of the reader, who struggles to disentangle information that is sometimes contradictory and difficult to decipher. In the face of such an articulated scenario, the role played by schools is absolutely central: the development of critical thinking in young people (and by extension in their families) is a necessary condition for facing the complexity of the reality with the right awareness and control. Providing young people with a thorough understanding of the fake news spreading phenomenon is a first step in combating it. To this end, in this article, we propose a serious game whose objective is to let young people experience the typical interaction scenario when faced to a feed of real and fake news in social media. Our proposal focuses on educational workshops, carried out in secondary schools and dedicated to the correct use of information on the web, with particular attention to logical fallacies and cognitive bias mechanisms that lead to the formulation of erroneous reasoning or prevent a comparison from progressing logically. Thanks to an intuitive interface that helps the teacher supervise the whole game session, the students are invited to assess the truthfulness of a small set of news at different levels and to share them with their friends. At the end of the game session, the teacher is provided with an interactive detailed report of the activities that enables the analysis of all participants&#39; actions and behavior. The teacher can use such a report to conduct a classroom lecture in a more engaging and interactive way, by stimulating discussions among the students and raising their curiosity on the subject. Our educational platform has been tested accurately in a broad experimental study involving 217 middle school students. The results show the suitability of the platform in providing a valuable educational tool for supporting educational activities on fake news analysis.},

  abstract     = {In children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), assessing attention is crucial to understanding their behavioral and cognitive functioning. Attention difficulties are a common challenge for children with autism, significantly impacting their learning and social interactions. Traditional assessment methods often require skilled professionals to provide personalized interventions, which can be time consuming. In addition, existing approaches based on video and eye-tracking data have limitations in providing accurate educational interventions. This article proposes a noninvasive and objective method to assess and quantify attention levels in children with autism by utilizing head poses and gaze parameters. The proposed approach combines a deep learning model for extracting head pose parameters, algorithms to extract gaze parameters, machine learning models for the attention assessment task, and an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks for attention quantification. We conducted experiments involving 39 children (19 with ASD and 20 neurotypical children) by assigning various attention tasks and capturing their video and eye patterns using a webcam and an eye tracker. Results are analyzed for participant and task differences, which demonstrate that the proposed approach is successful in measuring a child&#39;s attention control and inattention. Ultimately, the developed attention assessment method using head poses and gaze parameters opens the door to developing real-time attention recognition systems that can enhance learning and provide targeted interventions.},

However, the behaviors that elementary school students frequently exhibit during online learning particularly when they are in a low attention state have rarely been investigated. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to continuously track changes in the learner&#39;s attention state during online learning. A new EEG index reflecting elementary students’ attention level was developed using an EEG dataset acquired from 34th graders during a computerized d2 test of attention. Characteristic behaviors of 24 elementary students in a low attention state were then identified from the webcam videos showing their upper bodies captured during 40-min online lectures, with the proposed EEG index being used as a reference to determine their attention level at the time. Various characteristic behaviors were identified regarding the participant&#39;s mouth, head, arms, and torso. For example, opening the mouth or leaning back was observed more frequently in a low-attention state than in a high-attention state. It is expected that the characteristic behaviors reflecting a learner&#39;s low attention state would be utilized as a useful reference in developing more interactive and effective online education systems.},

Six classes of 152 8th graders were randomly assigned to unlimited gaming and scaffolding group, limited scaffolding group, and limited gaming group. Students&#39; learning outcomes in physics are optimized when they have unlimited access to GBL&#39;s gaming and scaffolding. All three groups perceived similar levels of engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. According to regression, time spent mastering the scaffolds on their first attempt is the most determinant predictor of physics concept learning and engagement, whereas winning the games for the first-time predicts mental model construction, engrossment, and total immersion the most. This study sheds light on future GBL studies that closely tying scaffolds and games challenges could motivate and facilitate students to master scaffolds and win games on their first attempts, resulting in better physics learning performance and more game immersion.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing aesthetic perception plays a crucial role in deepening our understanding of student creativity, emotional expression, and the pursuit of lifelong learning within art education. This task encompasses the evaluation and analysis of students&#39; sensitivity, preference, and capacity to perceive and appreciate beauty across different sensory domains. Currently, this assessment frequently relies on subjective evaluations of student artworks. There are two limitations: 1) the diagnosis is possibly limited by instructors&#39; bias and 2) the heavy workload of instructors for conducting comprehensive assessments. These limitations motivate us to ask: Can we automatically and objectively conduct aesthetic perception diagnosis? To this end, we propose an innovative deep hybrid framework, AestheNet, to automatically evaluate aesthetic perception by analyzing numerous collected student paintings. More especially, we first utilize convolutional neural networks to extract the significant features from the student artworks. Then, we employ the transformer model to capture the intricate relationships among multiple aesthetic perception dimensions for objective diagnosis. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the framework by creating a new dataset consisting of 2153 paintings drawn by 675 students. These paintings are annotated by human experts from 77 dimensions based on domain expertise. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of AestheNet in aesthetic perception diagnosis. AestheNet is dedicated to overcoming the subjectivity inherent in traditional assessment methods, providing a new, quantifiable, and standardized way to evaluate aesthetic perception. This research not only opens up new perspectives in understanding students&#39; aesthetic development during the art education process but also explores the innovation of using artificial intelligence technologies in the assessment of art education.},

  abstract     = {Manually scoring and revising student essays has long been a time-consuming task for educators. With the rise of natural language processing techniques, automated essay scoring (AES) and automated essay revising (AER) have emerged to alleviate this burden. However, current AES and AER models require large amounts of training data and lack generalizability, which makes them hard to implement in daily teaching activities. Moreover, online sites offering AES and AER services charge high fees and have security issues uploading student content. In light of these challenges and recognizing the advancements in large language models (LLMs), we aim to fill these research gaps by analyzing the performance of open-source LLMs when accomplishing AES and AER tasks. Using a human-scored essay dataset ( n = 600) collected in an online assessment, we implemented zero-shot, few-shot, and p-tuning AES methods based on the LLMs and conducted a human–machine consistency check. We conducted a similarity test and a score difference test for the results of AER with LLMs support. The human–machine consistency check result shows that the performance of open-source LLMs with a 10 B parameter size in the AES task is close to that of some deep-learning baseline models, and it can be improved by integrating the comment with the score into the shot or training continuous prompts. The similarity test and score difference test results show that open-source LLMs can effectively accomplish the AER task, improving the quality of the essays while ensuring that the revision results are similar to the original essays. This study reveals a practical path to cost-effectively, time-efficiently, and content-safely assisting teachers with student essay scoring and revising using open-source LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Data collection is crucial in securing evidence to support students’ arguments during scientific inquiries. However, due to the high costs associated with equipping schools with various measurement devices, students are limited in the scope of their scientific inquiry. Arduino can be proposed as a solution to the lack of measurement devices in schools. With Arduino, students can create various measurement devices by connecting different sensors, customize these devices to suit their inquiries, and implement remote sensing using the Internet of Things. However, even when promising new technology serves as a beneficial tool for teaching and learning, its successful integration into the educational system can be challenging if teachers struggle to use it. Technical issues often discourage teachers from incorporating potentially valuable technologies into their classrooms. This article examined the adoption of Arduino in three different cases involving teachers from various educational institutions: a gifted education center, an autonomous club activity in a middle school, and a local community center. We identified four major difficulties: 1) selection of appropriate technologies; 2) credibility issues with information from the Internet; 3) technical complexity due to the intervention of multiple variables; and 4) compliance issues with related acts and regulations. We described each of the technical challenges that teachers faced, in detail, and how they dealt with them. Finally, we discussed suggestions for reducing the barriers to Arduino use for teachers and proposed areas for further research.},

The digital enhancements introduced in a virtual environment contribute to our increased expectations of novel learning experiences. However, despite its promising outcomes, there appears to be limited adoption of the edu-metaverse for practical learning at this time. We believe this can be attributed to the fact that there is a lack of investigation into learners&#39; behavior given a social learning environment. This lack of investigation is critical, as without behavioral insight, it hinders the development of education material and the direction of an edu-metaverse. Upon completing our work with the pilot user studies, we provide the following insights: 1) compared to Zoom, a typical video conferencing and remote collaboration platform, learners in the edu-metaverse demonstrate heightened involvement in learning activities, particularly when drawing mind mapping aided by the embedded knowledge graph, and this copresence significantly boosts learner engagement and collaborative contribution to the learning tasks; and 2) the interaction and learning activity design within the edu-metaverse, especially concerning the use of MM.},

  abstract     = {Reading comprehension is a widely adopted method for learning English, involving reading articles and answering related questions. However, the reading comprehension training typically focuses on the skill level required for a standardized learning stage, without considering the impact of individual differences in linguistic competence. This article presents a personalized support system for reading comprehension, named chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT)-based personalized reading comprehension support (ChatPRCS), based on the zone of proximal development (ZPD) theory. It leverages the advanced capabilities of large language models, exemplified by ChatGPT. ChatPRCS employs methods, including skill prediction, question generation and automatic evaluation, to enhance reading comprehension instruction. First, a ZPD-based algorithm is developed to predict students&#39; reading comprehension skills. This algorithm analyzes historical data to generate questions with appropriate difficulty. Second, a series of ChatGPT prompt patterns is proposed to address two key aspects of reading comprehension objectives: question generation, and automated evaluation. These patterns further improve the quality of generated questions. Finally, by integrating personalized skill prediction and reading comprehension prompt patterns, ChatPRCS is validated through a series of experiments. Empirical results demonstrate that it provides learners with high-quality reading comprehension questions that are broadly aligned with expert-crafted questions at a statistical level. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of the system on learning achievement, learning motivation, and cognitive load, providing further evidence of its effectiveness in instructing English reading comprehension.},

  abstract     = {Automatic program repair (APR) tools are valuable for students to assist them with debugging tasks since program repair captures the code modification to make a buggy program pass the given test-suite. However, the process of manually generating catalogs of code modifications is intricate and time-consuming. This article proposes contextual error model repair (CEMR), an automated program repair tool for introductory programming assignments. CEMR is designed to learn program code modifications from incorrect–correct code pairs automatically. Then, it utilizes these code modifications along with CodeBERT, a generative AI, to repair students&#39; new incorrect programs in the same programming assignment. CEMR builds on the observation that code edits performed by students in pairs of incorrect–correct code can be used as input–output examples for learning code modifications. The key idea of CEMR is to leverage the wisdom of the crowd : it uses the existing code modifications of incorrect–correct student code pairs to repair the new incorrect student attempts. We chose three of the most related APR tools, Refazer, Refactory, and AlphaRepair, as the baselines to compare against CEMR. The experimental results demonstrate that, on public and real classroom datasets, CEMR achieves higher repair rates than the baselines. Through further analysis, CEMR has demonstrated promising effectiveness in addressing semantical and logical errors while its performance in fixing syntactical errors is limited. In terms of time for repairing buggy programs, CEMR costs approximately half as much as AlphaRepair requires. We opine that CEMR not only be seen as a program repair method that achieves good results with incorrect–correct code pairs but also be further utilized to generate hints to better assist students in learning programming.},

  abstract     = {The rationality and the effectiveness of classroom teaching behavior directly influence the quality of classroom instruction. Analyzing teaching behavior intelligently can provide robust data support for teacher development and teaching supervision. By observing verbal and nonverbal behaviors of teachers in the classroom, valuable data on teacher–student interaction, classroom atmosphere, and teacher–student rapport can be obtained. However, traditional approaches of teaching behavior analysis primarily focus on student groups in the classroom, neglecting intelligent analysis and intervention of teacher behavior. Moreover, these traditional methods often rely on manual annotation and decision making, which are time consuming and labor intensive, and cannot efficiently facilitate analysis. To address these limitations, this article proposes an innovative automated multimode teaching behavior analysis framework, known as AMTBA. First, a model for segmenting classroom events is introduced, which separates teacher behavior sequences logically. Next, this article utilizes deep learning strategies with optimal performance to conduct multimode analysis and identification of split classroom events, enabling the fine-grained measurement of teacher&#39;s behavior in terms of verbal interaction, emotion, gaze, and position. Overall, we establish a uniform description framework. The AMTBA framework is utilized to analyze eight classrooms, and the obtained teacher behavior data are used to analyze differences. The empirical results reveal the differences of teacher behavior in different types of teachers, different teaching modes, and different classes. These findings provide an efficient solution for large-scale and multidisciplinary educational analysis and demonstrate the practical value of AMTBA in educational analytics.},

  abstract     = {While ongoing efforts have continuously emphasized the integration of ChatGPT with science teaching and learning, there are limited empirical studies exploring its actual utility in the classroom. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the lesson plans developed by 29 pre-service elementary teachers and assessing how they integrated ChatGPT into science learning activities. We first examined how ChatGPT was integrated with the subject domains, teaching methods/strategies, and then evaluated the lesson plans using a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK)-based rubric. We further examined pre-service teachers&#39; perceptions and concerns about integrating ChatGPT into science learning. Results show a diverse number of ChatGPT applications in different science domains—e.g., Biology (9/29), Chemistry (7/29), and Earth Science (7/29). A total of 14 types of teaching methods/strategies were identified in the lesson plans. On average, the pre-service teachers&#39; lesson plans scored high on the modified TPACK-based rubric (M = 3.29; SD = 0.91; on a 1–4 scale), indicating a reasonable envisage of integrating ChatGPT into science learning, particularly in “instructional strategies and ChatGPT” (M = 3.48; SD = 0.99). However, they scored relatively lower on exploiting ChatGPT&#39;s functions toward its full potential (M = 3.00; SD = 0.93), compared to other aspects. We also identified several inappropriate use cases of ChatGPT in lesson planning (e.g., as a source of hallucinated Internet material and technically unsupported visual guidance). Pre-service teachers anticipated ChatGPT to afford high-quality questioning, self-directed learning, individualized learning support, and formative assessment. Meanwhile, they also expressed concerns about its accuracy and the risks that students may be overly dependent on ChatGPT. They further suggested solutions to systemizing classroom dynamics between teachers and students. The study underscores the need for more research on the roles of generative AI in actual classroom settings and provides insights for future AI-integrated science learning.},

Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant&#39;s practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material&#39;s applicability to real-world scenarios.},

In order to address this issue, we developed a formal, as well as an informal assessment of students’ internal visualization skills in the context of engineering instruction. To validate the assessments, we used data triangulation methods. We drew on data from two separate studies conducted in a small-scale lab experiment and in a larger-scale classroom context. Our studies demonstrate that an intelligent tutoring system with interactive visual representations can serve as an informal assessment of students’ internal visualization skills, predicting their performance on a formal assessment of these skills. Our study enriches methodological and theoretical underpinnings in educational research and practices in multiple ways: it contributes to research methodologies by illustrating how multimodal triangulation can be used for test development, theories of learning by offering pathways to assessing internal visualization skills that are not directly observable, and instructional practices in STEM education by enabling instructors to determine when and where they should provide additional scaffoldings.},

Dashboards with the students’ data allow the teacher to know, topic by topic, what is clear and what is not and thus how to organize the synchronous sessions. The tool was evaluated in a real-life setting, involving 63 graduate students in a course on Plasma Physics. The students filled in a System Usability Scale questionnaire and some questions regarding the perceived usefulness of the tool; the teacher&#39;s opinion was gathered via a semistructured interview.

  abstract     = {Emotion detection through sensors is intrusive and expensive, making it impractical for many educational settings. As an alternative, sensor-free affect detection, which relies solely on interaction log data for machine learning models, has been explored. However, sensor-free emotion detectors have not significantly improved performance when trained solely on students&#39; interactions with their environment. In this study, we aimed to improve the performance of these models by incorporating students&#39; personalities as additional information during model development. Personality is known to influence emotions, and the duration of negative emotions may depend on students&#39; personalities. Therefore, we hypothesized that including personality data, based on the big five theory, in training machine learning models for sensor-free detection would enhance their performance. We collected data and videos from students using a step-based math intelligent tutoring system and used human coders to annotate emotions as target labels for our dataset. To test our hypothesis, we compared the performance of affect detectors trained with personality data to those trained solely on interaction data (baseline model) to detect confusion, engagement, frustration, and boredom. We found that incorporating personality data provided only a modest improvement in engagement detection. Our detector detected student engagement with a Cohen&#39;s Kappa of 0.633 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 compared to Kappa = 0.630 and AUC = 0.846 for the same detector without personality data. Despite studies indicating that personality affects learning, this modest improvement leads us to conclude that adding personality information to sensor-free affect detectors is not cost-justifiable.},

  abstract     = {Throughout a programming course, students develop various source code tasks. Using these tasks to track students&#39; progress can provide clues to the strengths and weaknesses found in each learning topic. This practice allows the teacher to intervene in learning in the first few weeks of class and maximize student gains. However, the biggest challenge is to overcome the amount of work required of the teacher in the manual analysis of all tasks. In this context, our main research objective is to automatically group students with similar programming skills based on the analysis of their submitted source codes. Our research is applied and uses an experimental procedure. First, we prepared the database, with more than 700 real-world source code tasks written in C language, and distributed it in five different learning topics. Afterward, we define a set of features to be extracted from each learning topic. We defined and extracted 23 features from the source code for five learning topics. Then, we preprocess our database and extract the proposed features. Finally, we grouped the students. After performing the grouping, we obtained four groups of students, which were analyzed using a cluster midpoint calculation. Our results support the monitoring of students throughout the term, offering the teacher the freedom to create new exercises and waiving the obligation of any specific programming environment. We believe that these results can support the teacher in pedagogical decisions closer to the needs of each group of students.},

  abstract     = {Teacher dashboards provide insights on students&#39; progress through visualizations and scores derived from data generated during teaching and learning activities (e.g., response times and task correctness) to improve teaching. Despite the potential usefulness of enhancing teacher dashboards, and the respective teaching practices, with rich information regarding students&#39; cognitive and affective states (e.g., cognitive load), few studies on teacher dashboards have considered such information. In this study, we drew on contemporary developments of multimodal (MM) learning analytics and designed an MM teacher dashboard with a notification system. The proposed system: 1) receives data from various sensors; 2) computes relevant cognitive and affective measurements; 3) visualizes the resulting measurements in a clean customizable interface; and 4) notifies instructors during moments of interest, so they may determine an appropriate method to support struggling students. To evaluate our MM teacher dashboard, we first collected multimodal data (MMD), performance data, and video recordings of students&#39; interactions during an in situ study where 26 students engaged with a motion-based learning task. Then, we used our MM teacher dashboard to present the collected MMD and video recordings to 20 experienced teachers and educational researchers and collected qualitative data regarding respondents&#39; insights on the advantages and challenges of visualizing students&#39; MMD. Results showed that teachers found an MM teacher dashboard enhanced with a notification system, useful to complement their pedagogical practices. We offer empirically founded guidelines for design and integration of an MM teacher dashboard with notification systems, aimed to enhance teachers&#39; understanding of students&#39; learning states (e.g., real-time awareness of students&#39; stress).},

With the current COVID-19 outbreak, the majority of educational institutes are conducting online examinations to assess their students, where there would always be a chance that the students go for malpractice. It is difficult to set a question paper for any technical course with great novelty. Under these circumstances, safeguarding academic integrity has become a challenge for HEIs. This study is aimed at improving the quality of questions for online exams to increase the accountability of HEIs by proper evaluation of their students. A detailed procedure with suggestions for setting the questions for technical courses, in the format of assertion and reason, matching, multiple select types, etc., has been discussed with adequate examples. It deals with a strategy for ensuring that all the students are held to the standards that are reflected in their grades. The proposed evaluation method has been implemented on a test batch and presented the results along with a comparison with that of traditional question papers. It is witnessed that there is a simultaneous enhancement of students’ learning as an additional benefit of implementing the proposed learning-oriented assessment method.},

This may be because of the unique challenges that recommender systems face when used by a young and diverse population. However, recommender systems for K12 education could provide many benefits for students and teachers, such as the simplification of personalized learning. Some of the issues with K12 educational recommender systems may be solved by the use of deep learning and implicit feedback. As such, we investigated the use of deep recommendation algorithms and implicit feedback for K12 educational recommender systems. To do this, we compared metrics for highly cited traditional and deep recommendation algorithms trained on explicit and implicit data. We found that recommendation algorithms using deep learning as a group do not differ in performance compared to traditional recommendation algorithms. We also found that the use of implicit feedback led to higher performance than using explicit feedback. The best performing algorithm used both deep learning and implicit feedback. We conclude that deep learning can be a benefit for K12 recommender systems, particularly when the ordered sequence of items is carefully accounted for. We also conclude that researchers and developers must carefully consider which feedback contributes the most information for learning.},

  abstract     = {Virtual environments open up far-reaching possibilities with respect to knowledge impartation. Nevertheless, they have the potential to negatively influence learning behavior. As a possible positive determinant, especially in the digital context, the moment “game” can be listed. Accordingly, previous studies prove an overall positive influence of serious games on learning success and motivation. However, the current state of research only allows for careful and few conclusions in terms of a nuanced differentiation of this influence. Thus, this study differentiates on a deeper level with regard to different parameters of learning success and motivation. The aim of the study is to quantify and evaluate a possible influence of the factor “game” with regard to these parameters. Two versions of the modular software environment Arctic Economy , a game and a nongame version, served as the basis for evaluation. Both versions were compared in a field experiment, with randomized group formation ( N = 97) and repeated measures. The data analysis showed the game group having a tendency to demonstrate better learning performance. In the differentiated analysis, a significant effect can be proven: subjects in the game group were able to remember facts more easily than subjects in the nongame group (group difference retention rate $\overline{x}=$ 17%). In addition, participants showed an average of 46% higher motivation and were significantly more capable of linking the application&#39;s content with reality. The identified “game effect” can therefore be classified as highly significant in the context of this study.},

In this survey, we will conduct a thorough investigation of these progressions. First, we present three types of fundamental KT models with distinct technical routes. Subsequently, we review extensive variants of the fundamental KT models that consider more stringent learning assumptions. Moreover, the development of KT cannot be separated from its applications, so we present typical KT applications in various scenarios. To facilitate the work of researchers and practitioners in this field, we have developed two open-source algorithm libraries: EduData that enables the downloading and preprocessing of KT-related datasets, and EduKTM that provides an extensible and unified implementation of existing mainstream KT models. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research in this rapidly growing field. We hope that the current survey will assist both researchers and practitioners in fostering the development of KT, thereby benefiting a broader range of students.},

Results showed that GPT-4.0 exhibits superior grading consistency with experts compared to GPT-3.5 in terms of topic relevance, clarity of expression, answerability, and difficulty level. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 had low consistency with experts in terms of cognitive level. Over three rounds of testing, GPT-4.0 demonstrated higher stability in autograding when contrasted with GPT-3.5. In addition, to validate the effectiveness of GPT in evaluating SGQs from different domains and subjects, we have done the same experiment on a part of LearningQ dataset. We also discussed the attitudes of teachers and students toward automatic grading by GPT models. The findings underscore the potential of GPT-4.0 to assist teachers in evaluating the quality of SGQs.

  abstract     = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Generative artificial intelligence has become the focus of the intelligent education field, especially in the generation of personalized learning resources. Current learning resource generation methods recommend customized courses based on learning styles and interests, improving learning efficiency. However, these methods cannot generate personalized tutorials according to learners’ preferences, nor can they adjust tutorial content as moods or levels of knowledge change. Therefore, this study develops an intelligent tutorial-generating system (Self-GT) for self-aid learning, integrating cognitive computing and generative learning to capture learners’ dynamic preferences. The critical components of Self-GT are the tutorial-generating model based on cyclic deep reinforcement learning (RL) and the multimodal knowledge graph containing complex relationships. Specifically, the proposed RL model dynamically explores learners’ preferences from the temporal dimension, enabling RL agents to express learning behavior characteristics accurately and generate personalized tutorials.

  abstract     = {Blended learning (BL) has become increasingly popular in higher education institutions. Despite its popularity and the advances in methodologies for the detection of learning tactics and strategies from trace data, little is known about how they apply to BL settings and, therefore, how students use them to plan, organize, monitor, and regulate their learning in these settings. To address this gap, we analyzed the manifestations of learning tactics and strategies of 267 students across three undergraduate-level BL courses with different course designs, instructional activities, and learning contexts. We employed a data-driven method that incorporates hidden Markov models to determine students’ learning tactics. Then, we employed optimal matching to identify the students’ strategies based on the sequences of tactics they deployed and how they relate to their self-reported self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. Our results indicate that students’ tactics and strategies varied significantly depending on the course design and learning context. Tactics with regard to the use of time management resources were common across courses. In contrast, tactics deployed when revisiting old material and interacting with an SRL support tool were course-specific. We identified strategies related to surface and deep learning and found that surface-level strategies manifested consistently across all courses. These findings contribute to a better understanding of student learning mechanisms in BL environments and have implications for instructional design and SRL support.},

Integrating digital-based approaches to disseminate knowledge within institutional curricula is crucial for mainstreaming knowledge. This work explores the development of a virtual lab (VL) for additive manufacturing (AM), using an interactive VL simulator. The VL&#39;s experiments encompass anatomy, assembly, techniques, preprocessing, and postprocessing modules on AM. The aim of this dedicated AM VL is to facilitate digital education on 3DP among educational institutions. A case study compares the efficacy of VL to physical experimentation. Two groups of 30 students each provided feedback before and after conducting experiments in the physical laboratory and on the VL, respectively. The comparison elucidates how integrating the VL with traditional teaching pedagogy can be a progressive step in teaching AM in educational institutions. The teaching pedagogy approach is both cost-effective and time efficient. The developed VL offers unlimited access and availability for students to learn at their own pace. The design of the 3DP virtual simulation lab incorporates an inclusive align–act–assess approach, wherein each module includes related theory, aim, procedure, simulator interface, pretest, and posttest to align with this approach.},

However, these works ignore the collaborative information among those students who have similar exercise–answering experiences, which may contain some valuable information. In this article, we present a novel collaborative self-supervised learning method for KT (CoSKT), which exploits both similar students&#39; collaborative information and individual information to improve KT. We first use the overlap rate of students&#39; learning experiences to retrieve similar students. Based on similar students&#39; exercise–answering sequences, we leverage attention mechanism to learn the representation of their common knowledge state and expected response to the target exercise. Then, we introduce self-supervised learning by encouraging the consistency between the common knowledge state and individual knowledge state. Finally, we integrate collaborative information and individual knowledge state with a gate mechanism to conduct the response prediction of the target exercise. We compare CoSKT with nine existing KT methods on three public datasets, and the results show that CoSKT achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

For that, substantial training and practice are required, but it is costly to create a variety of high-quality HCI training materials. In this context, chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) and other chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to generate training materials of acceptable quality without foregoing specific human characteristics present in real-world scenarios. Personas is a user-centered design method that encompasses fictitious but believable user archetypes to help designers understand and empathize with their target audience during product design. We conducted an exploratory study on the Personas technique, addressing the validity and believability of interviews designed by HCI trainers and answered by ChatGPT-simulated users, which can be used as training material for persona creation. Specifically, we employed ChatGPT to respond to interviews designed by user experience (UX) experts. Two groups, HCI professors and professionals, then evaluated the validity of the generated materials considering quality, usefulness, UX, and ethics. The results show that both groups rated the interviews as believable and helpful for Personas training. However, some concerns about response repetition and low response variability suggested the need for further research on improved prompt design in order to generate more diverse and well-developed responses. The findings of this study provide insight into how HCI trainers can use ChatGPT to help their students master persona creation skills before working with real users in real-world scenarios for the first time.},

Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM&#39;s instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Prescreening children for specific learning disabilities, e.g., dyslexia, is essential for effective intervention. With a quick and reliable prescreening result, special education coordinators (SENCOs) can provide students with early intervention and relieve their learning pressure. Unfortunately, due to the limited resources, many students in Hong Kong receive dyslexia assessments beyond the golden period, i.e., under the age of six. To this end, information technology could establish automatic prescreening tools to address this issue. However, dyslexia prescreening for children learning Chinese is challenging due to the lack of sound–script correlation in Chinese. In this article, an automatic dyslexia prescreening system (ADPS) is developed to provide a quick test to identify at-risk children. Through a two-stage approach, we first develop a gamified tool based on linguistic characteristics and then evaluate the result by a comparison study. Results from a pilot test on 30 students with dyslexia and 32 students without dyslexia indicate that the ADPS can effectively distinguish between two groups of students. Furthermore, the interactive design elements can motivate students to conduct the prescreening independently.},

This research investigates the influence of knowledge management factors on the continuous usage of ChatGPT for educational purposes while concurrently evaluating student satisfaction with its use in learning. Using a quantitative approach, a structured questionnaire was administered to 513 Vietnamese university students via Google Forms for data collection. The partial least squares structural equation modeling statistical technique was employed to examine the relationships between identified factors and evaluate the research model. The results provided strong support for several hypotheses, revealing significant positive effects of expectation confirmation on perceived usefulness and satisfaction, as well as perceived usefulness on user satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT. These findings suggest that when students recognize the usefulness of ChatGPT for their learnings, they experience higher satisfaction and are more likely to continue using it. In addition, knowledge acquisition significantly impacts both satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT, while knowledge sharing and application influence satisfaction exclusively. This indicates that students prioritize knowledge acquisition over sharing and applying knowledge through ChatGPT. The study has theoretical and practical implications for ChatGPT developers, educators, and future research.

  abstract     = {This article presents an overview of educational robotics (ER) in primary and preschool education. As ER seems to be gaining popularity for its effectiveness as a learning tool, more research needs to be done in this area. Recent results from ER pilot projects advocate for the integration of ER in K-12 education curricula. On the other hand, teachers may face various difficulties in carrying out such activities due to lack of experience or knowledge in this field. Previous research has shown that ER is still an open field for exploration. Even though an increasing number of experiences are available for the use of robotic tools in early education, there is not enough empirical evidence on the features they need to present for young learners to perceive them as attractive and easy to use. In addition, the high cost of some tools may prevent educational institutions from using them systematically. To detect possible gaps in the current research, in the context of this work, 21 articles representing ER applications and frameworks were collected and reviewed between 2011 and 2021. The results of this study demonstrate that ER can be a valuable tool for supporting primary and preschool students. However, the review supports that more research is needed on the technical features that a robotic tool must have to be successfully introduced to students of this age. Moreover, future work is needed to develop low-cost ER tools so they can become more accessible to educational institutions.},

  abstract     = {Learning style recognition is an indispensable part of achieving personalized learning in online learning systems. The traditional inventory method for learning style identification faces the limitations such as subject and static characteristics. Therefore, an automatic and reliable learning style recognition mechanism is designed in this article. First, a learning style labeling framework (LSDFA) based on multilabel fusion is proposed, which can obtain learning style labels by mining the potential information of two sets of inventories. Furthermore, a two-layer ensemble model (SRGSML) based on learners&#39; online learning behaviors data to recognize learners&#39; learning styles is proposed, which combines the resampling technology (SMOTE) to solve the unreliable prediction problem caused by class imbalance. The superiority of the proposed mechanism is verified on learning behavior data of 2056 learners during the online teaching period of Shanghai Normal University. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of SRGSML reaches 0.977, as well as prove the effectiveness of the LSDFA for labeling learning style.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to provide a systematic review of existing research on the use of digital game-based learning (DGBL) technology for foreign language (English) in preschool and elementary schools. Digital game-based technology enables learning to become more interactive and inspirational, thereby enhancing language acquisition. The authors present a DGBL classification schema with four main components, design principles, language content, pedagogical factors, and feedback mechanisms, as guidelines for designing and implementing DGBL in foreign language learning. This survey classifies and filters 110 published articles from January 2010 to April 2022 based on the proposed DGBL schema adhering to the insertion and omission criteria, from which 50 studies focus on preschool and primary school students between the ages of 2 and 10 years. The findings indicate that DGBL influences motivation, creativity, and problem-solving ability. However, the synthesized literature also reveals challenges and issues in designing and developing DGBL systems based on novel technologies. The findings are fundamental for exploring the game classification schema for designing and implementing game-based learning to augment the trends of DBGL in foreign language learning and identify the possible issues and solutions for DGBL to lessen health concerns and technology challenges. The authors recommend emerging technologies and software engineering processes as possible solutions for continuity in DGBL research by enlightening the significance of evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, deep learning, AR/VR, and development and operations.},

More and more researchers have devoted themselves to solving KT tasks, e.g., deep knowledge tracing (DKT), which can capture more sophisticated representations of student knowledge. Nonetheless, these techniques ignore the reconstruction of the observed input information. Therefore, this leads to poor predictions of students&#39; knowledge, even if the student performed well in the past knowledge state. In this article, we first employ causal inference for explanatory analysis of KT, then propose a learning algorithm for stable KT based on the analysis outcomes. The proposed approach aims to achieve stable KT by constructing global balanced weights that facilitate estimating feature influence and assessing causal relationships between individual variables and outcome variables. We have proved the approach has effective in accuracy and interpretability through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets. In conclusion, this article has methodological implications for the stable assessment of students&#39; knowledge and provides a reference for personalization and use of intelligence in the educational teaching process.},

Effective attribution of their learning success or failure in the context of a small private online course (SPOC) could generate students’ motivation toward learning success while an incorrect attribution would lead to a sense of helplessness. Based on the attribution theories developed by Wiener and Kelly with learning analytics technology, this article developed a systematic framework for learning analytics in SPOC in an undergraduate course. A total of 197 undergraduates participated in the experiment and were randomly assigned to a treatment group (98 students) and a control group (99 students). The treatment group applied the learning analytics system framework in a SPOC, and the control group applied the traditional SPOC teaching method, and other conditions are consistent. Structural equation modeling is adopted to explore the correlations among attribution variables (i.e., ability, effort, difficulty of the task, and luck), motivational variables (i.e., endogenous motivation, and extrinsic motivation), and learning achievement. The results indicated that all four attribution variables have a significant correlation with both endogenous and extrinsic motivation and have a significant effect on learning achievement. Students in the experimental class exhibited better outcomes than students in the control class with respect to learning motivation and learning achievement. The findings validated the effectiveness of using the SPOC analytics system to facilitate SPOC learners making effective attributions, leading to the enhancement of learning motivation and achievement.},

In existing research, the correlations between learning risks and students&#39; changing cognitive abilities or learning states are still underexplored, and the personalized early warning is unavailable for students at different levels. To accurately identify the possible learning risks faced by students at different levels, this article proposes a personalized early warning approach to learning performance for college students via cognitive ability and learning state modeling. In this approach, students&#39; learning process data and historical performance data are analyzed to track students&#39; cognitive abilities in the whole learning process, and model their learning states from four dimensions, i.e., learning quality, learning engagement, latent learning state, and historical learning state. Then, the Adaboost algorithm is used to predict students&#39; learning performance, and an evaluation rule with five levels is designed to dynamically provide multilevel personalized early warning to students. Finally, the comparative experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively predict all students&#39; learning performance, and provide accurate early warning services to them.},

Despite utilizing deep learning models in KT, current approaches often oversimplify students&#39; exercise records into knowledge sequences, which fail to explore the rich information within individual questions. In addition, existing KT models tend to neglect the complex, higher order relationships between questions and latent concepts. Therefore, we introduce a novel model called feature crosses information-based KT (FCIKT) to explore the intricate interplay between questions, latent concepts, and question difficulties. FCIKT utilizes a fusion module to perform feature crosses operations on questions, integrating information from our constructed multirelational heterogeneous graph using graph convolutional networks. We deployed a multihead attention mechanism, which enriches the static embedding representations of questions and concepts with dynamic semantic information to simulate real-world scenarios of problem-solving. We also used gated recurrent units to dynamically capture and update the students&#39; knowledge state for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrated the validity and interpretability of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) aim to deliver personalized learning support to each learner, aligning with the educational aspiration of many countries, including China. ITSs&#39; personalized support is mainly achieved by providing individual prompts to learners when they encounter difficulties in problem-solving. The guiding principles and methods of prompts have been less investigated in previous ITS literatures. Based on relevant learning theories, such as self-regulated learning theory, zone of proximal development, scaffolding and heuristic teaching, we proposed seven guiding principles for designing ITS prompts and designed the guiding and adaptive prompts for the difficult questions in a mathematical ITS, math intelligent assessment and teaching system V2.0. In order to verify the effectiveness of this ITS with the aforementioned prompts, we conducted a 2 × 2 quasi-experiment in a high school, where the experimental group followed a process of “pretest, practice with general prompts and adaptive tutoring, and posttest,” while the control group followed a process of “pretest, practice with only general prompts, and posttest.” We collected the pre and posttest scores of both the experimental and control groups, and log data from the student model within the ITS for the experimental group students. The data analysis indicated that although the experimental group scored lower than the control group in the pretest, they scored higher in the posttest and spent less completion time. The drilled problems and the prompts provided to the experimental group students were personalized. In conclusion, the design principles for guiding and adaptive prompts in the ITS can provide personalized guidance and support for students, thus effectively improve their performance. Those principles are not only valuable for the subject mathematics but also can contribute significantly to the prompt design of other subjects, thereby bolstering the global pursuit of personalized education.},

The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem&#39;s connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

Three classification methods are analyzed in this article: 1) random forest algorithm with human-engineered descriptive features; 2) long and short-term memory algorithm with acoustic features generated by open speech and music interpretation by large space extraction toolkit; and 3) convolutional neural network algorithm with Mel spectrogram of the audio. The results show that the three approaches can complete the prediction task well, with the second approach exhibiting the best accuracy. The importance of the features in these classification models is analyzed according to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques (i.e., XAI) and statistical feature analysis methods. In this way, key indicators of high-quality tutoring are identified. This study demonstrated the usefulness of XAI techniques in understanding why some tutoring sessions are of good quality and others are not.

  abstract     = {Educational robotics (ER) is a discipline of applied robotics focused on teaching robot design, analysis, application, and operation. Traditionally, ER has favored rigid robots, overlooking the potential of soft robots (SRs). While rigid robots offer insights into dynamics, kinematics, and control, they have limitations in exploring the depths of mechanical design and material properties. In this regard, SRs present an opportunity to expand educational topics and activities in robotics through their unique bioinspired properties and accessibility. Despite their promise, there is a notable lack of research on SRs as educational tools, limiting the identification of research avenues that could promote their adoption in educational settings. This study conducts a systematic literature review to elucidate the impact of SRs across academic levels, pedagogical strategies, prevalent artificial muscles, educational activities, and assessment methods. The findings indicate a significant focus on K-12 workshops utilizing soft pneumatic actuators. Furthermore, SRs have fostered the development of fabrication and mechanical design skills beyond mere programming tasks. However, there is a shortage of studies analyzing their use in higher education or their impact on learning outcomes, suggesting a critical need for comprehensive evaluations to determine their effectiveness, rather than solely relying on surveys for student feedback. Thus, there is an opportunity to explore and evaluate the use of SRs in more advanced settings and multidisciplinary activities, urging for rigorous assessments of their influence on learning outcomes. By undertaking this, we aim to provide a foundation for integrating SRs into the ER curriculum, potentially transforming teaching methodologies and enriching students&#39; learning experiences.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a 3-D medical simulation that employs reinforcement learning (RL) and interactive RL (IRL) to teach and assess the procedure of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). The simulation is motivated by the need for effective, safe, and remote training techniques in medicine, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The simulation has two modes: a tutorial mode and an assessment mode. In the tutorial mode, a computer-based, ill-trained RL agent utilizes RL to learn the correct sequence of donning the PPE by trial and error. This allows students to experience many outlier cases they might not encounter in an in-class educational model. In the assessment mode, an IRL-based method is used to evaluate how effective the participant is at correcting the mistakes performed by the RL agent. Each time the RL agent interacts with the environment and performs an action, the participants provide positive or negative feedback regarding the action taken. Following the assessment, participants receive a score based on the accuracy of their feedback and the time taken for the RL agent to learn the correct sequence. An experiment was conducted using two groups, each consisting of ten participants. The first group received RL-assisted training for donning PPE, followed by an IRL-based assessment. Meanwhile, the second group observed a video featuring the RL agent demonstrating only the correct donning order without outlier cases, replicating traditional training, before undergoing the same assessment as the first group. Results showed that RL-assisted training with many outlier cases was more effective than traditional training with only regular cases. Moreover, combining RL with IRL significantly enhanced the participants&#39; performance. Notably, 90% of the participants finished the assessment with perfect scores within three iterations. In contrast, only 10% of those who did not engage in RL-assisted training finished the assessment with a perfect score, highlighting the substantial impact of RL and IRL integration on participants’ overall achievement.},

  abstract     = {A learner can autonomously acquire knowledge by experiencing the world, without necessarily being explicitly taught. The contents and ways of this type of real-world learning are grounded on his/her surroundings and are self-determined by computing real-world information. However, conventional studies have not modeled, observed, or understood a learner&#39;s self-regulation mechanism of real-world learning. This study developed computational learning analytics to estimate how this mechanism works. Our analytics segmented a time series of real-world learning into units of a cognitively closed and semantically independent function by estimating the spatiotemporal clusters of a learner&#39;s concentrated stay behavior. We found that learners&#39; intercluster moves functioned to determine whether they maintained or changed their contents and strategies of real-world learning. We also found that the spatiotemporal sizes of the estimated clusters were correlated with the activeness and diversity of strategy-based content examinations at each location. This study forms a basis for automatically estimating qualitative transitions of real-world learning and encouraging a learner to obtain a better understanding of the world.},

  abstract     = {Possible symptoms of intellectual disability (ID) include delayed physical development that becomes more pronounced as the disability progresses, delayed development of gross and fine motor skills, sensory perception problems, and difficulty grasping the integrity of objects. Although there is no cure or reversal, research has shown that extensive training and learning can lead to easier social integration, but the human demands of diagnosis and the cost of training often result in overburdened families of origin, an unmanageable workload for teachers, and high social costs. Therefore, it is important to conduct efficient, effective, and economical assessments in a safe and reproducible training environment. Currently, the assessment of ID relies on intelligence tests, such as the Wechsler intelligence scale and the vineland adaptive behavior scale. With the rapid development of virtual reality (VR) and machine learning (ML), we created a virtual supermarket and then collected data in three areas, including eye movements, brain waves, and behaviors. We also propose an intelligent executive function evaluation using ML to develop a more objective and automatic evaluation model based on real data through physiological data obtained from user reflections. Statistical analysis of the obtained data showed that some data metrics derived from behavioral information differed significantly between ID patients and healthy participants. This shows that it is possible to perform classification through neural networks, even at multiple levels, which may prove effective for vocational training through VR.},

To understand the impact of the constrained learning, we conducted a study on game-based learning to examine the effectiveness of computer-aided and autonomous learning of traditional Chinese by underprivileged students. From December 2020 to May 2021, we collected 3245 quiz results from 26 underprivileged students over six months. The quizzes systematically covered the fundamentals of learning traditional Chinese in six aspects, i.e., literacy, orthography, phonology, morphology, speaking, and writing. We analyzed the results to understand the learning efficacy of students. Remarkably, students can significantly improve their skills in literacy and phonology through unsupervised game-based learning. Furthermore, by parsing the writing tasks, we observe substantial improvements among 7 out of 13 common types of writing mistakes. Our study provides a critical lens to understand the design opportunities of game-based learning without direct supervision.},

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was necessary to switch from colocated physical intergenerational play to online experiences. This type of experience, in which grandparents connect from their own houses to participate, represents a challenge in terms of recruiting participants and carrying out the online sessions, due to grandparents’ technological insecurities and their reluctance to play videogames. Besides, intergenerational games have to be carefully designed to promote symmetrical interactions, fun, and engagement on the part of both age groups as well as to develop easy to use interfaces. In this work, we present an online storytelling game designed to be played by family teams formed by grandparents and their grandchildren. The guidelines followed, the assessment tools designed to evaluate the intergenerational dynamics and the emotions that arise during the experience are also presented.

  abstract     = {This work investigates the design and usability of a novel eXtended Reality (XR) Vest, which combines two viewpoints for demonstration-based training (DBT). Traditional modalities for DBT, such as prerecorded videos and live instruction, are minimally engaging and potentially hazardous resulting in low motivation and knowledge retention. To combat this, works incorporate XR technology to improve training immersiveness, safety, and engagement. When worn by a trainer, our XR Vest enables trainees to have the first-person perspective of immersive XR environments on an integrated tablet while simultaneously watching the third-person motor movements. To test the XR Vest in DBT, 28 individuals completed three training sessions: 1) using an Oculus Quest 2 (baseline); 2) watching a DBT video on a desktop computer monitor (first-person perspective); and 3) viewing a DBT on the XR Vest (first-person and third-person perspectives). Following each session, the participants performed a memory aptitude test to evaluate their recall, a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to investigate their perceived workload, and a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to measure the usability of the systems. A linear mixed-effect analysis showed significant differences between the temporal demand, physical demand, and frustration in the NASA-TLX scores and the integration and learnability features in the SUS scores. The results suggest that incorporating XR technology in first- and third-person perspectives within the XR Vest decreased workload and improved system usability. Future works should evaluate the benefits of this XR design in other domains where DBT is used.},

This study aims to explore the effects of generative AI-assisted preservice teaching skills training on preservice teachers’ self-efficacy and higher order thinking. The participants of this study were 215 preservice mathematics, science, and computer teachers from a university in China. First, a pretest–post-test quasi-experimental design was implemented for an experimental group (teaching skills training by generative AI) and a control group (teaching skills training by traditional methods) by investigating the teacher self-efficacy and higher order thinking of the two groups before and after the experiment. Finally, a semistructured interview comprising open-ended questions was administered to 25 preservice teachers within the experimental group to present their views on generative AI-assisted teaching. The results showed that the scores of preservice teachers in the experimental group, who used generative AI for teachers’ professional development, were considerably higher than those of the control group, both in teacher self-efficacy ( F = 8.589, p = 0.0084 &lt; 0.05) and higher order thinking ( F = 7.217, p = 0.008 &lt; 0.05).

Our primary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of conversational modules if a learning engineer follows our workflow. Notably, our workflow is technically lightweight, in the sense that no further training of the models is expected. To evaluate the workflow, we created three different conversational modules. For each, we assessed classifier quality and how coherent the follow-up question asked by the agent was based on the classification results of the user response. The classifiers reached F1-macro scores between 0.66 and 0.86, and the percentage of coherent follow-up questions asked by the agent was between 79% and 84%. These results highlight, first, the potential of transformer-based models to support learning engineers in developing dedicated conversational agents. Second, it highlights the necessity to consider the quality of the adaptation mechanism together with the adaptive dialogue. As such models continue to be improved, their benefits for learning engineering will rise. Future work would be valuable to investigate the usability of this workflow by learning engineers with different backgrounds and prior knowledge on the technical and pedagogical aspects of learning engineering.},

Entrepreneurship education aims to cultivate and develop the innovative thinking and entrepreneurial skills of students, making it a practical form of education. However, a knowledge retrieval and question-answering teaching assistant system for entrepreneurship education has not been proposed. This observation motivated us to develop a reading comprehension framework to address the challenges of domain-specific knowledge gaps and the weak comprehension of complex texts encountered by intelligent education models in practical applications. The proposed framework mainly includes: question understanding, relevant knowledge retrieval, mathematical calculation, and answer prediction. The techniques involved in the aforementioned modules mainly include text embedding, similarity retrieval, graph convolution, and long short-term memory network. By integrating this model into entrepreneurship courses, learners can participate in real-time discussions and receive immediate feedback, creating a more dynamic and interactive learning environment. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, this article conducts answer prediction on single-choice exercises related to entrepreneurship education courses. This study employs the potential of using a question-and-answer format to enhance intelligent entrepreneurship education, paving the way for a more effective and engaging online learning experience.},

  abstract     = {Serious video games provide a immersive learning environment for agriculture by simulating real-life challenges scenarios. However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness is sparse. This scoping review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighting research trends and identifying gaps. We systematically searched nine prominent research databases for papers on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and synthesized the collected data using a narrative approach. The initial search identified 3,297 articles, of which 0.58% ( n = 19) were included in the review. Most reviewed games were released in the last five years, with a predominant presence in the mobile platform. They commonly employed a simulation-based approach, featuring 2-D graphics and designed for single-player experiences. These games mainly target students, focusing on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Educational theories were often unspecified in the studies. Evaluation protocols primarily consisted of pilot studies, emphasizing user experience and knowledge enhancement. Positive outcomes, such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude and behavior changes, were commonly observed in these studies. This study highlights advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning over 20 years. However, it stresses the need for deeper exploration of game elements&#39; impact on user experience and effectiveness. Creating games for underrepresented players and specific agricultural challenges is essential, as is enhancing theoretical foundations and learning approaches. Rigorous research designs are vital for assessing game effectiveness across short, medium, and long terms.},

Most reviews of immersive learning research were outcomes-focused, few considered the educational practices and strategies. These are necessary to provide theoretical and pedagogical frameworks to situate outcomes within a context where technology is in concert with educational approaches. We sought a broader perspective of the practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments, and conducted a mapping survey of reviews, identifying 47 studies. Extracted accounts of educational practices and strategies under thematic analysis yielded 45 strategies and 21 practices, visualized as a network clustered by conceptual proximity. Resulting clusters “Active context”, “Collaboration”, “Engagement and Scaffolding”, “Presence”, and “Real and virtual multimedia learning” expose the richness of practices and strategies within the field. The visualization maps the field, supporting decision-making when combining practices and strategies for using the metaverse in education, highlights which practices and strategies are supported by the literature, and the presence and absence of diversity within clusters.},

A set of instructional support strategies has been defined and integrated into an online learning software, developed ad hoc to teach the basic vocabulary of the English subject syllabus of the two first courses of primary school. A controlled experiment was carried out with 20 students with DS, who were divided into two groups: control and experimental. The control group was given a simplified version of the software, while the experimental group had access to the complete software with personalized instruction. Prior to the experiment, all participants undertook the same level test (pretest) in order to assess their initial knowledge level of English. After finishing the learning stage, a posttest was provided to the students to assess their learning. In both groups, results in the posttest were consistently better than in the pretest, supporting the positive effect of the learning software as an instructional tool. In addition, learning gains were significantly higher in the experimental group, that used the proposed instructional aids.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel digital method of capturing finger-based gestures on touchscreen devices for the purpose of exploring tracing gestures in educational research. Given that tracing has been found to support cognition, learning, and problem solving in educational settings, data related to the performance of these gestures are increasingly of interest to researchers. Most educational research methods exploring the use of hand gestures rely on in-person data collection, whether through direct observation or video recording of participants’ behavior for later analysis. These methods, while effective for observing gross movements, may not provide researchers with detailed insights into how learners interact with learning materials. Using custom tools to record touchscreen engagement on tablet computing devices can address this limitation while also providing the means to visually represent touch-based interactions with these devices. Geometry Touch is an iPad app developed and tested by the primary author as a part of a pilot study. The research study, theoretically grounded in cognitive load theory (CLT), demonstrated that Geometry Touch could efficiently collect data on touchscreen interactions while also providing potential avenues to quantify touchscreen interactions through computational means. The purpose of this article is to report on the development and testing of this app while providing an explanation of how it was used as a method of data collection by leveraging touchscreen technology. The article concludes by discussing how this digital method of capturing movement can provide further insight into how finger-based gestures can influence learning and, as such, could increase the reach of gesture-based research.},

  abstract     = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are critical for students of all ages to maximize their learning. Two key processes of SRL are being aware of one&#39;s performance (self-evaluation) and believing in one&#39;s capabilities to produce given attainments (self-efficacy). To assess and improve these capabilities in young children (5–8), we use a literacy web application, where we introduced two randomly triggered prompts to evaluate perceived difficulty and desired difficulty. Comparing students&#39; actual performance with their responses to self-regulatory prompts provides information about their ability to self-regulate their learning, in particular their self-evaluation and self-efficacy. The novelty of this work resides in studying the SRL of young children (5–8) in digital learning environments while learning another task (reading in our case), measuring and improving some SRL abilities themselves and not only measuring and improving academic results in other tasks, and the large number of students on which the studies were carried (over 400 000). Using 15 982 994 responses from 467 116 students, we first measured two types of SRL deficits, and then, we assessed how a scaffolding and remediation strategy can reduce these deficits. In Study 1, we compare a group receiving remediation feedback to a control group, whereas in Study 2, we determine the impact of age and level on the remediation efficiency. Our contribution is twofold: a method to address on the long term a deficit in self-evaluation or in self-efficacy in a digital learning environment, and a corroboration of the fact that students who are academically at risk lack self-efficacy and avoid tackling challenging exercises compared with their level. We, therefore, recommend that digital learning environments integrate an overlay of SRL, such as self-evaluation and self-efficacy remediation loops, especially for younger students and students who are struggling academically. We included notes for educational practitioners in this article for this purpose.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel approach to remote laboratory instruction, specifically designed for teaching three-dimensional modeling using Blender software. The lab uses virtual machines to provide students with the necessary computational power to carry out the course activities, along with the correct version of the software. The flipped remote lab approach combines the elements of flipped classroom and peer assessment, making it suitable for face-to-face, totally online, or hybrid classes. Prior to each of the two lectures, students begin to practice by replicating the instructor&#39;s demonstrations in a set of concise tutorials. Upon completion of the assigned tasks, students carry out self-assessments of their own modeling, in addition to assessing two models created by their peers. A rubric comprising three questions facilitates the assessment process and allows providing feedback on each response. During the subsequent lecture, students work together with the instructor to address challenges encountered in their modeling, exploring also the advanced aspects of software usage that time constraints preclude in a traditional setting. The analysis of the flipped remote lab results reveals that student responses in peer-assessment activities are relevant to the posed questions. Moreover, the students who realized the models demonstrated a comparable level of rigor in self-assessment as their mates who reviewed their works. While students express a high degree of appreciation for the laboratory activities, a notable concern is the highlighted heavy workload. Increasing the allocated time for task completion can help mitigate the workload impact. The article concludes with insights gained from the implementation of the flipped remote lab approach.},

The enabling technologies are fast advancing, and the need for solutions during the COVID-19 global pandemic led to the emergence of the Edu-Metaverse, which is conceptualized as a collection of networked virtual worlds (i.e., the Metaverse) for learning. There is a great necessity to investigate how these more recent enabling technologies can support collaborative learning. This empirical study aims to collect both quantitative and qualitative results to fill the knowledge gaps. Specifically, 20 undergraduate students (three females and 17 males) taking the Game Design and Development course voluntarily participated in this study. The participants used three representative collaboration platforms (i.e., AltSpace, Gather, and ZOOM) in our laboratory for discussing three course-specific topics, simulating the undertaking of collaborative learning tasks in the distance learning setting. The results suggest that the participants were more engaged in the learning activities using the Metaverse platforms that offer avatar-mediated communications and collaborations (i.e., AltSpace and Gather). These platforms also gave the participants a stronger sense of copresence and belonging to the learning community. Potential improvements to the usability and the participants&#39; feedback are also discussed in the article.

When these events occur, traditional classrooms with traditional or blended delivery can shift to fully online learning, which requires an efficient learning environment that meets students’ needs. While learning management systems support teachers’ productivity and creativity, they typically provide the same content to all learners in a course, ignoring their unique learning styles. To address this issue, we propose a semisupervised machine learning approach that detects students’ learning styles using a data mining technique. We use the commonly used Felder-Silverman learning style model and demonstrate that our semisupervised method can produce reliable classification models with few labeled data. We evaluate our approach on two different courses and achieve an accuracy of 88.83% and 77.35%, respectively. Our work shows that educational data mining and semisupervised machine learning techniques can identify different learning styles and create a personalized learning environment.},

Although insightful, these reports had been mostly for text handwriting task that is not language agnostic (with observations related to a writer&#39;s language skills), thereby emphasizing the importance of assessing graphic execution ability during language-agnostic graphic task. The assessment can be carried out in terms of kinetic (e.g., grip force exerted on the pen barrel, in-hand manipulation of the pen, etc.) and kinematic (e.g., speed of the pen-tip, pen-tip pressure, etc.) attributes.

  abstract     = {In distance education courses with a large number of students and groups, the organization and facilitation of collaborative writing tasks are challenging. Teachers need support for planning, specification, execution, monitoring, and evaluation of collaborative writing tasks in their course. This requires a collaborative learning platform for coordinating all of the different phases in the writing process. In order to enable the design of such a platform, we created a process model of collaborative writing tasks that is based on the identification of participants, activities, phases, and orchestration from the literature. This model may serve as a basis for teachers to specify the instances for such tasks and can be used to determine the functional requirements needed for supporting model-compliant tasks on a collaborative learning platform. We present a general architecture for a platform of this kind that is independent of a concrete learning management systerm (LMS) system or shared editor and demonstrate its implementation using Moodle, Etherpad Lite, and Docker. The platform makes it easier for teachers to create groups and automatically assign members to collaborative workspaces. It enables asynchronous as well as synchronous text editing and communication. It also respects the European information security and data protection requirements and helps teachers monitor both the writing and reviewing activities. The platform was evaluated over a period of three semesters in distance learning courses with more than 4500 students. It proved a scalable and robust environment for coordinating the collaborative writing process of teachers and students and enables analysis of collaborative writing behavior by teachers and researchers.},

  abstract     = {The designs of many student-facing learning analytics (SFLA) dashboards are insufficiently informed by educational research and lack rigorous evaluation in authentic learning contexts, including during remote laboratory practical work. In this article, we present and evaluate an SFLA dashboard designed using the principles of formative assessment to provide feedback to students during remote lab activities. Feedback is based upon graphical visualizations of student actions performed during lab tasks and comparison to expected procedures using TaskCompare—our custom, asymmetric graph dissimilarity measure that distinguishes students who miss expected actions from those who perform additional actions, a capability missing in existing graph distance (symmetrical dissimilarity) measures. Using a total of $N = 235$ student graphs collected during authentic learning in two different engineering courses, we describe the validation of TaskCompare and evaluate the impact of the SFLA dashboard on task completion during remote lab activities. In addition, we use components of the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire as covariates for propensity score matching to account for potential bias in self-selection of use of the dashboard. We find that those students who used the SFLA dashboard achieved significantly better task completion rate (nearly double) than those who did not, with a significant difference in TaskCompare score between the two groups (Mann–Whitney $U = 453.5$ , $p &amp;lt; 0.01$ and Cliff&#39;s $\delta = 0.43$ , large effect size). This difference remains after accounting for self-selection. We also report that students&#39; positive rating of the usefulness of the SFLA dashboard for completing lab work is significantly above a neutral response ( $S = 21.0$ and $p &amp;lt; 0.01$ ). These findings provide evidence that our SFLA dashboard is an effective means of providing formative assessment during remote laboratory activities.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing is a well-known problem in AI for education, consisting of monitoring how the knowledge state of students changes during the learning process and accurately predicting their performance in future exercises. In recent years, many advances have been made thanks to various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Despite their satisfactory performances, they have some pitfalls, e.g., modeling one skill at a time, ignoring the relationships between different skills, or inconsistency for the predictions, i.e., sudden spikes and falls across time steps. For this reason, hybrid machine-learning techniques have also been explored. With this systematic literature review, we aim to illustrate the state of the art in this field. Specifically, we want to identify the potential and the frontiers in integrating prior knowledge sources in the traditional machine learning pipeline as a supplement to the normally considered data. We applied a qualitative analysis to distill a taxonomy with the following three dimensions: knowledge source, knowledge representation, and knowledge integration. Exploiting this taxonomy, we also conducted a quantitative analysis to detect the most common approaches.},

  abstract     = {Learning analytics (LA), like much of machine learning, assumes the training and test datasets come from the same distribution. Therefore, LA models built on past observations are (implicitly) expected to work well for future observations. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice because the dataset may drift. Recently, algorithmic fairness has gained significant attention. Nevertheless, algorithmic fairness research has paid little attention to dataset drift. Majority of the existing fairness algorithms are “statically” designed. Put another way, LA models tuned to be “fair” on past data are expected to still be “fair” when dealing with current/future data. However, it is counter-intuitive to deploy a statically fair algorithm to a nonstationary world. There is, therefore, a need to assess the impact of dataset drift on the unfairness of LA models. For this reason, we investigate the relationship between dataset drift and unfairness of LA models. Specifically, we first measure the degree of drift in the features (i.e., covariates) and target label of our dataset. After that, we train predictive models on the dataset and evaluate the relationship between the dataset drift and the unfairness of the predictive models. Our findings suggest a directly proportional relationship between dataset drift and unfairness. Further, we find covariate drift to have the most impact on unfairness of models as compared to target drift, and there are no guarantees that a once fair model would consistently remain fair. Our findings imply that “robustness” of fair LA models to dataset drift is necessary before deployment.},

  abstract     = {Swapping visual perspective in virtual reality (VR) provides a unique means for embodying different virtual bodies and for self-distancing. Moreover, this technology is a powerful tool for experiential learning and for simulating realistic scenarios, with broad potential in the training of soft skills. However, there is scarce knowledge on how perspective swapping in VR might benefit the training of soft skills such as those required in a job interview. This article investigates the impact of virtual body swapping on the self-assessment of verbal and nonverbal communication skills, emotional states, and embodiment in a simulated job interview context. Three main conditions were compared: a baseline condition in which the participants practiced a job interview from the first-person perspective of a virtual interviewee (no swap condition); an external point of view condition where, first, the participants answered questions from the interviewee perspective, but then swap visual perspective to re-experience their responses from a nonembodied point of view (out of body condition); and a condition in which, after answering questions from the interviewee perspective, the participants re-experienced their responses from the embodied perspective of the virtual recruiter (recruiter condition). The experimental results indicated that the effectiveness of the out of body and recruiter conditions was superior to the no swap condition to self-assess the communication styles used during a job interview. Moreover, all the conditions led to a high level of embodiment toward the interviewee avatar when seen from the first-person perspective; in the case of the recruiter condition, the participants also felt embodied in the recruiter avatar. No differences in emotional states were found among conditions, with all sharing a positive valence.},

When physical learning is not feasible, and when the demand cannot be met through actual hands-on laboratory sessions, as has been during the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual laboratory courses can be considered as an alternative education medium. This study focuses on developing a generic modular virtual laboratory framework that allows engineers, game designers, and developers to build lab experiments as serious games—games with ulterior motives rather than only entertainment—without writing additional code. A virtual lab serious game for civil engineering&#39;s soil mechanics course was created in Unity3D as a WebGL game, and it was tested within the framework by 24 students (12 from the Civil Engineering Department, the rest from computer science-related degrees). Seven faculty members evaluated if the serious game met the learning outcomes. In addition, nine engineers and designers assessed the framework&#39;s capabilities and analyzed its flexibility and reuse aspects. To analyze the usability and acceptability of the created game, standard questionnaires such as the technology acceptance model, system usability scale, and presence were employed. The study was done in two phases: participants tested the first version of the game, and the second version was built based on their feedback on the first version. The findings indicate that the modular structure has significant potential for use in a variety of fields and laboratory courses. The proposed game has received very positive feedback and can be considered a use case for the potential of games in interactive virtual laboratories.},

This article demonstrates the effectiveness of a VR-based surgical training simulator in laparoscopic surgery and investigates how stochastic modeling, represented as continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), can be used to explicit determine the training status of the surgeon. By comparing the training in real environments and in VR-based training simulators, the authors also explore the validity of the VR simulator in laparoscopic surgery.

  abstract     = {Academic misconduct stemming from file-sharing websites is an increasingly prevalent challenge in tertiary education, including information technology and engineering disciplines. Current plagiarism detection methods (e.g., text matching) are largely ineffective for combatting misconduct in programming and mathematics-based assessments. For these reasons, the development of an effective, automated monitoring tool would provide significant benefit in the struggle against misconduct. To address this challenge, this article reports an innovative software tool named AssignmentWatch which supports academic integrity by actively monitoring the upload of assessment content online, with a focus on file-sharing websites. This monitoring and alert notification system reduces the time burden on educators by automating the detection process. The design of AssignmentWatch focuses on early detection which enables educators to take early action. This could include preventative education or removal of content before it is utilized by students. Through this, AssignmentWatch can reduce incidents of misconduct. The software tool is open source and made freely available to the community. AssignmentWatch was validated under controlled conditions, followed by field testing in 30 assignments, across 16 subjects, and 5 higher education institutions. AssignmentWatch was found to effectively detect uploads on a variety of websites, generally within 24 h. In field testing, AssignmentWatch received positive feedback from educators with 8 out of 10 educators stating AssignmentWatch aided academic integrity and 7 out of 10 users stating AssignmentWatch helped identify assignment content online.},
