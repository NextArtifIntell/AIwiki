  abstract     = {For mega-constellation networks (MCNs), balancing network congestion and signaling overhead under high overloading is a critical challenge. This letter presents potential minimized path first (PMPF), a distributed potential-field-based routing policy where congestion notifications are selectively sent depending on their impact on network performance. The potential field effectively estimates the shortest path delay using ephemeris information and mimics the delay increase due to congestion with a concise potential model. With each satellite optimizing its routing decision based on potential minimization, signaling overhead is reduced by prioritizing the congestion notifications that significantly impact the potential. Also, routing stability is improved by updating the routing table only when it would significantly improve network performance. Simulation results show PMPF&#39;s potential to outperform a global state routing algorithm by up to 43% with less than 8% signaling messages, demonstrating its superior performance in joint scheduling among links.},

  abstract     = {There are various types of signals around us and recognizing the signals allows a network system to effectively and efficiently transmit from the sender to the receiver. Signals can be appropriately decoded by modulation classification for data integrity. However, traditional digital network systems require devices to share their signal data to a remote server for modulation classification, resulting in high communication overhead and data privacy concerns. Federated learning can help to solve these problems, but it still has some limitations. Existing works mostly consider homogeneous FL settings for modulation recognition with independent and identically distributed (IID) data distributions and equal contributions of clients in jointly training the global modulation model. Different from the literature, this paper studies a heterogeneous modulation recognition network problem using a new personalized federated learning approach. The proposed scheme allows clients with different data sizes, data points, and computational abilities to participate in the training process. The algorithm is then used to do the local model training and evaluate their performance. An adaptive dynamic global model aggregation is developed where the local model&#39;s gradient is updated based on their performance with available learning rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the state-of-the-art scheme, with an overall accuracy of 62.1% for non-IID data and 68.3% for IID data under varying signal-to-noise ratio settings.},

Particularly noteworthy is the recent introduction of the Sora model, a Transformer-based diffusion model, which exhibits exceptional performance in visual scenarios. However, diffusion vision transformer (DViT) models face limitations in terms of device resources, inference latency, and personalized requirements at the edge, despite their practical effectiveness in clouds. In response, we propose a DViT-enabled system to enhance vehicular metaverse services. Our approach involves a distributed DViT inference mechanism where road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles collaborate to execute the diffusion process and generate personalized content within vehicles using local prompts. Additionally, we address users&#39; latency-sensitive service demands by formulating a distributed latency optimization problem that considers bandwidth, computation power, and dynamic positioning of heterogeneous devices. We then propose a value iteration-based distributed inference algorithm capable of adaptively determining optimal inference strategies within resource-constrained vehicular networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in reducing latency and enhancing success rates for inference tasks.},

To harness the sparsity of the channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, we insert proximal mapping as a new layer into the deep network, which directly and explicitly produces well-regularized outputs. In particular, the layer is implemented by a trainable soft shrinkage function with a threshold vector, where the thresholds can be adapted by a dedicated sub-network. Moreover, we derive a mathematical expression for the proposed network and conduct a thorough analysis exploiting Bayesian philosophy, which provides valuable insights into the interpretability of neural networks.

Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing EE through the joint design of receiver weights and power control factors. To tackle this non-convex challenge, the alternating optimization method is employed, facilitating the development of low-complexity, closed-form algorithms. These algorithms leverage the generalized eigenvalue, quadratic transformation, and Lagrangian dual transformation techniques.

The encoder is very simple and only uses a single matrix-vector multiplication operation for realizing CSI compression, which greatly decreases the computation burden at the UE. The decoder module follows the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) principle and the attention mechanism is used to recover the CSI. A vector quantize layer is introduced which enables the encoder and decoder to be jointly trained from end-to-end.

  abstract     = {Mobile wireless sensing in communication networks has been well perceived as a technology tendency. By applying commercial communication infrastructures, advanced target (localization) sensing can be fulfilled. This is particularly feasible for 6G networks where the wireless nodes are evolving to be much denser, and new techniques such as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) emerge. In this context, short distance sensing remains challenging because the high-accurate wide-band sensing may be degraded due to the factors of severe fading, non-line-of-sight links, etc. To address this problem, we propose a sensing method based on received-signal-strength via assistance of IRS. By elaborately designing the beamforming vectors and amplifying power of the IRS, we purposely increase the path-loss fading exponent and hence efficiently obtain more accurate sensing performance. Besides, the proposed placement to deploy base-stations (reference points) can minimize the average sensing error considering the user uniformly random in a circular region, where a closed-form low-bound for sensing error is provided as theoretical reference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical studies.},

  abstract     = {The development of the extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) for the upcoming 6G technology indicates the significance of near-field communication. This work performs a near-field analysis to improve covertness when maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed with ELAA to send messages to the legitimate user. Specifically, we first derive the covertness constraint of the system by analyzing the beampattern. Based on this constraint, we introduce the concept of the vulnerable region, which is the region where covert communication is not achievable if a potential warden resides there. Furthermore, determining the vulnerable region involves deriving the range of distances by initially fixing the angle dimension, and then utilizing the covertness and the minimum effective throughput constraints to obtain the range of angle. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the determined vulnerable region in both distance and angle dimensions. As the azimuth angle or the distance between the legitimate user and the transmitter decreases, the area of the vulnerable region decreases. Additionally, increasing the number of warden&#39;s antennas or requiring a higher signal-to-noise ratio for legitimate user will expand the vulnerable region.},

In the proposed system, the transmitted symbols of each user are mapped to complex codewords which are randomly generated from a complex normal distribution, and the codewords overlap on sub-carriers in a non-orthogonal way for the sparsity. Subsequently, the real and imaginary parts of the resultant complex codewords are modulated by the chaotic signal and its Hilbert-transform version, respectively. At the receiver, after correlation demodulation, a deep learning-based decorder consisting of deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to recover the transmitted data. We also compare the SE, energy efficiency (EE), and complexity with benchmark systems. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance.

  abstract     = {The frequency coexistence between geostationary orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems is expected to be a promising approach for relieving spectrum scarcity. However, it is essential to manage mutual interference between GEO and LEO satellite systems for frequency coexistence. Specifically, in-line interference , caused by LEO satellites moving near the line-of-sight path between GEO satellite and GEO users (GUs), can significantly degrade GEO system throughput. This paper put forth a novel rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a super-common message for GEO-LEO coexisting satellite systems (CSS). By employing a super-common message that GUs can decode, GUs can mitigate the in-line interference by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Moreover, we formulate a traffic-aware throughput maximization (TTM) problem to satisfy the heterogeneous traffic demands of users by minimizing total unmet throughput demands (or user dissatisfaction). By doing so, the TTM precoder can be flexibly adjusted according to the interference leakage from LEO satellites to GUs and target traffic demands. Numerical results confirm that our proposed method ensures seamless connectivity even in the GEO-LEO in-line interference regime under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The dual-function base station communicates with the legitimate user and detects the sensing target simultaneously via active RIS, while the communication signal is intercepted by a potential eavesdropper (Eve). To achieve secure transmission, a novel successive interference cancellation scheme is proposed, where the sensing signal can disrupt the potential eavesdropping while keeping the legitimate user link intact. Then, the secure rate maximization problem is proposed, where the active beamforming of the RIS, the legitimate user&#39;s transmit beamforming, the Eve&#39;s transmit beamforming, and the radar receive beamforming are jointly optimized. However, the secure rate expression is non-convex, an iteration optimization algorithm based on majorization-minimization method and semi-definite programming are proposed to decompose the original problem into three sub-problems. Simulation results illustrate that the secrecy performance of the proposed scheme outperforms the passive RIS-assisted ISAC systems and the traditional cellular networks aided by active RIS.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical codebook-based beam training is gaining attention in near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple output (XL-MIMO) communications because it can significantly reduce the beam training overhead. However, most of the current beam training schemes are designed for near-field domain and do not consider more practical scenarios, i.e., hybrid near- and far-field communications. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient two-stage hybrid field beam training scheme based on rough beam sweeping and fine hierarchical codebook. In the first stage, we first modify the Rayleigh distance based on the beam gain, and a 3 dB spatial angle width is obtained by far-field beam sweeping with only some of the array antennas activated. The 3 dB spatial angle width is actually a rough angle range, which can be used to distinguish between near-field users (NUs) and far-field users (FUs). In the second stage, a fine hierarchical codebook is designed to further refine the beam training in the obtained polar coordinate domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in hybrid field and show that the proposed beam training method can achieve the performance of the near-field hierarchical codebook while significantly reducing the training overhead.},

Then, an integer partitions-aided TEPs generating criterion (GC) is proposed to generate the ordered TEPs in near-optimal. Further, by combining the weighted Hamming distance (WHD) estimation and the proposed TEPs GC, a stopping criterion is given to terminate the decoding when the most likely TEP is found. Comparing to the existing ordered statistics decoders (OSD) for RC coding schemes, simulation results show that the proposed OLD can achieve superior performance in terms of error-rate performance and decoding complexity.},

  abstract     = {Phase-modulated continuous-wave (PMCW) radar is one of the emerging technologies in various wide-band applications, such as automotive radars. Utilizing a one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver side can reduce the cost and power consumption of this kind of radar while leveraging its benefits. In this correspondence, we consider the joint design of the binary transmit code and the receive filter for PMCW radars in the presence of a one-bit ADC at the receiver. When using a one-bit ADC, noise samples play an essential role in the sidelobe increment of the filter output. Therefore, the mean-integrated sidelobe level (MEISL) metric is used as the design criterion to cover the effect of noise. Since the target backscattering coefficient ( $\alpha$ ) is unknown at the design stage, we resort to the worst-case approach concerning the target backscattering coefficient and cast a minimax problem. We demonstrate that the inner maximization problem has a closed-form solution. Indeed, we prove that the maximum value of MEISL for the fixed code and filter occurs at a real-valued $\alpha$ that relates to the minimum acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the radar system. Finally, by recasting the objective function, a cyclic optimization procedure is utilized, for which the filter optimization subproblem has a closed-form solution, and the code is optimized using the coordinate descent framework. Several numerical examples are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to some state-of-the-art methods, particularly in low-SNR scenarios.},

To alleviate the challenge of identifying the first-arriving path in ELM-based FS, a detection threshold is designed to perform a backward search in the output of ELM.

This paper proposes road-supervised FL (RSFL), which leverages road sensors&#39; perception results to annotate vehicle sensors&#39; data, providing a fresh perspective on data annotations for FLAD systems. To get deeper insights into RSFL, the information gain of annotating objects with road sensors is derived by leveraging the expected entropy reduction. Furthermore, a bug-aware sensor placement (BASP) algorithm is developed which strategically reduces (increases) the number of sensors in low (high) complexity scenarios. This is in contrast to traditional sensor placements where sensing coverage or road topology is the only consideration. It is shown that BASP approximately maximizes the information gain brought by road supervision. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed RSFL framework and BASP algorithm.},

Video captured by the built-in vehicle cameras must be streamed meeting a latency requirement of 5 ms with a 99% reliability. Although 5G offers high bandwidth, ultra-low latencies and high reliability; ToD service requirements are violated due to bad channel conditions. Ignoring the channel state may lead to over-estimating the number of ToD vehicles that can meet the service requirements, hence compromising the vehicle security. To fill this gap, in this letter we propose TOVAC, an algorithm that guarantees ToD service requirements by taking adequate admission control and routing decisions. This is achieved by using a channel-based capacity graph that determines the maximum number of vehicles that can be tele-operated in any road section. We evaluate TOVAC considering cellular deployments from Turin and show that, unlike a state of the art solution, TOVAC guarantees the ToD service requirements.},

In this paper, we investigate the mixed-resolution ADCs-based structure for the bistatic MIMO radar system as a trade-off between the system performance and cost, where the entire receive branch is quantized in either low or high resolution. In bistatic MIMO radar, the direction information, including the direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA), is a key factor for locating the targets. Thus, the effects of exploiting mixed ADCs on the estimation accuracy are first investigated by analyzing the constructed system model. Then, the generalized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) expression for the proposed scheme is derived, where the multiple target scenario is considered. Compared with the traditional and one-bit bistatic MIMO radar, the proposed scheme is a more effective and flexible solution. Furthermore, the selection of low-resolution quantized receive branches affects the DOA estimation performance, while the DOD estimation performance remains unaffected due to the entire receive branch quantization method. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme and derived CRB expression.},

In this work, we propose the concept of colored reconfigurable photodetector that generates tuples of colors each providing channel responses linearly independent among them in order to derive a novel transmission scheme referred to as colored blind interference alignment (cBIA). It gets rid of the closed-loop transmission while achieving multiplexing gain, i.e., cBIA achieves both low-latency, depending on the data packet size, and high data rates. The proposed cBIA achieves three times the DoF obtained by traditional non-colored blind interference alignment (BIA).

In this paper, we consider a scheme of the airship-assisted mmWave communication for HSR in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Furthermore, we introduce an optimal scheduling problem of maximizing the number of flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements between the airship and the train&#39;s mobile relays (MRs). To solve the above problem, we propose a MR selection algorithm to determine the number of MRs within the airship&#39;s coverage at every frame. Then we propose a max-flow scheduling algorithm based on the MR selection algorithm, which can increase the number of successfully scheduled flows by optimizing the scheduling order of the flows. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can effectively improve the number of successfully scheduled flows and bits. We also verify that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance with increasing the number of MRs.},

However, existing DDM-based Time-of-Arrival (TOA) localization methods overfit due to their dependence on the exact linear coefficients in the model or assume that the linear coefficients are the same in all paths. In response to the defect, we represent the linear coefficients in matrix form and resort to robust optimization. Subsequently, we construct a second-order cone (SOC) programming with the linear coefficients matrix. To obtain a tractable robust optimization problem, we first convert the SOC constraint to a semi-definite cone (SDC) constraint using the Schur complement. Then, we decompose the SDC constraint with auxiliary variables. For the nonconvexity introduced by the linear coefficients matrix, we use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and norm compatibility to eliminate the linear coefficients matrix. Finally, we convert a non-convex problem into a solvable semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. This study considers the linear coefficients as matrix variables, making the estimates accurate in densely cluttered environments and independent of precisely priori information about the linear coefficients. Simulations and experiments show better localization accuracy in complex environments than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL), through which mobile users (MUs) optimize a shared model without revealing the private raw data, has opened up possibilities for mobile crowdsensing (MCS). However, challenges for the MCS system with FL still exist in terms of an incentive mechanism for selecting suitable MUs to participate in and motivating MUs to contribute to model training. Our objective is to design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the overall quality of model training and improves communication efficiency while operating within a limited budget. This paper addresses a practical scenario where we lack information about the quality of MUs&#39; local training and their computation and communication capacities. Due to lacking information on MUs, we propose a novel approach that formulates the MU selection problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model. Then, we propose an effective incentive scheme combining reverse auction and discounted upper confidence bound (UCB) to incentivize the MUs to participate in the FL training process. Moreover, the proposed incentive scheme improves learning performance and reduces the FL latency by jointly selecting suitable MUs in terms of the local model quality and reputation of latency. We also prove that the proposed incentive scheme provides truthfulness, individual rationality and computationally efficiency. Compared with the existing schemes, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed incentive scheme can promote the quality of model aggregation and enhance communication efficiency in FL.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing in Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) is an essential road service that assists vehicle driving and promotes intelligent transportation applications. In VSNs, vehicles regularly collect and upload valuable data to share with other vehicles. Data encryption can be employed during data uploading and sharing to prevent malicious tampering and privacy disclosure. However, existing data-sharing schemes lack security, have high overhead in obtaining decrypted data, and show low trust in the central authority controlling the entire network. To facilitate data sharing in VSNs, this paper proposes a new scheme using consortium blockchain to realize secure data sharing. Nodes in the blockchain invoke smart contracts and implement the location-based Speculative Byzantine Fault Tolerance (LSBFT) to accomplish data-sharing transactions among vehicles. The scheme not only ensures the security of vehicle information but also protects the privacy of the shared data. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist attacks and has shown transaction fairness, data confidentiality, non-repudiation, and traceability. Simulation results show that the scheme has higher sharing efficiency and less time to reach a consensus in the data storage process.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally, direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of coherent signals relies on pre-processing approaches to eliminate the rank loss of the signal covariance matrix (SCM). However, almost all existing methods utilize the empirical covariance matrix (ECM) as a practical approximation of the SCM, and can not make full use of the information in received signals. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-aided estimation of signal parameters via the rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) algorithm for DoA estimation in coherent scenarios. Specifically, a dual-stream reconstruction network (DsRNet) is proposed for reconstructing the full-rank SCM directly from received signals, which overcomes the fundamental dependence on the ECM and exploits all available information in received signals. Next, the logarithmic eigenvalue-aided deep residual network (LogDRNet) is proposed for the source number detection, which improves the efficiency of network training and the detection performance, especially with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limited number of snapshots. Subsequently, we determine the signal subspace using the source number estimated by the LogDRNet and estimate the DoA referring to the ESPRIT algorithm. The proposed deep learning-based framework replaces some crucial aspects of traditional algorithms with customized neural networks, which mitigates the dependence on ideal model assumptions, does not require taking the source number as a prior and improves the estimation performance. Simulation results show that the proposed method not only performs better than existing methods in source number detection and DoA estimation, but also shows superior robustness to various kinds of array imperfections that are widespread in practical systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of joint time-of-arrival and two-dimensional direction-of-arrival (TOA/2D-DOA) estimation is solved using space-frequency nested array (SFNA) motion. SFNA is developed by incorporating the linear nested array structure and the frequency offset set generated by nested sampling, aiming to save on physical costs and computational resources. Additionally, a SFNA-based vertical movement strategy is proposed, which transforms the TOA/2D-DOA joint estimation into TOA/1D angle joint estimation and the other 1D angle estimation, significantly alleviating the enormous computational burden brought by 3D parameters joint estimation. Meanwhile, this strategy further reduces the number of sensors required, as it only needs a linear array to achieve 2D-DOA estimation. Based on the cross-covariance matrix of the novel signal model, the sparse iterative covariance-based estimation (SPICE) algorithm is applied to the TOA/1D angle joint estimation. However, the SPICE algorithm necessitates grid search, and its estimation accuracy degrades when the parameter values are not on the grids. Therefore, an improved SPICE (ISPICE) algorithm is proposed for off-grid TOA/1D angle joint estimation. Simultaneously, Euclidean distance-based grid estimation algorithm (EDGE) is developed to achieve accurate estimation of the other 1D angle. Multiple simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Connected vehicular cloud computing applies cloud computing to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which can provide road condition monitoring services for intelligent transportation systems. However, it brings new security and efficiency challenges to VANETs. Specifically, malicious vehicles may impersonate legitimate vehicles to tamper with or forge road conditions. Cloud servers are not fully trusted entities, the vehicle information, driver information, as well as road conditions uploaded to the cloud may be leaked to an unauthorized party. Moreover, small devices such as on-board units and roadside units have limited computational resources, and thus require light-weight security mechanisms. To address these challenges, this article proposes a blockchain-assisted road condition monitoring scheme with privacy-preserving. It prevents the leakage of sensitive vehicle identity with pseudonyms, protects the privacy of road conditions through encryption, identifies malicious vehicle impersonation attacks with source authentication, and detects dishonest behaviors of cloud servers with blockchain supervision. Our scheme does not rely on expensive bilinear pairing operations, which significantly reduces the computational overheads. Security analysis shows that our proposal can provide unforgeability of authentication request/response, privacy of road conditions, resistance to reply attacks, anonymity of vehicle, and traceability of malicious vehicles.

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled wireless communication system where a rotary-wing UAV is dispatched as the mobile data collector for multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the mission completion time, UAV trajectory, and communication scheduling of the SNs. This will be achieved while ensuring that the minimum throughput requirements of all SNs involved in the system are satisfied. It has been demonstrated that the formulated problem exhibits non-convexity, compounded by the uncertainty in mission completion time. Therefore, current convex optimization techniques or traditional time discretization methods are insufficient for effectively addressing this problem. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a fly-hover-fly scheme that leverages the UAVs ability to swiftly move between points of interest and maintain stationary positions for data collection. We introduce a well-designed hovering location selection algorithm to ensure coverage of all SNs while minimizing the number of required hovering locations. As a result, the original problem is segmented into several tractable subproblems. Leveraging the fly-hover-fly trajectory solution, we further develop a waypoint adjustment scheme that progressively refines the UAVs hovering locations through successive convex approximation technique.

Effective resource allocation emerges as a pivotal concern for such networks. This paper addresses the data allocation issue for FSO backhaul from the HAP to multiple UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) under the constraints of ground users&#39; requested data rates. We introduce frame allocation schemes (FAS), including rate adaptation with constraints (RAC)- and rate/power adaptation (RPA)-aided FAS. The key idea of these schemes is to allocate data frames effectively based on UAV&#39;s turbulence channel conditions, which aims to (i) guarantee the quality of services (QoS), (ii) retain both latency and throughput fairness, and (iii) minimize the transmitted power. Furthermore, the performance of these schemes is also analyzed under the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We newly derive the channel probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF), considering the imperfect CSI due to channel estimation and quantization errors. Capitalizing on the derived PDF and CDF, different performance metrics are analytically obtained, incorporating combined effects of cloud coverage, transceiver misalignment, Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ turbulence, and angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design proposals over the state-of-the-art. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the analysis.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular edge computing environment, massive computation-intensive tasks would be produced from diverse vehicular applications. Data scheduling among vehicles and roadside units(RSUs) is a fundamental issue in timely processing those tasks. However, the task heterogeneity with different computation resource requirements and delay constraints, the distinct capacities of vehicles and RSUs, and the stochastic task arrival, pose significant challenges in realizing efficient data scheduling. The existing literature ignores the multi-core feature of both vehicles and RSUs in data scheduling, which may lead to an inefficient resource usage. To cope with these challenges, in this paper, we first construct a multi-queue multi-block model for heterogeneous task oriented data caching on both vehicle and RSU sides. By fully utilizing the multi-core features of both vehicles and RSUs, a fine-grained offloading model is then developed, involving the association between data blocks and computing cores, and the allocation of computation and communication resources. After that, a long-term loss minimization problem is formulated to facilitate data processing. We leverage the Markov decision process (MDP) to model the optimization problem, which is then solved by our proposed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based association mapping and resource allocation algorithm (D-AMRA). In D-AMRA, an action transformation method is proposed to map the outputs of DDPG to the form of optimization variables. Eventually, extensive simulations with comparative benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed D-AMRA.},

For downlink process, to address the joint trajectory and power optimization problem, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework is utilized, follows a centralized training and distributed execution framework. During the centralized training process, experiences of each agent interacting with the environment are stored in an experience replay pool and then used to train the soft actor-critic network. This process is conducted on the high altitude platforms (HAP) to alleviate the burden of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). During the distributed execution process, each UAV uses the trained actor network to output actions based on observations and adjust its flight position and transmission power for joint service provision. To update the parameters of the soft actor-critic network, an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is proposed.

Secondly, prior information is utilized to calibrate the iterative process of SGMD, enhancing robustness and effectiveness in signal reconstruction and noise separation. Moreover, the model enriches global relations and representation capability of information in high-noise backgrounds by approximating the local relationships of the signal covariance matrix in the Riemannian space, which leads to improved performance in solving nonlinear problems. Consequently, the subarray positioning accuracy is enhanced to satisfy the requirements for achieving full-phase coherence in mobile DCAR systems. This ensures the attainment of the desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain by the system. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ISGMD-TSELM method effectively filters out background noise and feature redundancy in the received signals. When the SNR is −6 dB, the algorithm guarantees a coherent synthesis efficiency of over 70% for the system.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow is considered as a critical feature of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Accurately forecasting future vehicular volumes is an effective means of mitigating traffic congestion. However, the nonlinear and complex traffic flow characteristics make the traditional approaches unable to achieve satisfactory prediction performance. Although existing methods based on deep learning models have improved the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, the spatio-temporal features of traffic flow data are still not fully explored. Moreover, existing methods pay little attention to the task of training models in a decentralized environment where data are distributed across multiple clients. To solve the problems mentioned above, we propose a novel network model called Graph Transformer Attention Network (GTAN) for traffic flow prediction, which can effectively extract traffic flow&#39;s temporal and spatial characteristics by considering all node locations&#39; information in the traffic networks. Then, we propose a training strategy called Graph Federated Meta-learning (FedGM), solving the problem of topological heterogeneity by combining meta-learning and federated learning, to achieve an optimal initialization model which can quickly adapt to different traffic networks under low communication cost. Finally, the experimental results on a real data set show that the GTAN model has better prediction performance and faster meta-training speed. The model trained by FedGM can quickly adapt to different graph-structured data and achieve high accuracy.},

However, it is highly challenging to design information dissemination mechanisms due to the heterogeneity and interactive characteristics of cyber-physical interacting networks (CPINs). In addition, the stochasticity of information forwarding and forgetting over these networks has further aggravated this situation. In this paper, we propose a temporal point process based method to address information dissemination over CPINs. We first construct a CPIN model to capture the heterogeneity and interactive characteristics of physical and cyber networks. We then build a temporal point process based information dissemination model (TPP-IDM) to characterize the stochastic evolution of information dissemination over CPINs. This model captures the dynamic stochastic nature of the information dissemination accurately over time by computing the probability distribution of the sizes of information dissemination over CPINs, which greatly reduces the bias caused by the traditional deterministic solutions. Furthermore, we develop an intensity learning based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE-IL) method to improve the prediction accuracy of TPP-IDM by learning the most appropriate intensities. Finally, experimental results show that our method can predict the size of information dissemination over CPINs more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Aeronautical Ad hoc Networks (AANETs) have been identified as pivotal constituents of the Next Generation Wireless Communication Network (NGWCN), courtesy of their ability to facilitate global coverage and low-latency network services. However, in contrast with terrestrial networks, large-scale AANETs exhibit distinct characteristics of high dynamics, which impose considerable challenges to global state synchronization for computing routing paths. For suppressing synchronization overhead, we consider partial-observable network state to make routing decisions. Specifically, we formulate the multi-flow routing problem as a non-cooperative Multi-Player Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MP-POMDP) game, in which each flow acting as a player aims to maximize its own transmission bandwidth, while consciously avoiding conflicts with bandwidth already occupied by other flows. To tackle the high-dimensional state space of the proposed MP-POMDP game, we employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to develop a novel Distributed Game based Multi-flow Routing (DGMR) algorithm by utilizing a parallel multi-agent scheme. In DGMR, each flow is equipped with an agent for routing selection and the agent will move along the routing path and utilize the recently observed states to make the next-hop routing decision. Moreover, to provide fixed-size inputs for neural networks, a Pareto-based Optimal Neighbor Selection (PONS) algorithm based on Pareto optimality theory is proposed to filter out a fixed number of neighbors from variable neighbor sets of aircraft. The selected neighbors are proximal to the destination and have sufficient available bandwidth resources, which guarantee high-quality routing decisions. The experimental results show that DGMR has high scalability and achieves up to ten times of bandwidth utilization than the benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Precise localization technology promotes many modern applications, including automatic driving, navigation and so on. The ultra-wideband technology (UWB) is a promising localization method due to its high-precision and low power consumption. During its localization, a proper anchor deployment can not only improve localization accuracy, but also enhance resistance to interferences. In the current researches, the deployment of UWB anchor nodes is optimized by minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). However, it ignores non-line-of-sight (NLoS) interference caused by fixed obstacles and high-precision requirements in a specific region. Hence, we propose a comprehensive solution to search for the optimal deployment of UWB anchors under LoS or mixed LoS/NLoS propagations, and consider the diverse demands on UWB localization precision. Firstly, the integral of the localization mean square errors (MSEs) is derived by Gaussian approximation in mixed LoS/NLoS scenarios. Secondly, region of interest (ROI) and dimension of interest (DOI) are further taken into account and the localization performance with respect to anchor deployment is presented numerically. Finally, a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based optimal anchor deployment searching algorithm is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed optimal deployment of anchors outperforms three other typical anchor deployment schemes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed anchor deployment optimization is verified in our UWB test platform. Compared with three other deployments, its localization performance is improved by 83.3%, 41.8% and 40.7%, in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) in the mixed LoS/NLoS scenarios with a fixed obstacle.},

However, existing research in target tracking primarily focuses on enhancing tracking accuracy, which struggles to adapt to tasks considering strict time constraints and energy consumption. To address these issues, this paper introduces a model-based reinforcement learning tracking strategy (MRLTS) for the UAV to minimize control costs and achieve user-specified tracking performance, including a two-stage design. In the first stage, a steady-state robust tracking controller is developed based on available model knowledge that forces the UAV to asymptotically approximate a predefined observation path in spite of uncertainties. In the second stage, an intelligent component based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is customized to empower the UAV to strike a trade-off between prescribed tracking performance and energy consumption, wherein a skilled barrier function is constructed to interpret specified time constraints. The proposed paradigm can provide a higher sampling efficiency than SAC-based strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our strategy outperforms benchmarks and results in a 46.3% cost-effectiveness improvement at least.},

  abstract     = {The LEO satellite data center (LSDC) is becoming a key application paradigm for the future satellite Internet with global information fusion, which consists of numerous satellite storage nodes forming distributed storage systems. Satellite on-board disks inevitably fail due to space radiation and battery depletion, resulting in data loss. Erasure coding (EC) can guarantee data reliability at the expense of heavy repair traffic. To mitigate this challenge, multiple repair data flows can be aggregated progressively into a single data flow during transmission. In this paper, we employ storage-transmission integration to LSDC and propose the erasure coding aggregation repair (ECAR). Firstly, ECAR models repair data flows in LSDC as a staged tree graph, called multi-weight path tree (MWPT). The edge weights in MWPT are metricized by multiple factors affecting the repair performance, including transmission time, propagation delay and energy cost. Then, we give a delay-sensitive energy-efficient MWPT (DE-MWPT) construction method for single stripe repair, which reduces the energy cost while guaranteeing the minimum repair delay. We also propose the pipeline erasure coding aggregation repair (PECAR) for multiple stripe repair, which further reduces the repair delay by decentralizing the stripe synchronization process to aggregation nodes. Finally, we design a storage-transmission integrated simulation platform for LSDC and deploy the prototype of MWPT in it. The experimental results show that DE-MWPT can reduce the repair delay by 7.3% and energy cost by 6% compared with the existing aggregation repair policies, while PECAR can further reduce the repair delay by 43.9% compared to ECAR.},

However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, it is difficult to avoid the presence of eavesdroppering in the networks, which can severely influence the users privacy protection between users and UAVs. In order to enhance the communication security of the networks while reducing system latency, this paper considers a dual UAV-assisted edge computing system that contains two UAVs: one UAV acts as an MEC server to process users&#39; offloaded computation tasks, and the other multi-role UAV can function as a jammer or a relay, which depends on the users&#39; expectations, to improve communication security and reduce system latency. However, due to the variables coupling and inconsistency in user preferences for UAV functionalities, the jointly optimization of UAV trajectories, computation resource allocation, and multi-role UAV&#39;s functionality switching is challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes Distributed UAV Functionality Switching and Trajectory Design (DUFST) algorithm, which utilizes block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to decouple the variables. Then, DUFST adopts the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to tackle the problem of inconsistent user preferences for UAV functionality selection. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of this algorithm, which outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of performance.},

Joint optimization of coverage and energy, however, remains understudied, especially in the scenario of 5G and beyond, i.e., extended wireless coverage with limited onboard energy. In this article, we propose a novel approach to optimizing the configuration of a team of UAVs to cover an arbitrary 3-D surface, including their transmit power, 3-D locations, and number. Here, the discussed problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), whose goal is to simultaneously maximize visual coverage (VC) and minimize energy consumption (EC). To optimally solve this MOP, we analy-tically derive the closed-form expression of VC and maximize VC by jointly optimizing the transmit power and 3-D location of a UAV. The transmit power and 3-D location of a UAV are further updated by minimizing the EC arising from aerial movement and wireless transmission. Given the optimized VC and EC of an individual UAV, the optimal number of UAVs is obtained by finding the best tradeoff between minimum VC and total EC, subject to a given set of constraints on transmit power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, outage probabilities, sensing distances, and onb-oard energy. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing that energy efficiency (EE) remains high with an extended coverage area.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of taxi service demand and supply is essential for improving customer experience and provider&#39;s profit. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), modeling city areas as nodes in a transportation graph, have been shown efficient for this application as they utilize both local node features and the graph structure in the prediction. Still, further improvement can be achieved by either simultaneously exploiting different types of nodes/edges in the graphs or enlarging the scale of the transportation graph. However, both alternatives are challenged by the scalability of GNNs. An immediate remedy to the scalability challenge is to decentralize the GNN operation. In return, as shown by our theoretical analysis and experimentation, this creates prohibitively excessive node-to-node communication. In this paper, we first propose a heterogeneous GNN-LSTM algorithm for improved taxi-level demand and supply forecasting utilizing several edge types in the graph. Then, to enable the large-scale application of this approach, we propose a semi-decentralized GNN inference approach that achieves scalability at minimized communication and computation overheads. This is achieved by utilizing multiple cloudlets; data centers with moderate computation and communication capabilities that can fit at cellular base stations. Extensive experiments over real data show the advantage of the proposed GNN-LSTM algorithm in improving prediction accuracy, and the ability of the proposed semi-decentralized GNN approach in reducing the overall inference time by about an order of magnitude compared to centralized and decentralized inference schemes.},

To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.},

Subsequently, intrusion detection systems are mainly studied to detect masquerade attack attempts. However, existing research cannot detect certain masquerade attack attempts that use periodic and event messages, ultimately resulting in low detection rates. In this paper, we propose an acceptance filter-based intrusion detection system called PE-detector, which is able to detect a variety of masquerade attack types on the controller area network (CAN) bus including periodic and event message-based masquerade attacks with 100% accuracy when all ECUs are able to receive and transmit CAN messages from the CAN bus. If an arbitrary ECU cannot participate in CAN communications due to a DoS attack, PE-detector cannot detect a masquerade attack impersonating the corresponding node, but it is able to detect abnormal patterns of CAN bus caused by the DoS attack. In addition, since PE-detector is able to be added to the CAN bus as a dongle-type ECU board, no hardware changes to legacy ECUs are required. The proof-of-concept for PE-detector has been validated in a real vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) is a promising solution to alleviate the burden of communication infrastructure. However, few works have been done to theoretically analyze the system performance, especially for the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) assisted vehicular network, where vehicle users (VUs) can request contents from either the UAV or other VUs that the UAV has successfully served. We first consider the single hot-spot scenario and analyze the system performance in terms of the VU&#39;s successful service probability (SSP). Then we extend our analysis to the multi-hot-spot scenario where the hot-spots merge and split due to VU mobility. For this scenario, the SSP and the average number of successfully served VUs (SSVs) are theoretically derived, based on which a UAV&#39;s 3D position deployment problem is formulated. Due to the complicated formulation of SSP and the dynamic environment including hot-spot distribution and UAV&#39;s battery state, the closed-formed solutions to the UAV&#39;s deployment are intractable. To obtain the sub-optimal positions of the UAV, the proposed problem is reformulated into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, and a pre-trained deep Q-network (DQN) based scheme is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme achieves a high number of successfully served users with moderate energy consumption.},

The rapidly developing field of VEC transfers computationally demanding activities to a nearby VEC server, allowing real-time applications for vehicles. Conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are inadequate for addressing privacy concerns when outsourcing sensitive data activities. This work introduces an asynchronous federated deep reinforcement learning (AFDRL) approach for task offloading techniques to maximize computation rate while ensuring queue stability and data privacy. To tackle the issue, our research examines computation and queue models for executing tasks at the vehicle or roadside unit (RSU). We introduce a Lyapunov-enhanced deep reinforcement learning approach to address the optimization issue. The outcomes of the simulation show that our proposed approach may significantly improve the computation rate and maintain queue stability in the context of task outsourcing issues, as compared to several baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multiuser detection (MUD) is a critical aspect for the emerging sixth generation (6G) networks. Accurate and efficient recovery of users from vast amounts of data is the key aspect for massive machine-type communications (mMTC). Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) has been recognized as a suitable multiple access technique for mMTC scenarios. Leveraging the inherent sparsity poverty of mMTC combining with GF-NOMA, MUD can be recast as a compressive sensing (CS) problem. However, the existing schemes are facing the challenge of limited accuracy and high computational complexity. In this paper, we first focus on the study of joint channel estimation (CE) and MUD under the single measurement vectors (SMV) model, where a novel approach using spike-and-slab priors with Gibbs sampling (SS-GS) is proposed to solve the MUD problem. To exploit the structural sparsity and improve the recovery performance, we also devise a truncated spike-and-slab priors with Gibbs sampling approach (TSS-GS) under the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) model to retrieving transmitted signals through the channel. The MMV model is transformed into a new model to better exploit signal sparsity. We compare the performance of the proposed methods with traditional detectors. Extensive simulation experiments and analysis are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and efficiency.},

This is equivalent to introducing additional artificial noise at the eavesdropper. To characterize system performance, the channel correlation is first considered, then we propose a valid method to model the distribution of composite instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of eavesdropper as the tractable exponential distribution. Furthermore, we drive the close-form expressions for both the joint probability density function (PDF) of channel and the average SNR at the eavesdropper. Based on above results, we deduce the close-form expressions of average security capacity with AS and 4-WFRFT technologies. To obtain further insights, we also derive the theoretical expressions of secrecy outage probability. The analysis results show that AS and 4-WFRFT technologies exist to simultaneously increase the average security capacity and then decrease the secrecy outage probability. The numerical results illustrate that: 1) 4-WFRF technology can validly eliminate the impact of channel correlation due to introducing the artificial noise; 2) the secrecy performance of system can be improved remarkably by employing AS and 4-WFRFT technologies.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid Intelligent Reflecting/Refracting Surfaces (HIRS) offer a promising solution to the limitations faced by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) in high-frequency bands, owing to their versatile utilization of reflective and refractive techniques across indoor and outdoor surfaces. This paper investigates a hierarchical beam-sweeping (HBS) approach tailored for HIRS-assisted millimeter-wave networks, aiming to pinpoint user locations with reduced overhead. However, the HBS method typically entails numerous coarse steps for user identification, primarily due to its initial exploration starting with broader beam widths at the lowest detectable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), gradually narrowing down with increasing SNR. Such a process raises concerns about inadequate time for user discovery within HIRS coverage and available maximum beam search time. To mitigate this, we propose a novel method to optimize beam width allocation at the outset of beam searching, prioritizing maximum SNR for all users in the initial step to avoid multiple steps of HBS. Through extensive simulations and analyses across varied indoor and outdoor environments, encompassing diverse user counts and coverage distances, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in enhancing network performance. By dynamically adjusting beam widths, our method adeptly accommodates the requirements of diverse indoor and outdoor environments within the allocated maximum beam searching time.},

The backscatter communication (BackCom) and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) techniques can achieve low-power transmission while implementing effective beamforming. Thus, this paper leverages these two techniques into V2I communication systems, where multiple IRSs transmit roadside information to a multi-antenna vehicle by backscattering the vehicle&#39;s signals. Considering the self-interference and two optimization methods at the vehicle, i.e., post-detection (PD) and integrated detection (ID), we formulate two weighted sum-rate maximization problems. The detection matrix and transmit power at the vehicle, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients, are jointly designed based on an alternating algorithm. The simulation results validate the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm, the feasibility of the introduced system model, and the effectiveness of the optimization scheme.},

The sparsity-aware designs have been extensively investigated. In contrast, the VP-DAE+PLL schemes received very little attention. Under harsh channel conditions, e.g., communication channels among moving unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), it is necessary to employ dynamic parameters so as to achieve robust performance. In this paper, we propose a new VP-DAE+PLL scheme in which the VP is achieved via a recursive Gaussian-Newton (RGN) algorithm instead of conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. At-sea experimental results are provided to verify the advantages of the proposed RGN-VP-DAE+PLL scheme. It showed the proposed scheme achieves better performance than existing SGD-based VP-DAE+PLL schemes with a slight complexity overhead. Moreover, it is less sensitive to initial parameter setting.},

But the random mobility and low cost of the devices yield time delay and frequency offset between the devices and the BS, which will significantly reduce the performance of the JADCE. Towards this end, we design a chirp index modulation-based pilot sequence (CIM-PS), and analyze its auto-correlation and cross-correlation features under time delay and frequency offset. In order to fulfill the JADCE for the asynchronous massive access under time delay and frequency offset, we formulate the JADCE as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem with the help of the CIM-PS, and then propose a covariance-based coordinate descent algorithm with the least squares channel estimation (CD-LS) to solve it. Simulation results and analysis show that the designed CIM-PS is more robust to time delay and frequency offset than the random Gaussian sequences. Compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed CD-LS algorithm can achieve the same DEP performance with less antennas in the presence of only time delay and a lower computation complexity of searching frequency offset. In scenarios where both time delay and frequency offset exist, CD-LS can still achieve a good DEP and channel estimation performance.},

Utilizing High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPSs) as aerial base stations, 6G facilitates low-latency internet access. However, the exponential growth in terrestrial wireless devices puts a strain on the available frequency bands shared by terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Therefore, in this research, we aim to optimize the resources between HAPS-to-satellite and HAPS-to-terrestrial uplinks. One challenge that arises is the interference caused by simultaneous uplink and downlink transmissions, especially from uplink back lobes disrupting ground user downlinks. To mitigate this interference, current methods like the Zero-Forcing (ZF) proposed a technique to steer nulls toward ground users. However, current methods randomly allocate limited nulls, potentially leaving many users outside null zones and experiencing interference. To address this issue, we propose a solution to design null directivity based on user locations. This is achieved by creating a codebook of antenna patterns that are linked to weight matrices. Selecting suitable antenna patterns from the codebook and adjusting weight matrices accordingly enables null formation at positions that maximize user communication satisfaction. Numerical analysis confirms the effectiveness of this approach, showing increased user satisfaction compared to existing methods.},

This paper proposes a novel STBC-SM technique that temporally permutates signals of STBC blocks, allowing for increased data rate by selecting different permutation patterns. The proposed technique, temporal permutations in distinct accumulated blocks (TP-DAB), can be applied to existing STBC-SM schemes to enhance spectral efficiency. We first propose a systematic method to generate permutation patterns of TP-DAB for various numbers of different blocks. Subsequently, we design examples using the obtained permutation patterns. Besides, we propose a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) detector with significantly lower complexity than the original ML receiver. In addition to the benefit of bandwidth efficiency, analytical bounds and computer simulations demonstrate that STBC-SM systems using TP-DAB provide better error performance than the original system.},

The existing phase quantization (PQ) algorithm at the relay has limitations in capturing the amplitude differences of received signals, leading to performance saturation with increasing quantization bits. To address these limitations, we propose a novel relay algorithm, amplitude-phase quantization (APQ), which quantizes both the phase and the amplitude. Moreover, we introduce neural networks into the relay process, resulting in PQ with neural networks (PQNN) and APQ with neural networks (APQNN), which is expected to further improve system performance at the expense of additional computational load at the relay. We also propose a sub-message one-hot encoding method and a retraining approach for the worst-performing sub-message to reduce computational complexity and improve performance in autoencoder-based systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the autoencoder-based QF relay system, with various relay algorithms and the sub-message one-hot encoding method, achieves excellent performance with reduced memory usage at the relay and significantly reduced complexity at the source and destination.},

  abstract     = {Relative direction estimation among neighboring vehicles in urban environments is essential to a wide variety of driving safety applications. To obtain accurate direction information solely from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is desirable but very challenging due to enormous multipath effects. In this paper, we propose an online cross-domain vehicular relative direction estimation method, called DeepAoA+, based on a domain adaptive deep learning method. More specifically, the channel state information (CSI) is estimated from a set of synchronized receiving radios at a receiver vehicle. By taking the CSI phase difference between a pair of such radios, CSI phase errors in the baseband can be effectively eliminated, which makes a compelling feature to represent the direction of incident radio frequency (RF) signals and the dynamic channel characteristics. Moreover, to conquer the non- i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) problem caused by dynamic environments, DeepAoA+ discovers latent domains in the CSI phase difference dataset. For each identified domain, a domain-specific model is trained to estimate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of incoming signals. To this end, a framework based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to obtain domain partitions considering downstream AoA estimation tasks. Furthermore, a pre-training technique is used to enhance the robustness of AoA estimation with misclassified test samples. We implement a prototype of DeepAoA+, using four synchronized Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) from various scenarios, and conduct extensive real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that DeepAoA+ can achieve the best AoA estimation with low latency.},

We aim to track a single-antenna mobile station (MS) based on well-known pilots broadcast from a multiple-antenna base station (BS). We have a particular interest in the practical scenario where the MS and BS are equipped with hardware-impaired transceivers that distort the pilots. To this end, the extended Kalman-filter-based tracker ( EKFT ) and the unscented Kalman-filter-based tracker ( UKFT ) are proposed to accomplish the tracking process. We pay special attention in its design to the accuracy degradation caused by these hardware impairments (HWIs) as well as to the MS transition uncertainty. Afterwards, this work derives the performance analysis in the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) term, which considers the information conveyed by the distorted pilot and the transition uncertainty model. Moreover, this analysis is not only for assessment purposes but also for EKFT and UKFT design. Furthermore, this work enhances the tracking accuracy by adopting the Monte Carlo (MC) approach. Lastly, extensive computer simulation is conducted for a comprehensive discussion of the proposed tracker&#39;s performance and the related theoretical bound. The results present the harmful impact of HWIs, non-line of sight paths reflected of unknown scatterers, and clock offset on the tracking process and the capabilities of the proposed trackers in improving tracking accuracy.},

We utilize the trace of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), equivalently, the average Fisher information, as the estimation accuracy metric, and obtain its closed form expression for the intended receiver and the eavesdropper. Accordingly, the joint RIS phase profile and power allocation problem is formulated, and it is solved via alternating optimization. When the power allocation matrix is fixed during alternating optimization, the optimal RIS phase profile design problem is formulated as a non-convex problem and it is solved via semidefinite relaxation and rank reduction. When the RIS phase profile is fixed, a linear programming formulation is obtained for optimal power allocation. Via simulations, the effects of RIS phase design and power allocation are illustrated individually and jointly. Moreover, extensions are provided by considering the presence of line of sight paths in the environment and the availability of RIS elements with adjustable magnitudes.},

  abstract     = {Recently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication have attracted considerable attention owing to their advantages in terms of high data rates, low latency, and seamless coverage. However, mmWave-UAV communication performance is significantly compromised by the mmWave molecular absorption and UAV movement, resulting in a drastic deterioration in the performance and even potential disruptions in communication links. In this study, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) mmWave-assisted UAV communication system that considers both mmWave molecular absorption and UAV movement. We utilize the Nakagami- $m$ distribution to model the fading of the mmWave link, and a 3D cylindrical region model to depict the mobility of the UAV. To comprehensively characterize the random movement of the UAV, the proposed system incorporates distribution models in both horizontal and vertical directions. Furthermore, the cumulative distribution and probability density functions of the signal-to-noise ratio for the proposed system are derived. We also derive closed-form and asymptotic expressions of outage probability, average bit error rate, and ergodic capacity. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the derived expressions. The results show that the extension of the cylindrical region and the increase in mmWave molecular absorption lead to a decrease in the performance of the mmWave-assisted UAV communication system. In addition, the diversity order for the system is obtained to gain further insight. It is demonstrated that the diversity order is affected by the Nakagami fading parameter, the molecular absorption coefficient, and the height and radius of the cylinder.},

  abstract     = {In practical applications, the main beam direction of massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) transmitters varies with the user&#39;s location. However, different directions will result in different distortions in mMIMO transmitters, and this poses a big challenge to digital pre-distortion (DPD). This paper first analyzes the relationship between direction configuration and main beam distortion in the fully-connected hybrid beamforming (FC-HBF) transmitters. In order to transmit the signal correctly under dynamic directions, two DPD models using heterogeneous neural networks (HNNs) based on vector decomposition (VD) and block-oriented (BO) structure, called HNN-VD and HNN-BO, respectively, have been proposed. The direction information is used directly as the input of HNNs. Then, a gating-based neural network model is proposed called direction adaptive neural network (DANN), which is composed of a gating network and a backbone network, and its core idea is to dynamically adjust the hidden layer features of the backbone network by utilizing direction information through the gating network. The simulation indicates that all of the proposed models exhibit good performance, but DANN has the best performance and low complexity among models, which provides a good digital pre-distortion scheme for FC-HBF transmitters under dynamic directions.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input single-output multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network operating in the terahertz band subject to co-channel interference (CCI). The IRS is examined under various configurations: i) IRS partitioning with discrete phase shifts, ii) IRS with random phase shifts, and iii) IRS with discrete phase shifts for one user and random phase shifts for the remaining users. It aims to assess the impacts of various factors, including beam misalignment, imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), CCI, phase quantization errors, and random phase shifts. Thus, it derives accurate expressions for the ergodic rate, outage probability and diversity order, which are verified via numerical and simulation results. The results show that the impacts of beam misalignment and imperfect SIC are more dominant compared to those resulting from random phase shifts, phase quantization errors and CCI. Despite achieving lower performance compared to the discrete phase shifting scheme, the random phase shifting scheme can be a promising candidate for multi-user NOMA, as it avoids the costly channel estimation and computational complexity that are proportional to the numbers of IRS elements and users. The results also reveal that partitioning the IRS under discrete phase shifts outperforms a combination of discrete and random phase shifts. The system performance in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime is also analyzed, which shows that the performance reaches a limit due to inter-user interference and CCI.},

In this paper, we analyze the spatial consistency of multi-users for RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems and classify users in each user group into two kinds, namely one central user (CUE) and several adjacent users (AUE). We propose an innovative two-phase multi-user joint parameter estimation (MJPE) scheme. In the first phase, we analyze the “orthogonality” of the CUEs in the UE-RIS channel and the “coherence” in the RIS-BS channel and propose a joint concurrent transmission (JCT) algorithm and a joint Newton orthogonal matching pursuit (JNOMP) algorithm, respectively. In the second phase, we propose an extrapolation algorithm for UE-RIS channel estimation based on the spatial proximity of adjacent users around the central users. In this scheme, separated channel parameters are estimated for each path for each user, including sparse paths for UE-RIS channels and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths for RIS-BS channel, based on known line-of-sight (LoS) path for RIS-BS channel. A new pilot protocol with an RIS phase control strategy is proposed, which can effectively reduce pilot overhead. In addition, we analyze the time computational complexity of the algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed multi-user estimation algorithm can accurately accomplish channel reconstruction with low overhead.},

  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) holds great promise within the Internet of vehicles (IoV), offering real-time, context-aware information to enhance user experiences. Since wireless AR services have stringent requirements for latency and energy efficiency, terahertz (THz) transmission and mobile edge computing (MEC) can be leveraged to address these issues. Besides, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely employed to design resource allocation and offloading decision schemes, further boosting the benefits of THz and MEC communication. However, conventional RL-based schemes necessitate online trial-and-error interactions and policy updates, which may result in unsafe actions and pose risks, e.g., vehicle collisions. Inspired by this, we propose a novel static data-driven AR tasks offloading framework for the IoV with THz communication. The proposed framework utilizes an offline RL algorithm to train the offloading decision agents without real-world interactions. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing user experience by jointly optimizing bandwidth and computation resource allocation. To reduce the complexity of solving the original problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: 1) THz bandwidth allocation and 2) MEC offloading decisions. Considering the unique characteristics of THz communication that users&#39; available bandwidth varies with their distances to the base station (BS), we design a heuristic THz bandwidth allocation algorithm to achieve fair allocation. To address the typical out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue encountered in offline RL, we exploit the conservative Q-learning (CQL) to make the optimal MEC offloading decisions enhancing user experience. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of algorithm stability and user feedback.},

  abstract     = {Using the drone as a cooperative relay (CR) can improve the connectivity of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) on highways in remote areas. Meanwhile, considering limited spectrum resources, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is regarded as a promising approach for increasing spectrum efficiency and the channel capacity of IoV. Motivated by the above, this paper investigates the application of the cooperative relaying system (CRS) and NOMA in drone-enabled IoV. Specifically, we propose a NOMA-enhanced CRS in drone-enabled IoV for spatially multiplexed transmissions, where the base station is allowed to transmit two different data symbols simultaneously to associated vehicles. Next, in order to analyze the capacity, we adopt the incomplete Gamma function and Taylor expansion of Bessel function to derive the closed-form expression of average data rates. Then, to simplify the calculation, we provide an approximate expression by using the Gauss-Chebyshev integral. Afterwards, to fully exploit the advantages of the CR, the CR height is optimized by employing the Steffensen method, which has second-order convergence without calculating the derivative. In order to apply to real scenarios, we extend the considered model to accommodate large-scale networks by using the stochastic geometric method. Finally, the simulation results show the accuracy of the obtained approximate results, where the performance gap is 1.6%. Moreover, the NOMA-enhanced CRS using the proposed CR height optimization scheme outperforms the current works in terms of the sum data rate. Furthermore, utilizing the Steffensen method can reduce the running time by 26.3% in comparison with the Newton method.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is explored to accomplish integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. Two algorithms are conceived for identifying the positions of the target and user of interest, with the assistance of specifically designed time-varying RIS configurations. Concretely, the angle of the line-of-sight link is estimated via the reduced-dimension multiple signal classification (RD-MUSIC) algorithm, while the angle between the target/user and the RIS is estimated by the proposed maximum parallelism approach. We also study the joint optimization of the transmit covariance matrix (TCM) and RIS configuration to enhance the communication and sensing performance simultaneously. Specifically, an alternating optimization method is adopted to decouple the coupling between the TCM and RIS. The two obtained subproblems are solved by using the projected gradient and manifold optimization methods, respectively. Simulation results are illustrated to corroborate the feasibility of the conceived positioning algorithms and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization algorithm.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges to develop the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile communication and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) devices is the limitation of the power supply. As a promising solution, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) concept has been introduced while the performance highly depends on modeling the nonlinear characteristics of the receiver. In this article, a novel nonlinear model is presented for the DC output power of the rectifier as a function of the input power and the operating frequency. The proposed model is named Entropy model since the entropy of the input power and the operating frequency of the rectifier serve as indices of the rectifier&#39;s DC output power. Also, it can be used to compare the shape of various rectifiers’ conversion efficiency. In addition, the proposed model is applicable to different operating frequency bands and works for a wide range of input power. The similarity of the proposed model with the measured data is more than 98%. To maximize the total received power over the frequency band by utilizing the proposed model, we solve a non-concave optimization problem subject to minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for three different receiver structures, i.e., power splitting, time switching and separated receivers. For all receivers, the non-concave optimization problem is transformed into a tractable form. Moreover, the ratio of the power splitter in the PS is optimized during solving resource allocation problems considering its effect on the total received power and SINR. The results demonstrate that resource allocation can significantly enhance the performance by use of the proposed nonlinear model rather than the conventional linear and nonlinear ones.},

  abstract     = {Image super-resolution (SR) technology is crucial for applications such as telemedicine. Performing image SR tasks using semantic communication allows the received information to be directly applied without the need for complex operations at the receiver. However, research still grapples with the challenges of constructing a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method that effectively extracts semantic information from LR images for reconstructing HR images, as well as reducing the unfavorable impact of the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic information extraction (DSIE) module for the image SR task in semantic communications. This module ingeniously integrates the advantages of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architectures and incorporates signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to dynamically adjust the output via the channel attention mechanism. Building on DSIE, we custom-design the JSCC scheme for image SR tasks in semantic communications. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed DSIE and show that the proposed JSCC scheme surpasses the existing DNN-based JSCC schemes and the traditional separated-source channel coding schemes.},

  abstract     = {As a key pillar technology for the future 6G networks, Terahertz (THz) communications can provide high-capacity transmissions, but suffers from severe propagation loss and line-of-sight (LoS) blockage that limits the network coverage. Narrow beams are required to compensate for the loss, but they in turn bring in beam misalignment challenge and degrade the THz network coverage. The high sensing resolution of THz signals enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology to assist the LoS blockage and user mobility-induced beam misalignment, enhancing THz network coverage. Based on the 5G beam management, we propose a joint synchronization signal block (SSB) and reference signal (RS)-based sensing (JSRS) scheme to assist beam alignment. JSRS enables a predict-and-prevent procedure that provides early interventions for timely beam switches. To maximize performance of JSRS, we provide an optimal sensing signal insertion and time-to-frequency allocation to improve the joint range and velocity resolutions. We derive the coverage probability of the JSRS-enabled network to evaluate its abilities in beam misalignment reduction and coverage enhancement. The expression also instructs the network density deployment and beamwidth selection. Numerical results show that the JSRS scheme is effective and highly compatible with the 5G air interface. Averaged in the tested urban use cases, JSRS achieves near-ideal performance and reduces around 80% of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by about 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability.},

  abstract     = {In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication over fast time-varying frequency-selective fading channels, also known as doubly-selective channels (DSC), channel estimation (CE) and OFDM demodulation are challenging tasks. This is because high Doppler spread in DSC introduces severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) that distorts the OFDM data, and spreads the pilot tones away from their designated frequency positions to make channel estimation inaccurate. In this paper, we present a robust OFDM communication receiver for severe DSC, which incorporates a novel deep learning (DL) based channel estimator (CE) and a two-stage equalization architecture named 2s-BEM-ANN. The proposed 2s-BEM-ANN architecture operates in two stages. In the first stage, a pilot-aided CE is performed using an attention neural network (ANN) known as BEM-ANN, followed by equalization using a banded-minimum mean square error (BMMSE) algorithm. In the second stage, data-aided CE is carried out using another BEM-ANN, followed by maximum-likelihood (ML) equalization. Both channel estimators model the DSC using a complex-exponential basis expansion model (CX-BEM), and two training strategies are proposed for the pilot-aided and data-aided BEM-ANNs. Simulation results show that the proposed 2-stage basis expansion model attention neural network (2s-BEM-ANN) receiver significantly improves the bit-error rate (BER) performance over the conventional CE and equalization techniques. Furthermore, the BER performance of the proposed 2s-BEM-ANN approaches very close to the BER lower bound, and without requiring any turbo iteration between the CE and equalization modules. The proposed 2s-BEM-ANN is also robust against signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Doppler uncertainties, as well as variations in the channel power-delay profile. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed 2s-BEM-ANN grows only linearly with the OFDM block length $N$ .},

In CHMA, multiple access interference and multipath interference can be mitigated with the help of complementary codes, namely complementary coded CHMA (CC-CHMA). However, traditional CC-CHMA works on random code hopping (CH) patterns, which leads to an irreducibly high bit error floor. To address this issue, this work proposes an optimal CH pattern design to minimize the bit error floor. In addition, code collision probability and bit error rate (BER) with binary phase shift keying modulation are derived explicitly. The results verify that CC-CHMA with the proposed optimal CH pattern exhibits a much better BER performance than traditional CC-CHMA, which at the same time also offers a higher overload rate than traditional NOMA in uplink multipath channels, paving a way for its possible applications in beyond 5G mobile communications.},

While relaying is a possible solution when the direct mmWave D2D link is blocked by obstacles, the selected relay link may also be blocked by dynamic blockers that are difficult to know in advance. This paper focuses on investigating the dynamic blockage effects in relays-assisted mmWave D2D communication systems, where we assume that D2D users can switch to other available relays when the current link is blocked. A closed-form expression for the probability of all available relays being simultaneously blocked for a pair of D2D users is derived, which reveals the effects of the density and position of relays on the blockage characteristics and system reliability. Additionally, a closed-form expression for the minimum relay density required to satisfy certain quality of service requirements is obtained accordingly, and the feasible positions for a relay to effectively reduce the blockage probability is found based on particle swarm optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to theoretically analyze the dynamic blockage in relays-assisted mmWave D2D communications, which provides valuable insights for designing network parameters.},

Meanwhile, BackCom systems can incorporate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to achieve higher spectral efficiency for massive connectivity. Hence, we consider a NOMA-enabled bistatic BackCom system, where multiple backscatter nodes (BSNs) are grouped by the NOMA principle and served with the assistance of an RIS. Using the method of moments (MoM), we analyze and obtain the bit error rate (BER) expressions of a 2-BSN NOMA cluster under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The validity of the derived expressions is corroborated through extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system is evaluated in comparison with the conventional NOMA-BackCom system. Our results reveal the superior performance of the RIS-assisted NOMA system, and demonstrate the influence of the number of RIS elements and the choice of reflection coefficients on the BER performance of the proposed system.},

Compared to traditional ground network, SAGIN has a wide coverage area and enables seamless Internet access for users worldwide. However, due to its structural complexity, diverse services, and the heterogeneous nature of its resources–including bandwidth, CPU, and storage–the orchestration of these multidimensional resources in SAGIN poses a significant challenge. Through network virtualization technology, the resource orchestration of SAGIN can be transformed into a virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. To address the issue of high energy consumption, this paper introduces an innovative energy-aware VNE algorithm that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with graph convolutional network (GCN). In particular, during the node mapping phase, we develop a GCN-based policy network that effectively extracts network features by aggregating information from adjacent nodes through GCN. Furthermore, Chebyshev polynomials are employed to approximate the graph convolution kernel, which significantly reduces the algorithm&#39;s computational complexity. To minimize energy consumption during the link mapping process, we have proposed an energy-first K-shortest path algorithm. Finally, we simulated the proposed algorithm, GD-EA-VNE, to evaluate and verify its effectiveness.},

Unlike existing studies that focus solely on optimizing caching based on specific transmission policies, we investigate the joint design of caching and JT strategies by considering their interactions. Due to the nonconvex nature of the joint optimization problem, we decouple it into a caching optimization subproblem and a transmission optimization subproblem. In SCNs, SBSs are selectively activated according to the transmission strategy to efficiently manage interference and enhance signal quality. In solving the caching optimization subproblem, the activation probabilities of all SBSs are modeled and a closed-form suboptimal caching algorithm is derived based the activation probabilities of all SBSs. Based on the closed-form caching algorithm, a distributed transmission scheme is designed by using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the closed-form caching algorithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity. Compared to heuristic schemes, optimization schemes, and MARL schemes, the proposed joint scheme achieves at least 80 $\%$ reduction of the network delay.},

OTFS accommodates the channel dynamics in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the delay and Doppler shifts of each physical path will be captured by the DD grid and represented as integer and fractional indexes. However, the critical challenge associated with OTFS-based sensing is the insufficient resolution caused by the limited bandwidth and frame duration. To address this issue, we propose a two-step amplitude barycenter calibration (TS-ABC) method, which exploits the non-linear relationship among several discrete Fourier transform (DFT) samples and produces a true-valued estimate through two calibration steps.

In this work, we show that the network geometry (locations of serving base station, IRS, and user) can be captured using the so-called triangle parameter $\Delta$ . We introduce a decomposition of the effect of the combined link into a signal amplification factor and an effective channel power coefficient $G$ . The amplification factor is monotonically increasing with both the number of IRS elements $N$ and $\Delta$ . For $G$ , since an exact characterization of the distribution seems unfeasible, we propose three approximations depending on the value of the product $N\Delta$ for Nakagami fading and the special case of Rayleigh fading. For two relevant models of IRS placement, we prove that their performance is identical if $\Delta$ is the same given an $N$ . We also show that no gains are achieved from IRS deployment if $N$ and $\Delta$ are both small. We further compute bounds on the diversity gain to quantify the channel hardening effect of IRSs. Hence only with a judicious selection of IRS placement and other network parameters, non-trivial gains can be obtained.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a promising technique for next-generation mobile networks, offering reduced device size, power consumption, cost, and improved spectrum efficiency. Full realization of such benefits relies on waveform design and resource allocation. This paper focuses on frequency-time (FT) resource allocation of multi-user uplink ISAC systems by minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of 5G new-radio signals. We first derive two types of CRBs for communications with respect to channel coefficients and parameters, respectively, and derive one CRB with respect to parameters for radar by removing the line-of-sight path and exploiting the shared parameters among different users&#39; channels. Closed-form solutions to the FT resources are obtained under certain conditions for both radar and communication CRB minimizations, revealing the relationship and differences between the optimal radar and communication FT-resource allocations. Then, to balance the radar and communication CRB performance, we formulate two ISAC FT-resource optimization problems based on the two different communication CRBs and optimize FT resources accordingly. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CRB optimization scheme.},

  abstract     = {As the fog-based internet of vehicles (IoV) is equipped with rich perception, computing, communication and storage resources, it provides a new solution for the bulk data processing. However, the impact caused by the mobility of vehicles brings a challenge to the content scheduling and resource allocation of content dissemination service. In this paper, we propose a time-varying resource relationship graph to model the intertwined impact of the perception, computation, communication and storage resources across multiple snapshots on the content dissemination process of IoV. Based on this graph model, the content dissemination process is modeled as a mathematical optimization problem, where the quality of service of both delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive services are considered. Owing to its NP-completeness, the optimization problem is decomposed into a joint link and subchannel scheduling subproblem and as well a joint power and flow control subproblem. Then, a cascaded low complexity scheduling algorithm is proposed for the joint link and subchannel scheduling subproblem. Moreover, a robust resource management algorithm is developed for the power and flow control subproblem, where the channel uncertainties in future snapshots are fully considered in the algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that the effectiveness of the proposed approaches outperforms other state-of-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems will play a pivotal role in future integrated satellite-terrestrial networks to realize ubiquitous high-throughput communication. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and the utilization of Ku-Ka and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands introduce wide-range Doppler shifts, which are especially detrimental to OFDMA-based systems. Existing Doppler shift compensation methods are limited by the requirement for prior user location information and/or high computational complexities associated with searching across broad Doppler shift ranges. In this work, we propose a multi-stage Doppler shift compensation method aimed at compensating for wide-range Doppler shifts in downlink LEO satellite OFDMA systems over Ku-Ka to mmWave bands. The proposed method consists of three stages: incorporating the phase-differential (PD) operation into the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to widen the estimation range, enhancing compensation using a repetition training sequence, and utilizing the cyclic prefix (CP) for fine estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s effectiveness in handling Doppler shifts in LEO SatCom over different channels and frequency bands. Moreover, the proposed method attains the maximum estimation range and exhibits high accuracy with low complexity, irrespective of the Doppler shift range, making it an effective, practical, and easily implementable solution in LEO satellite communication.},

  abstract     = {High frequency directional communication is considered as key technology to improve the performance of mobile Ad Hoc networks owing to its advantages in terms of communication distance and low interference. Neighbor discovery plays a key role for efficient routing and topology control in mobile Ad Hoc networks. It is also a very challenging issue due to the use of directional antennas and the movement of mobile nodes. Beam configuration is the core step of neighbor discovery in mobile Ad Hoc networks with directional antennas. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an efficient beam configuration algorithm to reduce the neighbor discovery latency. In this paper, we propose a novel beam configuration algorithm based on personalized federated learning. Considering the characteristics of mobile Ad Hoc networks (e.g., dynamic topology and directional communication), we use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) as the local model of federated learning. Since the local data of Ad Hoc network nodes is heterogeneous, Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) is applied to personalize the federated learning. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has better performance than some baseline algorithms.},

This paper proposes an efficient PLS scheme for coded multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems operating under imperfect channel estimation conditions. Since coded MIMO systems are typically equipped with an interleaver for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM), which is associated with soft iterative decoding, the scheme proposed herein adopts a random interleaving index, which is a function of the legitimate channel. This scheme also includes a novel strategy to prevent the performance degradation caused by channel estimation error through the combination of ancillary forward error correction (AFEC). This innovative concept can archive an advanced level of security protection without requiring any additional power. We also derive the secrecy rate of the proposed scheme. The simulation results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively protects the transmitted data without any information leakage to the eavesdropper.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer wireless access services to terrestrial users without geographical limitations, making them integral to future communication systems. However, the openness of wireless channels and the mobility of UAVs pose significant security challenges to UAV-based communication systems. This work delves into the security of aerial cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with multiple location-uncertain colluding eavesdroppers. In this setup, a cognitive aerial base station transmits messages to cognitive terrestrial users using the spectrum resources of primary users. All secondary terrestrial users employ the maximal ratio combining scheme to decode the received message, as do all illegitimate receivers. To maximize the average secrecy rate of aerial CRNs, we jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV and its transmission power while ensuring that the propulsion energy consumption remains within an acceptable threshold. To address the non-convex mixed-variable optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, demonstrating improved secrecy performance for airborne CRNs.},

Different from the traditional BM procedures, our approach feedbacks all the beam measurements to the base station via beam reporting to facilitate HYB design without the estimation of explicit CSI. Furthermore, to handle the noisy beam measurements feedback problem with reduced overhead, we propose a swin transformer-based beam compression and restoration method featuring its ability to extract the relationships among different beams. Finally, we develop a low-complexity coordinated HYB algorithm in the proposed framework. The method involves analog domain beam selection and the design of two-layer digital precoders for inter-cell and intra-cell interference cancellation, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed beam restoration method efficiently removes measurement noise and reduces feedback overhead and the proposed coordinated HYB scheme reveals a 90% achievable sum-rate of the ideal scheme, highlighting the effectiveness in interference elimination.},

The receiver first measures the discrete cross-ambiguity values between the received signal and local discrete-frequency-shifted comb-type preamble signals for discrete time shifts sequentially. With the measured discrete cross-ambiguity values, the preamble-comb-based ITS approach using sequential threshold comparison and select-the-largest identification is then developed to estimate the start time of a received preamble frame on the leading channel path. Preamble-comb-based coarse and fine ITS systems are investigated to operate over a wide timing acquisition range (TAR) under the influence of data self-interference (DSI) and over an adjustable narrow DSI-free TAR, respectively. When the channel exhibits a strong leading path and wide ranges of fractional Doppler shifts, the preamble-comb-based ITS systems are shown to outperform several conventional ITS systems significantly in estimation robustness and accuracy for sufficiently high preamble signal-to-noise power ratios.},

To this end, by virtue of the frequency domain implementation of the GFDM transmission, we apply the discrete fourier transform (DFT) operation on the received symbols, which in return diagonalizes the channel matrix. Next, this efficient received signal after DFT is put into the zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer of GFDM, and subsequently, fed into the message passing algorithm (MPA) receiver of SCMA, which establishes a low complexity multiuser detection for the SCMA-GFDM system. For rigor, the closed form average bit error ratio (BER) bound for this SCMA-GFDM system is also derived by computing the effective noise power.

The transmit beamforming and the reflecting coefficient matrix are jointly optimized for minimizing the transmit power. This optimization problem is formulated under the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) between the secondary base station (SBS) and the primary user (PU), as well as that between the RIS and the PU are imperfect. Additionally, under the rate and the maximum tolerable interference power constraints, this problem becomes non-convex and intractable. Fortunately, by applying an upper-bounding technique, it is transformed into a tractable form, which can be solved efficiently by an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm.

In addition, the system throughput of PRIS-ARIS-NOMA in delay-limited mode and delay-tolerant mode are discussed according to the outage probability and ergodic data rate. The simulation results verify the correctness of the formulas and yields the following insights: 1) The outage behaviors of PRIS-ARIS-NOMA outperforms than that of PRIS-ARIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA); 2)Use of PRIS-ARIS-NOMA is better than use of PRIS-ARIS-OMA in small transmit power threshold scenarios 3) By increasing the number of reflecting elements of RISs, the PRIS-ARIS-NOMA is able to achieve the enhanced outage performance; and 4) The PRIS-ARIS-NOMA has the higher ergodic data rate and system throughput than double PRISs-NOMA.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated communications, computing, and sensing (ICCS) network, where a multi-functional base station (BS) performs downlink communication, target sensing and edge computing. To examine the overall performance of the system under consideration, a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing information beamforming, sensing covariance matrix, sensing echo receiving beamforming, offloading signal receiving beamforming, local computing resources, edge computing resources and offloading strategy. The formulated problem consists of multiple coupled variables, which leads to its non-convexity. To circumvent this issue, we propose an efficient alternating iterative optimization algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into four subproblems to be solved alternately. Specifically, we develop an effective algorithm based on the quadratic transform fractional programming approach to optimize the information beamforming, sensing covariance matrix, sensing echo receiving beamforming and edge computing resources. Then, the Lagrangian dual method is used to optimize the offloading signal receiving beamforming. We derive a closed-form solution for the local computing resource. Meanwhile, a coordinate descent (CD) method is proposed to obtain the offloading strategy. The final solutions are obtained by alternatively optimizing the above subproblems until convergence. Finally, numerical results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the existing benchmark schemes.},

Then, we propose two categories of scheduling schemes, namely scheduling schemes with and without interference among users, which are implemented under fixed-rate mode and delay-based allocated-rate mode, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the average system throughput and fairness of each scheduling scheme under different rate modes.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the use of the $\tilde{\mathcal {M}}$ distribution that is the product of Lognormal and Shadow Rician to describe the atmospheric turbulence-induced scintillation in free space optical communication systems. By approximating the moment generating function of Lognormal distribution with Hermite polynomial, the probability density function of $\tilde{\mathcal {M}}$ distribution is obtained in an approximately analytical form. It is shown that the proposed model yields a best fit to experimental and simulation data over a wide range of channel conditions when compared with the other widely used turbulence models. With resect to the pointing error model, we introduce a singular value decomposition method to transform the correlated sways to be independent and find that it is equivalent to the coordinate rotation method proposed before. To efficiently approximate the Beckmann distribution by the modified Rayleigh distribution, we present a new variance estimation method by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence and find that the derived new variance can reduce the computational cost of the gain parameter. Moreover, Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistical test results show that the derived new variance leads to a better approximation in most scenarios when compared with the two other estimates derived with the moment matching method in literature. To investigate the outage probability, bit error rate performance, and the ergodic capacity performance, an unifying probability density function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors for heterodyne detection and intensity modulation and direct detection techniques is derived. The simulation results verify the accuracy of the approximately analytical results and indicate that the derived new variance provides the best approximation accuracy in the performance of ergodic capacity in the whole SNR regime.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enable communication among vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) with a dedicated short range communications (DSRC). In VANETs, the real-time trajectory prediction service can be provided by roadside units (RSUs) using data collected from vehicles. This service is important for the prevention of traffic accidents. Due to the openness of the communication in VANETs, the transmitted data is vulnerable to illegal users&#39; attacks that results in the leakage of vehicles&#39; data. To address the above concerns, a privacy-preserving multi-party computation scheme with secret sharing is proposed for vehicle trajectory prediction in VANETs. The proposed scheme is designed to protect the privacy of transmitted vehicle data during trajectory prediction. Note that four distributed interactive protocols of $\bm {\mathit {SecLog(\cdot)}}$ , $\bm {\mathit {SecExp (\cdot)}}$ , $\bm {\mathit {SecRec(\cdot)}}$ and $\bm {\mathit {SecCmp(\cdot)}}$ are introduced to carry out the computation of nonlinear logarithm, exponent, reciprocal and comparison functions in the proposed scheme. The aforementioned interactive protocols facilitate the distributed deployment of the Adaboost ensemble learning algorithm among multiple RSUs, while ensuring the privacy of vehicle data using secret sharing simultaneously. Security analysis proves that the proposed scheme can effectively protect the privacy of vehicle data. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has a minimal impact on the prediction accuracy of the Adaboost algorithm compared to the differential privacy (DP)-based scheme. Furthermore, the low latency of the proposed scheme allows for efficient trajectory prediction, as demonstrated by the runtime of the proposed scheme on test set.},

  abstract     = {Communication between satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations takes place through inter-satellite links (ISLs). Unlike intra-plane ISLs, which interconnect satellites belonging to the same orbital plane with fixed relative distance, inter-plane ISLs experience significant Doppler frequency shifts, since satellites belonging to different orbital planes exhibit time-varying relative distance (required, e.g., to minimize the risk of physical collisions between satellites). In this paper, we consider the problem of connecting multiple satellites, belonging to a massive LEO constellation, to a receiving satellite, referred to as the sink. Specifically, we consider a hybrid multiple access scheme, which employs a combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where radio-frequency ISLs share the same time-frequency resource blocks, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA), where ISLs employ orthogonal resource blocks. The set of satellites transmitting towards the sink is divided into groups, where NOMA is employed within each group, whereas OMA is used to separate different groups. Such a scheme subsumes as special cases both pure-OMA and pure-NOMA. Our study highlights that similar Doppler frequency shifts have a significant impact on the individual rates of the satellites in a pure-NOMA scheme, thus reducing the network fairness of this technique. Motivated by such a fact, we develop design strategies of the proposed hybrid NOMA-OMA scheme, which exploit inter-plane Doppler frequency diversity to enhance fairness among the satellites, while ensuring a significantly higher sum-rate capacity compared to the pure-OMA technique. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical analysis, by demonstrating both the fairness enhancement of the proposed techniques over the pure-NOMA scheme, as well as their capacity improvement over the pure-OMA one.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a dynamic multi-steerable energy beam scheme for millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) and studies its resource allocation. In the considered system, a hybrid access point (HAP) transmits radio frequency (RF) energy beams to multiple sensors for their wireless energy harvesting (WEH) in downlink (DL) and then receives signals from the sensors in uplink (UL). During the DL phase, a beam splitting technique is adopted to opportunistically generate multiple analog sub-beams for serving multiple sensors with arbitrary angle-of-departure (AoD) distribution, which can provide more flexibility and improve usability for the mmWave-based WPCNs. Then, we design a two-stage resource allocation method for improving the WEH efficiency of all sensors during the DL and maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system during the UL. In the first stage, by utilizing the coalition formation game theory and linear optimization method, a joint sensor grouping, antenna allocation, and power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the conditional harvested RF power of all sensors by fixing transmission timeslot allocation of the DL and UL. In the second stage, by utilizing the obtained optimal information in the first stage, a solution based on Dinkelbach algorithm and Lagrange dual method is devised to solve the optimization problem of transmission timeslot allocation for maximizing of the system&#39;s EE. The numerical results demonstrate that the designed resource allocation method for WEH in the DL can achieve an approximately optimal performance, while the whole two-stage resource allocation method offers an obvious EE improvement compared to that of the proposed multi-beam scheme without optimal resource allocation and conventional single-beam scheme.},

Therefore, in this paper, a sensing assisted optical wireless communication scheme based on the hovering UAV is proposed, and time-division multiplexing is employed to make the sensing and the communication share the same hardware of the transceiver. Four cases are analyzed in detail. In Case I, the sensing error, the UAV position error and the angle of arrival error are considered, and the channel statistical characteristic, the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) and the optimization problem are investigated. The EAR does not have a closed form and the optimization problem is difficult to be solved in Case I. Therefore, three special cases are studied. In three special cases, the analytical solutions obtained in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region are derived. Moreover, simulation results show that the optimization result in Case I can be approximated by the derived results in three special cases. Besides, the EAR of the proposed scheme is very close to the conventional scheme in the same communication power, and its total power consumption and hardware complexity are lower.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secure simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) assisted by the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). Specifically, a base station (BS) configured multi-antennas has secure communication demand to an information receiver (IR) and performs wireless power transmission to an energy receiver (ER). We consider the fact that non-linear energy harvesting model is applied at the ER. Moreover, there is no direct link between the BS and the IR/ER, only the STAR-RIS-assisted cascade channel exists, and cascade channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. In particular, two CSI error models, i.e., the bounded CSI error model and the statistical CSI error model, are taken into account. Considering the potential eavesdropping risk of the ER under these two models, we study the quality of service (QoS) based robust design problems by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming and artificial noise (AN) at the BS as well as amplitude and phase shift at the STAR-RIS. To handle the formed non-convex optimization problems, we adopt S-Procedure to transform the bounded CSI error signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and we utilize the Bernstein-Type Inequality (BTI) to convert the outage probability constraints with statistical CSI errors into second-order cone (SOC) constraints and linear inequalities. Accordingly, we propose two effective algorithms based on alternating optimization (AO), in which the semi-definite programming (SDP), penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-define relaxation (SDR) are used to solve the decomposed non-convex subproblems. We also analyze the complexity for the proposed algorithms. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the impacts of the CSI uncertainty and the STAR-RIS parameters on the system performance are analyzed.},

Therefore, this study proposes an improved indoor localization algorithm using a deep randomized neural network (RandNN) with Wi-Fi-RSSI. We have conducted a real experiment testbed for Wi-Fi RSSI data collection from a complex indoor environment. An improved adaptive unscented Kalman filter (IAUKF) method is used to minimize noise fluctuations and signal attenuations in the raw Wi-Fi RSSI data collection. Moreover, we have investigated the deep RandNN in which the weights and biases of the input hyperparameter are initially randomized to obtain the best localization performance. For convenience, the presented localization model is known as RandNN-IAUKF. Furthermore, real experiments were conducted in a room surrounding working stations, walls, patriation separations, etc., to maximize the complexity of wireless signal propagation. The performance of the presented RandNN-IAUKF algorithm is assessed and compared with other well-known conventional localization approaches. Overall, the experimental results showed that the presented RandNN-IAUKF algorithm provides significant 95% and 67% location estimation errors only at 0.79 m and 1.31 m, respectively, outperforming conventional algorithms by approximately 30% under the same test environment.},

  abstract     = {The sparse phased multiple-input–multiple-output (phased-MIMO) radar system, composed of separated subarrays, is highly applicable for multi-platform cooperative systems. Specifically, it effectively utilizes the wide transmit beam to rapidly cover the region of interest and shapes a receive beam with high angular resolution for precise target detection. However, due to the mismatch between transmit and receive beam width, the conventional one-transmit-one-receive mode is no longer suitable for sparse phased-MIMO radar system. This results in wasted detection information for remaining angles within the transmit main beam. In this paper, our focus lies on implementing a simultaneous multibeam application based on sparse phased-MIMO radar system. By minimizing the peak sidelobe level (PSL) of the virtual transmit-receive beampattern as an objective function while also considering mainlobe level restrictions and fixed nulling constraints at specific regions, we formulate a simultaneous multibeam optimization problem with only one emission. To efficiently tackle the resulting non-convex design problem efficiently, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm based on alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which decomposes complex constrained optimization problem into multiple simple subproblems and solving them iteratively. Numerical simulations are provided to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the achieved beampattern under various constraints and parameter settings. Simulation results demonstrate that by controlling the phase and amplitude of digital domain receiving weights, sparse phased-MIMO radar can achieve low sidelobe simultaneous multibeam reception under a single transmission for high resolution target detection in monitoring areas.},

  abstract     = {It is a great challenge to guarantee both path-tracking performance and vehicle stability when suffering from aggressive uncertainties and severe disturbances. We design a novel learning-based robust model predictive path-tracking controller to alleviate the influence of disturbances, avoid over-conservative steering actions, and mediate the conflict between path-tracking and vehicle stability. Specifically, we firstly utilize the friction limits of tires and define an enveloped stable zone in the phase portrait which is used as safety constraints. Secondly, two approaches under the model predictive control (MPC) framework are employed to tackle the severe uncertainties and disturbances: 1) a deep neural network (DNN) dynamics model is employed to estimate the predictive error and attenuate the mismatch between the nominal model and actual plant; and 2) a local feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is used to stabilize the system matrix, calculate invariant tube, and thus guarantee all state and control constraints are satisfied. Finally, real vehicle experiments indicate that the proposed controller can achieve an over 18% improvement in path-tracking performance and guarantee vehicle stability, even for cases with severe uncertainties and disturbances.},

The conventional qZIC, applying a modified modulation based on modified ZSVM3 (three-segment Z-source Space Vector Modulation), has been proposed due to its capability to achieve fully soft switching without any additional circuits. However, the inductor operates with discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), resulting in significant output charging current ripple. To figure it out, the proposed qZIC substitutes a coupled inductor for the two inductors of quasi-Z-source network. The output current is continuous and ripples are suppressed. In addition, all power switches can still realize ZVS or ZCS by designing the coupled inductor according to the operation principle. The operation principle is analyzed in detail and design considerations are provided. A 6-kW prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inductor coupling qZIC. Experimental results demonstrate the elimination of output current ripples, and all switches operate with soft switching.},

  abstract     = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) has multiplied rapidly due to governments&#39; push towards clean energy transition. Being an integral part of future transportation-power coupling, how to make the most of these EVs in this interdependent interaction while respecting their privacy concerning EV batteries&#39; state conditions and physical limits becomes critical. This paper proposes a new peer-to-peer energy trading framework between EV aggregators and local entities with distributed energy resources. The framework enables the efficient use of EV batteries for various vehicle-to-everything (V2X) operations, like vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle, while ensuring safe operation and protection of confidential data. Safe operating envelopes are developed to control EV battery state of charge and temperature limits, reducing dimensionality without compromising accuracy and privacy. Additionally, an incentive model is introduced to capture the EV owner&#39;s willingness to support V2X and undergo multiple charge/discharge cycles during the trading period. Moreover, a model predictive control-based architecture is developed to effectively manage the dynamic nature of EV arrivals and departures. The proposed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework incorporates grid constraints and has been rigorously evaluated through numerical simulations conducted using the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with 5 prosumer agents, hosting a combination of solar PVs and multiple EVs. Simulation results show that the framework facilitates efficient engagement of EVs in P2P energy trading without violating their safe operational limits as well as the grid constraints.},

Relevant analytical methods perform online SOH estimation requiring inputs of the SOC variation and the charge stored in the battery in a time interval. However, SOC estimation errors and unclear time interval selection are two technical challenges for analytical methods. To overcome the issues and fulfill the online SOH estimation objective, this paper proposes an adaptive moving window total least square method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined using the Stanford battery degradation dataset, which cycles the battery using the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profile. Compared with relevant methods in the literature, the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate SOH estimation, achieving a -0.01% mean relative error and 1.96% mean absolute error, averaged from fourteen benchmark checkpoints, in the presence of slowly-varying 2% SOC estimation error; the proposed algorithm also renders a constrained estimation with a 2.60% standard deviation. Also, the implementation procedures and their decision-making are well explained, allowing future implementation in electric vehicles.},

The novel multi-head architecture of the dilated temporal convolutional network facilitates simultaneous learning of patterns across different scales, allowing the model to adapt to new patterns quickly. The diverse dilation rates in the dilated temporal convolutional network enhance the model&#39;s capability to capture long-term sequences, while the gated recurrent unit focuses on short-term dependencies, offering a versatile state of charge estimation method suitable for various environmental conditions. Additionally, the incorporation of the explainable artificial intelligence technique - Shapley Additive exPlanations aids in achieving global interpretability for state of charge prediction, offering a precise quantification of the influence of individual attributes. Comprehensive experiments were conducted across various temperatures and driving cycles to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The computation results indicate the proposed method&#39;s adaptability to varying conditions, achieving high estimation accuracy and robustness with a mean absolute percentage error and root mean square percentage error of 0.54% and 0.84%, respectively, along with a parameter count of 3,74,433.

Based on the parameters of vehicle driving stability, the concept of vehicle danger level (DL) is established by integrating the parameters of path tracking accuracy. Affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm is used to cluster the vehicle driving status under different road adhesion coefficients, speeds and curvatures. The results of DL recognition are added to the design of TD3 reinforcement learning reward function, and the coordination control of automatic steering and differential braking under different conditions is realized, so as to achieve high-precision path tracking control under the premise of ensuring vehicle safety. The results of CarSim/Simulink co-simulation and hardware-in-loop test show that the vehicle DL can be more accurately recognized by using AP clustering algorithm and the reinforcement learning control strategy combined with DL recognition is superior to the traditional fixed parameter MPC controller and the reinforcement learning control strategy without considering the clustering method in improving the path tracking accuracy and lateral stability of the vehicle. The training convergence speed is improved in both the variable curvature road and the docking road, in which the functional insufficiency problem of the steering system is fully alleviated in the variable curvature road, and the energy loss caused by the additional yaw moment is less in the docking road.},

For relaxing the upper bound information constraint of sliding mode control design, an ELM-based mechanism is utilized for learning the lumped uncertainty bound online, while the ELM output weights are updated adaptively in the sense of Lyapunov. Also, considering that the input voltage is normally limited due to the vehicular battery constraint for practical applications, to handle the input saturation scenario, an auxiliary system (AS) is further designed to guarantee a fixed time convergence of auxiliary state and the state is correspondingly fed into the controller design. The global stability analysis of the closed-loop system is rigidly given. Comparative experimental studies are conducted to illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed control.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the finite-time-prescribed performance-based (FTPP) platoon formation control problem of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with connectivity preservation and collision avoidance. Each vehicle is subject to unmeasured velocities, model uncertainties, external disturbances and actuator input delay. By introducing a finite-time performance function (FTPF), the desired transient and steady-state performances can be guaranteed in finite time, which makes the line-of-sight (LOS) error and angle error be limited within the desired constraints to achieve collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance. Furthermore, a relevant variable containing constrained upper and lower bounds is designed to further realize the FTPP with asymmetric properties. In order to recover unmeasured velocity information, estimate uncertain dynamics of the vehicle and compensate for external disturbances, an extended state observer (ESO) based on position-heading information is proposed. Thereinto, the event-triggered mechanism is introduced to reduce the communication burden from the sensor to the observer channel. The effects of actuator input delay are eliminated by using the Pade approximation transform. A second-order linear tracking differentiator (TD) is introduced into the kinematic design to avoid the measurement of acceleration in the dynamics control design. The stability analysis shows that the proposed control scheme ensures that all signals of the USVs are bounded, and the Zeno behavior will not occur. Moreover, the distance between the two neighboring USVs converges to the prescribed range, meanwhile, the tracking angle error limits to a desired arbitrarily small region within finite time. Finally, the simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The speed and accuracy of the initial alignment are two important indicators. The process is usually divided into two stages, coarse alignment and fine alignment, to ensure the speed and precision of the alignment. To simplify the alignment steps and improve accuracy, a factor graph optimization(FGO)-based in-motion alignment method is proposed in the paper. First, an IMU factor based on the exact preintegration measurement model is proposed, which is especially suitable for initial attitude alignment of high precision strapdown inertial navigation system. Second, a nonlinear optimization problem based on graph model is constructed with the IMU factor and DVL factor. An incremental fixed lag smoothing method is adopted to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. Due to multiple iterations and batch optimization of the historical data, it can be superior to the traditional alignment method. Both the simulation and field tests show that FGO-based alignment speed is fast enough. It is comparable to that of the coarse alignment and faster than the filter-based method. Besides, the alignment accuracy is still the highest. It confirmed that FGO-based alignment method has great application potential in INS/DVL integration.},

  abstract     = {The safeguarding of critical zones aboard a marine vehicle, such as the engine room, wheelhouse, and pump room, assumes crucial significance while navigating through the open sea. Despite the existing pre-boarding security measures, Concealed Threat Detection (CTD) systems have emerged as a pressing need to prevent the ship from post-boarding damage with concealed dangers. Due to concerns regarding deployment cost and privacy, mmWave-based CTD systems have received significant attention. However, current solutions are not easily adapted to work in ships because of the large number of ghost targets resulting from multipath reflections in full metal cabins. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new CTD system, called mmCTD, which utilizes two mmWave commercial radars. The proposed system addresses the multipath challenge by unifying multi-view perceptions with two distinct designs. First, we propose a ghost-point elimination algorithm that extracts the point clouds from real objects. Then, we design a multi-view domain adversarial framework to predict concealed threats in the human body using the extracted RF features. mmCTD is validated by both simulations and real ship experiments, and results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy in three scenarios reaches 89% with a low false alarm rate.},

  abstract     = {Eco-driving for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEVs) through signalized intersections is a coupled problem of speed planning and powertrain control under complex environmental constraints. For global optimality and fast computation, this paper proposes a spatially convex long-term eco-driving approach for FCHEVs on signalized corridors. Considering road slopes, speed limits, and traffic lights, the original eco-driving problem is reformulated as a convex second-order cone programming problem by pre-optimization of the best green light window and convex approximation and convex relaxation of the hybrid powertrain. A powertrain-aware green window planner is first used to determine the optimal passing time windows through signalized intersections. Then the convex eco-driving problem is formulated and finally solved by concurrent optimization and sequential optimization according to whether the speed planning problem and energy management problem are coupled. Results show that the proposed concurrent convex optimization algorithm performs better fuel economy than the sequential optimization algorithm with similar computational time and can reduce motor energy consumption by 4.25% compared to an analytical speed planner. Compared to dynamic programming-based concurrent optimization, the proposed eco-driving method achieves 93.45% fuel economy with only 0.80% computational time.},

This article proposes a novel coordinated control architecture of active four-wheel steering (4WS) system and direct yaw moment control (DYC) system for IWMDEV. Firstly, a novel shared steering control framework for 4WS system is built, which includes two players, namely, the active front steering (AFS)and active rear steering (ARS). The non-cooperative game theory-based control strategy between AFS and ARS is designed to provide more lateral stability for the path following control. Secondly, a linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) is used to determine the direct yaw moment of the vehicle. Then, on the basis of comprehensive consideration of system characteristics and control objective performance requirement, the coordination controller based on K-means Density Peak Clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization (KDPC-PSO) algorithm is put forward to calculate optimal weight coefficient between the ARS system and DYC system. Finally, the Carsim/Simulink co-simulation and Hardware-in-the Loop (HIL) experiment results show that the proposed control system can effectively improve the path tracking ability and handling stability of IWMDEV under extreme conditions.},

The proposed approach introduces a seven-dimensional clustering-directed point (CDP) that encompasses three-dimensional coordinate information, three-dimensional feature vector information, and one-dimensional point cloud category information of LiDAR points. Among them, the point cloud categories are obtained through ground point segmentation and point cloud clustering, and the feature vectors are obtained by processing the classified point clouds with principal component analysis (PCA). The paper proposes a two-step point cloud matching approach and establishes an adaptable weighted comprehensive residual that includes distance and direction residuals of the associated point cloud. The attitude estimation results are obtained by optimizing the residual error.

This paper investigates the performance-prescribed vessel-train formation of path-guided underactuated MSVs subject to unknown kinetics, input saturation, and actuator faults. We develop a saturation-tolerant prescribed control method for implementing the vessel-train formation along a parameterized path. Specifically, at the kinematic level, a saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP) function is constructed by introducing non-negative modified variables to not only restrict tracking errors but also avoid possible violations because of input saturation and actuator faults. Then, the surge and yaw tunnel guidance laws based on the transformed errors are derived to achieve position and heading tracking under SPP constraints. At the kinetic level, the saturation-tolerant control laws are designed using the identified kinetics from echo state network-based estimators. By the Lyapunov stability analysis, all error signals of the proposed closed-loop system are proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded and evolve within SPP constraints against input saturation and actuator faults. Finally, simulation results are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed saturation-tolerant tunnel prescribed control method for vessel-train formation.},

  abstract     = {The off-road environment is characterized by complex terrains, which have a significant impact on vehicle safety and ride comfort. To ensure the safe and smooth operation of the vehicle driving in off-road environment, the speed profile should be terrain adaptive, meaning that it can ensure the vehicle&#39;s vertical response remains within a reasonable range and the safety distance between the vehicle and obstacles can vary with the terrain. Therefore, this paper proposes a terrain-adaptive hierarchical speed planning (TAHSP) method for off-road environments. This method consists of an upper-layer three-dimensional jerk-limited time-optimal speed planning algorithm (3D JL-TOSP) and a lower-layer speed replanning algorithm. Firstly, in the upper layer, a vertically responsive speed profile for a given 3D path represented by a set of waypoints is desired. To achieve this, the relationship between time and vehicle responses is reconstructed, and the speed planning problem is formulated as a temporal optimization problem with constraints, solved iteratively using the slack convex feasible set (SCFS) algorithm. Secondly, the lower layer aims to plan a collision-free speed profile. To accurately quantify the impact of terrain on safety, a terrain adaptive safety distance model (TASDM) which comprehensively considers the impact of varying terrain and vehicle motion states on safety distance is designed. The TASDM is introduced to quantify the risk of collision, and the speed planning problem is described as a multi-stage decision problem. Terrain adaptive speed profile can be obtained by combining upper and lower layers. Finally, the results of co-simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the ride comfort and safety of the vehicle, the real off-road vertical responses are reduced by an average of 20.69%. Moreover, it exhibited great real-time performance and excellent generalization to off-road environments, the average success rate under different driving conditions is 96.85%.},

Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication have the potential to improve vehicle coordination and enhance the safety and efficiency of on-ramp merging. While the existing research mainly concentrates on single-lane mainline scenarios, and its applicability to multi-lane on-ramp merging scenario is limited. To address this gap, a multi-lane on-ramp merging strategy is proposed, integrating dynamic lane-changing decision-making and quasi-uniform B-spline trajectory optimization. Initially, a multi-lane dynamic lane-changing decision model is developed, leveraging lane-changing benefits and traffic flow assisted decision-making. This approach comprehensively considers vehicle surroundings, combining global road section information to enhance accuracy of lane-changing decision and overall traffic efficiency. Subsequently, a trajectory optimization model based on quasi-uniform B-splines is designed, formulating the optimization problem as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem to balance trajectory feasibility and computational load. Simulation results reveal that the proposed lane-changing decision model enhances lane-change accuracy and reduces travel delay in different mainline traffic flow proportions and mainline-ramp traffic demands, outperforming the existing model. Moreover, the proposed trajectory method surpasses other methods in safety and comfort during the merging process, with a noticeable improvement in traffic efficiency compared to SUMO&#39;s built-in algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Task offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) can advance cooperative perception (CP) to improve traffic awareness in Autonomous Vehicles. In this paper, we propose the Quality-aware Cooperative Perception Task Offloading (Q-CPTO) scheme. Q-CPTO is the first task offloading scheme that enhances traffic awareness by prioritizing the quality rather than the quantity of cooperative perception. Q-CPTO improves the quality of CP by curtailing perception redundancy and increasing the Value of Information (VOI) procured by each user. We use Kalman filters (KFs) for VOI assessment, predicting the next movement of each vehicle to estimate its region of interest. The estimated VOI is then integrated into the task offloading problem. We formulate the task offloading problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that maximizes the VOI of users and reduces perception redundancy by leveraging the spatially diverse fields of view (FOVs) of vehicles, while adhering to strict latency requirements. We also propose the Q-CPTO-Heuristic (Q-CPTO-H) scheme to solve the task offloading problem in a time-efficient manner. Extensive evaluations show that Q-CPTO significantly outperforms prominent task offloading schemes by up to 14% and 20% in terms of response delay and traffic awareness, respectively. Furthermore, Q-CPTO-H closely approaches the optimal solution, with marginal gaps of up to 1.4% and 2.1% in terms of traffic awareness and the number of collaborating users, respectively, while reducing the runtime by up to 84%.},

  abstract     = {Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) for multiple intersections is an important way to solve traffic congestion. With the development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), an increasing number of DRL methods are applied to TSC. However, the prevailing methods in DRL-based TSC does not adequately address the issue of missing data within the agent state space. Furthermore, these methods often insufficiently account for the intricate interactions and relationships among the agents involved. Therefore, a graph deep reinforcement learning traffic signal control for multiple intersections considering missing data is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose an agent state space estimation method based on wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN). This method is adept at addressing the issue of diverse types of missing data within the state space to ensure its integrity. Secondly, we propose a graph deep reinforcement learning based on two-stage attention network and GraphSage (TAGGRL) to improve TSC efficiency for multiple intersections. A dynamic interaction graph based on two-stage attention network is constructed to facilitate effective interactions among agents. GraphSAGE is constructed for aggregating multi-agent state features. Then, the decision network outputs Q-values based on the extracted features, which guide agents in executing phase-specific actions to enhance the smoothness of multiple intersections. Finally, the experimental results confirm that the agent state space estimation based on WGAN successfully solves the problem of missing data within the state space, thereby enhancing the robustness of TSC for multiple intersections. Furthermore, the TAGGRL model surpasses the baseline model in terms of TSC efficiency for multiple intersections.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate intelligent vehicles in making informed decisions and plans, the precise and efficient prediction of vehicle trajectories is imperative. However, the future trajectory of a vehicle is not solely determined by its own historical path; it is also influenced by neighboring vehicles (NVs). Hence, understanding the interactions between vehicles is crucial for trajectory prediction. Additionally, the computational challenges posed by long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) add complexity to trajectory prediction tasks. This paper introduces a novel network, named Sparse Attention Graph Convolution Network (SAGCN), designed to comprehensively consider the trajectory interaction details of multiple vehicles, optimizing the LSTF for the target vehicle (TV). Specifically, grounded in real-world driving scenarios and vehicle interaction nuances, a multi-vehicle topology graph is formulated to amalgamate the historical trajectories of the TV and the interaction trajectories of NVs. The SAGCN network employs the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to assimilate and analyze diverse features within the multi-vehicle topology graph, subsequently computing the future trajectory of the vehicle through a sparse attention mechanism. The proposed method is validated and evaluated using natural datasets. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, the SAGCN network presented attains exceptional prediction accuracy and satisfactory time efficiency when predicting the trajectories of TV in LSTF.},

This paper proposes an accurate and robust LiDAR SLAM system to achieve low-drift ego-motion estimation and globally consistent mapping for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in diverse environments. Firstly, a pyramid warm-up registration method is proposed to directly match the current scan with the map without feature extraction. More importantly, it utilizes the original geometric information to improve the registration accuracy and adopts a fast covariance matrix calculation method to greatly enhance the registration speed. Secondly, a submap generation method is proposed by formulating an anti-slip strategy and a point cloud similarity metric. It effectively prevents the loss of critical information while establishing strong constraints between keyframes and the map. Finally, a local-to-global optimization factor graph is constructed by establishing multi-level constraint relationships to optimize the overall system accuracy. The proposed method is compared with the current state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods on several challenging datasets, including the KITTI, NeBula, and Newer College datasets. Experimental results show that our method has higher trajectory estimation accuracy and map consistency, and performs robustly in disparate environments.},

  abstract     = {Powertrain electrification is an effective solution to reducing emissions of construction machinery. However, working hydraulic system of existing electric wheel loaders are centralized load-sensing (LS) system. The LS system suffers from low energy efficiency because of valve throttling losses. Therefore, an independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive (VSD) with separate layout, normal pump speed and closed circuit is proposed to increase the efficiency of working hydraulic system and electric wheel loader. The VSD is powered by a variable-speed electric motor and a fixed pump without throttle control valve, eliminating throttling losses. Besides, the separate VSD utilizes commercially available electric motor and pump, interconnecting actuator via hydraulic pipelines. The system components are modeled in detail and the influence of pipeline is considered in simulation analysis. A mode-based control strategy for the proposed powertrain is developed. The simulation study is carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed separate design and control strategy. The powertrain operation and energy comparison between proposed powertrain and baseline powertrain are conducted. Results demonstrate the efficiency of independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive improves from 36.9% to 70.6% compared to centralized LS system. Furthermore, the proposed powertrain reduces energy consumption by 32.3% compared with baseline powertrain.},

While many studies have utilized calibrated physical car-following models (CFM) and machine learning techniques for trajectory prediction, these approaches often falter in complex, dynamic traffic scenarios. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces PS-TrajGAIL , a generative adversarial imitation learning framework tailored for urban vehicle trajectory generation. Contrary to conventional discriminative models, PS-TrajGAIL employs a generative model to capture the inherent distribution of urban vehicle trajectories. This framework models the tasks of trajectory generation as a partially observable Markov decision process based on imitation learning. PS-TrajGAIL ’s architecture features a generator, which simulates vehicle behavior to produce synthetic trajectories, and a discriminator that distinguishes between authentic and generated trajectories. In addition, the driving policy within the generator is fine-tuned using the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) algorithm, ensuring safety in vehicle driving. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets highlight that PS-TrajGAIL notably surpasses existing baselines and state-of-the-art approaches in trajectory generation.},

In order to further improve the accuracy and stability of dynamic target positioning, based on the combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) ranging information, the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm is used to process the measurement data of dynamic target. Since it is difficult to determine the system model noise and measurement noise under dynamic conditions, this paper introduces adaptive factor and dynamic window adjustment based on the covariance matching method, then proposes an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) combination positioning method integrating UWB and GPS. In this method, the GPS single point positioning based on the sliding window AKF algorithm of covariance matching is used when the target is in the linear motion state. Under the condition of nonlinear motion of the target, the UWB/GPS integrated location is on account of the adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) algorithm which imports the filter divergence criterion. The simulation results confirm that the combined positioning method can adapt to the dynamic positioning requirements in complex environment and outperforms the traditional KF. The developed filtering algorithm has high adaptability, strong robustness, and can effectively improve the positioning accuracy.},

A three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) vehicle dynamic model is constructed including lateral motion, yaw motion and roll motion. Additionally, an error tracking model is developed and the tire model is fitted by experimental data from 235/55 R19 tires. A parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted on the weight coefficients of the control output. The sensitivity analysis is used to assess the vehicular states in the phase space. The stable region is determined by side slip angle, yaw rate, and load transfer ratio (LTR) in this space. An adaptive weight (AW) coefficient allocation law is determined by the current states and the stable boundary. A quadratic penalty method is used to solve the quadratic programming (QP) problem to meet the real-time testing requirements. To validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed algorithm, simulations and field tests under different driving conditions are performed on a four-wheel vehicle. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the trajectory tracking performance of the proposed controller is better than the traditional MPC. Further, the experimental test shows the feasibility by reducing the MAX and RMS of tracking performance up to 11.4% compared to MPC approach without AW.},

The Integrated Gradient (IG), a prominent attribution-based explainable artificial intelligence method, offers an effective solution for explaining and diagnosing ML models. However, IG is primarily designed for deep neural network models, hindering its broader applicability to various structured machine-learning models. Moreover, the issue of selecting a suitable single baseline point in IG methods still needs to be solved. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a model-agnostic explainable technique called the Expected Integral Discrete Gradient (EIDG). This approach extends the capabilities of IG to encompass a wide range of machine-learning models by leveraging numerical differentiation. It replaces the previous single baseline point scheme with a distributed multi-baseline method to reveal how varying baselines affect the output. Our method is thoroughly evaluated on standard machine learning models, targeting scenarios in autonomous driving scenarios, thereby validating its effectiveness in explaining and diagnosing models. Our work will inspire and equip developers and users with the necessary tools to promote the adoption of attribution explanations across various machine-learning domains.},

  abstract     = {In Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS), vehicles can disseminate announcements to the traffic Application Server (AS) and nearby vehicles to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. To build reliable dissemination environments, various threshold announcement approaches are proposed, wherein receivers accept a traffic event only when $t$ (threshold) vehicles have endorsed it. Among these approaches, group signature-based approaches have emerged as promising choices for C-ITS due to their optimal tradeoff among certificate management, privacy protection, and traceability. However, existing group signature-based approaches have three limitations: 1) Announcement verification is time-consuming, making them unable to meet the fast authentication requirement of C-ITS. 2) Receivers face significant storage burdens in maintaining numerous traffic events and endorsements. 3) Unsuitable for vehicle-to-AS announcement dissemination as their one-by-one dissemination mode would impose unaffordable costs to the central AS, which limits their applicability in certain scenarios. To overcome these issues, we design an efficient group signature scheme tailored to reliable anonymous announcement dissemination. Building upon this scheme, we further present a novel threshold anonymous announcement protocol, which optimizes the announcement&#39;s dissemination mode and enables efficient batch verification. Specifically, instead of the traditional one-by-one dissemination, a compressed anonymous announcement with $t$ endorsements is disseminated to receivers. This dissemination mode facilitates immediate announcement processing, eliminates the need for extensive traffic information maintenance, and is suitable for both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-AS announcement dissemination scenarios. Meanwhile, regardless of the threshold $t$ , the announcement can be verified with only a small constant number of pairing and scalar multiplication operations. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our protocol achieves the expected properties, and extensive simulation results show that our protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art protocols, indicating the performance and practicability of our protocol.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the cooperative vehicle and infrastructure systems (CVIS), trajectory planning for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provides a promising solution to the management of merging vehicles at a freeway on-ramp. Existing studies mainly focus on the planning of trajectory profiles or trajectory points at each time step assuming CAVs can exactly follow such planned trajectories. However, challenges arise due to high computational burden and limited communication bandwidth in the near future where low-level CAVs and Regular Vehicles (RVs) coexist. This study introduces the concept of Critical Trajectory Points (CTPs) and establishes a CTP planning model to guide merging CAVs at a freeway on-ramp under the mixed traffic environment. A quintic polynomial trajectory model is applied to describe the lane-changing (LC) process of a merging CAV. The moving trajectories of potential collision points and the minimum safety spacing prediction model are derived. Considering feasibility and safety, the CTP planning model is formulated as a nonlinear optimization model to optimize the CTPs for CAVs within the control zone. The objective of the model includes maximizing the average speed and minimizing the LC time of merging vehicles within the control zone. Genetic Algorithm is designed for solutions. CTP strategy is more applicable to CAV merging guidance than complete trajectory strategy, especially with the accessible technologies in the near future. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed model from the perspective of system optimum, even at low penetration rates of CAVs.},

Additionally, due to a limited availability of frequency spectrum, the implementation of vehicular coordination, using full duplex communication relays is a cognizant solution. To this end, a compact, bi-static, circularly polarized antenna is proposed for full duplex relay based communication. The prototype is composed of a square slot antenna and a stacked microstrip patch antenna radiating right hand circularly polarized waves. Both antennas are integrated vertically leading to an overall compact footprint of 45 mm $\boldsymbol{\times}$ 38 mm (0.87 $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{\boldsymbol{0}}$ $\boldsymbol{\times}$ 0.73 $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{\boldsymbol{0}}$ , $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{\boldsymbol{0}}$ is the free-space wavelength at center frequency). The measured results of slot antenna demonstrate a broad impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 5.5 to 6.2 GHz, axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of 5.63 to 6.48 GHz with a peak gain of 7.6 dBic at resonance frequency of 5.9 GHz, while for the stacked microstrip patch antenna, the IBW of 5.58 to 6.1 GHz, the ARBW of 5.61 to 6.25 GHz and peak gain of 5.7 dBic have been realized. The measured results are in conformance with the simulated results. For in-band full duplex operation, the prototype provides an IBW ( $\boldsymbol{| S_{11} |&amp;lt;}$ −10 dB) of 5.58 to 6.1 GHz and an ARBW (&lt;3 dB) of 5.63 to 6.25 GHz, leading to an overlaying frequency band of 5.63 to 6.1 GHz.

  abstract     = {A mixed traffic flow with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will persist for a long time. It is essential to utilize the limited road resources of freeways to improve traffic efficiency in the traffic flow environment. To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimization model for freeway lane management strategies. Firstly, three lane management strategies, dedicated lane (DL), general lane (GL), and mixed lane (ML), are introduced. Secondly, the capacity model of different lane management strategies is derived based on headway and its probability. Then, an optimization model for freeway lane management is developed. The objective function is freeway throughput, and the constraints are traffic demand, heterogeneous traffic flow distribution balance, and fair allocation of road resources for heterogeneous traffic flow. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that (1) the throughput of freeway segments increases with the penetration rate (PR) of CAVs; (2) when the PR reaches a certain level, the formation of CAVs platoons has a significant impact on the throughput of freeways; (3) different lane management strategies exhibit significant differences in the throughput of freeways. Given the traffic demand and PR, there is an optimal combination of lane management strategies. Therefore, the proposed model can theoretically support lane management of freeways in the mixed traffic environment.},

We propose a track-before-detect labeled multi-Bernoulli filter, which directly utilizes the signals received from the sensor array as the measurement in the form of a sample-covariance matrix (SCM). Using the unthresholded sensor data avoids creating bearing measurements and thus alleviates the challenges in the presence of multiple targets and high levels of background noise. The SCM measurement is affected by multiple targets in an additive fashion, which causes multi-dimensional integrals in measurement updating. We employ a change of variables and complex inverse-Wishart approximations to derive the closed-form solutions, which ensures the filter is computationally tractable. Moreover, sequential Monte Carlo implementation is provided, complemented by an adaptive birth procedure based on the current SCM measurement. Simulation results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed filter in challenging scenarios of low signal-to-noise ratio, small number of snapshots, trajectory crossing, and fluctuating received signal power.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces security threats from malicious entities that endanger vehicles. However, traditional centralized networks have limitations in scalability, latency, and security. Decentralized blockchain architectures provide an alternative, though conventional blockchains also have restrictions. We develop an architecture based on IOTA&#39;s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger tailored to IoV needs to enhance traceability, throughput, and security. The goal is to leverage IOTA&#39;s decentralized, high throughput, low latency design to overcome limitations in existing IoV networks. We propose an IOTA-based model using smart contracts for malicious data/user tracing and timing side-channels for attack detection. We adaptively schedule data to optimize throughput based on traffic conditions. Our simulations compare throughput, latency, and attack detection across varied scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the architecture enables automated security via decentralized consensus, avoiding centralized failures. The smart contracts facilitate real-time threat tracing and mitigation. Timing analysis reveals IOTA&#39;s ability to identify attacks through latency fluctuations. Optimized data transfer scheduling adapts to congestion levels. Overall, integrating reputation systems, smart contracts, and IOTA&#39;s innovations significantly improves security, efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized and blockchain IoV networks. This work advances IoV security by outlining a comprehensive blockchain solution leveraging IOTA&#39;s unique capabilities. The decentralized mechanisms enhance traceability and trust while optimizing performance tailored to vehicular demands. This establishes a foundation for reliable and safe autonomous driving through innovations in distributed ledger technology.},

This paper proposes a cooperative hunting method for multi-USVs based on trajectory prediction by obstacle relation long short-term memory (OR-LSTM). First, the historical target trajectory is preprocessed by univariate nonlinear regression, and the obstacle information is input to OR-LSTM to predict the trajectory of the target, with improved accuracy and convergence. A bionic-based cooperative hunting strategy is proposed, by which multi-USVs ambush the predicted trajectory of the target by simulating the hunting strategy of lions. When the target is close to the ambush position, the multi-USVs start to hunt it. Two groups of simulation experiments were implemented on the Unity 3D platform to validate the proposed algorithm, which had higher accuracy and faster convergence in target trajectory prediction than the traditional algorithm, and higher efficiency in target hunting.},

For networked USVs, ignoring network limitations can cause serious sailing incidents. Therefore, we developed a DOCC design with a limited number of communication channels and a restricted communication range. The proposed optimal control system includes two subsystems: coordinated trajectory optimization and local trajectory tracking control. The first employs a delicately designed auxiliary system to determine the optimal solution for each USV. To address the scarcity and intermittency of communication channels, we also develop an intermittent interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (IIPETM) in the auxiliary system. The second subsystem adopts a neural network-based backstepping approach to achieve the tracking objective. Compared with the existing methods, the developed algorithm can interleave the triggering instants for different USVs and ensure system stability, even under communication interruptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme through numerical simulations of USVs.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is essential for improving the reliability and efficiency of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, since link failures and frequent handovers can be alleviated by foreseeing positions of vehicles. Yet, accurate prediction is difficult due to complex interaction and multimodal motions. Deep learning methods are dedicated to addressing these challenging issues and hence surpass traditional physics-based models dramatically. However, current methods mainly model interaction based on spatial relationship while overlooking dynamics-aware interaction, which hinders comprehensive perception. When dealing with multimodality, stochastic latent space without proper goals as regularization is generated to enable one-to-many mapping between historical and future trajectories, which restrains inference accuracy. To tackle these problems, a multimodal and dynamics-aware interaction neural network, MODA, is proposed for vehicle trajectory prediction. To handle dynamics-aware interaction, a graph attention network is conducted. By taking each vehicle as a node and interaction as an edge, self-attention mechanism adaptively calculates edge strength between nodes, which acts as dynamics importance between vehicles for interactive aggregation. To facilitate multimodality, conditional variational autoencoder is incorporated, where supervisory information regularizes the latent space of a recognition network in the training phase for goal orientation. The proposed model is evaluated on two real-world highway datasets: NGSIM I-80 and US-101. The experiments demonstrate that MODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the increasing integration of intelligent modules into vehicles, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have increasingly assumed a pivotal role in augmenting driver safety. As an ITS, vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) not only establish a secure traffic environment for users but also provides them with an efficient means of exchanging traffic information. However, during vehicle communication processes, security challenges such as the leakage of vehicle privacy information and tampering with shared task information must be addressed. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized anonymous authentication and secure traffic task information-sharing scheme based on blockchain and zk-SNARK. Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to securely and efficiently store and share task information in a fully decentralized manner. Vehicle users anonymously participate in tasks within VANETs using pseudonym information generated during registration with a trusted authority (TA). Additionally, by employing zk-SNARK to generate zero-knowledge proofs, the validity and integrity of task information can be verified without revealing any private information. Performance comparisons indicate that the proposed scheme enhances the security of vehicle-to-roadside unit (V2R) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications while reducing communication and computational costs.},

For the PTC tracking control strategy, the expected tracking time can be pre-specified directly without over-prediction of utilizing the system parameters. Concretely, compared with the finite/fixed-time control, the upper bound of the convergence time of PTC is irrelevant to initial states, communication topology information, and certain parameters. Moreover, the magnitude of the initial control input is reduced when the difference between the initial states is large, such that the saturation problem will hopefully be eliminated in the PTC algorithm. Then, the dynamic ETC is proposed by introducing the internal variables to reduce the triggering times further. Subsequently, the STC scheme is presented to exclude continuous monitoring, including self-state monitoring, which reduces energy consumption to a great extent. Furthermore, both the triggering strategies can avoid Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Deepreinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in complex autonomous driving scenarios. However, DRL models inevitably bring high memory consumption and computation, which hinders their wide deployment in resource-limited autonomous driving devices. Structured Pruning has been recognized as a useful method to compress and accelerate DRL models, but it is still challenging to estimate the contribution of a parameter (i.e., neuron) to DRL models. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic structured pruning approach that gradually removes a DRL model&#39;s unimportant neurons during the training stage. Our method consists of two steps, i.e. training DRL models with a group sparse regularizer and removing unimportant neurons with a dynamic pruning threshold. To efficiently train the DRL model with a small number of important neurons, we employ a neuron-importance group sparse regularizer. In contrast to conventional regularizers, this regularizer imposes a penalty on redundant groups of neurons that do not significantly influence the output of the DRL model. Furthermore, we design a novel structured pruning strategy to dynamically determine the pruning threshold and gradually remove unimportant neurons with a binary mask. Therefore, our method can remove not only redundant groups of neurons of the DRL model but also achieve high and robust performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive with existing DRL pruning methods on discrete control environments (i.e., CartPole-v1 and LunarLander-v2) and MuJoCo continuous environments (i.e., Hopper-v3 and Walker2D-v3). Specifically, our method effectively compresses 93% neurons and 96% weights of the DRL model in four challenging DRL environments with slight accuracy degradation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a compact non-canonical non-uniform conformal phased array antenna (NNCPAA) attached to an irregular UAV surface to overcome the space and aerodynamic constraints for high-gain, wide-scan applications. The NNCPAA is parametrically determined using a geometric sequence for the x -axial spacings of array elements in the center rows to manipulate the elevation scan, while the y -axial spacings take care of the azimuth scan. It outperforms its equal-aperture uniform conformal counterpart before amplitude or phase synthesizing as it can achieve a lower sidelobe level, a smaller elevation-scan angle, and a wider 2D scanning coverage. Moreover, based on the proposed NNCPAA, a co-design method is developed for a compact high-performance onboard system at 5.8 GHz. By using improved miniature elements, the inter-element mutual coupling is reduced and all elements can be directly attached to the locally flat parts of the actual UAV surface, thus without any mechanical support added to the whole system. The experiments show that the onboard system achieves a peak gain of 21.8 dBi, a high efficiency of 88.4%, and scanning ranges exceeding 51° and ±28° with small scanning losses of 2.2 dB and 0.5 dB in elevation and azimuth, respectively. Therefore, the designed NNCPAA system is promising for UAV-based wireless communication (e.g., V2X) and remote sensing.},

  abstract     = {Future transportation systems are primarily based on the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, to fully unleash the potential of IoV, Network Virtualization (NV) is regarded as one of the key enablers. With NV, heterogeneous service requests can be deployed quickly, cost-effectively, and on-demand on a shareable infrastructure to meet stringent resource requirements. Virtual Network Embedding (VNE), one of the main challenges in NV, has been extensively investigated in the data-center paradigm, in which the network topology is static. Some existing VNE solutions have tackled the VNE problem in data-center networks while considering IoV demands, but very few have directly solved the problem considering vehicle mobility. Therefore, solving the online VNE problem in dynamic IoV environments, where connected and moving vehicles function as physical nodes to handle network service requests, still remains at an early stage. Towards that end, this paper proposes a novel heuristic algorithm that efficiently ranks available moving vehicles based on multiple network attributes, their neighborhood information, and the correlation of preceding mappings to tackle the online VNE problem in IoV. Moreover, we investigated the performance of several VNE algorithms using the Random Waypoint mobility model on different sizes of the Substrate Network (SN). We also introduce additional performance metrics to demonstrate the impact of vehicle mobility. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than state-of-the-art VNE algorithms in multiple performance metrics.},

In this work, the channel QSRs in a vehicular communication (V2X) generic high-dense urban environment at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies (28 GHz) have been analyzed using different approaches, such as the extended channel response into a Doppler-delay domain or the shadow fading spatial auto-correlation function (SF ACF) methodology. Then, the QSRs have been used as sampling distance in an in-house developed three-dimensional ray-launching (3D-RL) algorithm as an acceleration approach. The time variant channel features have been extracted and compared with the full resolution approach, obtaining consistent results when considering the QSR sampling distances, while decreasing by 83.30% the simulation computational time for the Doppler-delay approach, and 92.86% for the SF ACF method.},

However, for dynamic systems with mobile nodes, positioning and antenna alignment are continuous processes that cannot be perfectly achieved in practical conditions. To this end, we investigate the performance of the NOMA system in the presence of tracking and antenna misalignment errors and show that even antenna misalignment errors of less than one degree can affect the performance of the considered NOMA system based on directional THz antennas. In this paper, by considering real channel parameters, such as real 3D array antenna patterns and positioning estimation errors, a comprehensive modeling of the considered NOMA system is provided, which is used to obtain the closed-form expressions of the probability distribution function of the channel gain, the bit error rate, and the channel capacity. Moreover, a set of simulation and analytical results is explored and discussed to investigate the performance of the considered NOMA system and the impact of different parameters.},

The impact of UAV wobbling is modeled by two stochastic processes, i.e., the canonical Wiener process and the more realistic sinusoidal process. In contrast, the aggregate impact of all hardware impairments is modeled as two multiplicative and additive distortion noise processes. We then rigorously characterize the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the wireless channel, using which we provide a comprehensive analysis of four key channel-related metrics: i) power delay profile (PDP), ii) coherence time, iii) coherence bandwidth, and iv) power spectral density (PSD) of the distortion-plus-noise process. Furthermore, we evaluate these metrics with reasonable UAV wobbling and hardware impairment models to obtain useful insights. Notably, we demonstrate that even for small UAV wobbling, the coherence time severely degrades at high frequencies, which renders air-to-ground channel estimation very difficult at these frequencies. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that characterizes the joint impact of UAV wobbling and hardware impairments on the air-to-ground wireless channel.},

However, due to the interference and coverage hole issues of UAV-assisted aerial 3D communications, how to design a suitable UAV trajectory is crucial for the performance of future 6G-UAV. In order to achieve a balance between the communication quality and mission accomplishment, we define an environmental model with random interference and formulate a trajectory optimization problem to improve the communication coverage performance in high mobility conditions. By setting an interference point in the highly dynamic networks, we propose a novel trajectory optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the overall task execution delay and expected outage duration. The received data information of UAVs is used for double deep $q$ -network (DDQN) training while the prioritized empirical replay architecture in the prioritized replay deep $q$ network (DQN) is utilized to select the best UAV action, avoid the UAV flying into the random interference points, and reduce the random interference. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

In our study, a contract-based incentive mechanism is investigated to tackle the incentive mechanism for joint data sensing and communication (IMJDSC) within the asymmetric information context. The IMJDSC optimization problem is formulated as achieving the maximum utility of the MCS platform subjected to individually rational and incentive compatible constraints. The sufficient and necessary conditions of the feasible contract are derived to deduce the optimal reward strategy.

However, it is important to recognize that deep learning-based SemCom is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which pose significant security risks to ICVs. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate these security risks before integrating SemCom into ICVs. To this end, this study introduces a novel backdoor attack known as Covert Semantic Backdoor Attack (CSBA), specifically designed for SemCom-enabled ICVs. Unlike existing backdoor attack techniques that rely on noticeable triggers, CSBA analyzes the self-contained semantics in transmitted images to determine if they contain the target semantic required for initiating a backdoor attack. Moreover, in the event of an attack by CSBA, the target semantics disappear from the recovered image while the rest of the image remains unchanged, ensuring that the attack remains invisible. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and the stealthiness of the proposed CSBA schemes across various wireless channel conditions and attack ratios.},

To overcome the effect of channel uncertainties and improve transmission robustness, in this paper, we study a robust RA algorithm to maximize the overall throughput for a downlink multiuser SR network, where the separated channel uncertainty model and the non-linear energy harvesting model are considered. Furthermore, based on the Lagrange dual theory and the interior point method, we propose an iteration-based RA algorithm to obtain the closed-form solution of the transmit power and the suboptimal solutions of other variables. The simulation results verify that the outage probability of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 25.28% compared to the existing algorithms.},

Firstly, the CH-CM assignment problem is formulated as a coalition formation game (CFG). It&#39;s proved that the CFG with the two-side best order is an exact potential game (EPG), which can significantly mitigate co-channel interference and hostile jamming. Secondly, the CH-DN matching problem is formulated as a bilateral many-to-one matching game.

Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.},

The UAV takes off from the depot, completes the pickup and delivery tasks, and returns to the depot; it needs to maintain a reliable connection with the ground base station (GBS) during the UAV&#39;s flight. In the mission, the energy consumption of the UAV is closely related to the order of pickup and delivery as well as the weight of the goods. Therefore, this paper achieves the goal of minimizing UAV energy consumption and designing UAV flight trajectory by optimizing the access sequence. In this paper, we first construct a radio map of the target area, and then we propose an improved Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm to calculate the path which is the shortest between any two access points that satisfies reliable communication. Then, using the constructed distance matrix, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the UAV trajectory of the minimum energy pickup and delivery problem (PDP). Finally, through the simulation analysis of traditional PDP and energy-efficient PDP on the python platform, it can be found that our proposed minimum energy consumption PDP saves about 20% of energy consumption compared with the traditional PDP without considering energy consumption.},

However, mmWave signals are sensitive to blockages. Existing solutions to reduce blockage are to deploy UAVs using a probabilistic blockage model, which may fail to match the actual blockage status. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a practical scheme to predict the link blockage and deploy multiple UAVs to provide anti-blockage mmWave transmission for terrestrial users (UEs). It can accurately predict link blockage via location information of UAVs and UEs, along with historical blockage status without prior knowledge of building blockages, such as shape, size, or location. Particularly, the scheme schedules UAVs to fly over the target area, gathering the positions of UEs and blockage status, which is then employed to train a link geometric feature based blockage prediction model to acquire the blockage status for any desired UAV locations. Then, a multi-agent $Q$ -learning based method is adopted to determine the positions of UAVs through an iterative process that alternates between position optimization and blockage prediction. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can effectively avoid blockages and enhance the sum rate compared to benchmark methods.},

This correspondence proposes a knowledge base-based high compression ratio CSI feedback scheme (Knowledge Base Network, KBNet) for millimeter wave RIS-assisted wireless communication. The scheme employs a learnable knowledge base to approximate the distribution of CSI features and only needs to transmit the indexes of the vectors in the knowledge base that are most similar to the CSI feature, which can achieve accurate recovery of CSI under the condition of improving compression ratio.

NOMA-ALOHA is a hybrid ALOHA, where the transmitted information exploits NOMA in the physical layer and slotted ALOHA protocol in the medium access control (MAC) layer. In addition, a prioritized burst repetition (PBR) is proposed to improve the throughput of NOMA-ALOHA. The main idea is to reduce collision by exploiting burst repetition based on priority in MAC and iterative cancellation in the receivers. The asymptotic throughput is derived using density evolution, and the simulation results validate that PBR substantially improves the existing NOMA-ALOHA.},

We address the challenge of minimizing mean-square-error (MSE) of the AP, while considering transmit power constraints at both the AP and the sensors, as well as ensuring the covert transmission to Willie with a low detection error probability (DEP).

A novel approach based on fractional programming (FP) has unveiled the optimal beamforming structure (OBS) for RSMA. This method, combined with a hyperplane fixed point iteration (HFPI) approach, named FP-HFPI, provides suboptimal beamforming solutions with identical sum rate performance but much lower computational complexity compared to WMMSE. Inspired by such an approach, in this work, a novel deep unfolding framework based on FP-HFPI, named rate-splitting-beamforming neural network (RS-BNN), is proposed to unfold the FP-HFPI algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed RS-BNN attains a level of performance closely matching that of WMMSE and FP-HFPI, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity.},

We focus on a fundamental configuration with one massive-antenna base station (BS) and one single-antenna communication user (CU). The wireless channel exhibits sparsity and consists of multiple paths associated with scatterers detectable via radar sensing. Under this setup, the BS first sends downlink pilots to the CU and concurrently receives the echo pilot signals for sensing the surrounding scatterers. Subsequently, the CU sends feedback information on its received pilot signal to the BS. Accordingly, the BS determines the sparse basis based on the sensed scatterers and proceeds to recover the wireless channel, exploiting the feedback information based on advanced compressive sensing (CS) algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed sensing-assisted approach significantly increases the overall achievable rate than the conventional design relying on a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based sparse basis without sensing, thanks to the reduced training overhead and enhanced recovery accuracy with limited feedback.},

  abstract     = {Edge-device co-inference, which concerns the cooperation between edge devices and an edge server for completing inference tasks over wireless networks, has been a promising technique for enabling various kinds of intelligent services at the network edge, e.g., auto-driving. In this paradigm, the concerned design objective of the network shifts from the traditional communication throughput to the effective and efficient execution of the inference task underpinned by the network, measured by, e.g., the inference accuracy and latency. In this paper, a task-oriented over-the-air computation scheme is proposed for a multi-device artificial intelligence system. Particularly, a novel tractable inference accuracy metric is proposed for classification tasks, which is called minimum pair-wise discriminant gain. Unlike prior work measuring the average of all class pairs in feature space, it measures the minimum distance of all class pairs. By maximizing the minimum pair-wise discriminant gain instead of its average counterpart, any pair of classes can be better separated in the feature space, and thus leading to a balanced and improved inference accuracy for all classes. Besides, this paper jointly optimizes the minimum discriminant gain of all feature elements instead of separately maximizing that of each element in the existing designs. As a result, the transmit power can be adaptively allocated to the feature elements according to their different contributions to the inference accuracy, opening an extra degree of freedom to improve inference performance. Extensive experiments are conducted using a concrete use case of human motion recognition to verify the superiority of the proposed design over the benchmarking scheme.},

By analysing the distribution of the per-steam age of information, analytical expressions of the time-average AoSIs under the different patterns are derived. Based on the time-average AoSI, it is found that: The SYN pattern always outperforms the ASY pattern in terms of the TSS; The TSS difference becomes greater with the improvement of the channel conditions; The maximum time-average AoSI difference is a quarter of the update transmission time. Numerical results indicate that: The TSS becomes worse with the increase of the asynchronization level; The TSS can be improved significantly through enhancing the updating synchronization, particularly when the channel conditions are favorable.},

  abstract     = {As a kind of wavefront with helical phase, orbital angular momentum (OAM) shows the great potential to enhance the security results of wireless communications due to its unique orthogonality and central hollow electromagnetic wave structure. Therefore, in this paper we propose the reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) assisted OAM scheme, where RIS is deployed to weaken the information acquisition at eavesdroppers by adjusting the OAM beams pointed to the eavesdropper and artificial noise (AN) is applied to interfere with the eavesdropper, thus significantly increasing the secrecy rates of short-range secure communications. Aiming at obtaining the maximum secrecy rate, we develop the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG) based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to assign much power to low-order OAM-modes and optimize the OAM beams direction with the programmable RIS, thus respectively enhancing and weakening the received signal strength at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing works in terms of the secrecy rate and the eavesdropper&#39;s bit error rate.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to introduce the cell load estimation problem of cell switching approaches in wireless networks—specifically presented in a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-assisted network. The problem arises from the fact that the traffic loads of sleeping base stations for the next time slot cannot be perfectly known; they can rather be estimated, and any estimation error could result in divergence from the optimal decision, which subsequently affects the performance of energy efficiency. The traffic loads of the sleeping base stations for the next time slot are required because the switching decisions are made proactively in the current time slot. Two different $Q$ -learning algorithms are developed: one is full-scale, focusing solely on the performance, while the other is lightweight and addresses the computational cost. Results confirm that the estimation error is capable of changing cell switching decisions, yielding performance divergence compared to no-error scenarios. Moreover, the developed $Q$ -learning algorithms perform well since an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.3%) is observed between them and the optimum algorithm.},

This benchmark effectively measures the timeliness and confidentiality of data transfers in secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted uplink communication systems. To facilitate the SDOR analysis, we consider height-dependent probabilistic Line-of-Sight (LoS) channels subject to Rician fading effects and employ a computing model strategy for task offloading. Additionally, we implement a UAV scheduling strategy to enhance the channel capacity for legitimate users. We derive the closed-form expression of the SDOR and conduct an asymptotic analysis in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes for deeper insights. Through analytical and numerical results, we examine the impact of environmental conditions, transmit power, task offload ratio, and the volume of transmitted data on the overall system performance. This work not only advances the theoretical framework of SDOR analysis for task offloading in smart farming applications but also paves the way for future research in secure UAV-assisted communication networks.},

However, with the down-tilted base station (BS) antennas in most current cellular systems, the UAVs may be served by the sidelobes with a high probability and suffer significant handover delay. It is challenging to provide seamless low latency connectivity for such UAV systems. In this paper, we propose a flight direction-based handover scheme in cellular-connected UAV communications to reduce the handover rate. Specifically, the ‘flight angle’ of the UAV is reflected in the change rate of reference signal received power (RSRP). When the handover triggering condition is met during the time to trigger (TTT), we adopt the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to predict the RSRP in future slots. Then, the change rate in RSRP and the RSRP threshold can be used to make the handover decision. Simulation results show that the proposed handover scheme can significantly reduce the handover rate with a relatively small drop in RSRP, especially in the case of larger antenna arrays.},

However, the non-uniform spacing between array elements poses a challenge for applying classical spatial smoothing methods and similar techniques to achieve coherent signal angle estimation. In this paper, we leverage array motion to achieve signal decorrelation, facilitating accurate estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) angles for coherent signals. First, by exploiting the motion of a parallel coprime array, we construct a new cross-covariance matrix (CCM), which can be vectorized to obtain the difference coarray even with coherent signal, and can transform the 2-D angle estimation into one-dimensional (1-D) angle estimation at the same time. Second, with the vectorized CCM, an off-grid sparse representation approach, coupled with joint sparse recovery technology, is considered to obtain accurate angle estimation. In contrast to the existing approach, the proposed method can conduct 2-D angle estimation without requiring prior knowledge of the source count, which makes it more applicable in practice. The validity and superiority of the proposed method are confirmed through simulation.},

The maximum average age of information (AoI) among users is minimized by jointly optimizing the time interval allocation, power allocation and UAV trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function and coupled variables. Thus, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by dividing the problem into three sub-problems, which thus can be efficiently solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed U-IRS design can significantly improve the AoI performance as compared to the UAV relay design and the packet error rate (PER) minimized U-IRS design. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of IRS elements has a compromise effect on the AoI performance. On the one hand, it helps to achieve higher beamforming gain for further improving the transmission reliability and thus better compensating for the packet error owing to using short packet. On the other hand, it leads to higher channel eatimation overhead for reaping the beamforming gain, which however introduces unfavorable larger delay. As a result, while the IRS elements number exceeds a certain value, the AoI performance no more improves but degrades instead.},

  abstract     = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is to identify the modulation format of the received signal corrupted by the channel effects and noise. Most existing works focus on the impact of noise while relatively little attention has been paid to the impact of channel effects. However, the instability posed by multipath fading channels leads to significant performance degradation. To mitigate the adverse effects of the multipath channel, we propose a channel-robust modulation classification framework named companding spectral quotient cumulant classification (CSQCC) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, we first transform the received signal to the companding spectral quotient (CSQ) sequence by spectral circular shift division operations and modified $\text{-}$ sigmoid function mapping. Secondly, we extract the companding spectral quotient cumulants (CSQCs) from the CSQ sequence. At last, the CSQCs serve as the inputs to train the artificial neural network (ANN) classifier and use the trained ANN to make the final decisions. Notably, the classifier is only trained using the data under the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel condition but tested under Rician multipath fading channel. Simulation results show that the proposed CSQCC method performs robust and superior classification performance when subjected to unknown Rician multipath fading channels, in comparison to other methods. Specifically, the proposed CSQCC method achieves nearly 100% classification accuracy at the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 4 dB when testing under multiple channels but only training under AWGN channel.},

Some existing works have considered such problems under transceiver hardware impairments but neglected the practical model of RIS. Moreover, their performance still leaves room for improvement. To address these issues, RIS passive beamforming is re-optimized in this paper to maximize spectrum efficiency, taking into account both transceiver hardware impairments and practical RIS model. We deal with the fractional structure of the problem by using the quadratic transform. The remaining sub-problems are addressed utilizing the penalty-based method and the difference-of-convex programming. Since all sub-problems have closed-form solutions, our method is highly efficient. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our method.

In previous studies employing RSMA for CF-mMIMO network, all access points (APs) were assumed to provide common message service. However, with the RF chain limitation in the HB architecture, APs can not provide all services and therefore AP-service association is essential. To handle it, we first propose to design the analog beamformers in a heuristic manner. Then an optimization problem for the maximization of the tradeoff between SE and EE, where digital precoders and AP-service association are jointly considered, is formulated and finally transformed into a tractable second-order cone programming (SOCP) one.

  abstract     = {Near-ultrasound acoustic localization has emerged as a cost-effective and precise technique for indoor localization. Acoustic Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) identification is essential in indoor localization systems. Current NLOS identification approaches predominantly utilize Matched Filter (MF) characteristics or signal spectrum output. However, these methods often fail to deliver adequate identification performance in cross-scenario environments, including those that employ statistical analysis and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel NLOS identification method specifically designed for near-ultrasound localization signals. Our approach utilizes an enhanced Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technique to obtain an improved intermediate frequency (IF) signal. Subsequently, a subset of eight distinct features is extracted and selected from the IF signal. The features are then employed to enhance an XGBoost classifier for the identification of NLOS conditions. Experimental results across three scenarios demonstrate that our method attains a classification accuracy of 99.9% within identical-room settings, and achieves accuracies of 93.73% and 86.20% in cross-scenario environments, respectively.

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) channels exhibit unique sparse properties in the delay-Doppler-angle (DDA) dimension. In this paper, we are dedicated to exploring how to utilize these special sparse properties to design an efficient channel estimation algorithm to balance the computational cost and estimation accuracy. To this end, we propose an iterative 3D efficient subspace pursuit (3D-ESP) channel estimation algorithm by exploiting these unique properties. Firstly, we invent a novel subspace pursuit technique to efficiently locate channel supports by detecting multiple dominant paths per iteration. Secondly, we adopt least squares twice in each iteration to optimize the estimation accuracy. Thirdly, we propose a noise-adaptive criterion to filter the estimated channels to promote the estimation accuracy in high-level noise cases. The performance verification results show that, compared to the classical 3D-SOMP, the 3D-ESP reduces the runtime by a range of 17.19% to 45.15%, and meanwhile decreases the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 12.29% to 21.82%, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 0 dB and the antenna number goes from 1 to 20.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of sophisticated applications and vertical services results in ever more complex mobile networks. Hence radio access network (RAN) slicing based on the traditional private network architecture is struggling to satisfy the resultant diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. The fledgling next-generation Open RAN is capable of creating a large number of virtual network slices, with the promise of meeting these challenges. However, the existing slicing schemes fail to lend themselves to seamless integration with Open RAN due to offering no customized function splitting capability and owing to having a single time granularity. Therefore, we consider three typical customized RAN slices, namely, the high-throughput slices, the low-delay slices and the wide-coverage slices based upon the same underlying Open RAN. By formulating a utility function, we jointly optimize the operating cost from the perspective of operators, as well as the transmission rate, service delay and coverage from the perspective of users. We propose a joint function-splitting and resource-scheduling (JFSRS) strategy to make optimal deployment decisions for each slice and user under different timescales and resource granularities. Specifically, a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is conceived for making local/global decisions. This is achieved by optimization relying on real-time (RT) centralized units (CUs)/distributed units (DUs), on an intelligent near-RT RAN controller, and a non-RT controller. The simulation results verify the utility advantages of our proposed scheme, allowing us to strike compelling tradeoffs between the operating cost and network performance. Compared to the traditional “BBU-RRH” and “static FS” benchmarks, the network-wide utility of the proposed scheme increases by an average of 17.21%, with a maximum increase of 123%. In contrast to the “coarse granularity” and “single-layer” benchmarks, the utility of the proposed algorithm increases by an average of 23.2%; while the algorithm&#39;s training time for the “fine granularity” benchmark is twice that of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Edge and vehicular-fog architectures enable a two-tier Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) system, where computing resources are positioned behind base stations and vehicular-fog nodes are placed closer to user equipment (UE), resulting in lower latency compared to cloud alternatives. Vehicular-fog is a computing resource formed by a group of either stationary or mobile vehicles. In densely populated areas like congested intersections or festivals, UEs can generate concentrated hotspot traffic towards nearby MEC servers, potentially straining the access network MEC (AN-MEC) site behind the base station. To address this, a portion of the traffic can be offloaded, either vertically to nearby vehicular-fog nodes or horizontally to neighboring AN-MEC sites. The control plane rapidly determines traffic offloading locations and ratios within seconds, with the goal of minimizing average system latency. Our work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent TD3, which is built on top of the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to determine optimal offloading ratios. Evaluation results underscore the remarkable decision-making speed of the multi-agent TD3-based approach, which surpasses the single-agent TD3 and simulated annealing (SA) methods by one and five orders of magnitude, respectively. Notably, the average latency of the multi-agent TD3 is better than that of the single-agent TD3, with only a marginal increase of 2 to 6 ms when compared to SA.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been envisioned as a promising technology to support wireless virtual reality (VR) applications. However, the huge energy consumption during the rendering process is challenging for UAV-enabled VR systems. The existing energy management strategies neglecting the dynamic and tiling features of VR tasks may not achieve optimal performance. To cope with these issues, we present a dynamic energy optimization framework for UAV-enabled VR systems. In the proposed framework, a tile-based collaborative rendering scheme for multi-UAVs is developed by exploiting the correlation among different tiles of VR users. Further, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the collaboration decision, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, aiming to reduce the long-term energy consumption under the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency requirement. Due to the tight coupling variables and the dynamic factors, the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to tackle by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV trajectory and collaboration decision (UTCD) problem, and the resource allocation (RA) problem. Then, we design a dynamic UTCD algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and present an optimal RA algorithm based on the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method. To enhance the solving efficiency, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based solving method is introduced by embedding the RA algorithm in the learning environment of DRL. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can obtain good performance for UAV-enabled VR systems.},

To address these challenges, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into mobile edge computing (MEC) for IoV by leveraging their advantages of mobile flexibility, low price, and line-of-sight (LoS) communication links. In this paper, we establish a joint UAV-assisted IoV scenario, where both UAVs and MBSes can provide computation and data caching services for smart vehicles. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for dynamic data caching and computation offloading, aiming to minimize the average task processing delay and maximize the UAV cache hit ratio. By applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, we design an intelligent data caching and computation offloading (IDCCO) algorithm to deal with large-scale and continuous state and action spaces. Furthermore, in order to accelerate the convergence speed of DRL model training while protecting the privacy of original user data in IoV, we propose a distributed training mechanism based on Federated Learning (FL), where the DRL model training is performed locally on UAV and global parameter aggregation is performed on MBS. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several comparative algorithms in shortening the training time, reducing the task processing delay, and maximizing the cache hit ratio.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsensing utilizes users&#39; mobile devices to form a sensing network for collecting data. The quality of the crowdsensing services can only be guaranteed if location-based tasks are covered at a high rate. However, since users&#39; mobile trajectories are uncertain, neither the platform nor the users can guarantee the coverage of these time-sensitive tasks. Therefore, the user recruitment mechanism needs to improve coverage while reducing uncertainty. There are two problems with existing user recruitment mechanisms: 1) most mechanisms do not consider the impact of uncertainty, and 2) a few mechanisms that consider uncertainty only use it as a constraint and cannot effectively reduce it, resulting in their actual performance deviating from expectations. Inspired by modern portfolio theory, we propose a User Recruitment Mechanism based on Uncertainty, called URMU. First, we use a global sequence comparison algorithm to quantify the correlation between users and reduce uncertainty by combining users based on their correlation. Then, we use combinatorial optimization to achieve the bi-objective optimization problem of maximizing coverage and minimizing uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and experiments on real dataset demonstrate that URMU can reliably improve the coverage of crowdsensing tasks.},

  abstract     = {Clustered federated multitask learning is introduced as an effective strategy, specifically designed to tackle statistical challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed data among clients. This is achieved by clustering clients based on a similarity in their data distributions and assigning a specialized model for each cluster. However, this approach encounters complexities when applied in hierarchical wireless networks due to hierarchical two-level model aggregation and resource-based client selection. This results in a slower convergence rate and deprives clients of the best-fit specialized model for those having similar data distribution from different mobile edge networks. To this end, we propose a framework comprising two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes designed for IoT devices and intelligent vehicles. For client selection, the cloud ensures fairness among all clients by providing them with equal priority to participate in training, contributing to more accurate clustering. Once a particular cluster reaches a stopping point, the related edge server performs two client selection methods separately, greedy and round-robin. The greedy algorithm prioritizes clients with less latency and superior resources, while the round-robin algorithm allows for cyclic participation in training. The cloud then executes model aggregation in two distinct ways: one based on reaching pre-determined aggregation rounds (round-based model aggregation) and the other by performing at least one split at the edge servers (split-based model aggregation). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Our results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the convergence rate, minimize training time, and reduce energy consumption by up to 60% while providing every client with a specialized model specifically attuned to its data distribution.},

  abstract     = {As intelligent transportation develops by leaps and bounds, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to improve efficiency and security. One key aspect of them is the Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication (CPPA) scheme, which addresses challenges of identity authentication and message integrity during communications. Most ID-Based CPPA schemes rely on Tamper-Proof Devices (TPDs), which are vulnerable to side-channel attacks. If sensitive data stored in TPDs are compromised, the entire system would be in danger. To tackle this issue, Xiong et al. introduced a CPPA scheme with double-insurance, claiming its security against adaptively chosen message attacks. However, this paper reveals that their scheme is universally forgeable, allowing anyone to create valid signatures on any message, rendering it inadequate for CPPA. In light of the weaknesses, we propose a novel scheme that inherits the time-tested Schnorr Signature and Abe-Okamoto Message Recovery Signature. Besides, we prove the security under the assumptions of Discrete Logarithms (DL) and Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH), and conduct experiments and realistic evaluations. The results demonstrate its superiority, and establish its practicality in real-world scenarios.},

This central training approach has scalability limitations and poses privacy risks to private data. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training framework that empowers physical smart systems devices to collaboratively learn a task without sharing private training data with a central server. However, FL introduces new challenges to Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, such as communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, as the exchange of model updates may still lead to data leakage. This paper explores the communication overhead and privacy risks facing the implementation of FL and presents an algorithm that encompasses Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to address these challenges in FL. We compare the operational flow and network model of model-based and model-agnostic (KD-based) FL algorithms that enable customizing per-client model architecture to accommodate heterogeneous and constrained system resources. Our experiments show that KD-based FL algorithms are able to exceed local accuracy and achieve comparable accuracy to central training. Additionally, we show that applying DP to KD-based FL significantly damages its utility, leading to up to 70% accuracy loss for a privacy budget $\epsilon \leq 10$ .},

Due to the limited storage capacity of collaborative vehicles, a single vehicle cannot fully store large files or programs such as firmware upgrade packages or ultra-high-definition videos. The current solution is to split the large files that need to be shared into several smaller files and store them in different vehicles for decentralized downloading. However, the current file segmentation methods lack flexibility and cannot effectively address the inherent data consistency and copyright protection issues in distributed storage. Aiming at the above problems, this paper introduces the homomorphic hash algorithm into the IoV and proposes a distributed storage secure data sharing method based on a homomorphic hash tree structure. With the help of layer-by-layer segmentation of the cloud service platform and edge server, the method flexibly divides large files into smaller file blocks and stores them in the sharer vehicles (sharer). The requester vehicle (requester) collaborates with data sharers to obtain all partial data blocks and eventually reconstruct the complete file. Considering the copyright protection problem involved in the file block sharing process, a one-way proxy re-encryption algorithm is proposed to encrypt and share the file core block to ensure that only the paid vehicle can decrypt it using its private key. Through theoretical proof and experimental verification, the method significantly improves the efficiency of data sharing in the IoV and successfully solves the data consistency and copyright problems in the process of distributed storage and secure data sharing.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and high altitude platform station (HAPS) to cache popular content, and combining with D2D communication to build the D2D-assisted air-ground integrated caching network (AGICN-D2D), is an effective way to meet the increasing data demand and relieve the peak pressure of future network. However, due to the limited on-board energy storage of UAVs and terminals, optimizing resource allocation and UAV trajectory to improve system energy efficiency (EE) becomes a major issue. Moreover, due to the high dynamic nature of the AGICN-D2D, it often falls into the dilemma of information uncertainty and curse of dimensionality. To overcome the above challenges, a downlink AGICN-D2D model consisting of HAPS, UAVs, and users is intended, where user devices can cache popular content and assist data transmission through D2D links. Then, the joint content cache probability, resource allocation and UAV trajectory plan issue is investigated for maximizing system EE. As it is an NP-hard issue coupled with content caching probability, power control, bandwidth assignment and trajectory plan, we decompose it into two subproblems. Firstly, for the content caching probability sub-problem, AVOA-based Cache Probability Optimization (ACPO) algorithm is developed to realize the optimization of content caching probability. Secondly, for the power control, bandwidth allocation and trajectory design sub-problem, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based Resource allocation and Flight trajectory Optimization (MRFO) algorithm is developed to maximize the system EE. Finally, Joint Content caching probability, Resource allocation and Flight trajectory Optimization (JCRFO) algorithm is introduced. We conduct extensive experiments to compare with other benchmark methods. The outcomes demonstrate that our approach is superior to others.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) plays a significant role in reducing network delay for Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) services by caching these services close to the User Equipments (UEs). These MAR services collect UEs&#39; network traffic and orientation information, and generate the service results back to UEs. However, the UE&#39;s mobility features change network traffic and orientation, negatively impacting MAR services&#39; access frequencies and service preferences. Moreover, the changed access frequencies also influence the workload of cached MAR services, resulting in the uneven workload of edge servers. Therefore, this paper formalizes cooperative service caching based on UEs&#39; location and orientation to optimize network delay and response fairness in MEC environments. To solve the problem, we propose a S ervice C aching strategy based on R egional M obility features A wareness (SCRMA) algorithm, which consists of two stages. Firstly, the R egional M obility features A wareness (RMA) algorithm perceives the user mobility features and service preferences, which provides a prerequisite for determining service caching strategy. Then, a S ervice C aching strategy based on a G enetic A lgorithm (SCGA) is proposed to optimize network delay and response fairness. The simulation experiment on a real dataset shows that our service caching strategy averagely reduces network delay, fairness factor, and total cost by 11.49%, 33.24%, and 17.86% compared with the existing algorithms, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The upcoming 6G paradigm leverages digital twin (DT) to create a virtual replica of network topology, facilitating real-time control in complex environments. In intelligent manufacturing, where ultra-low latency is essential, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) adopts mobile edge computing (MEC) for task offloading, compensating for the limited energy and computational resources of its devices. In areas with network congestion or limited coverage, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) extend the network reach and relay tasks to central nodes. To address the challenges of resource allocation and computational offloading in 6G-enabled IIoT air-ground networks, this paper presents a novel architecture called Dynamic DT Edge Air-Ground Network (D2TEAGN). Utilizing DT for real-time state prediction, the architecture enables more adaptive and efficient resource utilization. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization, termed Joint UAV Trajectory, IIoT devices Association, Task Offloading, and Resource Allocation (JUTIA-TORA). To solve this problem in dynamic conditions, we transform it into a Markov decision process and utilize a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Our simulation results indicate that compared to existing actor-critic (AC), full-offload, and greedy algorithms, the proposed DDPG-based solution achieves the highest energy saving while adhering to the constraints of task delay and edge computing capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned as a new technology to improve the quality-of-service in vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks due to its ability to change the wireless radio propagation environment. In this paper, we study multi-RIS-assisted VEC networks, where vehicle user equipments (VUEs) can offload tasks to nearby base stations (BSs) which offer efficient computation edge services (ESs). Meanwhile, the individual virtual machine (VM), which is defined as a software clone of the VUE&#39;s service environment containing the profile and application to run the VUE&#39;s tasks, need to be migrated to the same ES for offloaded task completion. Accordingly, we formulate a throughput maximization problem for multi-RIS-assisted VEC networks via jointly optimizing the selected ESs, the deployment locations of RISs, and reflection matrices of RISs, subject to the maximum tolerable delay. To solve the non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, where two types of heterogeneous agents are considered. In particular, several tricks such as reward normalization, orthogonal initialization, and learning rate decay are adopted to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that the throughput obtained by the proposed MAPPO-based scheme outperforms that obtained by the scheme without multi-RIS 26.41% and that obtained by the scheme without service migration 23.65%, respectively. Moreover, compared to other conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, the proposed algorithm converges faster.},

Specific content can be pre-cached on the user devices based on personalized content placement strategies, and the cached content can be fetched by neighboring devices in the same D2D network. However, when multiple devices simultaneously fetch content from the same device, collisions will occur and reduce communication efficiency. In this paper, we design the content fetching strategies based on an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture, which can adjust the content fetching collision rate to adapt to different application scenarios. First, the optimization problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the collision rate to improve the throughput, and a general actor-critic DRL algorithm is used to improve the content fetching strategy. Second, by optimizing the network architecture and reward function, the two-level actor-critic algorithm is improved to effectively manage the collision rate and transmission power. Furthermore, to balance the conflict between the collision rate and device energy consumption, the related reward values are weighted in the reward function to optimize the energy efficiency. The simulation results show that the content fetching collision rate based on the improved two-level actor-critic algorithm decreases significantly compared with that of the baseline algorithms, and the network energy consumption can be optimized by adjusting the weight factors.},

The sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks is envisioned to answer all demands of the next decade, which is only possible with advances in network design and management. This paper first presents a 6G-based network architecture that deploys emerging technologies, including Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and Cell-Free massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (CF mMIMO). Then, a hierarchical network slicing and resource management approach compatible with the presented architecture is defined. The proposed novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based scheme benefits from the openness of O-RAN to provide two levels of centralized multi-agent decision-making and decentralized single-agent execution for choosing proper service types by following the objective of maximizing the system capacity while guaranteeing the defined Quality of Service (QoS). To demonstrate the performance of the management method, Deep RL (DRL)-based algorithms for each level are proposed.

  abstract     = {Edge-assisted digital twin (DT) is an efficient way to monitor, analyze, and guide connected vehicles by creating a virtual representation of the vehicle at the edge. This allows for real-time monitoring of vehicle performance, location, and condition, as well as providing guidance and edge services to optimize the vehicle&#39;s performance and ensure safe operation. Current traffic digital twinning methods primarily rely on data-driven approaches for predicting and replicating vehicle behavior, which do not adequately capture the complex dynamics and interactions between vehicles. In this paper, we propose a proximity-aware longitudinal lane changing (PALLC) model that simply and efficiently models longitudinal lane changing behavior to develop a DT system. More specifically, we first observe vehicle behavior, and find that the lane-changing behavior of the target vehicle is mainly influenced by neighboring vehicles, and ignoring the influence of distant vehicles can improve the accuracy of the PALLC model. Next, we theoretically analyze the convergence properties of the PALLC model for forecasting and assessing collision risks. Uncertainty factors originating from DT modeling, including model parameter biases, measurement deviations, and environmental noise, are fully considered to explore their effects on the DT system. In the experiments of different types of vehicles and different indicators, the results show that the PALLC model all have higher accuracy compared with the traditional method. Moreover, the PALLC model is more stable under the influence of parameter deviation and measurement deviation. These findings highlight its potential to provide DT edge services for connected vehicles.},

Different from the widely used constant time headway policies, a refined constant time headway (RCTH) policy that leverages the relative velocity between adjacent vehicles is adopted to enhance platooning safety while preserving traffic efficiency. To deal with the discrepancy of vehicle dynamic parameters, heterogeneity compensators are developed for each platoon member to estimate the platoon leader&#39;s state. By virtue of the switching system theory, the desired parameters of heterogeneity compensators are designed and the tolerable condition of replay attacks is also established. Furthermore, sufficient design criteria are derived to obtain the local compensator-based controller gains under the proposed edge-based DETM and RCTH policy. It is further proved that Zeno freeness of the proposed edge-based DETMs is excluded.

(2) The other is a group authentication protocol used to form and maintain a stable and secure Metaverse service group composed of RNs, which ensures the reliability and enhances the security of Metaverse service. The reliability and security of Metaverse service under RSMS are thoroughly discussed, and also informal and formal security analysis are conducted.

However, this approach encounters two primary challenges: balancing the freshness of traffic information in the long term with the costs of vehicle recruitment and ensuring the privacy of participating vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a smart-contract-based incentive mechanism that recruits vehicles for traffic sensing. Our approach is structured as a two-stage game. In Stage I, the platform designs the incentive mechanism. In Stage II, vehicles independently decide their participation in the sensing process. Despite the inherent challenges of dealing with different time scales and the lack of future information, our framework effectively transforms the long-term problem into a solvable short-term one with a closed-form solution. Additionally, our implementation of the incentive mechanism through a blockchain-based smart contract offers a unique advantage: it enables vehicles to anonymously upload sensing data and receive payments, thereby safeguarding their privacy. Numerical analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in fulfilling long-term information freshness requirements. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces the platform&#39;s time-average cost by 59.6%, 24.6%, 28.5%, and 25.8%, compared with other benchmarks.},

We address these challenges by designing an End-to-End (E2E) resource management solution that considers network topology and payload capabilities to route VNRs optimally based on resource availability. This solution includes modules for topology prediction, traffic prediction, and Virtual Network Function (VNF) mapping and resource allocation. The topology prediction module uses supervised learning to predict satellite-to-gateway link availability and stability. The traffic prediction module classifies the gateway into urban and remote and predicts the traffic load between gateway pairs. Based on the predicted data, the VNF mapping and resource allocation module allocates substrate networks to the VNRs by assigning optimal routing paths customized to the traffic generation area (remote or urban). Simulation results based on realistic topology, parameters, and datasets show that the proposed solution achieves promising performance regarding link stability prediction and VNR mapping accuracy. The proposed solution reduced E2E delay by $11.17 \%$ for remote traffic compared to the benchmark VNE-TEG.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative vehicle infrastructure is critical for facilitating multi-tier vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems to collaboratively process latency-sensitive intelligent tasks. However, the dynamic topology and the scarcity of available computing resources on real traffic roads pose significant challenges. While previous works have explored using public transit and parked vehicles as cooperative vehicles, they often overlook the incentive mechanisms and the specific tasks of these vehicles, rendering these solutions impractical. Motivated by the achievements in smart electric vehicles (EVs), this paper presents an electric vehicle cluster (EVC) assisted multi-tier VEC system that leverages the capabilities of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to provide stable computing resources to traffic areas. The proposed EVC-assisted multi-tier VEC system employs a cross-system two-level optimization method that jointly considers offloading and resource allocation decisions for road task vehicles (RTVs) in the VEC system and charging power decisions for the EVs in the EVC. At the lower level, we minimize the task latency for RTVs by utilizing the computing resources of idle EVs. At the upper level, we build a multi-agent two-step game model and introduce a potential game-based strategy and a Nash equilibrium (NE) based EV-RSU mapping method to derive the optimal decision strategy for the EVC. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficient reduction in total-task latency of RTVs and lower cost for the EVC while meeting the essential requirements in the V2G.},

In addition to the cylindrical NFZs, we also modeled and analyzed the polygonal NFZs that are common in reality but seldom investigated in research. We aim to maximize the sum-rate of all user by jointly optimizing the power allocation and trajectory design of the UAV under the constraints on the limited power resource, the QoS requirements of users and the NFZs evasion for UAV. Since the formulated joint optimization problem is non-convex, to deal with it, we design a low-complex iterative scheme based on the proposed modified water-filling algorithm, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technology, disjunctive programming and penalty functions. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the system sum-rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of all users, reasonably evading the NFZs and adapting well to the real-time mobility of uses.},

Moreover, there&#39;s an anticipation for the deep learning model to unearth more generalized and distinct features. In this paper, we introduce the Unsupervised Power Allocation based on Attentive Graph Representation (UPAR) method. UPAR combines an Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Regression Network (EGRN) with Deep Unfolded Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (DU-WMMSE) within an unsupervised learning framework. Initially, EGRN leverages an attention mechanism and Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) to amalgamate features from adjacent nodes and their connecting edges, enhancing the identifiability and generalization of the graph&#39;s features. Subsequently, DU-WMMSE applies unsupervised learning to refine these graph features through regression training, transforming WMMSE iterations into efficient, interpretable layers within the neural network. This process introduces adjustable parameters, employing both feed forward and back propagation phases during end-to-end training. The proposed method significantly narrows the solution space for the objective function, accelerating the training process and enhancing the efficiency of the deep learning model. Simulation results confirm the UPAR method&#39;s superior performance and adaptability across a variety of scenarios.},

Relay-assisted communication provides an additional boost to system&#39;s performance by expanding its capacity, coverage range, enhancing data rates and mitigating the effect of turbulence. In this manuscript, three dual-hop systems are considered i.e., FSO-FSO, radio frequency (RF)-FSO and FSO-RF systems employing decode and forward (DF) relaying protocol. Furthermore, chaotic signals are incorporated in these systems to enhance their confidentiality using differential chaos shift keying (DCSK). This is demonstrated by performing secrecy analysis on the system. Here, it is assumed that RF link experiences Nakagami-m fading while the affect of fading in FSO channel is caused by Gamma-Gamma turbulence along with pointing errors. The average bit error rate (BER) of three proposed systems is analyzed, and the results indicated that the FSO-RF-DCSK system outperformed the other three in terms of performance. Finally, secrecy performance is accomplished using secrecy outage probability (SOP) as a metric for the proposed systems. The findings are noteworthy as FSO-FSO-DCSK system demonstrates superior performance as compared to FSO-RF-DCSK and RF-FSO-DCSK systems in terms of secrecy. As compared to other counterparts, FSO-FSO-DCSK system shows an improvement of more than 10 order of magnitude in terms of signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication demands efficient handover decision-making strategies to ensure seamless connectivity and maximum throughput. However, the dynamic nature of V2N scenarios poses challenges for traditional handover algorithms. To address this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to optimize handover decisions in dynamic V2N communication. We leverage the advantages of transfer learning and meta-learning to generalize across time-evolving source and target tasks. In this paper, we derive generalization bounds for our DRL-based approach, specifically focusing on optimizing the handover process in V2N communication. The derived bounds provide theoretical guarantees on the expected generalization error of the learned handover time function for the target task. To implement our framework, we propose a meta-learning framework, Adapt-to-evolve (A2E), based on the double deep Q-networks (DDQN) with the Thompson sampling approach. The A2E framework enables quick adaptation to new tasks by minimizing error upper bounds with divergence measures. Through transfer learning, the meta-learner dynamically evolves its handover decision-making strategy to maximize average throughput while reducing the number of handovers. We use Thompson sampling with the DDQN to balance exploration and exploitation. The DDQN with The Thompson sampling approach, ensuring efficient and effective learning, forms the foundation for optimizing the meta-training process, resulting in improvement in cumulated packet loss by 48.02 % in highway settings and 46.32 % in rural settings.},

However, matrix-inversion-based DFE schemes are not suitable for massive MIMO systems due to their prohibitively high computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate frequency domain DFE for signal detection in single-carrier massive MIMO systems with the goal of reducing computational complexity for practical applications. We propose a low-complexity implicit DFE scheme for single-carrier massive MIMO systems, which mitigates inter-stream and inter-symbol interference by leveraging the Neumann series (NS) expansion for matrix inversion approximation (MIA). The proposed scheme performs DFE implicitly by recursively computing forward/feedback signals using the NS expansion, thereby avoiding computationally intensive matrix inversions and forward/feedback filters calculation. Simulation and analysis results indicate that, compared to matrix-inversion-based DFE schemes, the proposed implicit DFE scheme can significantly reduce computational complexity while achieving similar performance in single-carrier massive MIMO systems. Moreover, it outperforms existing low-complexity detection methods under stringent channel conditions while maintaining similar or even lower complexity.},

  abstract     = {5G cellular communication and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) have provided a new opportunity to support connected vehicles safety applications complementing Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) direct communication. One major benefit of using cellular networks for connected safety is its wide deployment and support in the vehicles today, and it eliminates the need for additional physical radio technologies in vehicles. However, a few major considerations for cellular networks to support real-time safety applications are latency, reliability of communication, cellular costs, and scalability. In this paper, we conduct the first real-world implementation and study of using infrastructure-based camera sensing along with 5G cellular communication and MEC computing setup to support connected safety applications. To achieve this, we design and implement a vision-based multilayer connected safety platform called Raven . We also develop and evaluate three different connected safety applications namely Intersection T-Bone Vehicle Crash Warning, Vehicle-in-blind-spot Warning and Stopped/Disabled Hazard Vehicle Warning applications on top of the Raven platform. These applications are enabled via a roadside camera that is connected via 5G communication link to the MEC server where Raven detects and tracks vehicles in the received camera frames, estimates each vehicle&#39;s dynamics such as tracking ID, position, speed, and heading, packages that information along with other parameters required by the Basic Safety Messages (BSM) standard, and shares it with other vehicles that have subscribed to Raven ’s service. Our experiments show promising results: the median error in position, velocity, and heading accuracy is $\text{2.5}\,\text {m}$ , $\text{4.9}\,\text {kph}$ (or $\text{3}\,\text {mph}$ ), and $2.1^{\circ }$ , respectively, and the driver is warned in-time during all the test runs of the implemented safety applications.},

In particular, four phase shifting designs at RIS are considered, i.e., imperfect continuous phase shifting, perfect continuous phase shifting, imperfect discrete phase shifting, and perfect discrete phase shifting. To reveal the impact of four phase shifting designs on the secrecy performance of system, we analyze the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) and derive new closed-form expressions. Then, the asymptotic ESC is derived to gain useful insights. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the imperfect continuous phase shifting has the same ESC performance with the imperfect discrete phase shifting, while the ESC of perfect continuous phase shifting is similar to that of perfect discrete phase shifting. Besides, the ESC firstly increases and then decreases with the increasing time switching factor, and each phase shifting design has a different optimal time switching factor. Moreover, RIS aided WPC system under four phase shifting designs outperforms the traditional WPC system without the aid of RIS under high transmission power, verifying the superiority of using RIS to enhance the secrecy performance.},

  abstract     = {Phased array antennas have been widely used in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems due to their simple structure and low cost. However, phase quantization errors in the transmitting weight vector, introduced by phase shifter (PS) quantization, adversely affect the performance of physical layer secure communication systems with phased array antennas. In this paper, we develop a quantization model to analyze the impact of PS quantization on the magnitude and phase deviation of the transmission gain. We find that the loss in magnitude decreases with an increase in quantization bits. The analysis indicates that phase deviation, which deteriorates the received constellations of the target user, causes the constellations to scatter in a circle on the complex plane. The scattering radius increases with array size but decreases with an increase in quantization bits. Based on these analyses, we propose a compensation scheme to mitigate the phase deviation of the transmission gain for the target user. This scheme confines the scattering constellations within a narrowed pie-shaped area, thereby reducing the symbol error rate (SER) for the target user. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate our analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation scheme. The simulation results include SER versus the number of quantization bits, SER versus the order of phase shift keying (PSK) modulations, and SER versus transmission gains.},

A nested quadratic-transform (NQT)-based approach is proposed next for maximizing the non-convex GEE objective by first approximating it as a concave-convex function and then by applying the quadratic transform. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is developed that sequentially applies the Lagrangian dual transform, quadratic transform and Dinkelbach&#39;s transform to obtain a closed-form solution of the GEE optimization problem formulated.

  abstract     = {This article aims to provide a comprehensive performance comparison between intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and conventional full-duplex (FD) relays, making it clear under which conditions and with what protocols, the performance boundaries are achieved by the two methods. We target millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output networks that are key players for the next generation mobile communication and consider the scenarios where an IRS or a FD relay is adopted to establish transmission links between two terminals that may suffer from blocked direct channels. In the comparison, both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying schemes are considered. Furthermore, practical power consumption models for IRS and FD relay are built. Aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency, we optimize the element/antenna sizes, active/passive beamforming and power allocation for IRS-aided and FD relay-aided systems, respectively. Our numerical results show that the superiority of each relaying scheme highly depends on the carrier frequency. Though IRSs exhibit lower spectral efficiency than active relays, this gap could be narrowed by decreasing the carrier frequency. Moreover, IRSs&#39; energy efficiency is higher than that of active relays at sub-6 GHz. Specially, when the transmission/receiving gain of transceivers is very high, IRSs can further achieve higher energy efficiency at mmWave band. Compared to amplify-and-forward relays, decode-and-forward relays exhibit better performance in general, however, increasing transmit power can substantially enhance the performance of amplify-and-forward relays. Finally, we apply our conclusion to the relevant works to reveal the reasons for their seemingly conflicted findings.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum sensing (SS) based on energy detection (ED) is a simple yet effective approach to detect the presence of unknown signals that are active in a specific band of frequencies. The classical ED (CED) algorithm uses the value of the energy detected in the current sensing slot as test statistic and has a fixed threshold, but improved signal detection performance is possible by modifying the test statistic and/or the detection threshold. In this paper we propose a novel ED algorithm for SS that considers a binary activity model for the signal to be detected and combines the use of an average energy test statistic with an adaptive decision threshold for improved detection performance. We present the analytical characterization of the proposed test statistic in terms of its mean and variance, and derive the expressions corresponding to the correct decision probability (CDP) and false alarm probability (FAP). Using the derived CDP and FAP expressions, we also determine the detection thresholds that yield desired values for the false alarm and missed detection probabilities. The proposed algorithm is illustrated with numerical results obtained from simulations, which confirm our theoretical findings and also show that the algorithm outperforms alternative adaptive ED algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of High-Speed Railways (HSR), there is a growing focus on research. High-mobility communication is an area that requires significant improvement in 5G, 6G, and beyond cellular communication systems. However, research on optimizing communication pilot design specifically for HSR scenarios is still relatively premature. To validate the effectiveness of pilot allocation in HSR communication, this paper establishes a model of the train-to-ground Predictor Antenna (PA) communication system. We focus on the design of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) in a high-speed train-to-ground Time Division Duplex (TDD) communication system that includes PAs. Our objective is to maximize the system&#39;s downlink throughput. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent double Deep Q-Network (MADDQN), which jointly optimizes the allocation quantity of SRS for different antennas, pattern of SRS, and transmission period in both the time and frequency domains. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm jointly allocates the time-frequency resources of SRS, thus enhancing the channel estimation for PA and channel prediction for Main Antennas (MA) in HSR scenarios, while ensuring low complexity and stability.},

Initially, we develop analytical equations for the secrecy outage probabilities (SOPs) of the downlink users and the system SOP (SSOP) of the FD-CNOMA network. It is observed that the users suffer notably higher SOPs and exhibit zero-diversity order, leading to an outage floor in the high transmit power regime. In order to enhance the PLS performance, we suggest a jamming-assisted (JA) framework and evaluate the SOPs and the SSOP through analytical and simulation studies. In comparison to the network without a jammer, the suggested JA framework greatly lowers the SSOP and the SOPs, while the diversity order is enhanced to unity, provided both RHI and RSI are negligible. We also develop a deep neural network (DNN) framework for accurate and fast prediction of SOPs and SSOP, that can overcome the limitations of the intricate mathematical modelling approach. For further improving the PLS performance, we determine optimal transmit powers for the users at the BS and at the relay that separately minimizes the SSOP of the JA-FD-CNOMA network. The findings indicate that, in comparison to equal/random power allocation approaches, the suggested approach leads to a significant reduction in SSOP and SOPs and a notable improvement in system secrecy throughput (SST) and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE).},

To effectively address the PSN, we adopt the expectation of the sum data rate as our objective function and derive its closed-form expression. This derivation facilitates the design of a loss function suitable for unsupervised learning networks. We then propose a lightweight cascade convolutional neural network (LCCNN) for fast beamforming, featuring fewer trainable parameters for accelerated training and efficient implementation.

  abstract     = {In-band full-duplex relay (FDR) has attracted much attention as an effective solution to improve the coverage and spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Considering the residual self-interference (RSI) at the FDR, the overall equivalent channel can be modeled as an infinite impulse response (IIR) channel. For this IIR channel, a joint design for precoding, power gain control and equalization of cooperative OFDM relay systems is presented. Compared with the traditional OFDM systems, the length of the guard interval for the proposed design can be distinctly reduced, thereby improving the spectral efficiency. By analyzing the noise sources under the single relay with single antenna scenario, this paper theoretically evaluates the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed scheme and presents a power gain control algorithm at the FDR for the cases of with and without direct link. With the direct link considered, the FDR transmission system can be regarded as a $2\times 1$ virtual MISO system and the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two. Furthermore, the proposed FDR system is generalized to multiple relay nodes and multiple antennas at each node. Simulation results show the proposed scheme achieves 5.7 dB and 2.9 dB gains compared with the traditional OFDM method with the same guard interval length in the Rayleigh fading condition and Rician fading condition at BER = $10^{-3}$ , respectively.},

The degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of ISAC is limited due to multiple performance metrics used for communication and sensing. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) composed of metamaterials can enhance the DoF in the spatial domain of ISAC systems. However, the availability of perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is a prerequisite for the gain brought by RIS, which is not realistic in practical environments. Therefore, under the imperfect CSI condition, we propose a decomposition-based large deviation inequality approach to eliminate the impact of CSI error on communication rate and sensing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). Then, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and gradient extrapolated majorization-maximization (GEMM) is proposed to solve the transmit beamforming and discrete RIS beamforming problems. We also analyze the complexity and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively eliminate the influence of CSI error and have good convergence performance. Notably, when CSI error exists, the gain brought by RIS will decrease with the increase of the number of RIS elements.},

Specifically, we first develop the theoretical detection error probability (DEP) under the strategy of the separate detection and the maximal ratio combining (MRC) based cooperative detection, respectively. Secondly, we propose the robust beamforming optimization model comprised of the beampattern mean square error (MSE) based sensing metric and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based covertness measure under the sensing assisted imperfect channel state information (CSI) of wardens. In order to tackle the non-convexity of the proposed optimization problem, we propose the iterative algorithms comprised of the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to achieve the robust beamforming design for the covert ISAC system under the CSI uncertainty. Due to the significant large complexity of the robust beamforming design for colluding wardens, we further propose the low complexity optimization algorithm based on the monotonicity of the theoretical DEP for the MRC based detection instead of KL divergence.

VLC exploits high frequencies for signal propagation for short-range and is highly susceptible to blockages. Hence, in this work, the sensitivity of the VLC toward the blockages is explored. This study examines outdoor-indoor communication for an urban scenario featuring an office environment. The VLC system is designed by considering multiple VLC access points serving the end users in the presence of human blockages. Selection combining is employed to select the access point which offers the maximum instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the user. To capture the outdoor scenario, path loss modeling is conducted to account for signal attenuation from outdoor to indoor spaces. The outdoor scenario is modeled using Nakagami-m fading channels while VLC is employed for the indoor scenario. System performance is assessed in closed-form expression for outage probability and the symbol error rate for binary phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. A deep learning-based approach detects the symbols by tracking dynamic changes in the channel. Simulation results corroborate the correctness of derived analytical expressions and reveal that blockages significantly impact both single and multiple LED based communication channels.},

Assume that the base station side and the transmitter in each V2V transmission pair know the statistical CSI and the imperfect CSI of the user terminals. The statistical CSI is a joint correlation model with channel variance information only, and the a posteriori CSI after channel estimation is a joint correlation model with both channel mean and variance information. Based on this, the C-V2V massive MIMO downlink channel model is established. The precoding design problem is a weighted ergodic sum-rate maximization problem, and the objective function is the weighted sum of the achievable ergodic unicast rate for all the V2V pairs and the achievable ergodic multicast rate for all the cellular users. The minorize-maximize (MM) algorithm is utilized to equivalently convert the complex non-convex original optimization problem into a quadratic optimization problem that can be solved iteratively. Since the closed-form optimal solution of the quadratic optimization problem contains the expectation of the complex random matrix, the deterministic equivalents of the desired matrix expectation are introduced to reduce the computational complexity, and the large-dimensional matrix inversion problem is avoided by matrix inversion lemma to further reduce the complexity. In addition, we prove that the beam domain transmission is optimal for the scenario with zero mean in the a posteriori CSI. Linear precoding design algorithms are given in conjunction with the above procedure. The simulation results demonstrate the good convergence performance of the proposed algorithms and the significant improvements of the proposed robust coordinated communication method in the system spectral efficiency.},

It not only improves the performance of the wireless communication system but also constructs a new localization scenario that utilizes the RIS as assistance. The RIS-aided positioning system can improve the localization performance of the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environment by building Virtual-Line-of-Sight (VLoS) links. However, it also faces challenges. First, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), which is usually utilized to evaluate the system performance, has been analyzed only based on one or two parameters in existing research. It is not precise enough under the practical situation. Second, since there are many passive reflective elements on the RIS, applying all of them to localization will not only increase the storage space but even decrease the localization accuracy due that some elements may provide ambiguous information. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we first analyzed the CRLB of multi-parameter estimation to be consistent with the real environment. Second, a cutting-edge metaheuristic optimization algorithm, i.e., Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO) algorithm, is proposed to optimize the passive reflective elements, which aims to minimize the CRLB to increase the location accuracy while reducing the storage simultaneously. The experimental results show that the multi-parameter CRLB analysis is more in line with the actual situation. In addition, after the RIS passive reflective elements optimization, it improves the location accuracy by about 15.26 $\%$ compared with using all elements.},

Existing methodologies predominantly assume perfect SF orthogonality, neglecting the detrimental effects of interference between signals using different spreading factors (SFs) in the same channel (CH). This study investigates a joint SF, CH, and transmit power (TP) allocation problem with the objective of optimizing the system&#39;s uplink EE while fully considering quasiorthogonal SFs, which is an NP-hard optimization problem. To enhance tractability, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems: CH/SF assignment and TP allocation. First, an attention-based deep neural network is designed to generate a near-optimal CH/SF assignment, leveraging both channel state information and channel activity detection-based historical channel occupancy information. Second, given the CH/SF assignment, the optimal TP allocation is determined through the resolution of a convex optimization problem. Experimental results on a real-world LoRa network demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the system&#39;s uplink EE.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have attracted attention for realizing ultrahigh-speed and large-capacity communication in the next-generation 6 G communication standard. Still, research has indicated that it is difficult for an IRS to communicate simultaneously with multiple users. Therefore, the common method for communication via IRSs is to allocate a wide bandwidth to one user to perform large-volume communication in a short period per user and to support the communication of many users by repeating the same process. However, allocating broadband to a single user causes a reflected beam shift owing to the beam squint, reducing the frequency efficiency. Therefore, we propose a control and frequency allocation method for IRSs that can support multiple users simultaneously without reducing the frequency efficiency by effectively utilizing a beam squint. Specifically, the proposed method maximizes the frequency efficiency by controlling the IRS reflection direction, reflected beam width, and resource block allocation to user equipment (UE), exploiting the shift in the reflection direction caused by the beam squint. In this study, we evaluated the proposed method with regard to frequency efficiency and simultaneous multiple-connection performance through simulations.},

Therefore, a hybrid blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication scheme is proposed. Instead of using a single chain, the scheme combines the consortium and private chains, retaining the decentralization and high security of the consortium chain while leveraging the advantages of faster transactions, lower costs, and higher privacy in the private chain. Importantly, short signature technology and homomorphic encryption technology are proposed to further improve the efficiency of entity communication and protect the delivery of private data, respectively, while pre-authentication mechanism is used to further accelerate the cross-domain authentication of vehicles. The security analysis demonstrates the good privacy protection and attack resistance of this scheme. In addition, performance simulations and evaluations show that the proposed scheme requires the least computational and communication overhead compared to other schemes. It also performs better in terms of authentication delay and packet loss rate. Finally, the availability of the proposed scheme is explained through throughput and transaction cost analysis.},

FD operation however results in a new source of interference— self-interference (SI)— causing analog-to-digital converter (ADC) saturation and a subsequent reduction in SE gains. In this paper, we present a novel design of precoders and combiners for millimeter wave (mmWave) BSs that leverages a hybrid analog/digital beamforming architecture. The proposed design balances SI reduction in the analog domain to avoid ADC saturation and in the digital domain to enable increased SE. Our hybrid beamforming design requires a few iterations to converge and provides reasonable performance, significantly improving upon related work in the literature. For example, our hybrid FD design achieves SE gains of 1.05x to 3.09x vs. several leading hybrid FD designs; an SE gain of 1.91x vs. half-duplex (HD); and an SE loss of 1.10x vs. an all-digital FD beamformer. The all-digital FD beamformer assumes there is no ADC saturation and uses one RF chain per antenna (which has prohibitive power consumption for a large number of antennas).},

  abstract     = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a popular code-domain (CD) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique that excels in segregating multiple users&#39; signals. In SCMA, sparse codewords are detected using the powerful message-passing algorithm (MPA). However, SCMA systems suffer from a limited diversity order (DO). Conversely, dense code multiple access (DCMA) systems, which do not possess a sparse nature, benefit from the full DO offered by dense codewords. Despite this advantage, the MPA detector is not feasible for DCMA systems due to the lack of sparsity. To address these challenges, we present an iterative linear detector for CD-NOMA systems based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In this approach, the standard maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem for CD-NOMA systems is converted into a sharing optimization problem, which is then solved in a distributed manner. The reformulation of CD-NOMA system models enables resource-wise processing using the ADMM algorithm. The proposed detector effectively addresses the detection problem for both dense and sparse coded NOMA systems. By reformulating the system model, we make single input multi-output (SIMO) and spatially modulated (SM) CD-NOMA systems special cases of spatial multiplexing CD-NOMA (SMX-CD-NOMA) for detection. Furthermore, the ADMM algorithm&#39;s resource-wise processing approach is proposed to solve the detection problem in various multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) CD-NOMA systems.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of the Internet of Everything, the forthcoming 6G networks will necessitate an extensive deployment of base stations to achieve comprehensive network coverage. This development presents a formidable challenge for operators due to the surging expenses associated with each base station and the exponential increase in their quantity. Consequently, formulating strategies to mitigate network deployment costs has become an imperative challenge that operators must address urgently. The fully-decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN), through its innovative separation of uplink and downlink base stations, provides the flexibility for deployment in response to asymmetrical service demands, offering a promising solution to the deployment cost dilemma. In this study, we first propose a techno-economic cost model (TECM) for FD-RAN deployment based on the techno-economic approach and then formulate a cost-minimization problem for decoupled network deployment. To tackle the complexity of massive terminals, we present an adjacent gravity-based optimal link clustering algorithm (AGOC) to transform the significant 0–1 programming problem into a mixed integer program. Leveraging FD-RAN&#39;s uplink-downlink decoupling, we decompose the original problem into separate subproblems for uplink and downlink network deployments. For the decoupled problem, we further propose a branch-and-cut based network deployment (BCND) algorithm to solve the two decoupled deployment subproblems, respectively. Simulation results indicate that FD-RANs can offer significant cost benefits when facing differentiated service demands. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that power consumption and rental costs are the primary factors influencing network expenses.},

  abstract     = {Future 6G-enabled vehicular networks face the challenge of ensuring ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for delivering safety-critical information in a timely manner. Existing resource allocation schemes for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems primarily rely on traditional optimization-based algorithms. However, these methods often fail to guarantee the strict reliability and latency requirements of URLLC applications in dynamic vehicular environments due to the high complexity and communication overhead of the solution methodologies. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for the joint power and block length allocation to minimize the worst-case decoding-error probability in the finite block length (FBL) regime for a URLLC-based downlink V2X communication system. The problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). Initially, an algorithm grounded in optimization theory is developed based on deriving the joint convexity of the decoding error probability in the block length and transmit power variables within the region of interest. Subsequently, an efficient event-triggered DRL based algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. Incorporating event-triggered learning into the DRL framework enables assessing whether to initiate the DRL process, thereby reducing the number of DRL process executions while maintaining reasonable reliability performance. The DRL framework consists of a two-layered structure. In the first layer, multiple deep Q-networks (DQNs) are established at the central trainer for block length optimization. The second layer involves an actor-critic network and utilizes the deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm to optimize the power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed event-triggered DRL scheme can achieve 95 $\%$ of the performance of the joint optimization scheme while reducing the DRL executions by up to 24 $\%$ for different network settings.},

  abstract     = {The next generation mobile communication system has put forward higher requirements for uplink capacity. A system integrating full-duplex (FD), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) techniques (named as FS-NOMA systems) has exhibited considerable technical advantages in terms of uplink spectral efficiency (SE). With the exponential growth of mobile data traffic, the devices&#39; workload will also seriously affect the system performance. Thus, to further enhance the uplink capacity, the workload-weighted FS-NOMA (WFS-NOMA) system must be investigated. To reflect the impact caused by workload, true workload-weighted sum-rate (TWSR) is employed to measure the performance of WFS-NOMA. In this paper, an uplink enhanced scheme (UES) based on deep learning is proposed to address the uplink capacity enhancement problem. Unlike the conventional iterative schemes which usually need a relatively longer computational time to perform an iterative process, the uplink powers of WFS-NOMA users can be automatically determined depending on a deep neural network (DNN) with a shorter computational time compared with the iterative schemes. In addition, a typical transmit power allocation (TPA) scheme called power back-off allocation (PBA) is evaluated as the TWSR benchmark of the uplink unenhanced scheme (UUS), which also constitutes the skip connection of the proposed DNN for accelerating convergence. The closed-form expression of TWSR with PBA is derived and clarified. Moreover, an iterative scheme is proposed as the TWSR performance benchmark of the UES. Numerical results show that the implementation of the proposed UESs substantially improve the uplink capacity compared with that of the UUS. The DNN-based UES is capable of offering comparable capacity and less computational complexity compared with that of the iteration-based UES even under heavy-workload scenarios.},

Concretely, by establishing the formation error system, the concerned leaderless formation control problem is tactfully transformed into the formation error consensus problem. Taking communication interruptions into account, a distributed controller is developed to achieve formation error consensus with intermittent inter-vehicle communications. Simultaneously, to endow the leaderless formation system with high economy, a novel intermittent dynamic interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (IDIPETM) is integrated into the controller synthesis, leaving the USVs to interact with each other only at preset periodic event-detecting instants. By assigning exclusive interleave bias to each vehicle, the proposed IDIPETM naturally eliminates the possibility that multiple USVs simultaneously broadcast information, thereby eradicating the communication congestion phenomenon inherent in the existing periodic event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

To overcome the limitation of the conventional design, which aims solely at sum-rate maximization resulting in zero rates for some users across all sub-carriers and thus failing to boost all users rates, we propose the two alternative designs: one maximizing the geometric mean of the users&#39; rates (GM-rate maximization) and the other maximizing the soft users&#39; minimum rate (soft max-min rate optimization). However, they pose challenges as large-scale nonconvex problems, rendering convex-solver computational approaches impractical. To tackle this, we develop iterative computational procedures based on closed-form expressions of scalable complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the substantial benefits of these novel designs in significantly enhancing multi-user rates. Notably, under the same power budget, the active-RIS-assisted multi-carrier system achieves approximately twice the minimum user-rate or sum rate compared to RIS-less or passive-RIS-assisted counterparts.},

Compared to the simulators in the literature, the proposed simulator is more practical and comprehensive, employing two-dimensional position and motion simulation to develop localization capabilities, and considering THz characteristics such as wideband echo, molecular absorption and cluster-based channel. Specifically, the simulator supports the standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) waveforms for sensing and communication simultaneously. Trade-offs between communication and sensing metrics required for waveform numerology design are investigated. In particular, by exploiting TDD framework&#39;s integration capability, range-velocity-angle estimation with virtual array and sensing-aided downlink spatial multiplexing are co-designed. Additionally, a user interface with elaborate parameter configuration is introduced. Finally, we implement an urban vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) application case to verify the simulator.

  abstract     = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) exhibits notable benefits in flexibility, low power consumption, and cost-effectiveness, offering a promising prospect for extensive deployment. However, the performance of the IRS-assisted networks can be hindered by double path-loss fading, resulting in limited serving region and IRS selection constraints. Therefore, it becomes imperative to propose a more rational network architecture that surpasses the current limitations of IRS. This paper proposes a user-centric IRS group cooperative serving scheme, which integrates the benefits of user-side IRS selection and multi-IRS cooperative transmission, and establishes a comprehensive system-level performance analysis framework under the proposed scheme via stochastic geometry. Specifically, IRS cooperative group is decided by an adjustable radius $C$ centered on each user and the IRSs within this circle collaborate to provide services to the user. The average signal strength under cooperative transmission approximated via moment matching, where we propose a general framework to calculate the high order moments of combined channel of IRS-reflected paths as a random sum. In addition, our proposed architecture exacerbates the irregularity of network topology, and more accurate interference Laplace functions by quantifying the irregular interference partitioning are obtained.

  abstract     = {Smart vehicles employ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication links in conjunction with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for enhanced data rates and reliability over mobile wireless channels. These systems use a large number of subcarriers, and feeding back the estimated precoder for even a subset of subcarriers from the receiver to the transmitter is prohibitive. Moreover, frequency domain approaches do not exploit the predominant line-of-sight component present in such channels to reduce feedback. In this work, we view the precoder in the time-domain as a matrix all-pass filter, and model the discrete-time precoder filter using a matrix-lattice structure that reduces the overall feedback while maintaining the desired frequency-phase delay profile. This provides an efficient precoder representation across the subcarriers using fewer coefficients, and is amenable to tracking the precoder coefficients over time with much lower feedback than past approaches, which is beneficial for mobile communication links. Compared to frequency domain approaches that depend on approximate discrete-time representation, the proposed method yields higher achievable rates with a much lower feedback burden. Through extensive simulations over mmW channel models, we confirm the effectiveness of our claims, and show that the proposed approach reduces the feedback burden by up to 70%.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) based modulation classifiers, despite their unprecedented accuracy, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a transformer generator, named TRANS-G, for the modeling and constructing of universal adversary perturbations (UAPs). Built upon the characteristics of modulated signals, the proposed TRANS-G has a tailored nature with many advantages. First, the proposed generator is highly efficient in that it can generate a large number of UAPs in a short period of time with a strong attack capability. Second, UAPs constructed by TRANS-G have a focus nature, which enhances the efficiency of attack. In addition, the focus feature is independent from the models to attack, allowing a transfer-ability of TRANS-G from model to model. Third, the crafted UAPs have same probability distribution as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) in the wireless channels. The low-power and noise-like variations facilitate the invisibility of UAPs. Fourth, the diversity constraint introduced in the loss function design encourages TRANS-G to have a diverse exploration of perturbations. Both focus nature and diverse explorations of UAPs enable TRANS-G to have a good transfer-ability. By taking into account the effects of channel fading, we extend our research from the AWGN channels to the fading channels, validating the attack capability of the proposed method in realistic wireless scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used modulation classifiers: VT-CNN2, CLDNN, and ResNet, which validate the performance advantage of the proposed method in terms of attack performance, diversity, focus, invisibility and model transfer ability.},

However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.},

This development necessitates the establishment of secure and reliable buoyed node-to-AUV links to safeguard sensitive information. However, existing methods such as cryptography and channel coding introduce latency and computational complexity, primarily due to the inherent challenges of acoustic communications, including limited bandwidth and low energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose implementing intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) between buoyed nodes and AUVs, creating what we term buoyed-to-IRS-to-AUV (BIA) links. The BIA link enables secure and reliable communications by dynamically adjusting its beam widths and IRS depth in response to variations in wind and sea current speeds. In this paper, we introduce the BIA link topology, develop a comprehensive model for it, and derive a mathematical expression for the link&#39;s outage probability. Additionally, we formulate the ratio of channel secrecy rate in the MAX-MIN optimization problem and solve it using an exhaustive search method to ensure optimality. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the BIA link achieving an impressive 300% increase in the secrecy rate compared to the buoyed-AUV link.},

Channel estimation with fractional Doppler can be considered as an off-grid sparse signal recovery problem, where the virtual sampling grid is introduced in the delay-Doppler domain. First-order linear approximation as a conventional approach to estimate fractional Doppler and sparse signal in OTFS systems. However, linear approximation approach may incur considerable modeling errors, since the finite sampling grid may be insufficiently refined in the OTFS systems. Furthermore, this error will deteriorate recovery performance. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) method to jointly estimate the fractional Doppler and sparse channel vectors. Specifically, we reformulate the input-output relationship for fractional Doppler, and further present an off-grid channel estimation model. Then, an in-exact block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is adopted to iteratively update the associated parameters under the SBL framework. Fractional Doppler can be iteratively refined to eliminate the off-grid gap using the gradient descent method. The proposed scheme presents an exact channel estimation model that avoids any approximation operation, so that it effectively alleviates the model error. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Specifically, the proposed RCTS-LAMP is a model-driven neural network that combines the advantages of compressive sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL) by using the deep unfolding technique. By doing so, we can recover the direct and cascaded channels with CS under low training overhead, and the estimation performance can be significantly improved with the joint optimization of DL. Meanwhile, the cascaded channel estimation is decomposed into two stages to reduce computational complexity further. Numerical results show that the RCTS-LAMP network can estimate the cascaded channel with a better trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy, while the direct channel can be jointly recovered without adding an extra network.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a promising technique of aggregating massive data from distributed Internet-of-Things Nodes (IoTNs) has been proposed, which is referred to as over-the-air computation (AirComp). Since the computational accuracy degrades as the number of IoTNs increases, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) may be considered for improving the computation performance by improving the degrees of freedom. However, the passive beamforming performance of RISs degrades in the face of environmental factors, e.g., snow, dirt, and precipitation. To address this impediment, we investigate the robust design of RIS-assisted AirComp systems under realistic imperfections. We first characterize two models of imperfections in terms of their statistical features, namely by the long-term and the short-term model. To deal with the long-term imperfections, a minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimator is harnessed first for estimating the imperfections. Then we propose an optimization algorithm to optimize the computational accuracy by alternatively updating the transmit coefficients of the IoTNs, the active receive beamforming of the fusion center (FC), and the passive beamforming of the RIS. In particular, the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) technique is invoked for updating the passive beamforming vector. As for the short-term imperfections, we resort to optimize the computational accuracy in the worst-case scenario owing to imperfect passive beamforming at the RIS. Another alternating optimization algorithm is developed for solving the associated Min-max problem. Our numerical results verify that our developed beamforming designs substantially outperform their non-robust counterparts. Specifically, our algorithm conceived for mitigating the long-term imperfections approaches the performance of idealized perfect beamforming designs relying on unimpaired RISs.},

In this paper, to alleviate the large training overhead in millimeter wave (mmWave) beam alignment, an environment-aware and training-free beam alignment prototype is established based on a typical CKM, termed beam index map (BIM). To this end, a general CKM construction method is first presented, and an indoor BIM is constructed offline to learn the candidate transmit and receive beam index pairs for each grid in the experimental area. Furthermore, based on the location information of the receiver (or the dynamic obstacles) from the ultra-wide band (UWB) positioning system, the established BIM is used to achieve training-free beam alignment by directly providing the beam indices for the transmitter and receiver. Three typical scenarios are considered in the experiment, including quasi-static environment with line-of-sight (LoS) link, quasi-static environment without LoS link and dynamic environment. Besides, the receiver orientation measured from the gyroscope is also used to help CKM predict more accurate beam indices. The experiment results show that compared with the benchmark location-based beam alignment strategy, the CKM-based beam alignment strategy can achieve much higher received power, which is close to that achieved by exhaustive beam search, but with significantly reduced training overhead.},

  abstract     = {Ambient backscatter communication (ABC) is a promising method of reducing energy consumption in wireless communications. Previous works on signal detection for ABC often assume that the ambient source signal is always present during backscattering. However, this may not be the case due to the random traffic of the ambient source and the asynchronous operation between source and tag. In this work, the effect of source signal traffic on the detection performance is studied for ABC systems. Firstly, the performances of the existing detectors are analyzed in the presence of source traffic. Both random arrival and random departure are considered. The exponential and uniform traffic models are used. Their bit error rate expressions are obtained by taking advantage of different approximation methods. Then, new detectors taking into account the random traffic models are derived by weighting the samples exponentially or linearly with their arrival times. Numerical results show that the random source traffic could cause large performance degradation to the existing detectors, leading to error floors at small signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In particular, the exponential departure causes the largest performance degradation, followed by the uniform arrival and departure. Numerical results also show that the new detectors could have significant performance gains over the conventional detectors in the presence of source traffic. In some case, the gain could be over 3 dB in SNR, and it increases with the sample size and traffic parameters. However, this gain could become negative for large SNRs and small sample sizes due to the use of heuristic detection thresholds.},

In the proposed architecture, the transmitting BS and the receiving BSs cooperate to complete target location and beam tracking. When the transmitting BS transmits to terminals, multiple receiving BSs apply extended kalman filter (EKF) or unscented kalman filter (UKF) to predict locations of terminals based on received echoes, and then the location information is fed back to the transmitting BS to assist in beam tracking. To improve the performance of beam tracking, we first analyze the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) of prediction performance under the first-order Taylor approximation. Then, we investigate the subcarrier and power allocation problem during tracking, which is essentially a sequential decision problem. We propose a novel algorithm that combines optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve optimal overall performance.

This paper presents the first realistic experimental validation of such studies, involving a commercial 5G mmWave BS with a customized beam sweep procedure and a user equipment (UE) development kit mounted on a test vehicle. We present the relevant signal models, and signal processing methods, and validate these based on data collected in an outdoor science park environment. Our results indicate that positioning is possible, but the performance is limited by the knowledge of the position and orientation of the infrastructure and the multipath visibility and diversity.},

  abstract     = {In this work, to tackle the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage constraint, a new transmission scheme for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) visible light communications (VLC) employing optical reflecting intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed and analyzed. To this end, the idea is to address the critical V2V-VLC LoS blockage impact concerning mobility scenarios. Moreover, multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs)/transmitters-based headlights are employed to enhance the transmission propagation paths. Consequently, it significantly improves the overall reliability of the proposed RIS-aided V2V-VLC model. Further, to emphasize the reliability of the proposed V2V-VLC model, comprehensive path loss and energy efficiency modeling are accentuated. For the realistic V2V-VLC findings, modeling of the path loss corresponding to the intermediate communication links, i.e., between transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver is emphasized. A novel closed-form expression of a lower bound for the required number of RIS elements to attain a targeted energy efficiency is also developed. Further, to mark interesting research insights, the performance of the proposed RIS-aided V2V-VLC scheme is also compared with the existing scheme. Furthermore, considering the key findings, it is observed that the proposed RIS-aided V2V-VLC scheme offers reliable communication despite mobility-concerned blockage. Moreover, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing scheme concerning the targeted energy efficiency for the reasonable number of required RIS reflection elements.},

  abstract     = {Symbiotic radio (SR) has recently been proposed to improve the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency of the Internet of Things. Therefore, the resource allocation (RA) algorithm has always been a research hotspot in SR systems. However, most of the current RA algorithms have assumed only one backscatter device or perfect channel state information (CSI), which is unrealistic in practical SR systems. In this paper, we formulate a robust RA problem for a downlink SR system with imperfect CSI to maximize the system throughput and decrease transmission outages. Specifically, a throughput-maximization robust RA problem is formulated subject to the outage rate constraints of both the primary users and backscatter devices. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we design an iterative-based robust RA algorithm that exploits Bernstein-type inequality, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, and alternating optimization methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a 16.41% throughput increment compared to the non-symbiotic algorithm. Moreover, the actual outage probability of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 65.15% compared to the non-robust algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of resource-hungry applications, a common paradigm to quickly respond to the ever-increasing demands of tasks is mobile edge computing (MEC), which deploys resources on the premise of grasping task information (including time and quantity of task release, etc). Actually, task generation is dynamic in many practical scenarios, and it is unrealistic for MEC servers to acquire a task&#39;s demand for computing resources beforehand until task execution is completed. It is also challenging to ensure all tasks can be processed before their deadlines. In this paper, we characterize task generation as a dynamic process, implying that MEC servers only obtain the task information in the current time slot. Also, we assume the task&#39;s demand for computing resources is uncertain with only knowledge of its mean and variance. To eliminate this uncertainty, we leverage the chance-constrained program (CCP) method, which also offers a probabilistic guarantee to the task deadline. Moreover, we formulate a long-term time-averaged task processing power minimization problem, which is transformed into a series of per-slot deterministic optimization problems utilizing the Lyapunov algorithm. Given that the transformed problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, a joint optimization algorithm considering UE access, power control, and resource allocation (JUPR) is proposed to decouple the MINLP problem into three sub-problems. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the JUPR algorithm can consume 22% less power per task than the average resource allocation algorithm and 12% less power per task than the random resource allocation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Understanding fundamental limits of the anti-interference performance of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) systems is essential for efficient anti-interference implementation. Existing research contributions on anti-interference implementation mainly aims at blocking interference and DSSS with long period sequences (LPS-DSSS). However, broadband interference, due to high energy efficiency, is a more effective interference mode to DSSS systems. Conventional bit error rate (BER) models bring errors during the despreading process in DSSS with short period sequences (SPS-DSSS). Therefore, in this paper, we propose the maximum matching decision criteria (MMDC) based statistical BER model that is capable of accurately evaluating the BER for both LPS and SPS systems. Firstly, explicit mathematical model of the despreading of MSK signals in DSSS systems is established; Then, mathematical models of despreading under typical interference modes, i.e., multi-tone and pseudo-random noise (PN) code MSK interference, are derived. Finally, statistical BER model is proposed using the MMDC scheme to evaluate the BER performance. Extensive simulation and experimental results reveal that: 1) the proposed statistic BER model outperforms conventional BER model for SPS-DSSS systems, and is consistence with that for LPS-DSSS; 2) for MSK DSSS systems, PN code MSK interference outperforms multi-tone interference in the BER performance; 3) practical tests demonstrate that the same PN code length interference is capable of obtaining higher BER performance than different PN code lengths interference, due to the strong correlation between the interference signal and the desired signal in DSSS systems.},

  abstract     = {Existing works on space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) have not sufficiently explored the synergy between control- and user-plane separation (CUPS) and end-to-end (E2E) network slicing. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of E2E network slicing for CUPS-based SAGIN (CUPS-SAGIN), where the control base stations (BSs), control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) together with the low earth orbit (LEO) satellites form the control plane (CP) to provide access for users, while the traffic BSs and traffic UAVs form the user plane (UP) to provide various services for users. We develop two typical E2E network slices for the CP, i.e., massive access and wide-area access slices, as well as two typical E2E network slices for the UP, i.e., high throughput and low delay slices. The utilities of the two CP access slices are defined based on their access percentages, while the utilities of the two UP service slices are defined based on their E2E throughput and delay, respectively. To maximize the sum-utility of the four E2E network slices, a judgement network-assisted deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is designed to jointly optimize the UAV position, users&#39; association with BS/UAV/LEO satellite and the allocations of the transport network capacity, downlink bandwidth and transmission power. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed E2E network slicing for CUPS-SAGIN in terms of the access percentage, E2E throughput and delay as compared with the benchmarks, including the E2E network slicing schemes for the terrestrial cellular networks, coupled SAGINs, etc.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on Digital Twin Driven Network Slicing (DTDNS) for Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployment and network information synchronization. Firstly, we abstract the data collection function of DTDNS as an information synchronization VNF, deploy it jointly with service VNFs, and propose a VNFs joint deployment model and an information synchronization model. Secondly, we introduce an optimization problem to maximize service and information synchronization utility, which consists of a deployment subproblem and an information synchronization subproblem. Additionally, we introduce a distributed VNF deployment and information synchronization algorithm to address these issues. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce information synchronization delay and node deployment costs. Furthermore, the distributed VNF deployment and information synchronization algorithm can enhance algorithm convergence speed and reduce training time.},

Recently, we have witnessed an enrichment of source data prompting us to design more robust DOA estimator, where artificial neural network (ANN)-based DOA estimators have shown their superior performance as compared to the traditional subspace-based DOA estimation methods. However, these data-driven DOA estimation methods tend to rely on parameters that are computationally intensive for efficient processing/running with the limitation of hardware resources. Thus, we propose an event-driven spiking neural network (SNN) model, namely, Joint-Scnn, for DOA in the presence of various imperfections, which consists of ANN-based and SNN-based modules with weights sharing. The former not only contributes to assist sparse SNN-based module to learn latent information, but also enhances its robustness via self-learning. The superior estimation performance and lower power consumption have been verified via experimental results. The success of Joint-Scnn is partially attributed to the teacher-student tandem learning scheme.},

In this paper, we tackle this challenging resource allocation problem of the URLLC system for HSR. Specifically, we establish the train-ground URLLC model for the HSR communication system with mobile relays (MRs), based on which we formulate the optimization problem with the QoS requirements of URLLC as constraints for maximizing the system&#39;s energy efficiency. By decomposing this challenging optimization problem into two subproblems, a heuristic algorithm is adopted to optimally allocate the transmit power and bandwidth of users with the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. The simulation results show that compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in resource allocation optimization of user bandwidth and transmit power.},

Furthermore, a symbol-by-symbol aided expectation propagation (SS-EP) detector is designed for our SM-VBLAST system communicating over generalized fading channels. Our theoretical ABEP bounds are confirmed by simulation results in the cases of small-scale antenna parameters, which is helpful for the bit error rate (BER) performance evaluation in ultra-massive antenna configurations.

  abstract     = {The hierarchical aggregation and control of electric vehicles (EVs) is an effective way to promote the consumption of clean energy and ensure the balance of power demand-supply. In the case of increasingly insufficient wireless resources of cellular networks, one challenging problem is how to guarantee the real-time and accurate service interaction requirements of massive services in EV aggregation response. In this paper, in order to support the communication process of EV hierarchical aggregation and control, a hierarchical communication network architecture of “Central cloud- Regional cloud- Edge unit- EVs” is proposed. Considering the differences of service processing functions and communication demands of each layer, the utility function models are constructed to describe the different demands on the timeliness and accuracy. And based on the utility functions, a network communication resource allocation model is established to allocate power and channel resources on demand. Finally, to reduce the amount of computation, this paper proposes the joint allocation algorithm of power and channel resources based on the improved water-filling algorithm, adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and two-sided matching theory. The simulation experiment results illustrate that the total utility of the proposed algorithm is increased by 0.43 times on average compared with the channel average allocation (H-A), and 0.08 times compared with the layer-by-layer optimization (H-NJO).},

The superposition of speed changes under fault shock further causes more difficulty for the direct denoising of signals. Therefore, a denoising framework that can directly process the original vibration signal under speed change has been proposed in this study. The framework includes a variable peak search approach and an adaptive least square (ALS) algorithm. The established variable peak search can capture the transient shock at variable speed. Besides, the proposed ALS algorithm can adaptively search the optimal parameters for the best denoising results. Simulations and actual equipment tests have demonstrated that the proposed framework can effectively reduce noise which has a satisfactory result under speed change conditions. Meanwhile, the performance is superior to other approaches showing its potential for applications on rail transit trains. Especially our study may apply to other typological vehicles under speed change conditions.},

  abstract     = {Array radar signal processing is extensively employed in a variety of applications, including the detection of targets and the estimation of parameters for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nonetheless, within radar systems, effectively mitigating multiple concurrent interferences, especially the mainlobe interferences (MLIs), during the estimation of target parameters remains a significant technical challenge. The objective of this research is to investigate anti-interference and high-precision angle measurement in monopulse radar for distributed array nodes (DAN) in the presence of multiple oppressive MLIs and sidelobe interferences (SLIs). Firstly, the signal model of the DAN including the target and interferences is established. Then, to make the monopulse curve consistent with the quiescent monopulse curve while suppressing MLIs and SLIs, a processing approach that the received signal is weighted by two-stage including intra-node and inter-node weighting is proposed, achieving the purpose of angle measurement. Also, the DAN in actual conditions is taken into account, such as computational and transmissive resource limitations. So, a modified framework genetic algorithm is applied for node selection to reduce the pressure on computational resources while improving the effectiveness of MLIs suppression. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs the suppression of three MLIs and two SLIs with 8 nodes, and the nullings of all interferences in pattern are below −60 dB. In addition, the proposed method achieves angle estimation for up to three targets. Further, the performance enhancement of MLIs suppression by selecting the optimal 8 nodes out of 15 nodes is confirmed, and the nullings of all three MLIs are decreased by at least 10 dB with regard to the worst case.},

Maintaining the contact force between the pantograph and the overhead line is essential to ensure the robustness of the power supply and to minimise mechanical wear. This paper proposes an innovative pneumatic pressure-controlled active pantograph, tested through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiments. The proposed easy-to-implement active pantograph is achieved by controlling the air pressure entering the pantograph. The controller design is based on an identified linear model, considering disturbance rejection performance and control input limitations. Experimental results show that the closed-loop active pantograph can robustly and effectively reduce the contact force deviation. This highlights the capability of designing active pantographs through pressure control and model-based design philosophy to achieve improved pantograph–catenary contact performance.},

The proposed radar divides the transmitted OFDM signal into multiple sub-bands along the frequency axis and provides orthogonality to these sub-bands by multiplying phase codes in both the time and frequency domains. Although the sampling rate is reduced by the factor of the number of sub-bands, the sub-bands above the sampling rate are folded into the lowest one due to aliasing. In the process of restoring the signals in folded sub-bands to those in full signal bands, the proposed PC-SNS-OFDM radar effectively eliminates symbol-mismatch noise while introducing trade-offs in the range and Doppler ambiguities. The utilization of phase codes in both the frequency and time domains provides flexible control of the range and Doppler ambiguities. It also improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detected targets compared to an earlier sub-Nyquist sampling OFDM radar system. This is validated with simulations and experiments under various sub-Nyquist sampling rates.},

  abstract     = {Improper torque division strategy in vehicles leads to unnecessary energy consumption as well as poor driving comfort and safety. Previous research ignores the time-delay phenomenon of vehicle power systems, hindering the further improvement of related performance. In this work, an efficient two-layer torque split strategy with the consideration of the time-delay phenomenon is proposed to improve tracking accuracy, reduce fuel consumption, and avoid battery electrical abuse. In the upper layer controller, an optimal energy management strategy (EMS) is developed to coordinate between the battery state and engine fuel consumption rate by solving a nonlinear optimization problem, generating the reference torque split scheme. The bottom layer controller is based on Time-delay Model Predict Control (TMPC), comprehensively considering the reference torque split scheme, future information, and vehicle power system information. This TMPC strategy reduces both the torque tracking error and velocity tracking error by exploiting the characteristics that hydraulic braking system (HBS), motor and engine have different response times. Event-trigger (ET) mechanism is introduced in the frame of TMPC for the trade-off between control performance and computation efficiency. Stability and feasibility are theoretically guaranteed by the invariant set method. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

In this paper, a novel self-balanced multi-channel WPT system is proposed to promote the power level as well as the system reliability. The key is to adopt a three-loop control strategy to realize power balance among the multi-channels. Firstly, the multi-channel WPT system is demonstrated and its order-reduced transfer function is derived. Then, the three-loop control strategy is proposed and the operational principles are illustrated. Next, the controller of each loop is designed with the analysis of the optimized performance. Finally, a prototype of three-channel parallel WPT system is constructed and a set of experiments are carried out. The results show that the output voltage can be stabilized around the set value and the steady-state error is less than 5%. And the current-sharing error can be reduced from 5.48% to 0.51%, which has a good current sharing effect. The output power of the system can reach about 20kW and the efficiency can reach 90.30%. At the same time, it can be stabilized within 40 ms when the working condition changes, and has good dynamic response. Meanwhile, the proposed system has good performance under different misalignment conditions.},

In this paper, we present a novel UAV charging scheduling and speed control framework that optimizes the decisions on flight speed and charging schedule at roadside charging stations to achieve timely and energy-efficient goods delivery. The approach we take is to first formulate a finite-horizon Markov decision process (FH-MDP) problem and then analytically and rigorously reveal the underlying structure of the optimal solution to the problem. Specifically, a FH-MDP is put forth to minimize the energy requirement of the UAV while guaranteeing timely delivery at the destination. We analytically reveal an underlying monotone deterministic Markovian policy, asserting that the optimal charging time and speed are monotonic regarding the distance remaining and the time elapsed. We also show that the optimal charging time and speed change only when the UAV reaches the derived distance- and time-related thresholds. Simulations also show that our approach can extend the flight distance of the UAV by at least 19.8% under our simulation setting, compared to the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The precision of trajectory tracking significantly influences the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate and use control algorithms to reduce the tracking error between the real vehicle and the expected trajectory. However, the discrete expected trajectory points generated by traditional planners result in an estimation bias of tracking error. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT) function to calculate the projection point of the real vehicle on the expected trajectory, serving as the position of the DT vehicle, resulting in a more precise estimation of tracking error between the real vehicle and the expected trajectory. We then use the lateral and longitudinal control algorithms of autonomous vehicles to enable the vehicles to track the expected trajectory with the expected speed and acceleration by reducing the tracking error. For lateral control, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm are improved by incorporating a feedforward Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID). For longitudinal control, a real data-based PID algorithm is designed for longitudinal trajectory tracking. Experimental results based on real vehicle experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both lateral and longitudinal control accuracy, as well as driving stability. Compared to state-of-the-art model-based lateral control algorithms Double-layer MPC and Baidu&#39;s Apollo LQR, the lateral error is reduced by more than 60%. Compared to the model-based longitudinal PID algorithm, the longitudinal speed error is reduced by at least 38%. The oscillation amplitude of the wheel angle and yaw angle is also obviously decreased.},

A novel adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is proposed in this study to achieve the control objective, which incorporates two contributions: Firstly, a finite-time prescribed performance function (PPF) is proposed for the prescribed performance control (PPC) based on a simplified error transformation formulation, which is used to embody the desired performance specifications and make PPC control design less complex but able to guarantee the tracking error constrained in a prescribed region within a finite time; Secondly, a stabilizing PPC controller is synthesized based on a modified Nussbaum-type function and barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), which also encompasses a simplified adaptive neural network (ANN) term for approximating the unknown system nonlinearities. The synthesized FTC controller is capable of realizing the finite-time prescribed transient control while handling the actuator failures and input saturations simultaneously. The results of a high-fidelity Simulink-CarSim simulation on a slippery road have validated the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed synthesized FTC strategy compared with a traditional sliding mode control (SMC), and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation has been implemented to verify the real-time performance of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In long baseline (LBL)/inertial navigation system (INS) round-trip tightly coupled navigation, the traditional tightly coupled method exhibits the function model mismatch and the observation distance error. To address this issue, we proposed a high-precision LBL/INS round-trip tightly coupled navigation based on constrained acoustic ray-tracking and Rauch-Tung-Streibel (RTS) smoothing. Specifically, the method develops the system and measurement models tailored for LBL/INS round-trip tightly coupled navigation to improve the state estimation accuracy of the filter. A novel round-trip acoustic ray-tracking based on the depth constraint is then introduced to reduce the distance observation errors. Additionally, the measurement model is transformed into the local Cartesian coordinate system to facilitate acoustic round-trip ray-tracking. Finally, RTS smoother is utilized to enhance the smoothness of the navigation results. The simulation test results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the traditional method, with a reduction of 35.6 $\%$ and 67.0 $\%$ in the three-dimensional root mean square (3D-RMS) value of the navigation errors, respectively. In the field experiment, the proposed methods display a decrease of 11.7 $\%$ and 38.8 $\%$ in the 3D-RMS value in contrast to the traditional method, respectively. These findings indicate that the proposed methods exhibit superior accuracy, stability and availability compared to the traditional method.},

  abstract     = {As an important component of land transportation systems, tracked vehicles (TRVs) and wheeled vehicles (WVs) have developed independently in parallel, particularly in the modeling of vehicle-ground interactions. However, their differences are not as significant as they appear. This paper introduces a simplified terramechanics-based track-ground interaction model for the motion control of TRVs on firm ground. The simplified interaction model addresses the problem that the terramechanics-based models are too complex to be applied to optimization-based real-time control algorithms. Interestingly, the proposed track-ground interaction model closely resembles to the tire model used for WVs. Through comparison, we present the unified mechanisms underlying vehicle-ground interactions. In our approach, TRVs can be treated as a special type of skid-steer WV, which benefits the theories and methods of wheel vehicles to be deployed in the TRV domain. Finally, we verify the proposed interaction model with extensive dynamic data from a real dual motor-driven TRV to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

However, the visible real-time images could be easily influenced by illumination in applications, and it makes the localization system unable to work. In this paper, an image registration network (NIVnet) is proposed to deal with near-infrared real-time and visible reference images for the multimodal visual localization system of UAVs in GPS-denied environments. In NIVnet, a new feature extraction strategy is first developed to reduce the modality differences of input images. The input images are embedded into a common feature space with disentangled representations. Then, a new bidirectional matching layer is proposed by matching a pair of input images twice in one registration process. Such matching layer can effectively handle large geometric deformations between the images to be registered. Finally, an intensity loss is introduced to further enhance performance by measuring the similarity of monomodal images rather than multimodal images. The proposed NIVnet can predict the affine transformation parameters in an end-to-end way, and thus the localization of UAVs is accelerated. Extensive experiments on three synthetic datasets are conducted to demonstrate the validity of NIVnet, and experimental results show that NIVnet can effectively improve localization accuracy.},

We propose a new method, which condenses all the existing measurements into a MAP estimate of the current state of the system, and calculates the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) to gauge the reliability of the estimate. This method, termed as the CRB-Kalman filter (CRB-KF), can deal with nonlinearity better than the widely-used extended Kalman filter (EKF) and is computation-wise much more efficient than the particle filter (PF). We then apply the CRB-KF to the localization and tracking of a vehicle aided by some roadside base-stations, which would be important for the emerging application of autonomous driving. Simulation results show that the proposed method, where Cramér and Rao meet with Kalman, can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, including the EKF, the cubature KF and the PF.},

On this regard, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods can achieve better traffic efficiency and success rate than rule-based methods, but they occasionally lead to collisions. This paper proposes a safety-enhanced method that integrates the DRL and the Dimensionality Reduction Monte Carlo Tree Search (DRMCTS) algorithm to achieve safety-enhanced trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections. First, DRMCTS is employed to address the partially observable Markov decision process problem. Through dimensionality reduction, it effectually enhances computational efficiency and problem-solving performance. Then a unified framework is introduced by simultaneously implementing DRL and the Gaussian Mixture Model Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) in real-time. DRL determines actions in the current state while GMM-HMM identifies the turning intentions of surrounding vehicles (SVs). Under safe driving conditions, DRL makes decisions and outputs longitudinal acceleration with optimized ride comfort and traffic efficiency. When unsafe driving conditions are detected, DRMCTS would be activated to generate a collision-free trajectory to enhance the ego vehicle&#39;s driving safety. Through comprehensive simulations, the proposed scheme demonstrates superior traffic efficiency and reduced collision rates at unsignalized intersections with multiple SVs present.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cell electric vehicles are usually hybrid vehicles requiring an energy management strategy (EMS) to determine the power split between the fuel cell system and a battery. The performance of an EMS can be improved by taking into account forecasts of the vehicle velocity. Simple estimates derived from static route information, e.g., speed limits, can already provide a significant performance increase because they are available before departure and for the entire driving mission. However, such long-term predictions can deviate considerably from the actual velocity because of dynamic influences, such as traffic, roadworks, or weather. Here, short-term predictions from vehicular communication systems provide more accurate real-time information and allow the EMS to react better to the actual driving conditions. This article proposes a predictive EMS that optimally combines the information of long-term and short-term forecasts. Before departure, a dynamic programming algorithm optimizes the energy management based on static route information yielding a distance-based map describing the optimal cost-to-go. While driving, a model predictive controller (MPC) optimizes the energy management in real time considering the short-term prediction and including the optimal cost-to-go representing the long-term information as terminal cost. A computationally efficient linear MPC implementation is proposed, and the significant performance benefit over an MPC that tracks an optimized battery state of charge reference is demonstrated in a numerical study.},

Moreover, the unknown dynamics of the controlled vehicle are modeled approximately by the fuzzy wavelet neural networks, while a compensation function is designed to overcome the composite perturbation comprising the external disturbances and estimation errors. In addition, a switching event-triggered mechanism-based adaptive fixed-time control design is proposed, which not only achieves non-periodic updating of the control signal but also effectively eliminates control singularity and computational complexity present in traditional recursive control frameworks. Stability analysis confirms the practical fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system.

The three-dimensional multi-AUV formation is maneuvered (e.g., rotation, scaling, shear, coplanarity, collineation, etc.) by fusion of the affine transformation technique. The desired yaw angles of all AUVs are acquired in real time by utilizing their desired trajectories, which is with the high yaw maneuverability. Besides, the continuous adaptive sliding mode control protocol is designed to guarantee the high flexibility and formation maneuverability for the multi-AUV formation. The $\sigma$ -modification technique is employed to design the non-monotonic adaptive sliding mode switch gain laws, which can avoid the unexpectedly large gain to reduce the chattering amplitude. Furthermore, the event-triggered mechanism is devised to transmit the control signals intermittently in the controller-thruster channels, which can further mitigate the chattering frequency and save the communication resources. The proposed distributed affine formation control scheme is with merits of high maneuverability, saving communication and chattering reduction. Finally, the high-fidelity simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme under the real water current disturbances.},

  abstract     = {The tunnel entrance area usually has different velocity limitations and lane-drop bottleneck. The randomness of human-driven vehicles&#39; (HVs&#39;) lane-change behaviors could result in vehicle slowdown and collisions, which aggravate the traffic performance of the tunnel entrance area. The use of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is a powerful tool for creating control nodes and ensuring the indirect control of HVs to mitigate the negative impacts of HV&#39;s random lane-change behaviors. Balancing the differences in the penetration rate (PR) and vehicle density between each lane provides a means to increase the PR on the lanes that have fewer CAVs while reducing the PR for lanes with higher rates. In order to achieve this purpose, this paper proposes a new decentralized hierarchical trajectory programming algorithm to compute the lane-change sequence (or lane-change decision) of CAVs. The proposed algorithm is designed based on several trajectory programming strategies, including the Lane-value based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (LV-MCTS) algorithm and the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which deals with the randomness of HVs&#39; lane-change behaviors under time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies in a realistic traffic simulation environment show that the congestion caused by lane-drop bottleneck is improved along with the reduction of the average fuel consumption and travel time of the mixed traffic flow.},

Many deep learning-based methods have been proposed for their high accuracy and outstanding generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, they overlook the constraints posed by limited computational resources and memory capacity within real-time, online navigation systems. To strike a balance between positioning accuracy and model complexity, this paper proposes an Online Semi-supervised Transformer (OSS-Transformer) model for GNSS/INS integrated navigation that functions effectively during GNSS signal outages and has low computational requirements. This model comprises three critical components: 1) A Transformer-based architecture for adaptive feature extraction; 2) A self-supervised Masked Language Model (MLM) task to understand contextual relationships and feature distributions within INS data; 3) An improved memory replay technique for efficient online network training. Verified by the road test, the proposed OSS-Transformer based integrated navigation system reaches a maximum error of 6.02 m during 40 s outages and 9.81 m during 100 s outages, significantly outperforming traditional deep-learning methods. Additionally, the improved memory replay technique reduces loss by 26.23% compared to conventional methods, making it feasible on navigation devices with constrained computational resources and memory.},

First, the driving style was recognized through the implementation of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), followed by the prediction of the driving intention using a bi-directional long short-term memory-CNN (BILSTM-CNN) model. Subsequently, the predictive cruise control function was implemented using MPC, the safe following distance was determined based on the driving style, and the acceleration range was constrained in consideration of the driving intention. The safety and cruising performance of the system were validated through changes in relative speed and relative distance. Fuel consumption was reduced by 12.1% compared to the adaptive cruise control system, demonstrating the excellent fuel economy performance of our developed PCC system. Our PCC control strategy not only maintains good followability under various driving conditions, including cruising, acceleration, and deceleration, but also caters to different drivers&#39; personalized needs by considering their driving style and intention.},

A shifting function is first employed to adjust the tracking error, and together with a novel performance function, an improved FnTGPPC method is proposed, with which both strict restrictions that the initial conditions within a predefined region and must be known in prior all can be removed simultaneously, that is, for any known/unknown initial conditions, the given FnTGPPC method ensures the tracking error tends to the prescribed region. A predefined-time control scheme under the sliding mode control framework is further designed, such that the platoon tracking errors can converge to a predetermined region within the predefined time while avoiding the singularity phenomenon and improving the convergence speed of the system. By constructing numerical simulations and comparisons, the validity of the given scheme is demonstrated at last.},

The proposed approach incorporates a time-series motion risk field, capturing diverse road structures through a spatiotemporal map. Then, an adaptive motion primitive is developed, dynamically adjusting action time windows based on evolving risk and expected deviation during the search process. This enables efficient and accurate initial trajectory generation. Additionally, a bilevel corridor is introduced to extract the drivable area and re-represent the risk field, enabling trajectory smoothing to consider motion risk without resorting to non-convex optimization methods. Simulation results in structured and unstructured scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method improves efficiency, flexibility, and optimization quality compared to fixed-step search and single-level corridor-based optimization approaches. Real-world experiments on autonomous vehicles validated the dynamic characteristics and effectiveness of the proposed method in the actual environment.},

Taking full advantage of the heavy haul train&#39;s facilities, a proportional-integral (PI) control method based on the real-time speed error and the real-time displacement is proposed to represent the dynamic model of heavy haul train as port-Hamiltonian (PH) system framework, which implements the interactive feature of the in-train force and the damping feature of the basic resistance force effectively. Due to the proposed method, the real-time speed of heavy haul train asymptotically tracks the time-varying desired speed and the real-time displacement is small in whole operation procedure. Since the basic resistance force is utilized to construct the non-negative definite matrix and heavy haul train is represented as PH system, the proposed method is also effective for trajectory tracking control of heavy haul train subjected to the uncertain and time-varying basic resistances without parameter adaption or estimation. In short, a universal tracking control scheme is presented for heavy haul train subjected to the aforementioned different operative conditions.

  abstract     = {Vehicle platoons equipped with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) have the potential to improve traffic stability and reduce congestion. Existing CACC research lacks micro-level trajectory cluster observation regarding the impact of heterogeneous CACC platoons—comprising vehicles with different types and characteristics—on mixed traffic flow. This study implements a simulation framework that creates a realistic mixed traffic flow consisting of manual driving vehicles (HDVs) and heterogeneous CACC platoons on highway merging areas. By adjusting four influential factors: traffic volume, truck ratio, CACC market penetration rate (MPR), and CACC platoon size, a series of high-resolution trajectory data were obtained to analyze their influence on traffic flow characteristics. Subsequent analysis, using both quantitative statistical measures and visual demonstrations, revealed that higher traffic volumes and truck ratios lead to an expansion of congested areas. Whereas increasing the MPR of CACC platoons can alleviate this issue by reducing the overall oscillation level and actual traffic density, encouraging more vehicles to change lanes, thus blending clusters of high- and low-speed vehicles. However, the impact of increasing CACC Platoon size in a small range remains insignificant. This study can serve as a reference for investigating the mechanisms behind the impact of heterogeneous CACC platoons on the mixed traffic flow pattern.},

To precisely evaluate the cost of energy consumption and travel distance, a shortsighted evaluation model is designed, the evaluation model accounts for slope changes in 3-D terrain and mitigates the impact of the terrain beyond the search domain. A multi-race ant colony strategy is proposed in the MACPCS, and three types of ants are deployed in this strategy to search for paths in parallel, ensuring that energy consumption and travel distance are appropriately considered. The optimal path is achieved through a parallel chaos search strategy (with five tracks), and this strategy allows each ant to have different parameters and conduct global search, thus preventing local optima and ensuring high efficiency in 3-D terrain path planning. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the MACPCS in finding optimal path and reducing energy consumption for vehicle on 3-D terrain.},

Unlike indoor small-scale object point clouds, large-scale point clouds have inherent sparsity, abundant outliers, and other limitations. These characteristics often lead to low alignment accuracy and high time consumption when applying existing methods to large-scale point cloud registration. To address these issues, we propose an improved point cloud keypoints extracting method based on rotation compensation and a convolutional end-to-end unsupervised point cloud registration network. The former enables reliable keypoints extraction. The latter further extracts global features from the keypoint point clouds obtained by the former method and learns the overlapping region information between the source and target point clouds using a spatial attention weight encoder, and it can be trained efficiently without pose ground truth. To ensure fast and effective convergence of the network, we introduce a chamfer distance loss based on dynamic overlap rates. We test our method on two outdoor large-scale LIDAR point cloud datasets: PandaSet and KITTI odometry datasets. The results demonstrate excellent and stable performance, when it is applied to either original consecutive frames or the case of simulating large angular variations in real-world scenarios between consecutive frames by randomly transforming the target frame. Moreover, by applying our method&#39;s registration results as initial values to the classic ICP, we not only achieve optimal accuracy and robustness but also significantly accelerate the convergence of ICP, enhancing the efficiency of precise registration.},

However, existing physical models suffer from low accuracy due to modeling simplification and inaccurate model parameters, while data-driven models lack physical interpretability and robustness. To address these issues, a hybrid architecture inspired by vehicle lateral dynamics is developed in this study, which embeds the data-driven model into a physical model for parameter identification and error characterization to achieve accurate and interpretable modeling. Specifically, a physical lateral dynamics model with error analysis is established at first, and the problems of modeling error characterization and parameter identification are formulated. Then, the physical lateral dynamics model is deformed, and the modeling errors and cornering stiffness are unified into compound parameters. Using this deformed physical model, the modeling errors can be characterized by the identification of these compound parameters. To obtain high-precision compound parameters, a neural network-based parameter identification method is proposed, and the identified time-varying parameters enable high-precision characterization of modeling errors and parameters using data knowledge. By embedding the neural network into the deformed physical model, a hybrid model integrating physical laws and data knowledge is finally established for the description of vehicle lateral dynamics. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model realizes more accurate modeling of vehicle lateral dynamics than conventional physical and data-driven models.},

  abstract     = {With the development of automatic driving technology and the Internet of Vehicles, platooning based on control of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) has become one of the most promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) will coexist for a long period, and the inherent randomness of HDVs may cause traffic flow oscillations within the mixed platoon. This paper proposes a mixed platoon control strategy, Relative Position Encoding Multi Actor Attention Critic (RPE-MAAC), for CAVs operating in mixed platoons with HDVs. To be more specific, RPE-MAAC integrates relative position encoding into the MAAC framework, enhancing the model&#39;s capability to handle spatial relationships among platoon members and improve platooning control effectiveness. By incorporating HDV reaction delays in the reward function, RPE-MAAC ensures the stability of the mixed platoon, reducing disruptions and enhancing driving comfort. In particular, the more accurate HDV trajectory generation model, IDM-Informer, is incorporated into the problem formulation to provide feedback that more closely resembles real-world mixed platoon scenarios. Lastly, the effectiveness and stability of the proposed RPE-MAAC-based controller is verified through numerical simulations under various conditions. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is shown by comparing with existing traditional algorithms and state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.},

By comparing the widely used induction motor (IM) with the PMSM, this paper integrates the dynamic motor efficiency map, which plays a crucial role in energy saving, into the energy-efficient train control (EETC) problem. The paper adopts auxiliary variables and utilizes data transformation to perform double surface-fitting for highly nonlinear and non-convex dynamic efficiency. This transformation naturally distinguishes the train traction and braking operating states, further enhancing the solution accuracy of the EETC model. Results reveal that the proposed model, while maintaining high computational accuracy, can achieve millisecond-scale computation time, and the results are closer to the actual distribution of train operating points. Based on a real case analysis of Qingdao Metro Line, it was found that replacing the IM with PMSM as a traction motor does not require adjustments to the train operation control strategy, and the PMSM can save at least 1.01 kWh/km, achieving an energy-saving rate of 12.96%.},

Due to the complex structure and frequent traffic accidents, traditional rule-based methods struggle to address this issue flexibly and often produce suboptimal strategies. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has garnered significant attention for its exceptional performance in decision-making problems. We propose a local attention safety deep reinforcement learning (LA-SRL) decision-making method for ego vehicle right-turns at unsignalized intersections. LA-SRL enables paying attention to different states of social vehicles within complex traffic environments and effectively deals with the impact of surrounding vehicles on ego vehicle. This contributes to enhancement of safe driving efficiency. To further balance the safety and efficiency of decision-making for ego vehicle at unsignalized intersections with dense traffic flow, we design a safety-reward function composed of risk reward and avail reward. The safety-reward function enables ego vehicle to promptly navigate out of high-risk areas, meanwhile avoiding collisions and reducing waiting periods. Finally, we evaluate our method in the CARLA simulator. The results demonstrate that LA-SRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable success rate of 98.25% and reducing the average time to 6.6 seconds.},

Real-world communication systems, however, are usually constrained by wireless communication resources or reliability and cannot handle the enormous real-time data transmissions to support the delay-sensitive collaborative perception. To resolve this issue, we propose an efficient vehicular Collaborative Perception method based on Spatial-temporal feature Compression (CPSC) that exploits the trade-off between perception performance and bandwidth consumption. It performs feature-level compression by focusing on critical regions of perceptual information in the spatial-temporal domain and adapts traffic according to network conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first work where temporal feature redundancy is considered for enhancing the efficiency of collaborative perception. To thoroughly evaluate CPSC, we conduct extensive experiments of collaborative 3D object detection tasks on the real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and the simulated dataset OPV2V. The results show that CPSC outperforms the SOTA collaborative perception methods by 2.91% for AP@0.7 in OPV2V dataset and 1.71% for AP@0.5 in DAIR-V2X dataset. Meanwhile, CPSC attains a communication volume reduction of more than 10 times while consistently outperforming the previous SOTA method.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a trajectory planning framework for an automated merging vehicle on the freeway acceleration lane when it interacts with human-driven mainline vehicles. This is mainly ascribed to the prediction of the average accelerations of the mainline vehicles and a polynomial merging trajectory planning method. The ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) classifier was utilized to predict the average accelerations of the preceding and following vehicles on the mainline during the merging interaction process based on a naturalistic dataset at the merging zone. The accuracy of the acceleration prediction model for the preceding vehicle on the mainline is 97.7%, and for the following vehicle, it is 96.1%. In addition, an ERT-QP trajectory planning model considering the results of the ERT model and the necessary constraints was proposed based on the Quintic Polynomial (QP) function. The remaining distance in the acceleration lane is considered to guarantee that the lane-crossing behavior occurs before the end of the acceleration lane. The cost of the QP function was formulated based on the stability, duration, terminal speed, and distances between the merging vehicle and the target lane vehicles. At last, a simulation merging scenario on a freeway acceleration lane was established based on the SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) simulation platform and the MATLAB algorithm control platform. The simulation results showed that the ERT-QP trajectory planning model proposed performed better compared to the embedded SL2015 model in SUMO, with a more stable merging trajectory, a shorter merging duration, and a higher merging terminal speed.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing on a moving unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) remains a challenge as it is difficult for the UAV to track the real-time state of the UGV and adjust its landing policy accordingly. This paper proposes a learning framework for a quadrotor UAV to land on a moving UGV without knowing its motion dynamics. Specifically, the learning framework consists of two main systems: a Landing Vision System (LVS) using deep learning and a Landing Control System (LCS) using deep reinforcement learning. The LVS enables the UAV to recognize and localize the UGV in real time to estimate the relative position and velocity between them. Besides, the location of the UGV is tracked in the field of view of the UAV using consecutive images, alleviating the tracking failure problem. We propose a Memory Consolidated TD3 (MCTD3) algorithm to generate optimal policies to enable precise tracking and landing control of the UAV. In addition, we propose an adaptive COACH (ACOACH) algorithm that allows human intervention in the action space of the UAV to speed up the training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.},

  abstract     = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art Model-Free RL (MFRL) algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single vehicle only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles (PEs) with Trajectory Sampling (TS) algorithm namely MA-PETS . In particular, to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages PE neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterward, MA-PETS capably develops TS-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFRL.},

In this paper, the problem of autonomous navigation control of tracked unmanned vehicle formation in communication restricted environment is studied, and the Visual Limiting-Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (VL-MADDPG) algorithm is proposed. First, in order to reduce the influence of large policy space and non-stationary environment on algorithm convergence, a visual limiting mechanism is proposed. By focusing the dependent information of the algorithm decision within the visual boundary, the communication requirement is further reduced while the state space is compressed, and the learning efficiency of the algorithm is improved. Then, a non-sparse reward function with time series is constructed based on the tracked vehicle motion model, and the policy is further optimized on the basis of synthesizing continuous action information. Finally, the VL-MADDPG algorithm is proposed and embedded into the autonomous navigation control task of tracked unmanned vehicle formation, which is the first attempt of collaborative control of tracked vehicles by related algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence and scalability compared with other excellent algorithms, and can complete the autonomous navigation control task of the tracked unmanned vehicle formation in the communication restricted environment.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal trajectory analysis and trajectory recovery are essential tasks in transportation research, especially for offline vehicles, which enable comprehensive understanding of complex transportation systems and address the issue of incomplete or missing trajectory data. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Trajectory Recovery Framework, DTRF, which can effectively tackle both challenges by using a combination of a Cellular Automata (CA) model and a Multi-Kernel Graph Neural Network (MKGNN) model. The CA model plays a crucial role in normalizing and representing multi-modal traffic data with diverse structures, sampling frequencies, and physical meanings. By capturing the inherent relationships among different modalities, the CA model enables our proposed framework to make better use of these multi-modal data from networked vehicles and roadside detectors and then generate data for traditional vehicles. The MKGNN model, built on the foundation of spectral graph theory, employs various kernels to model different driving characteristics. The use of multiple kernels allows the GNN model to capture a wide range of driving patterns, enhancing its ability to reconstruct missing trajectories accurately. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory recovery, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {A vehicle platoon consisting of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can improve road capacity and decrease energy consumption. However, for such a system to be fully enabled, it is required for the system to be resilient to adverse events or operational changes. Vehicle platoon oscillation can greatly degrade the performance of the platoon and impair the system resilience. Therefore, in this work, strategies to dampen the oscillation are developed for resilience enhancement. Specifically, a resilience-oriented strategy-design framework that considers the deviation from nominal performance and the oscillation is first proposed. Then, the inherent damping property of a vehicle platoon under multiple-predecessor following (MPF) topology is formulated, followed by the construction of the weighted MPF-Helly model with the derivation of its inherent damping oscillation property and the string stability condition. Strategies are then designed guided by the resilience-oriented strategy-design framework and the characteristics of the weighted MPF-Helly model, including an analytical method of parameters reconciliation for inherent oscillation dampening, and a predecessor state prediction technique to restrain the oscillation caused by intermittent link failures. Numerical analysis and simulations implemented in the Carla simulator provide insights into the interaction effect between string stability and damping property, and proper utilization of these two characteristics can effectively dampen the inherent oscillation and restrain the propagated error for a platoon system. Furthermore, the results corroborate the proposed oscillation dampening approaches to maintaining a resilient platoon system when affected by operational changes or adverse events like link failures.},

  abstract     = {Recently, with the increasing deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, wireless transmitters have been extensively deployed in vehicles. And to enable high-capacity and high-speed communications everywhere in the world, the communication from vehicle to satellite (V2S) has emerged, particularly utilizing high throughput satellite (HTS) technology. However, the nonlinearity of the millimeter wave transmitter (mmWT) in a vehicle ends affects the quality of the V2S uplink transmitted signal gravely. Digital predistortion (DPD) linearization has shown promise in mitigating the nonlinearity of mmWTs. In addition, due to the powerful and complex feature fitting ability, neural networks have been used to nonlinear behavioral model and DPD linearize for broadband wireless communication systems. In this work, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with attention mechanism (GRU-attention) model is proposed for modeling and linearizing mmWTs in V2S communication systems. The attention mechanism in the GRU-attention model calculates a distribution matrix during the training process, which is utilized to weigh the GRU-attention model parameters, thereby enhancing the modeling accuracy. The linearization performance of the GRU-attention is experimentally evaluated by using a Ka-band 29 GHz mmWT with a 100 MHz bandwidth and 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) 5G NR signal. The experimental results demonstrate that the GRU-attention improves the adjacent channel power ratio of the mmWT by 18 dB, which is 4 dB better than that of the conventional GRU model.},

The main resonators have a combination of a fractal-shaped line and a uniform impedance resonator, which are combined and analyzed in an asymmetric SIR structure framework.

To properly operate, an estimation of the channel coefficients is mandatory, for this reason, superimposed training (ST), a technique that transmits pilot and data symbols together, have become an attractive solution. In ST-based channel estimation, an averaging of the received signal is required to mitigate the data interference over the pilots. Unlike reported works that employed oversimplified block-selective channel models to determine the averaging length of ST, in this paper, a frequency-selective model is considered in the analysis. Thus, realistic and more accurate mean square error (MSE) expressions for the ST-based least squares (LS) and minimum MSE (MMSE) channel estimators are theoretically derived. Then, the optimum number of averaged subcarriers, which provides the lowest MSE, is analytically computed. Simulated results considering parameters from 5G New Radio (NR) standard show that the MSE and symbol error rate (SER) metrics can be improved by more than one order of magnitude in contrast to previous works, which either did not average any subcarrier or averaged a group of subcarriers given by the coherence bandwidth simplification. Finally, the robustness of the proposed method, which guarantees a high tolerance in performance for a wide range of imperfect input parameters, is addressed.},

  abstract     = {The characterization and modeling of wireless channels are crucial prerequisites for designing communication systems. It must be measured and investigated, especially for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels. Vegetation in the road environment is expected to block the propagation signal and have an uncertain impact on channels. Therefore, the loss of communication quality due to vegetation can not be ignored for safety-related applications. This paper measures V2V channels in a vegetated environment, emphasizing the changes in large-scale fading, power delay features, spatial stationarity, and multipath characteristics caused by vegetation obstruction. Specifically, this paper points out that vegetation obstruction makes the wireless system need about 8 dB of extra fading margin and causes the average delay spread to increase by 30 ns. At the same time, vegetation obstruction intensifies the non-stationarity of V2V channels, resulting in a smaller stationary distance. In addition, in terms of multipath spatial characteristics, the azimuth spread has increased to about two times that of the general line-of-sight (LoS) scenario, which means more significant spatial dispersion. In this paper, the influence of vegetation obstruction on channel key parameters is quantified and modeled comprehensively.

  abstract     = {Estimating accurate channel state information (CSI) is a prerequisite to benefit from the deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, pilot overhead is required for estimating the high-dimensionality cascaded channel in RIS-assisted wireless communication systems in addition to considering the scaling ambiguity for separate channel decomposition. In this paper, we exploit a large number of elements at a RIS and the resulting slow variations of the channels between the RIS and the user terminals (UTs). Specifically, we exploit the channel hardening effect between the RIS and UTs and propose an algorithm to estimate the individual channel components for the RIS-assisted system based on the conjugate-gradient method. Moreover, we resolve the channel ambiguity in estimating the separate channels and introduce a three-interval sounding procedure where in the first two intervals we eliminate the product of the RIS-UTs channel matrix with its Hermitian and replace it with a diagonal matrix. Thereby, we transform the channel estimation problem into a tractable form and avoid the bi-linearity in RIS-assisted systems. Then, we deploy the conjugate gradient method to estimate the BS-RIS channel, which is assumed to be constant. In the last sounding phase, the RIS-UTs channel is estimated using conventional techniques such as the least-squares (LS) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators. The results confirm that hardening phenomena between the RIS and UTs channel make the channel estimation problem in the RIS-assisted system feasible and avoid the high degree of non-convexity.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and fast channel estimation is one of the challenging problems in achieving practical reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communication. However, a RIS-assisted communication system typically involves cascaded channels with intricate large-scale data distribution. Hence, practical implementation of the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator may be infeasible due to its excessive complexity. In addition, most of the existing artificial intelligence (AI)-based channel estimation methods generally rely on convolutional neural networks, which only guarantee the estimation accuracy without considering the estimation time. To address these problems, an efficient parallel Transformer (EPformer) is proposed to achieve efficient channel estimation by jointly considering both estimation accuracy and estimation time. Firstly, the channel estimation problem is formulated as a parallel super-resolution (PSR) problem, given that the elements on the RIS are typically distributed in a two-dimensional manner. Then, the multi-head attention mechanism is employed to extract the deep channel features from the input data in parallel. To further enhance the estimation accuracy, the super-resolution block (SRB) is designed to denoise the noisy channel matrices. Finally, the encoder-to-decoder paradigm is developed to enhance the estimation performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed channel estimation scheme.},

More precisely, we develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process that effectively captures the geometric fact that satellites are always positioned on orbits, and these orbits may vary in altitude. Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading. The derived statistics enable the evaluation of the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters.},

In order to strengthen the flight surveillance of UAVs and guarantee the airspace safety, UAVs can be equipped with the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system, which periodically sends flight information to other aircrafts and ground stations (GSs). However, due to the limited resource of channel capacity, UAVs equipped with ADS-B results in the interference between UAVs and civil aircrafts (CAs), which further impacts the accuracy of received information at GSs. In detail, the channel capacity is mainly affected by the density of aircrafts and the transmitting power of ADS-B. Hence, based on the three-dimensional poisson point process, this work leverages the stochastic geometry theory to build a model of the coexistence of UAVs and CAs and analyze the interference performance of ADS-B monitoring system. From simulation results, we reveal the effects of transmitting power, density, threshold and pathloss on the performance of the ADS-B monitoring system.

A major limitation of the existing robust statistics based EP solutions is that many of them assumed the fitting errors have a zero center, which may not be the case in NLOS environments tending to positively bias the BR data. We provide a practical remedy for this, by applying instead the maximum correntropy criterion with variable center (MCC-VC) to robustify the EP estimator and developing an alternating minimization algorithm for optimization.

However, this will also introduce the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic cascaded channels with Rician fading and the severe interference from other base stations (BSs) randomly scattered by the AIRSs leading to the performance fluctuation, which are the impacts that need to be analyzed. This paper proposes a 3D network model for ground users assisted by AIRSs considering the interference introduced by other BSs and that scattered by AIRSs to obtain the theoretical formula of coverage probability (CP) to analyze the system performance of such a network where the impacts of dynamic cascaded channels varying with $h$ are also considered. Specifically, the deployment of AIRSs is given by a 2D homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) with $h$ and thus the cascaded channel model is given to capture the contributions of LoS/NLoS links with height-sensitive Rician factor to re-derive the Gamma approximation of signal power distribution considering the ${\mathcal{O}}(N^{2})$ -gain brought by AIRS beamforming. In addition, the severe interference introduced by AIRSs through more LoS links is considered and then derive the formula of CP considering different deployment parameters. The numerical results show that the CPs of the users are significantly increased by about 62% and 77% by the aid of AIRSs compared with the IRS-aided network when $h=25$ m under different conditions with a larger working range while AIRSs are deployed in a more centralized manner.},

Most semantic communication systems are built upon advanced deep learning models whose training performance heavily relies on data availability. Existing studies often make unrealistic assumptions of a readily accessible data source, where in practice, data is mainly created on the client side. This circumstance limits the transmission of data due to privacy concerns, which is necessary for conventional centralized training schemes. To address this challenge, we explore semantic communication in a federated learning (FL) setting, which can harness the data of clients without compromising their privacy. Additionally, we design our system to lower the communication overhead by reducing the quantity of information delivered in each FL training round. This not only allows us to save significant bandwidth for resource-constrained devices but also reduces overall network traffic. Finally, we introduce a mechanism to aggregate the global model based on the client&#39;s performance, which we have referred to as FedLol. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Backscatter communication and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are emerging paradigms in wireless communication offering promising solutions to enhance spectral and energy efficiency of energy-constrained devices in 6G networks. This work introduces a symbiotic radio system tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and proposes an innovative framework that integrates backscatter-based IoT devices into the NOMA network. In this proposed system, the primary base station employs NOMA principles to serve both far and near users simultaneously. The IoT network consists of an IoT device equipped with a backscattering device that transmits its information over the primary signal, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the two. The IoT transmitter not only serves the IoT receiver but also concurrently enhances performance of the far user. This paper delves into an extensive analysis of the outage probabilities for the NOMA and IoT networks. The outage probability of the far user is obtained for the cases with and without a direct link between the primary base station and the far user. The obtained results clearly demonstrate a significant performance improvement over orthogonal multiple access techniques. Finally, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to validate the accuracy of the derived theoretical analysis.},

In this paper, we propose an ISAC-UAV assisted secure communication system amidst multiple eavesdroppers. In each time slot, we implement ISAC and communication functions. Since there are multiple eavesdroppers in the system, jammer UAV is required to send jamming signals to the eavesdroppers. During the ISAC process, the source UAV identifies multiple eavesdroppers, relaying their position information to a jammer UAV. During the communication process, multiple eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the communication link between source UAV and users. We use the center of all users as the horizontal location of the jammer UAV. To maximize the secure data transmit rate, we propose a joint optimization problem involving user scheduling, transmit power, and source UAV trajectory. We break down the non-convex optimization problem into three subproblems, and then achieve the suboptimal solution to the original problem through iteratively optimizing these subproblems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can achieve significant secure transmit rate even in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.},

While orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been a popular basic waveform, its primitive version falls short in sensing due to the inherent unregulated auto-correlation properties. Furthermore, the sensitivity to Doppler shift hinders its broader applications in dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a superposed index-modulated OFDM (S-IM-OFDM). The proposed scheme improves the sensing performance without excess power consumption by translating the energy efficiency of IM-OFDM onto sensing-oriented signals over OFDM. Also, it maintains excellent communication performance in time-varying channels by leveraging the sensed parameters to compensate for Doppler. Compared to conventional OFDM, the proposed S-IM-OFDM waveform exhibits better sensing capabilities and wider applicability in dynamic scenarios. Both theoretical analyses and simulations corroborate its dual benefits.},

Especially, to strictly fulfill no-fly requirements for certain zones, we treat the trajectory realistically in a continuous manner, which introduces new challenges in handling the highly non-convex problem with the infinite variables and infinite no-fly constraints over the continuous time domain. To facilitate the theoretical analysis on the focused problem, we first adopt the optimal successive-hover-and-fly (SHF) structure to reformulate the problem into a new one with finite variables without loss of optimality which allows tight convex problem approximations at any feasible point with the assistance of our proposed methodology. Then, based on rigorous mathematical analysis on NFZ constraint, problem with infinite NFZ constraints is transformed into solvable one equivalently, enabling an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution.

Unlike traditional transceivers, these neural transceivers are trainable using actual source data and channels, enabling them to extract and communicate semantics. On the flip side, each neural transceiver is inherently biased towards specific source data and channels, making different transceivers difficult to understand intended semantics, particularly upon their initial encounter. To align semantics over multiple neural transceivers, we propose a distributed learning based solution, which leverages split learning (SL) and partial NN fine-tuning techniques. In this method, referred to as SL with layer freezing (SLF), each encoder downloads a misaligned decoder, and locally fine-tunes a fraction of these encoder-decoder NN layers. By adjusting this fraction, SLF controls computing and communication costs. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of SLF in aligning semantics under different source data and channel dissimilarities, in terms of classification accuracy, reconstruction errors, and recovery time for comprehending intended semantics from misalignment.},

Although the highest spectral efficiency in such systems would be achieved using fully-digital precoding, the large number of antennas in massive MIMO systems makes using a radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna expensive and currently infeasible in practice. A common alternative solution is hybrid beamforming, which combines analog beamforming and digital precoding and reduces the required number of RF chains. The primary goal of hybrid beamforming is to provide precoding performance as close as possible to that of a fully-digital precoder. In this work, we consider two variants of a generative adversarial network (GAN), namely a conditional GAN (CGAN) and Wasserstein CGAN (WCGAN) to develop the hybrid precoder. The CGAN is used to implement the (partially-connected) analog beamformer and the WCGAN is used for the digital precoder. Our simulation results demonstrate the proposed method yields an improvement in spectral efficiency of about 12–19% over some existing hybrid beamforming schemes and achieves up to 87% of the performance of fully-digital precoding.},

Besides, estimating noise distribution and determining suitable detection window sizes greatly impact the performance of the CFAR detector. In this letter, we present a deep neural network (DNN)-based scheme for radar target detection with OTFS. In our proposed method, the deep learning network utilizes the OTFS demodulation signal, processed by two-dimensional (2D) pulse compression and expansion, as the input. The network outputs the proposal regions and the probability of the region containing a target according to the input and prior learning weights. Then a non-maximum suppression (NMS) method is proposed to suppress the false alarm rate. The simulation results illustrate the potential advantages of the proposed scheme, highlighting its superiority in multi-target detection and generalizability at multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with OTFS when compared to the classic benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a game theoretical anti-jamming beamforming approach is investigated for the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems in the presence of malicious jamming. The base station (BS) can transmit the communication signal and sense the echo of the target simultaneously. Meanwhile, the malicious jammer uses its sensing ability to adjust jamming power to implement precise jamming attack to the ISAC systems. Considering the impact of incomplete information on the anti-jamming strategy, we have developed a Bayesian Stackelberg game model, where BS acts as the leader and jammer assumes the role of the follower. In the follower sub-game, a closed-form solution is derived for the optimal jamming power. In the leader sub-game, the optimal transmit precoder is obtained by leveraging semidefinite relaxation and Gaussian randomization method. Furthermore, the proposed Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) has been proved to exist and be unique. Simulation results analyze the effect of channel uncertainty, observation error and beam pattern gain threshold on the system effectiveness, which demonstrates that the utility value of the proposed SE is significantly higher than that of the Nash equilibrium.},

Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed negative moment algorithm (NMA) can effectively suppress the adverse effects of impulsive noise to improve the equalization quality. Also, a modified Newton method is designed to search for the optimal equalizer so that the blind equalizer can rapidly converge to the desired one. Moreover, the constructed iterative increment is proved to be the descent direction of the negative moment-based cost function, which guarantees the stable convergence of the proposed modified Newton method. In addition, computational complexity analysis of related methods indicates that the computational cost of the NMA is not significantly increased compared the least mean square methods.

The application of deep learning (DL) techniques in the domain of SEI has gained significant attention due to its potential for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of SEI. Recent studies show that DL-based SEI is susceptible to adversarial attacks. For SEI based on the time-frequency spectrogram, we propose a single-line pixel attack (SLPA) method. The attacker adds the same perturbation to the time-frequency spectrogram samples line by line and queries the model recognition results, selecting the RF signal corresponding to the line with the highest number of successful attacks as the optimal perturbation signal. This is a practical black-box attack that does not require synchronization and knowledge of model parameters. Under the same perturbation power, our proposed method can achieve an attack success rate of 35.05%, which is much higher than the 20.10% of the white-box attack fast gradient sign method (FGSM) that requires gradient information of the target model.},

We determine the best strategy for offloading computing in an environment whose dynamics are challenging to regulate. We perform extensive simulation testing, and our findings indicate that the proposed method converges faster to the optimal solution.

Then, in order to improve the control performance while preserving the stability, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum convergence rate among all control loops, subject to the transmit power budget of each control loop and control stability condition. Since the original problem is mathematically complicated, with the help of zero-forcing principle, we propose an iterative algorithm using Lyapunov stability theorem, exponential accumulation and sequential convex approximation to solve it efficiently.

More importantly, facing the ever-increasing greenhouse gas emission concerns and the rapid growth of the operational cost, how to effectively utilize the resources to improve computation efficiency is of vital importance. In this paper, with the aim to maximize the computation efficiency of the MEC-enabled heterogeneous networks through proper resource allocation, a joint task offloading and resource management problem is formulated.

However, most existing RIS-aided ANM (RIS-ANM) methods assume a uniform linear array (ULA) RIS which can only handle the one-dimensional (1D) DOA estimation. To this end, a novel RIS-aided gridless two-dimensional (2D) DOA estimation method is developed for a uniform planar array (UPA) RIS passive sensing system, where a general single-input multi-output (SIMO) transmission model is adopted. Specifically, a RIS-aided decoupled ANM (RIS-D-ANM) is proposed for gridless 2D-DOA retrieval. We show that the proposed RIS-D-ANM provides a decoupled formulation of the atomic norm instead of reshaping the 2D information via vectorization in the classic RIS-ANM method. Thus, the computational complexity of the original high-dimensional SDP problem is remarkably reduced without performance degradation. Furthermore, the computational cost is further reduced by integrating the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), resulting in the RIS-aided decoupled ADMM (RIS-D-ADMM) method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed framework focuses on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target echo while satisfying the communication rate requirement. Addressing the challenges posed by the higher peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of communication waveforms than sensing waveforms, we provide a detailed analysis and offer valuable insights into power assignment techniques that account for PAPR considerations. We reveal that the integration of constant-modulus sensing signals results in a substantial enhancement in sensing SNR, and numerical results underscore the effectiveness of leveraging sensing signals within the ISAC framework. These findings highlight the potential for achieving superior sensing performance by using dedicated constant-modulus sensing signals.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has recently been regarded as a paradigm-shifting technology beyond 5G, for its flexibility on smartly adjusting the response to the impinging electromagnetic (EM) waves. Typically, RIS can be implemented by properly reconfiguring the adjustable parameters of each RIS unit to align the signal phase on the receiver side. And it is believed that the phase alignment can be also mechanically achieved by a flat metal plate with the same physical size and shape. However, we found in the prototype experiments that, a well-rotated flat metal plate can only approximately perform as well as RIS under limited conditions even under the case of spherical wave impinging, although its scattering efficiency is relatively higher. We analyze this phenomenon with wave optics theory and propose explicit scattering models for both the metal plate and RIS in general scenarios. Finally, the models are validated by simulations and field measurements.},

  abstract     = {The Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) terminator requires extra idle channels to ensure reliable broadcasting of safety information, especially when traffic congestion occurs under high vehicle density. In the DSRC and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) mixed vehicular communication networks, it is straightforward to adopt the dynamic spectrum access of the DSRC over idle C-V2X channels. In this paper, we propose a novel joint spectrum prediction and selection scheme for DSRC users (DUEs), aiming to improve the data rate of DUEs and mitigate the interference to C-V2X terminators (CUEs). Firstly, we define the process of DUEs&#39; spectrum selection as an Indian buffet process (IBP), which fits the practical scenarios and also implies that the channel&#39;s availability is predictable. Secondly, we integrate channels&#39; available probability predicted by IBP with the corresponding historical reward obtained by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to acquire a more accurate available channel list. Finally, we exploit a deep Q-learning network (DQN) to select high-profit channels for DSRC communications in the candidate channels. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the average data rate of DUEs by 15% and maintain low interference to CUEs under different transmission power levels and densities of DUEs, compared with the other four typical methods.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as promising platforms to provide flexible and low-cost services for ground users of hard-to-reach areas in the era of 6G. Nevertheless, the limited battery life of UAVs poses a significant challenge when it comes to establishing reliable air-ground connections. A potential solution to address this challenge is to exploit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), wherein RIS planes are affixed on UAVs to enhance energy efficiency. However, this scheme is subject to unwanted UAV oscillations. This paper presents a robust optimization framework for RIS-assisted UAV multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication networks while considering the practical undesired oscillations for UAV. Specifically, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of the base station (BS) and the phase shift of RIS under UAV&#39;s undesired oscillations. To effectively tackle the intricate non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust block coordinate Lagrangian dual transform (RoBl) scheme by leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian dual transform. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a superior WSR compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed scheme.},

At the receiver, practical $q$ -ary linear physical-layer network coding is employed to compute and stores a number of network-coding (NC) message streams per slot. Upon collecting a sufficient amount of NC message streams from a number of consecutive slots, the receiver carries out generalized matrix inversion (GMI) to recover the users&#39; messages. We demonstrate that the developed scheme exhibits dramatically increased throughput by as much as 80%.

Our findings indicate a nontrivial relationship between average limiting received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distance emphasizing the significance of $\gamma$ in THz system design. We further propose new maximum likelihood (ML) thresholds for pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes, resulting in analytical symbol error rate (SER) expressions that account for different noise variances across constellation points. The results confirm that the analytical SER closely matches the true simulated SER when using an optimal detector. As expected, under maximum molecular re-radiation, the true SER is shown to be lower than that produced by a suboptimal detector that assumes equal noise variances.},

In this paper, we study the link topology of both ILLs and SGLs with different time slot durations from the perspective of each RSS based on the time-expanded graph. We propose a multi-objective mission flow optimization model to jointly achieve transmission benefits maximization, end-of-period energy maximization, and transmission wait time minimization. This model considers missions&#39; importance differences under limited storage, energy, and link bandwidth resources. To reduce the solving complexity and solution time, we propose a Phased Multi-Objective (PMO) algorithm to solve this problem. We simulate the proposed methods in different scale SIN with practical parameters. The results show that RSS&#39;s entire orbital period can be covered by ILLs and SGLs, except for the ILLs&#39; handover time. When the ILLs&#39; data transmission rate is much less than the RSSs&#39; data acquisition rate, important mission data can be transmitted in priority. When the transmission rate approaches the data acquisition rate, all observation data can be transmitted in near real-time. The proposed PMO algorithm can obtain the optimal solution in 19.1 seconds for a constellation with 500 satellites, which is much less than the 3.8-minute solution time used by other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle driving in a platoon is an efficient and ecological driving solution. Introducing the concept of digital twin (DT) into the platoon to establish platoon digital twin (PDT) can improve the management efficiency and driving safety of the platoon. However, the joint allocation of multiple types of resources in a platoon digital twin network (PDTN) is an important issue for the successful implementation and maintenance of the PDT. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in a PDTN. By comprehensively considering the effects of high mobility of platooning vehicles, real-time nature of the DTs, and multi-vehicle cooperation, we propose a PDT utility optimization model for bandwidth and computation resource allocation. We formulate the dynamic resource allocation problem as an $M$ -th order Markov decision process (MDP) and design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic resource allocation (DRLDRA) method to solve it. To optimize the actions of the agent, we reshape the state in a smaller time granularity to better reflect the temporal variations of the state. Correspondingly, we design temporal feature extraction neural networks (TFENNs) based on multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract the temporal features of the state. To improve the learning efficiency, a decentralized multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based learning framework is proposed. Numerical results show that the DRLDRA method performs excellently and outperforms other benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel device-free sensing framework, integrative heterogeneous wave sensing (IHWS). IHWS leverages mmWave angular power profile obtained through beam search and acoustic waves to facilitate wireless sensing focused primarily on blockage prediction in the realm of 6G communication networks. For reliable mmWave communication in realistic environments, mmWave can also serve as a sensing tool for identifying the direction of moving obstacles, such as vehicles, which could potentially cause link blockage. However, the effectiveness of mmWave device-free sensing is initially constrained by the requirement that the target at least has line-of-sight (LOS) to both the base station and user equipment. To mitigate this constraint, we propose an IHWS framework that utilizes motion-induced sound to capture the movement of obstacles and determine their angle of arrival (AoA), thereby enhancing the capabilities of mmWave sensing techniques. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to achieve directional localization of the target even outside the LOS region of user equipment and to predict the received power. Moreover, it is confirmed that the directional localization accuracy improves by around 24%, specially when the LOS between the target and user equipment is not necessarily guaranteed.},

This work aims to capitalize on the constrained resources of MEC networks to efficiently fulfill service requests by jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. However, the growing complexity of applications such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving introduces new challenges in modeling and problem-solving due to the causal correlation of service logic among various users, which adds to the intricate spatial-temporal dynamics of the network. To effectively capture the essence of cross-user task dependency in these scenarios while also accommodating dynamic factors like the variability of wireless channels and the mobility of terminals, we formulate a spatial-temporal correlative problem, aiming to minimize the weighted cost of task completion delay and energy consumption. To resolve this problem, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is developed for task offloading while integrating subchannel allocation and transmit power control into it to interact with the dynamic environment to generate a reward signal, thereby optimizing the long-term performance of the system. Comprehensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm surpasses the comparative methods in reducing the cost. Additionally, adaptability in different scenarios with different parameters and task structures has also been validated and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Asan emerging distributed ledger technology, blockchain provides multi-party trust between unreliable devices to share data and resources cooperatively, which facilitates the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) applications. In the typical blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV) scenarios, based on the data of common interest collected by various sensors, the IoV devices jointly maintain the world state in the form of address-balance pairs as the proof for transaction issuing and validation, where Ethereum-like blockchain is used as the finite-state machine driven by the transactions. However, with the extension of the IoV network, an enormous number of accounts leads to the explosive growth of the state data, which has been the main challenge for BIoV with resource-limited devices. This paper proposes a modular-based adaptive bit-width compression (ABC) scheme to reduce the state data storage on each device by representing the address as a remainder with a shorter bit-width. Besides, a new transaction validation method is designed with the support of the XOR filter, which guarantees that the core functions of the blockchain can still be performed normally with the proposed scheme applied. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the compression ratio for the address data could be more than 80%, which dramatically improves the scalability of BIoV system. In addition, the extra privacy-preserving property is introduced with the compression scheme because the account information is unrecoverable from the remainders.},

  abstract     = {Positioning with cellular networks can serve as a backup or as a complement to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), making it relevant for autonomous vehicle navigation with integrity monitoring. The user equipment (UE) can compute its position with cellular measurements that are obtained by tracking the code phase and carrier phase of received cellular signals. Integrity monitoring techniques require rigorous characterization of the cellular measurements and their corresponding error models. An important component of the downlink code phase and carrier phase measurements is the base station (BS) clock offset, which represents the deviation of the BS clock from a reference clock. Leaving the BS clock offset uncorrected or using a clock prediction model that does not fit the clock dynamics properly can result in an undesirable degradation of the positioning performance. In this work, the BS clock offset is studied using cellular measurements collected by tracking the cell-specific reference signal (CRS) of two commercially operated long-term evolution (LTE) BS uninterruptedly for eleven days. To avoid cycle slips or losses of the signal lock during high clock dynamics, the optimal bandwidths of the receiver tracking loop filters are first determined via simulation. The analysis of the collected carrier phase measurements shows that the main contributor to the BS clock offset is the occurrence of regular oscillator frequency jumps, which are sudden changes in the clock oscillator frequency. The jumps could be caused by a periodic clock steering mechanism keeping the BS clocks synchronized to the primary clock reference. The code-minus-carrier (CMC) analysis shows that both monitored stations adjust the code phase and carrier phase coherently. The impact of the BS clock offset on positioning is studied in a simulated terrestrial scenario in which the user relies on cellular measurements to coast during GNSS unavailability. The results show that the clock prediction model can significantly reduce the horizontal position error (HPE) when compared to the uncorrected BS clock offset.},

  abstract     = {Localization and synchronization of moving users in a time-division scheme have attracted considerable attention. Currently, closed-form methods are more prevalent than iterative methods due to their advantages, including not requiring initialization and avoiding divergence issues. However, existing closed-form methods are primarily effective for low-speed users and are associated with a substantial computational burden. High-speed users, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites, and spacecraft, can experience significant errors when using these existing methods. Therefore, this study presents a novel two-step localization and synchronization method. In the initial step, we convert the sequential measurements from each anchor node into time-of-arrival measurements at a single reference instant. Commonly employed conversion methods can introduce errors due to the time-varying measurement period caused by timestamp uncertainty. To resolve this challenge, this study introduces a computationally efficient piecewise osculating interpolation algorithm. In the second step of our proposed method, the measurement equations are linearized through squaring and differencing operations. The unification of timestamps allows for the elimination of many common terms through difference operations. Consequently, closed-form results are obtained by applying the least-squares method without introducing intermediate variables. The proposed method is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, showing improved precision and reduced computational complexity compared to existing methods. It is thus well-suited for applications with strict precision requirements and limited computational resource.},

To facilitate future generations of computing-intensive applications, we have developed a UAV-based airborne computing platform. However, the existing system only supports Wi-Fi connectivity. Recognizing the critical role of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in providing robust and reliable wireless communication, as well as its compatibility with current and future cellular systems, we present an improved airborne computing platform that combines UAV technology with software-defined radio (SDR). SDR is programmable and can be dynamically configured to enable different wireless communication technologies.

In this paper, we describe the detailed design and implementation of our UAV-based airborne computing platform, emphasizing the integration of SDR technology to build an LTE base station. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our platform in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, focusing on latency, throughput, signal-to-noise ratio, and resource consumption. Our findings highlight the impact of the computing platform on system performance and emphasize the importance of optimizing software components for specific hardware configurations. Despite the challenges, our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of SDR-enabled UAV platforms for enhanced aerial connectivity.

  abstract     = {Due to its strong flexibility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has been widely used in emergency communication, especially in the case when terrestrial infrastructures are no longer available. Within a UAV swarm, the design of routing protocol is one of the most challenging problems that enables cooperation among multiple UAVs to perform complex tasks in disaster areas. Nevertheless, the routing protocols reported so far have made the simplifying assumption that UAVs move randomly. In the context of mission-oriented scenarios, such as emergency communication in disaster areas, this assumption appears evidently impractical. On the contrary, for many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned. Disregarding trajectory information may result in routing protocols struggling to adapt to rapid changes in network topology. To break the bottleneck, we propose an efficient trajectory-based optimized routing protocol (TORP) for mission-oriented UAV swarm. Firstly, we model the packet routing problem using the concept of time-dependent graph. The objective is to maximize network performance, considering the power consumption and end-to-end (E2E) delay. The formulated problem is a binary linear programming (BLP) problem which is intractable to solve. Firstly, we propose a modified dynamically weighted Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm (MDWD). Based on the MDWD algorithm, we further propose an efficient optimization scheme to solve the problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can make effective routing selections in dynamic UAV network, thereby improving the system performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, E2E delay and power consumption.},

In this paper, a multi-agent collaborative task offloading scheme for distributed SMEC is proposed. Facing the time-varying available satellites and service requirements, each autonomous satellite agent dynamically adjusts offloading decisions and resource allocations based on local observations. Furthermore, for evaluating the behavioral contribution of an agent to task completion, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on counterfactual multi-agent policy gradients (COMA) to optimize the strategy, which enables energy-efficient decisions satisfying the time and resource restrictions of SMEC. An actor-critic (AC) framework is effectively exploited to separately implement centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) of the algorithm. We also redesign the actor structure by introducing an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory network (Atten-BiLSTM) to explore the temporal characteristics of LEO networks. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively enable satellite autonomous collaborative computing in the distributed SMEC environment, and outperforms the benchmark algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a centralized and distributed software-defined satellite network architecture. Under this architecture, we focus on the virtual network function (VNF) deployment and flow scheduling problem (VDS). Considering user delay performance and limited satellite network resources, we formulate the VDS problem as a nonlinear binary programming (NLBP) problem, which includes 0-1 fractional and piecewise function programming. To address this challenge, we linearize the NLBP problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based exact method to obtain optimal solutions for small-scale scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a resource-efficient VNF deployment and flow scheduling algorithm (RE-VDS) to efficiently obtain suboptimal solutions for large-scale scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm closely approximates the optimal solution in small-scale scenarios and exhibits favorable performance in terms of system resource utilization, load balancing, and trade-off user performance and operator profit in large-scale scenarios.},

The proposed protocol extends the existing Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) specifications. OCPP is an open and widely used protocol for EV chargers but it provides no privacy-preserving mechanisms. Differential privacy concepts are applied in the proposed paper along with key masking to hide private data from different kinds of adversaries. A lightweight implementation of the proposed approach is implemented and tested on a hardware testbed to ensure the practicality of the implemented system. Experimental results and analysis show that this method is able to preserve the confidentiality of metering values with minimal computation.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist sensing data transmissions from the ground users (GUs) to a remote base station (BS). Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs via low-power backscatter communications and then forwards it to the remote BS by the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs&#39; access control, the UAVs&#39; beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. We first model the dynamics of the GUs&#39; AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs&#39; access control, the UAVs&#39; beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs&#39; AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs&#39; scheduling fairness is also improved by adapting the GUs&#39; access control compared with typical baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {Although covert navigation deception technique entails high computational complexity, its high concealment has garnered increasing attention. However, existing research typically relies on known unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reference trajectories and other internal filtering parameters to calculate deceptive positions, which are hard to obtain in reality. In this paper, addressing the condition where internal Kalman filtering (KF) parameters and preset reference trajectory parameters of the victim UAV cannot be observed, a novel method for intelligent navigation deception position estimation based solely on radar detection of UAV motion information is proposed. This method essentially exposes the nonlinear mapping relationship between navigation deception positions and autonomous UAV motion control, while also considering the Markovian nature of the navigation deception process. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is introduced to dynamically solve for effective navigation deception positions in real-time. To ensure the generated navigation deception positions meet concealment requirements, a concept of deception residual rate based on radar estimation is proposed, with its impact on concealment and stability theoretically analyzed. Subsequently, we design a reward function that simultaneously considers navigation deception position concealment, deception trajectory stability, and the successful enticing of the victim UAV to the desired destination. Comparison experiments demonstrate that the estimated deception position by the proposed method achieves similar concealment and stability effects comparable to previous algorithms in the absence of reference trajectories and KF parameters, and successfully deceives UAVs to the intended destination while remaining below the normalization innovation square (NIS) threshold of UAV deception detection.},

In this paper, we study the performance of platoons that split and merge in response to the traffic and road context. We propose PLATO, an edge-based control system to efficiently manage the resulting set of coordinated sub-platoons, which acts as a platoon of platoons, i.e., a multi-platoon . We analyze costs and benefits of a multi-platoon by means of analysis and realistic simulations. We show that what is most critical for good performance is the coherence of the instructions received by individual platoons, and the optimal adaptation of the number of sub-platoons in response to the changing road and traffic conditions.},

  abstract     = {The fast advancement of 5G mobile communications, artificial intelligence and Big Data technology has driven the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), while at the same time putting great pressure on existing spectrum resources. Spectrum prediction, as a technology to improve spectrum utilization, faces problems such as poor modeling and ineffective use of historical spectrum sensing data. In addition, the different transmission environments and geographical locations of IoT devices lead to complex and variable wireless mobile channels, which are susceptible to interference from noise and external environments. They lead to inaccurate spectrum sensing results, which can affect the accuracy of spectrum prediction. Therefore, employing long short term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) neural networks proposes a dual branch neural network mobile spectrum prediction model (DB-LSTM). The historical sensing data under variable channels are fully utilized to extract forward and backward temporal feature information to overcome the effect of variable environment. First, spectrum sensing using a residual network (ResNet) module and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to extract intrinsic features of signal data and improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing results. This data is employed to train the DB-LSTM model and make for spectrum prediction. The M / G /1 queuing-based model under N -Nakagami channel is used to simulate and generate the signal data set under 2FSK and QPSK modulation methods. The proposed DB-LSTM method is evaluated from three perspectives of accuracy, Error and mean square error (MSE). The results obtained show that compared to the Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) models, the spectrum prediction accuracy is improved by 2%, 10%, and 1% respectively, the Error is reduced by 29%, 53%, and 4%, respectively, and the MSE is reduced by 23%, 65%, and 4%, respectively.},

However, these systems can only identify learned network attacks, while failing to identify the unknown attacks present in open scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based auto-updating intrusion detection system for vehicular network, which uses a two-layer filter to effectively sense unknown attacks in open scenarios and proactively updates the attack recognizer to enable it with the ability to identify unknown attacks. In addition, we design a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative model updating approach, where the updating task of the attack recognizer is deployed on a cloud server to reduce the computational load of the vehicle. The comprehensive experiments on three open scenarios show that the updated attack recognizer can accurately identify both known and unknown attacks.},

In this paper, to guarantee the transmission quality and reduce the deployment cost, wireless ad hoc network as a novel technology is applied to the communications-based train control (CBTC) system. In order to further improve the transmission efficiency of multi-hop ad hoc networks, a federated soft actor-critic (FeSAC) approach is proposed for joint optimization of relay selection, subchannel allocation and power control. The goal of the FeSAC algorithm training is to make the throughput of T2T links as large as possible with less energy consumption, while ensuring the link reliability and queuing delay requirements of T2T communications. To synthesize the training results of each T2T agent and accelerate model convergence, the FeSAC algorithm aggregates the network parameters by calculating the weighted mean value based on the reward of individual T2T agents. Evaluated by the simulation, the proposed FeSAC algorithm is more capable of increasing throughput and reducing energy consumption compared to other algorithms.},

However, highly precise time synchronization between transmitters is mandatory for existing high-precision positioning algorithms, which greatly limits their applications. Many recent studies focus on relaxing the requirement for time synchronization. In this paper, we propose a Carrier-phase Positioning Algorithm for Systems without Synchronization (CPASS). This algorithm introduces a static reference station as a Clock Bias Monitoring (CBM) station and uses double-difference to eliminate clock biases. Unlike Real Time Kinematic (RTK) in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), CPASS allows the position of the CBM station to be unknown, which simplifies the system requirement. This paper specifically proposes a Batch CPASS (B-CPASS) algorithm for post-processing scenarios and a Sequence CPASS (S-CPASS) algorithm for real-time scenarios. Numerical simulations verify that the two algorithms are able to approach the CRLB, and field experiments show that CPASS can realize centimeter-level carrier phase positioning.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a coded distributed computing (CDC)-based vehicular edge computing (VEC) framework. Therein, a task vehicle equipped with a dual-function radar communication (DFRC) module uses its communication function to offload its computing tasks to nearby service vehicles and its radar function to detect targets. However, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, the relative distance between the task vehicle and each service vehicle frequently varies over time, which causes a straggler effect and results in high offloading latency and even offloading disruption. To address this issue, the CDC based on the $(m, k)$ -maximum distance separable (MDS) code is used at the communication function of the task vehicle. We then formulate an optimization problem that aims to i) minimize the overall computing latency, ii) minimize the offloading cost, and iii) maximize the radar range subject to the offloading latency requirement and connection duration. To achieve these objectives, we optimize the fractions of power allocated to the radar and communication functions and the MDS parameters. However, the highly dynamic vehicular environment makes the problem intractable, particularly due to the uncertainty of computing resource, and stochastic networking resources. Thus, we propose to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms with regularization to address this issue. To enhance the generalizability of the proposed DRL algorithms, we further develop a transfer learning algorithm that allows the task vehicle to quickly learn the optimal policy in new environments. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of radar range, computation latency, and offloading cost. Furthermore, the employment of transfer learning is demonstrated to greatly boost the convergence speeds.},

  abstract     = {The latest assessments of the emerging technologies for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have indicated the concept&#39;s significant potential for localization and sensing, either as individual or simultaneously realized tasks. However, in the vast majority of those studies, the RIS state (i.e., its position and rotation angles) is required to be known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem of the joint three-dimensional (3D) localization of a hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user. The most cost- and power-efficient hybrid version of an RIS is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency chain and meta-atoms capable of simultaneous reconfigurable reflection and sensing. This dual functionality is controlled by adjustable power splitters embedded at each hybrid meta-atom. Focusing on a downlink scenario where a multi-antenna base station transmits multi-carrier signals to a user via an HRIS, we propose a multi-stage approach to jointly estimate the metasurface&#39;s 3D position and 3D rotation matrix (i.e., 6D parameter estimation) as well as the user&#39;s 3D position. Our simulation results verify the validity of the proposed estimator via extensive comparisons of the root-mean-square error of the state estimations with the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRB), which is analytically derived. Furthermore, it is showcased that there exists an optimal hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) power splitting ratio for the desired multi-parameter estimation problem. We also study the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of scattering points in the wireless propagation environment.},

  abstract     = {The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation system has demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, especially in time-frequency doubly dispersive channels. However, achieving robust OTFS demodulation requires a well-designed reference signal and channel estimation algorithm. In this paper, we propose an iterative Doppler shift estimation algorithm based on the weighted least squares method for the OTFS system with fractional Doppler shifts. This algorithm fully exploits the block sparsity of the discrete channel impulse response in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, achieving performance close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Additionally, we present a reference signal design in the DD domain that achieves higher spectral efficiency compared to conventional designs. Building upon an analysis of interference between data symbols and pilot symbols, we introduce an iterative interference suppression algorithm to further enhance the channel parameter estimation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we validate the convergence of the algorithms and conduct simulations on the normalized mean squared error of channel estimation and the bit error ratio of demodulation, affirming its performance advantages.},

  abstract     = {Dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) is extremely attractive in the sixth generation systems, since it can simultaneously support communication and detection by a unified hardware platform with real-time cooperation. Considering the appealing features of multiple beams, this paper designs a dual mode multi-beam scheme composed of static and dynamic beams, so that it can simultaneously support multi-user transmission and high-accuracy targets detection. Besides, an integrated continuous phase modulation and linear frequency modulation signal is exploited to improve both range resolution of radar and bit error rate (BER) of users. To unify communication and radar systems, we define radar rate, and set the maximum sum-rate composed of communication and radar rates as the objective function. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, the problem is divided into two sub-issues, i.e., user selection, and joint beamforming design with power allocation. A successive maximum rate algorithm is presented for the former one, which can balance the performances between the sum-rate and complexity; and maximum minimization - Lagrange multiplier iteration algorithm is utilized to solve the latter one. In addition, some theoretical analyses, e.g., spectrum, BER, ambiguity function, false alarm and detection probabilities are deduced for the proposed system. Simulation results show that our proposed DFRC system can provide better sum-rate than the classical communication and radar separated systems.},

  abstract     = {The next-generation wireless network is expected to use low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks to deliver seamless and high-capacity global communications services. Due to the high-speed mobility of LEO satellites, massive and frequent handovers inevitably occur. Moreover, handover becomes more complicated with the ever-growing constellation scale, number of mobile terminals (MTs), and demands for emerging delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, a decentralized Markov decision process (DEC-MDP) is adopted to formulate the handover problem in the LEO satellite network with finite bursty traffic. The target is maximizing the total reward associated with the service revenue and the cost of handover and packet loss. To deal with the high computational complexity caused by the large state space and action space, the solution is designed using a multi-agent double deep Q-network (MADDQN) with fully decentralized framework, which also allows each MT to train and use an individual local DDQN to avoid load imbalance between satellites. Further, to alleviate the non-stationary issue of the environment in parallel learning, multi-agent fingerprints are applied in MADDQN, and the proposed algorithm is called multi-agent fingerprints-enhanced double deep Q-network-based distributed intelligent handover (MAF-DDQN-DIH) mechanism. The implementation of MAF-DDQN-DIH in practical communication systems are discussed, and the corresponding communication overhead and computational complexity are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed multi-agent fingerprints are effective and the proposed MAF-DDQN-DIH algorithm outperforms the comparison handover algorithms in terms of the total reward.},

As opposed to conventional RIS-assisted spatial modulation schemes, the proposed RIS-assisted generalized spatial modulation with phase offset (RIS-GSM-P) scheme activates an arbitrary number of transmit antennas to form a wider variety of transmit antenna combinations (TAC) for improving SE. Depending on whether the direct path is available or not, two phase offset schemes are conceived to enhance the beamforming of the RIS and to widen the channel difference between TACs. Finally, a unified framework for the theoretical bit error rate upper bound of the proposed RIS-GSM-P scheme is presented, which is also compatible with several conventional RIS-assisted transmission schemes. Furthermore, a low-complexity detector is provided to reduce the detection complexity. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and to validate our theoretical analysis.},

Particular attention is paid to the effect that Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) decoding order has over the system secrecy rate. Each NOMA user is subject to an individual minimum bit rate requirement, whereas multiple eavesdroppers cooperate among themselves to enhance their repercussion on the system. We demonstrate the impact SIC decoding order has on the secrecy performance, and the importance to look for an optimal solution to the decoding order selection problem. We show how this problem is indeed a very challenging combinatorial one with a factorial complexity related to the number of users and eavesdroppers involved in the system. Given the high computational power demand to find the optimal solution, we approach the challenge in two ways. First, we propose a near-optimal interference-based analytical approach to find a secure decoding order. The idea is to take advantage of the inherent NOMA characteristic of self-interfere other legitimate users, to also act as an interference source over the eavesdroppers. Secondly, we introduce deep learning as another option to achieve a near-optimal solution with a much lower complexity. We see how a deep neural network is able to improve the performance of the interference-based analytical solution, being robuster to users&#39; and eavesdroppers&#39; increment. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of the two proposed solutions through numerical simulations and highlight their importance and advantages.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of channel estimation and joint active and passive beamforming for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We show that, with a well-designed frame-based training protocol, the received pilot signal can be organized into a low-rank third-order tensor that admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). Based on this observation, we propose a CPD-based method for estimating the cascade channels associated with different subcarriers. The proposed method exploits the intrinsic low-rankness of the CPD formulation, which is a result of the sparse scattering characteristics of mmWave channels, and thus has the potential to achieve a significant training overhead reduction. Specifically, our analysis shows that the proposed method has a sample complexity that scales quadratically with the sparsity of the cascade channel. Also, by utilizing the singular value decomposition-like structure of the effective channel, this paper develops a joint active and passive beamforming method based on the estimated cascade channels. Simulation results show that the proposed CPD-based channel estimation method attains mean square errors that are close to the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) and present a clear advantage over the compressed sensing-based methods. In addition, the proposed joint beamforming method can effectively utilize the estimated channel parameters to achieve superior beamforming performance.},

Therefore, it is important to investigate the statistical properties of band-limited signals in terms of their dynamic range. On the other hand, the out-of-band (OOB) emission of signals can be controlled by pulse shaping or windowing, where the latter is generally applicable to block transmission systems such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). In this work, by developing closed-form expressions of high-order moments for the signals band-limited by the conventional raised-cosine (RC) as well as square-root raised-cosine (RRC) filtering, we discuss the trade-off relationship between the spectral efficiency and signal dynamic range. In addition, an expression for the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the instantaneous power in the case of filtered Gaussian signals is developed. Based on these theoretical analyses, we elucidate the fact that as the transmit symbols approach Gaussian for increasing spectral efficiency, the resulting filtered signals tend to exhibit even higher dynamic range compared to the conventional block transmission systems such as OFDM and DFT-precoded OFDM.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered as the potential key technology of the future mobile communication systems. The signal design is fundamental for the ISAC system. The reference signals in mobile communication systems have good detection performance, which is worth further research. Existing studies applied the single reference signal to radar sensing. In this paper, a multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme is designed. Specifically, we jointly apply channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS), positioning reference signal (PRS) and demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in radar sensing, which improve the performance of sensing and extend the unambiguously detectable range of distance and velocity via obtaining continuous time-frequency resource mapping. The Crámer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the joint reference signal for distance and velocity estimation is derived. The impacts of carrier frequency and subcarrier spacing on the performance of distance and velocity estimation are revealed. The results of simulation experiments show that compared with the single reference signal sensing scheme, the multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme effectively improves the sensing accuracy. Moreover, because of the discontinuous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, the accuracy and robustness of velocity estimation could be further improved via compressed sensing (CS). This paper has verified that multiple reference signals, instead of single reference signal, have much more superior performance on radar sensing, which is a practical and efficient approach in designing ISAC signal.},

This paper introduces a novel transformation method for constructing a domain based on rotation matrices, termed Iterative Rotation Orthogonal Transformation (IROT). Our method centers on investigating the key factor in determining symbol decision accuracy, which is the distribution of noise energy superimposed on each symbol within a symbol block. The optimal distribution is influenced not only by channel fading but also by the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By employing linear equalization, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of the domain transformation method on noise energy distribution. When the SNR surpasses a specific threshold, the symbol error rate (SER) reaches its minimum through the average allocation of noise energy. To achieve controllable adjustments of the noise energy, IROT constructs a unitary matrix by a double-layer iteration. Then we calculate the SNR threshold and analyze the complexity and convergence of IROT. Furthermore, we proposed the inverse balanced IROT to improve the SER performance at low SNR. The simulation results show the superior SER performance of IROT compared to other domain transformation and pre-equalization methods.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is a cost-efficient network densification technology for improving the coverage and capacity of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular networks. In IAB systems, user traffic is forwarded to/from the wired base station by one or more relay stations, known as IAB nodes. Due to the multi-hop relaying, these systems may be subject to large packet delays and poor performance when the load is unevenly distributed among nodes. Addressing this limitation via delay-aware access and backhaul link scheduling in IAB networks is challenging due to potentially large network scale, complex topology, half-duplex, and interference constraints. In this paper, the topical link scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision problem (MDP) for a single-donor IAB system with a general topology that allows for users with different delay requirements and traffic dynamics. The proposed link scheduling strategy jointly optimizes (i) user traffic routing and (ii) multiplexing of access and backhaul links under half-duplex constraints and non-negligible interference that may arise in dense IAB systems even with high beam directionality. To address the complexity of our formulated MDP, we consider several approximation methods, namely, Q-learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and genetic algorithms (GAs). Then, we propose a customized version of the GA, which provides the preferred optimality–complexity trade-off and offers a 15% packet delay reduction as compared to the state-of-the-art backpressure algorithm.},

  abstract     = {To combat the spectrum scarcity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems are integrated as NOMA-V2X networks, where multiple vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links can opportunistically reuse the spectrum licensed to vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. However, the contradictory quality of service (QoS) requirements among V2V and V2I links make the design of an effective spectrum sharing scheme to be a great challenge. The high mobility of vehicles and the extra interference brought by NOMA make the issue more complex. Hence, a matching combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is proposed in the paper to maximize the sum delivery rate of V2I up-links while guaranteeing the reliability of V2V links in NOMA-V2X networks. In specific, the channel assignment is solved by one-to-many matching in advance which can be theoretically proved to converge to a stable state. While heterogeneous MADDPG is further adopted to obtain the proper power control for V2I link pairs and V2V links which are taken as different types of agents and interact with the environment independently. On the basis, a fully decentralized framework is designed for the proposed algorithm to reduce the communication overhead caused by the information synchronization. Simulation results demonstrate that by introducing matching theory into deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the sum delivery rate of V2I links can be greatly improved with less computation complexity and convergence time. Moreover, compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) communications, the outstanding energy and spectrum efficiency make it significant to explore NOMA in V2X networks.},

In addition, these tasks in system are also assumed to be generated stochastically and with different priorities. With respect to the model, we consider minimizing the total task delay of the system while ensuring that the high priority tasks been completed precedently. To do so, an optimization problem is formulated to determine the task offloading strategy for each task. A deep reinforcement learning approach is designed to solve the problem, where the double deep Q network (DDQN) is employed as the agent module. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 25% higher utility than the greedy one.

This paper addresses this challenge by introducing new algorithms for robust DOA estimation tailored for environments contaminated by impulsive noise. We initially employ the error-in-variable (EIV) model to derive a generalized framework for robust adaptive DOA estimation algorithms. Our methodology incorporates the Maximum Versoria (MV) criterion as a cost function, facilitating the development of the robust Gradient Total MV (GTMV) algorithm. To further enhance performance, we introduce a variable step-size mechanism within the GTMV framework (VSS-GTMV), which dynamically adjusts the step size based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to optimize the trade-off between convergence speed and steady-state error. The convergence properties of the GTMV algorithm are analytically examined, and its effectiveness is substantiated through extensive numerical simulations in impulsive noise environments. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over existing competitive approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

However, deploying accurate modulation recognition models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose GIQNet, an end-to-end deep-learning framework for underwater acoustic modulation classification. GIQNet incorporates two key components: a Temporal Large Kernel Convolution (TLKC) module and a Gated I/Q Mixer (GIQM) module. TLKC applies large kernel convolutions to capture long-range dependencies in the temporal domain. At the same time, GIQM facilitates the adaptive fusion of information from the in-phase and quadrature channels using gating mechanisms. Experiments on real-world underwater acoustic datasets demonstrate GIQNet&#39;s effectiveness. Moreover, when evaluated on publicly available radio modulation datasets, GIQNet outperforms existing approaches while using 55% fewer parameters. Further analyses validate the effectiveness of TLKC and GIQM in learning robust features for modulation recognition. The results show that the proposed architecture provides an efficient and effective deep-learning solution tailored for underwater acoustic modulation classification, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained AUV edge devices.},

Regarding the non-trivial problem form, we initially reformulate it into an considerable problem to make it tractable by utilizing the relationship between the achievable rate and the weighted minimum mean squared error. Next, the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix are alternately optimized. In particular, the optimal transmit precoding matrix and receive combining matrix are obtained in closed forms. Furthermore, a pair of computationally efficient methods are proposed for the RIS reflection matrix, namely the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and the successive closed form (SCF) method. We theoretically prove that both methods are ensured to converge, and the SCF-based algorithm is able to converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the problem.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is a promising modulation scheme that works in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, offering resistance to frequency selective fading and time-varying channels. Thus, OTFS channel estimation assumes great significance for successful transmission. Typically, it requires allocating pilots in the DD domain, which often results in an increase in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and high complexity to detect the received signal. In response to these issues, we present a solution that estimates the channel in the time-frequency (TF) domain. In addition, although several works in the literature present solutions for OTFS channel estimation, few consider the presence of high-power amplifiers (HPAs) and explain the impact of nonlinear effects on channel estimation and system performance. Starting from channel estimation based on preambles and pilots in the TF domain, we present a solution capable of obtaining reliable channel estimation using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in highly selective channel conditions, effectively compensating for nonlinearities in signal reception. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, highlighting its potential to improve the performance and robustness of OTFS communication systems in real scenarios with nonlinear HPA effects.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a manifold optimization empowered two-timescale channel estimation (MO-TTCE) scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user millimeter wave massive MIMO systems. Since the base station (BS) and RIS remain relatively stationary while the user equipments (UEs) are mobile, the coherence time of the RIS-BS channel is significantly longer than that of the UE-related channels, namely the UE-RIS and UE-BS channels. Therefore, it is sufficient to estimate the RIS-BS channel only once in the large timescale, while frequently estimating the UE-related channels in the small timescale. We leverage the sparse and low-rank properties of the RIS-BS channel and transform the channel estimation problem into a series of sparse low-rank matrix recovery (SLRMR) problems, specifically $\ell _{1}$ -norm regularized constrained optimization problems with the feasible region being a complex bounded-rank (CBR) matrix set. To ensure the differentiability of the objective function, we employ a differentiable Huber- $\gamma$ function as a substitute for the $\ell _{1}$ -norm. To handle the non-convex nature of the CBR matrix set, we treat the complex fixed-rank (CFR) matrix set as a CFR manifold and consider the CBR matrix set as a collection of CFR manifolds, thereby employing manifold optimization techniques to solve the problem. Furthermore, in the small timescale, we utilize the downlink pilot transmission and uplink feedback scheme to simultaneously estimate all UE-RIS channels. Simulation results show that the proposed MO-TTCE scheme can enhance the accuracy of channel estimation and reduce pilot overhead.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) has been considered as an enabler to alleviate the spectrum shortage problem while providing high data rates in high speed railway (HSR) communications. However, a mmWave channel has a larger path loss, and therefore is sensitive to blockage. In such a high speed mobile environment with fast-changing channels, considering the characteristics of mmWave, how to achieve reliable transmission scheduling in a train-to-train communication has become a critical issue, especially from the safety point of view. In this paper, we investigate a mmWave train-to-train communication system with the fixed frame structure, where two trains communicate with each other directly by mobile relays (MRs) deployed on top of cabin roofs. Due to the limited communication distance by MRs and the nature that mmWave is prone to blockage, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is placed between two trains to rebuild line of sight (LoS) link when original link is blocked or beyond the distance range. We aim to maximize the number of completely scheduled flows with different quality of service (QoS) requirements via optimizing the discrete phase shifts of RIS as well as flow scheduling. In particular, we consider multiple-frame scheduling to make use of the predictability of trains&#39; trajectory. To solve this nonlinear integer programming problem, we decompose the joint scheduling problem into two subproblems. We first optimize the discrete phase shifts of RIS, and then build an interference-based graph of flows while transforming the transmission constraints into interference relationships. The goal of the problem can be realized through the proposed scheduling algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms three baseline schemes in the literature in terms of the number of the completely scheduled flows and system throughput.},

  abstract     = {Research indicates that replacing relays with the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can effectively reduce energy consumption under certain conditions. Therefore, introducing RIS into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted air-to-ground communication networks can further enhance communication performance. In this paper, we propose a RIS-UAV-assisted communication network scenario that utilizes the zero-forcing (ZF) precoding method to eliminate multi-user interference, and then optimize the BS transmit power by using the Dinkelbach algorithm. To address the optimization problem of bandwidth allocation, RIS phase shifts, and three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the RIS-UAV, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, which are termed D3QN-MM and D3QN-Pure, respectively. Both D3QN-MM and D3QN-Pure utilize the dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) for optimizing bandwidth allocation and the 3D coordinates of the RIS-UAV. However, D3QN-MM employs the traditional majorize-minimization (MM) algorithm for RIS phase shifts optimization, while D3QN-Pure utilizes the D3QN. By comparing them with other algorithms, such as the DRL algorithm, the advantages of the algorithms proposed in this paper are highlighted. Furthermore, compared to the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay, the RIS can achieve a 48% energy efficiency improvement. Besides, the D3QN-Pure algorithm provided up to 14.3% energy effciency improvement compared to the D3QN-MM algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is a promising method to enhance energy and spectrum efficiencies of wireless communication systems through advanced precoding algorithms. However, conventional NOMA schemes encounter high complexity issues due to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process at the receiver end. Moreover, traditional precoding designs for multi-antenna NOMA systems only utilize user channel state information and overlook the modulation details of transmitted data symbols, which may result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a symbol-level precoding (SLP) scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the downlink NOMA systems. In particular, by the proposed SLP scheme, the “interference signals” is designed to fall within the decoding region of the “desired signal”, eliminating the need for an SIC receiver, thereby reducing the complexity of the NOMA system in practical applications. For ease of illustrating the idea of the SLP-based NOMA designs, we first focus on a single user group case with two users, and solve the associated problem by developing a fractional programming-based algorithm. Then, we extend the idea to the multi-user scenarios and focus on the joint user grouping and SLP design. For the purpose of computational complexity reduction, a low-complexity (adaptive) user grouping scheme is proposed based on the idea of unsupervised clustering. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SLP scheme and algorithms in improving the energy efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {WiFi-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in achieving device-free Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). Due to the strong dependence of WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) on the target environment, current WiFi-based activity recognition methods often require extensive training data and struggle to adapt to new environments. To enhance the generalization ability of wireless sensing, we propose a cross-domain activity recognition system based on WiFi, Wi-Cro . Wi-Cro utilizes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to transform source domain data into target domain data, supplemented by a small number of target domain samples to achieve cross-domain human activity recognition. We design a Subcarrier Dimension Reduction Algorithm (SDRA) to mitigate computational complexity of the system. This algorithm calculates the correlation between different CSI subcarriers and extracts principal components to reduce sample dimensions. Furthermore, we develop a data augmentation method based on GAN to transform source domain data into the target domain, addressing issues related to overfitting and domain adaptation due to insufficient samples. Finally, a metric learning approach is designed to further enhance the cross-domain sensing capability of the Wi-Cro system. Extensive experiments are performed using data collected in real-world environments and two public datasets.

  abstract     = {Diversity schemes play a vital role in improving the performance of ultra-reliable communication (URC) systems by transmitting over two or more communication channels to combat fading and co-channel interference. Determining an appropriate transmission strategy that satisfies the ultra-reliability constraint necessitates the derivation of the statistics of the channel in the ultra-reliable region and, subsequently, integration of these statistics into the rate selection while incorporating a confidence interval to account for potential uncertainties that may arise during estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ultra-reliable real-time transmission considering both spatial diversities and ultra-reliable channel statistics based on multivariate extreme value theory (MEVT). First, the tail distribution of the joint received power sequences obtained from different receivers is modeled while incorporating the inter-relations of extreme events occurring rarely based on the Poisson point process approach in MEVT. The optimum transmission strategies are then developed by determining the optimum transmission rate based on the estimated joint tail distribution and incorporating confidence intervals (CIs) into the estimations to cope with the availability of limited data. Finally, the system reliability is assessed by utilizing the outage probability metric. Through analysis of the data obtained from the engine compartment of the Fiat Linea, our study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in surpassing traditional extrapolation-based approaches. This innovative method not only achieves a higher transmission rate, but also effectively addresses the stringent requirements of ultra-reliability. The findings indicate that the proposed rate selection framework offers a viable solution for achieving a desired target error probability by employing a higher transmission rate and reducing the amount of training data compared to the conventional rate selection methods.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication enables direct data transmissions between devices, thereby filling in the blind zones of base stations (BSs) and alleviating their load pressures. In this work, we propose an adaptive single-hop and relay-selection-based double-hop D2D transmission scheme underlaying cellular networks with full-frequency reuse. When the communication distance between two D2D users is shorter than a threshold $d_{0}$ , the single-hop D2D link can be established. However, when the distance between two D2D users is longer than $d_{0}$ but shorter than $2d_{0}$ , and there exists at least one relay node in the overlapping coverage areas of both users, the double-hop D2D transmission is performed. Based on the stochastic geometry theory, we properly model the random distributions of D2D users, relay nodes, cellular users, and BSs, as well as the aggregate interference for each type of communication mode. We propose to divide the overlapping area of the coverage regions of two D2D users into small grids, and the relay selection priority is assigned to each grid according to the selection criterion. The griding of overlapping areas can greatly simplify the analysis of successful relaying by considering the possible locations of the selected relay. We also present two benchmark schemes, namely cellular only, cellular with D2D single-hop. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the area throughput compared with the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {In space scenarios, the communications between the flying transmitters and receivers generally face two difficulties: a long-distance transmission and a high-speed movement. The long-distance transmission decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver and the high-speed movement imposes a dynamic Doppler-shift on the transmitter&#39;s carrier frequency. Under the low SNR, the Doppler-shift acquisition requires a long-time accumulation of many received symbols. However, during this long-time period, the dynamic Doppler-shift disperses all symbols&#39; total energy over a wide frequency range, thus causing the energy dispersion problem. To address this problem, we propose a max-min-sliding-window (MMSW) scheme by less noise elements and all signal elements. The large elements (also called max-elements) and small elements (also called min-elements) provide us the cues of possible ranges and impossible ranges, respectively. Also, the sliding-window is adopted to collect all signal elements. The MMSW scheme includes two algorithms (i.e., Generic MMSW and Iterative MMSW). The Generic MMSW algorithm first selects the max-elements and min-elements to construct a narrow max-min-range, then slides a window over this range to derive the signal and noise windows, and finally searches the largest window to obtain the acquisition result. By updating the max-elements and min-elements, the Iterative MMSW algorithm iteratively slides a window over a much narrower max-min-range to further strengthen the signal window. Moreover, the simulations results have demonstrated our MMSW scheme&#39;s significant advantages over the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Combing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in ultra-reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) is deemed as a new service category of 5G wireless networks. The openness nature of wireless environment makes security of information transmission unprecedentedly importance. Traditional cryptography methods cannot cater to uRLLC due to high complex design and processing delay. As a result, physical layer security (PLS) has been designed to secure information transmission by exploiting intrinsic property of wireless channel. However, many prior works ignored the role of UAV in study of PLS in uRLLC, and mobility of UAV deserves further investigation. This paper studies security and reliability performances of UAV-based uRLLC by using NOMA, where two kinds of users with different requirements are served, i.e., users with privacy and low latency requirement (PLR), and users with reliability and low latency requirement (RLR). With the tools of stochastic geometry, we formulate the secrecy rate, a popular metric in study of PLS, by establishing the closed-form expressions for static and dynamic UAV. Key system parameters (e.g., transmit power allocation) are optimized for secrecy rate maximization. Simulations evaluate theoretical analysis and give a significant insight into a positive secrecy rate for the network designer.},

A linear minimum mean square error estimation technique is used to estimate the UL composite channels at the massive MIMO base-station via the user pilots for a given RIS phase-shift matrix. A statistical channel state information (CSI)-based RIS phase-shift optimization technique is adopted by leveraging the effective covariance matrices of the composite channels pertaining to NOMA clusters with distinct spatial signatures. Since channel statistics vary at a much slower rate compared to the channel coherence interval, the proposed RIS-aided NOMA system design is benefited by a much lower pilot overhead and computational complexity than the instantaneous CSI-based joint phase-shift and precoder optimization techniques. The achievable sum rates are derived in closed-form for the maximum ratio transmission/combining based linear precoder/detector in the presence of practical impediments, including spatially correlated fading, erroneously estimated CSI, intra-cluster pilot contamination, imperfect successive interference cancellation, and hardware impairments by leveraging the statistical CSI-based optimal RIS phase-shift matrix. The pilot overhead, computational complexity, and convergence of the proposed phase-shift optimization are investigated and compared against the baseline techniques that use instantaneous CSI-aided optimization with semi-definite relaxation techniques. Monte-Carlo simulations/numerical results are used to validate our achievable sum rate analysis and to investigate the rate gains of the proposed system design over the orthogonal multiple access based counterparts.},

To better assess the freshness of information in computation-intensive applications the criterion of age of information (AoI) is considered. In particular, the problem is formulated to minimize the average AoI of users with elastic tasks, by adjusting UAVs&#39; trajectory and resource allocation on both UAVs and HAP, which is restricted by the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty and multiple resource constraints of UAVs and HAP. In order to solve this non-convex optimization problem, two methods of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and federated reinforcement learning (FRL) are proposed to design the UAVs&#39; trajectory, and obtain channel, power, and CPU allocations. It is shown that task scheduling significantly reduces the average AoI. This improvement is more pronounced for larger task sizes. On one hand, it is shown that power allocation has a marginal effect on the average AoI compared to using full transmission power for all users. Compared with traditional transmission schemes, the simulation results show our scheduling scheme results in a substantial improvement in average AoI.},

In the source and relay link, the hybrid scheme uses feedback information to select a transmit antenna of the source node and a generalized selection combining (GSC)-based relay node. Additionally, in the relay and user link, the hybrid scheme selects a transmit antenna of the relay node and a selection combining (SC)-based user node. This study presents new exact cumulative distribution function (CDF) expression of the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) for GSC. Using the CDF for GSC, this research derives the new exact and approximate CDF expressions of the hybrid combining scheme for the received SNR. Using the exact CDF, this paper newly derives the lower bound and exact expressions of the proposed scheme for the secrecy performance. To offer new insights, this paper quantifies the secrecy diversity order, secrecy SNR gain for the secrecy outage probability, and assesses the high SNR power offset and the high SNR slope for the secrecy rate. Numerical results show that the number of combining paths affects both the secrecy SNR gain and the high SNR power offset. Thus, we confirm that the secrecy performance of the hybrid combining scheme can be adjusted by modifying the number of combining paths without hardware reconfiguration.},

This work first presents comprehensive analyses on AUV-based underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) uplinks, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted to facilitate the spectral efficiency. The laser beam irradiance fluctuation is assumed to follow the Weibull–generalized gamma (WGG) distribution. Besides, the beam spread function (BSF) is adopted to depict the attenuation triggered by absorption, scattering, and misalignment. To begin with, the exact closed-form expressions of the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and moments are presented. Furthermore, both perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC) and imperfect SIC (ipSIC) scenarios are analyzed, respectively. With either fixed decoding order SIC (f-SIC) or dynamic decoding order SIC (d-SIC) scheme at the receiver, both exact and asymptotic results of the outage probability and ergodic sum-rate are derived. The diversity orders are also derived through the asymptotic outage probability. Besides, the average bit error performance is illustrated by conditional bit error rate (BER). Results show that the outage threshold significantly impact the outage performance. Moreover, the residual interference induced by non-ideal SIC would result in a constant value of the Fox&#39;s H function and further lead to outage error floors and capacity bounds, which indicates that the performance of this UWOC system depends largely on the advanced SIC receiver. The impacts of turbulence strength, detecting methods, decoding strategies, and power levels difference are also analyzed in detail. All the derivations are verified via Monte-Carlo simulations.},

While one avenue for understanding these network properties involves the application of time-varying graphs, comprehending such methods may be hindered by absence of well-defined analogies to established properties of static graphs. Thereby, this study addresses this gap by exploring the properties of time-varying graphs as a means to depict network characteristics, aiming to enhance data dissemination efficiency within vehicular networks assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Considering delay-sensitive data dissemination, we integrate dissemination delay into the time-varying graph, introducing the concept of a delay-constrained time-varying graph (DTVG). In this context, a data dissemination problem is formulated to optimize data transmission utility. To address this problem, we propose a novel data dissemination algorithm leveraging insights from $k$ -token dissemination problem. Theoretical analysis is employed to derive both upper and lower bounds of our proposed algorithm. Simulations are conducted for validating the feasibility of characterizing dynamic networks based on time-varying graphs. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through the evaluation of metrics such as dissemination delay, delivery ratio, and network throughput.},

In addition, the average bit error probability (ABEP) and mutual information (MI) of our proposed GAM-FSM scheme are derived. To further enhance the system performance, geometric and probabilistic constellation shaping aided GAM-FSM schemes are investigated and optimized under three optimization criteria, maximization of the minimum Euclidean distance (MMED), minimization of the the bit error rate (MBER) and maximization of the MI (MMI). Simulation results reveals the superiority of our proposed GAM-FSM over the conventional fractional spatial modulation (FSM) systems. Besides, simulation results also show that our proposed constellation shaping aided GAM-FSM schemes exhibit significant system performance improvements compared to the one without constellation shaping.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface(RIS)-assisted communication systems can employ phase shifters to focus radiation energy at the receiver, thereby enhancing link quality and extending coverage. However, designing phase shifters requires cascaded channel state information (CSI), which poses a challenge due to the absence of A/D and D/A converters at RIS nodes. In RIS-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the design becomes particularly intricate since all subcarriers of an RIS element can only share the same phase shifter. Consequently, the estimation process relies on numerous pilots to provide sufficient degrees of freedom for CSI estimation, significantly increasing the pilot overhead. In this paper, we investigate several low-complexity and low pilot-overhead channel estimation methods for RIS-assisted single-input multiple-output (SIMO) OFDM systems based on compressive sensing techniques. Our study commences by developing a low-complexity orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) estimator, which jointly estimates sparse time-domain channel impulse responses (CIRs) and their associated sparse angular domains. The OMP-based estimator exhibits very low complexity but is sensitive to the structure of the sensing matrix. Therefore, we introduce two low-complexity sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) channel estimators to enhance robustness to the sensing matrix structure. The first estimator employs approximate message passing (AMP) with unitary transformation (SBL-UTAMP), while the second estimator uses orthogonal AMP (SBL-OAMP). Simulation results indicate that our proposed methods achieve a promising balance between CSI estimation performance and complexity in RIS-assisted SIMO-OFDM systems.},

  abstract     = {High-speed train (HST) communication has emerged as a prominent area of research, given its critical role in meeting the demanding requirements of high mobility scenarios like auto-driving and mission-critical train control signaling. The provision of these services relies heavily on the accurate acquisition of channel state information (CSI). However, traditional methods of channel estimation are inadequate for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) HST channels due to their extremely short channel coherence time, typically in the microsecond range. In this paper, we propose a dynamic grid-based joint uplink/downlink (UL/DL) channel tracking scheme in the angular domain, specifically designed to address fast time-varying channels in HST communication. The spatial reciprocity between UL and DL channels in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems and fuzzy spatial information are exploited to ensure the consistency of UL/DL supports and improve the tracking performance of the line-of-sight (LOS) channel, respectively. Then, we formulate a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) problem and adopt a block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where a significant gradient-based fast search (SGFS) algorithm is devised to solve the non-convex maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem for the angle of arrivals/departures (AoAs/AoDs) estimation. Finally, simulations verify the superiority of joint UL/DL channel tracking and show that the proposed scheme converges quickly with more accurate tracking results.},

  abstract     = {In ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems, passive tags connect to a reader by reflecting an ambient radio frequency (RF) signal. However, the reader may not know the channel states and RF source parameters. The traditional energy detector (TED) appears to be an ideal solution. However, it performs poorly under these conditions. To address this, we propose two new detectors: (1) A joint correlation-energy detector (JCED) based on the first-order correlation of the received samples and (2) An improved energy detector (IED) based on the $p$ -th norm of the received signal vector. We compare the performance of IED and TED under the generalized noise model using McLeish distribution and derive a general analytical formula for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on our results, both detectors outperform TED. For example, the probability of detection with a false alarm rate of 1% for JCED and IED is 22.97% and 5.41% higher, respectively, compared to TED for a single-antenna reader. Using the direct interference cancellation (DIC) technique, these gains are 34.92% and 3.7%, respectively. With a four-antenna array at the reader and a 5% false alarm rate, the JCED shows a significant BER improvement of 28.68% without DIC and 48.21% with DIC.},

However, the ultra-long spacing among each node will generate severe grating lobes. And the isolated nodes will introduce synchronization errors including gain error, phase error and position error. Such problems will impede DOA estimation performance for most existing methods. Here, we find the platform motion itself can be utilized to construct a virtual array to reduce the impact of grating lobes. Hence, a virtual array construction approach with specific platform motion design is proposed. Then, to conquer the gain-phase errors, a modified atomic norm is jointly considered to reconstruct the sample matrix. And a non-integer array interpolation algorithm is proposed to solve the non-integer node position problem caused by the limited platform control accuracy. Simulation based on several typical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {To solve the rapidly growing data traffic demand of massive users and strengthen the integration of wide-area and near-field communication, a method of collaborative caching and transmitting contents in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) supporting device-to-device (D2D) communication was investigated. We proposed a cache-enabled HetNets model in which user devices (UDs), small-cell base stations (SBSs) and macro-cell base stations (MBSs) all participate in caching and content serving. To improve the quality of service (QoS) and network service efficiency, the transmission cost of services is defined based on service delay and energy consumption. Considering the random characteristics of the network and the uncertainty of signals, using stochastic geometry, the probability of successful transmission for each level of caching node was derived, and on this basis, the expression for the average transmission cost was derived. The caching strategy was optimized by minimizing the transmission cost of services, and the sub-optimal solution was obtained by using the standard gradient method. Finally, the proposed algorithm was compared with two deterministic caching strategies based on content popularity and a probabilistic strategy based on maximizing the successful offloading rate. The results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages in reducing transmission cost.},

  abstract     = {The received signal in numerous practical wireless transmission scenarios, such as multi-hop systems, cascaded channels, keyhole multiple-input-multiple-output, and radar systems, can be realistically modeled as a product of random envelopes. In this context, the present contribution derives novel analytic expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the mixed product of an arbitrary number of random variates taken from the $\alpha$ - $\mu$ , $\kappa$ - $\mu$ , and Extended $\eta$ - $\mu$ distributions. These models are known to characterize generalized multipath fading effects accurately. The derived analytic results are exact and expressed in relatively simple, easily computable algebraic representations. The associated formulations are subsequently used in deriving tractable asymptotic expressions for the lower tail of both corresponding PDFs and CDFs. These asymptotes are particularly useful since they provide meaningful insights into the behavior of the channel statistics within the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. In addition, a single $\alpha$ - $\mu$ distribution is employed as a valuable and practical close approximation to the mixed product distribution with an arbitrary number of variates. The usefulness of such an approximation is demonstrated in the performance analysis of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted communication system, for which the mathematical treatment is usually very intricate. The accuracy and utility of the derived expressions are also validated through comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, an important practical application is demonstrated by applying the derived results to a realistic multi-hop communication scenario in the context of body area networks. This verifies that the proposed results greatly adhere to the target environment, whilst useful theoretical and practical insights on the corresponding impact of generalized multipath fading are developed.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) have become a new paradigm for on-demand and intelligent marine monitoring. To enable diverse AI applications, numerous computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs need to be timely and effectively offloaded. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient USV fleets-assisted collaborative computation offloading scheme for smart maritime services. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading services, and USV fleets are the helpers. Then, the first-price sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Afterwards, to minimize the energy consumption of executing tasks within the USV fleet under the delay constraint, the joint allocation optimization scheme for computation subtasks and computation capacities is proposed based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the expected revenue and participation degree of the USV fleet and reduces the overall energy consumption of computation offloading compared to conventional schemes.},

To address this problem, a sparse Bayesian learning-based main-beam deceptive jamming suppression method using the frequency diverse array (FDA)-multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is proposed. In addition to the angular dimension, an introduced range dimension in FDA-MIMO is utilized to detect the main-beam interferences. Since the range and angle are coupled, a range-angle separation method is given first, where a sparse reconstruction model taking the off-grid problem into consideration is established. Then, a sparse Bayesian learning-based method is proposed to estimate the directions of arrival (DOAs) and the Range of Sources separately. Considering that the overestimated interference power has little influence on the beamforming performance, the maximum eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix is adopted as the power of the interferences. Finally, based on the estimated DOAs, ranges, and powers, the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix (IPNCM) is reconstructed to realize the proposed beamformer with the desired signal steering vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamformer outperforms the existing methods and can suppress the main-beam interferences significantly.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid electric vehicles have been recognized as one of the promising countermeasures to realize carbon neutrality and mitigate energy issues, whose performance depends to a certain extent on energy management strategies. On the one hand, the power batteries are highly temperature sensitive, and working in high temperature will damage the battery life. On the other hand, energy management controller should be able to execute computation-intensive optimization task in real-time. Thus, besides fuel economy, battery temperature and algorithmic time efficiency should be of great concern in the development of practicality oriented EMS. In this work, a time-efficient battery temperature sensitive EMS for series hybrid electric vehicle is proposed. First, a multi-objective optimal control problem is mathematically formulated in model predictive control (MPC) framework. Then, the non-convex optimization problem caused by the non-linear battery state of energy and state of temperature models is transformed into convex optimization problem by convex reformulation. Finally, to improve computational efficiency, alternating direction method of multipliers is used to split the optimization problem into small-scale subproblems and solve the energy management problem. The simulation and Hardware-in-loop test results show that the proposed strategy is capable of not only improving the fuel economy but also effectively keeping the battery temperature as close as possible to the thermal comfort zone. It is observed that the proposed method produces a promising computational efficiency, relative to Pontryagin&#39;s minimization principle-MPC, close to that produced by rule-based strategy.},

At the model formulation stage, the EPC-MIMO radar is configured by coding both the transmit elements and slow-time pulses, where the echoes corresponding to the mainlobe jammers from different range ambiguous regions are distinguishable after decoding in the receiver. Then, the overall received signal model, which contains the true target, mainlobe deceptive jammers, and burst jamming signals with multipath effects, is conformed to a low-rank matrix decomposition model with “low-rank + low-rank + sparse” components. In order to recover each of these components, an improved go-decomposition (GoDec) algorithm is proposed. Moreover, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is utilized to estimate the target direction-of-arrival (DOA). A data-dependent beamforming procedure is conducted to suppress the disturbance components based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion, where the jammer-plus-noise covariance matrix is constructed with the recovered disturbance components involving the mainlobe deceptive jammers and burst jamming signals, and the mainlobe deceptive jammers are suppressed due to range mismatch.

At the design stage, the system parameters at the transmit side are optimized to accomplish joint range-angle estimation and mainlobe deceptive jammer suppression. Specifically, the subarray number and transmit weight matrix are devised to minimize the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) for estimation. In addition, the subarray number is optimized to maximize the Signal-to-Jammer-plus-Noise Ratio (SJNR) for jammer suppression. Subsequently, with the optimized architectures, the joint range-angle estimation is achieved based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion, and the jammers are suppressed via joint transmit-receive beamforming. At the analysis stage, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as well as the output SJNR are analyzed to evaluate the performances of estimation and jammer suppression, respectively.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the design of a dual-function narrowband orthogonal signal set with low Cross- and Auto-correlation Peak Sidelobe Levels (C/A-PSL) to simultaneously achieve active detection and multi-user communication for the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Dual-Function Radar and Communication (DFRC) system. A novel Intra pulse Index and Phase (Intra-IP) methodology via jointing Information embedding Subpulses (InSps) positions selection and Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) is proposed to communicate. This modulation method enables the transmission of different information to distinct users in the same spatial direction. The orthogonal signal set design problem is formulated based on minimizing C/A-PSL while considering the constant envelope and phase constraints. To tackle the resulting nonconvex and NP-hard optimization problem, the Special Majorization-minimization Coordinate Descent (SM-CD) algorithm is exploited to monotonically decrease C/A-PSL. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Intra-IP modulation method in comparison with some counterparts.},

  abstract     = {The growing use of FMCW radars in automotive vehicles has led to the occurrence of mutual interference between radar sensors. Efforts to mitigate this phenomenon are crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of radar systems in complex vehicular environments. In the majority of the proposed mitigation approaches, real-time implementations are notably absent, and many of these methods are usually evaluated by post processing utilizing synthetic or real-world data. This article presents a real-time method for mitigating uncorrelated automotive interferences using the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and L-Statistics. The idea of the method is to compute the STFT of the beat signal and sort each constant frequency line of the spectrogram in ascending order, which places the bins affected by interference towards the right hand side of the time-frequency plane. Onwards, the interference-free range profile is computed by a coherent summation along the time axis of the bins considered to be unaffected by interference (the first $q\%$ of time bins from the sorted spectrogram). In the development steps of the method, synthetic automotive radar signals were used to evaluate the impact of various design parameters (e.g., sliding window length and step size of the STFT, and the summation percentage $q\%$ ) on the performance. Notably, this algorithm does not require a prior interference detection step and by choosing the STFT step size to half of the window length it demonstrates almost performance parity with the unitary step size case, affording a reduction in computation time and facilitating real-time implementation. The method was successfully implemented on a Texas Instruments AWR1843 radar platform and tested within a controlled laboratory environment. The real-time processing flow is presented in detail with an emphasis on the implementation particularities related to the hardware resources of the AWR1843 platform. The tests encompassed various scenarios where the AWR1843 was used like victim radar and up to three additional similar radar platforms used as interference sources with different parameters.},

  abstract     = {Accurate acquisition of critical vehicle states is a prerequisite for active safety systems to work properly. However, vehicle sates under non-ideal conditions are usually difficult to be measured directly due to the high cost of sensors. To deal with the problem, an adaptive strong tracking maximum correntropy criterion extended Kalman filter (ASTMCC-EKF) is put forward to estimate vehicle states. Maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is introduced as the optimization criterion to construct the cost function. Strong tracking filter is employed to dynamically adjust the prior error covariance matrix. Moreover, Sage-Husa suboptimal unbiased estimator is adopted to estimate the noise in real time. Simulation experiments and road tests show that ASTMCC-EKF has a more excellent estimation performance than existing algorithms under non-ideal conditions. The algorithm not only effectively suppresses the interference of non-Gaussian noise but also improves the robustness of ASTMCC-EKF under the model uncertainty and time-varying noise. Furthermore, the proposed ASTMCC-EKF shows a strong robustness to different driving conditions and road conditions.},

The central-zonal E/E architecture with grouped components by their physical positions in the vehicle results significant improvement of computing power, data transmission and harness simplification. However, the MPA loop delays in the central-zonal E/E architecture may degrade or even deteriorate the stability of the system. Firstly, a new analysis model on the MPA loop delays is constructed to describe the network-induced delays. A mathematical upper-bound equation is derived to determine the worst-case loop delays. Secondly, in order to deal with the MPA loop delays and simplify the robust controller design, a novel co-design method of control and scheduling is proposed, in which a time-sensitive networking (TSN) with flexible time-triggered scheduling (FTTS) scheme is developed for improving the communication effectiveness, and a model predictive control (MPC) is adopted to make decisions instantly for improving the control accuracy. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based pole assignment theory is applied to verify the system stability.

  abstract     = {The modern Intelligent Vehicle (IV) is a complex technological marvel that heavily relies on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system to enable seamless communication among different electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN bus system lacks security mechanisms for authentication and authorization, leaving it vulnerable to various attacks. Malicious actors can freely broadcast CAN messages without protection, making the system susceptible to DoS, Fuzzing, and Spoofing attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to devise methods to safeguard modern vehicles from such threats. In this research paper, we introduce HybridSecNet, A hybrid two-step LSTM-CNN Model for Intrusion Detection, a deep learning-based architecture specifically designed to bolster in-vehicle security on Controller Area Networks (CAN). HybridSecNet comprises two stages of classification: the first stage employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to categorize input data as either normal or attacked, and the second stage further classifies the attacks into specific types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This two-step approach significantly enhances classification accuracy and reliability, yielding remarkable results with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1-score of approximately 99.5% for CAN bus network attacks. Comparative analyses with existing single-step models underscore the superiority of our proposed model, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize in-vehicle security in the realm of modern intelligent vehicles.},

The rapid development of autonomous driving technology has the potential to alleviate some bottleneck issues and lead to new changes in truck transportation. Ensuring the high-quality operation of connected and automated trucks (CAT) and connected and automated trucks platoon (CATP) in mixed traffic flow has sparked a wave of research. With the goal of achieving efficient and stable longitudinal control of CATP in mixed traffic flow, this paper develops a novel data-driven longitudinal control framework for CATP based on trajectory prediction (STdi4DMPC). Firstly, a s patio t emporal dynamic attention model for trajectory prediction using a Transformer style architecture that integrates d riving i ntentions (STdi) is constructed, capturing trajectory features of different dimensions and dependencies at different scales. Additionally, processing trajectories using empirical mode decomposition and wavelet denoising. Furthermore, a CATP longitudinal controller that conforms to the truck dynamics constraints based on distributed model predicted control (DMPC) is developed. Finally, the reconstituted noise-reduced trajectory of human-driven vehicle (HDV) is employed as a reference trajectory for DMPC, thereby achieving the integration of trajectory prediction model and longitudinal control algorithms. The simulation results based on the CitySim dataset are conducted and results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed longitudinal control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Lateral control for autonomous vehicles (AVs) under uncertainties is an important research topic. Although there exist various control approaches, it is still a difficult problem to design a robust optimal controller for AVs under uncertainties in the conditions of high maneuverability and large curvature turns. This paper proposes a game-theoretic receding horizon reinforcement learning algorithm (GTRHRL) for the lateral tracking control of autonomous vehicles in special scenarios, such as high maneuvering conditions and large curvature turns, which improves control performance and enhances the robustness to uncertainties while possessing efficient online learning capabilities. The proposed learning-based control strategy combines both the advantages of receding horizon reinforcement learning and the differential game theory. Different from previous receding horizon reinforcement learning, the uncertainties imposed on the AVs are considered and formulated as a player by zero-sum differential games. In this way, the robustness of the controller is guaranteed. Meanwhile, we prove that the proposed control strategy can reach the Nash equilibrium as well as retaining the stability and optimality under uncertainties. Furthermore, the actor-critic algorithm including a critic neural network and two actor neural networks is designed to implement the control strategy. By Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the implemented learning-based control strategy is analyzed, and the convergence analysis of the neural networks is performed. Various simulations are carried out to illustrate the superiority of the proposed learning-based control strategy. The experimental studies under special scenarios, such as high maneuvering conditions and large curvature turns are performed on an autonomous vehicle, and the results further validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy.},

Also, we design an implicit representation-based transmission method to save the transmission data volume while satisfying the data association between the edge and the cloud. Through the experiments, our method shows advanced performance in terms of communication demand with low transmission frequency and small data volume. At the same time, comparable precision to the state-of-the-art is achieved, showing the effectiveness of the data association building.

These frameworks assess the total energy and time expended, as well as the likelihood of target loss during visual navigation. We then develop a hybrid-driven switching scheme that alternates between two motion modes to approach and dock with a stationary target. A novel motion planning method, based on the deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, is proposed to identify the optimal switching points within this scheme. This method aims to minimize energy and time consumption while maintaining visual navigation stability. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and controlled pool experiments. Results indicate that this hybrid-driven approach not only stabilizes visual navigation but also improves the efficiency of autonomous docking when compared to single-mode strategies.

Our approach allows the vehicles to coordinate in tight spaces (e.g., busy highway lanes or parking lots) by using a polytopic description of each vehicle&#39;s shape and formulating collision avoidance as a dual optimization problem. Our method accommodates heterogeneous teams of vehicles (i.e., vehicles with different polytopic shapes and dynamic models can be part of the same team). Our method allows the vehicles to share their intentions in a distributed fashion without relying on a central coordinator and efficiently provides collision-free trajectories for the vehicles. In addition, our method decouples the individual-vehicles&#39; trajectory optimization from their collision-avoidance objectives enhancing the scalability of the method and allowing one to exploit parallel hardware architectures. All these features are particularly important for vehicular applications, where the systems operate at high-frequency rates in dynamic environments. To validate our method, we apply it in a vehicular application, that is, the autonomous lane-merging of a team of connected vehicles to form a platoon.

  abstract     = {Efficient route planning and traffic scheduling are the key enabling technologies to achieve intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, the existing schemes that use driving time or driving distance as indicators cannot meet the personalized requirements of vehicles. In addition, the existing research usually optimizes the route planning and traffic scheduling separately, which is difficult to effectively improve the traffic efficiency in practical applications. In this paper, by considering the personalized requirements of vehicles and the target of the traffic manager (TM), a digital-twin (DT) enabled integrated framework is proposed to jointly optimize the personalized route planning and global traffic scheduling. Specifically, based on the collection of traffic data, we first develop a DT architecture for route planning and traffic scheduling. With this DT architecture, we then consider the traffic condition of each road section and design a global traffic scheduling algorithm to help the DT of the TM (DT-TM) set the optimal reward for each road section to motivate and guide the DTs of vehicles (DT-Vs) to select their routes. After that, by considering the preference of each DT-V and the reward of each road section, a personalized route planning algorithm is designed to plan the optimal route for the DT-V. Since the reward of each road section set by the DT-TM and the route selected by each DT-V affect each other, we thus design a joint optimization algorithm based on dynamic iteration to obtain an equilibrium solution for the DT-Vs and the DT-TM. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can schedule the traffic more effectively and bring higher utility to both the vehicles and the TM than the benchmark schemes.},

Since the underlying problem is NP-hard, its convex relaxation is formulated to give an approximated optimal path. It is shown that the convex relaxation problem is of the form of a distributed optimization with coupled constraints. A fully parallel distributed (offline) algorithm is proposed to find an approximated optimal path of each agent under synchronous protocol. Since the algorithm is fully parallel, the time per iteration of each agent is significantly reduced. The theoretical results are demonstrated by an application to monitor and collect data in important areas of a large field.

  abstract     = {Lane detection is the prominent perception task for both self-driving and advanced driver assistant system. Recently, lane detection methods based on anchors have received increasing attention, but fixed shape anchors are difficult to model complex lane line shapes. To solve this problem, we propose an Enhanced Curve Perception Network (ECPNet) to detect the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and accurately. Specifically, we propose a Layer-by-layer Context Fusion Module (LCFM) to fully utilize both high-level and low-level features in lane detection, which can simultaneously obtain the global spatial structure relations and the local accurate positioning details. The module includes short hop connections within the initial layer and between feature layers of different scales. More importantly, we propose a novel Structural Correction Prediction Module (SCPM), which enhances the model&#39;s detection capability on curved structured lanes by assisting model selection anchor classification mode through adaptive guided techniques. In addition, we design a branch network and construct a Cross-channel Attention Mechanism (CAM) to realize self-information attention, which further enhances the detection accuracy. Experiments on the two most representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of environments, especially in curvy lanes.},

In vehicle platooning, cooperative driving necessitates intricate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interactions, which are governed by challenges including large-scale, constraints, nonlinearity, and stringent real-time processing. DMPC can decompose a high-dimensional, complex centralized optimization problem into multiple subproblems solved in parallel. This property can reduce inter-vehicle communication while enhancing the efficiency of control problem-solving, making it well-suited for platoon control scenarios. Considering the computational limitations of onboard devices, we design and deploy a distributed nonlinear model predictive control (DNMPC) algorithm on cloud servers with superior distributed computing capabilities utilizing docker containerization technology. However, this cloud-centric approach hinges on reliable network quality. To ensure the safety of platoon driving under network anomalies, we introduce edge computing, designing and deploying a less complex distributed linear model predictive control (DLMPC) algorithm at the vehicle edge. Moreover, we incorporate an event-triggered mechanism to optimize cloud computing utilization and reduce operational costs while maintaining control performance.

To evaluate the impact of geometry deviation in the interaction performance of pantograph-catenary, focusing on speeds exceeding 400 km/h, which characterise the next generation high-speed rail. Realistic geometry deviation data of catenary from a newly-built high-speed line is collected. A numerical model is used to simulate the interaction of pantograph-catenary, comparing results with ideal design and realistic geometries. Field tests and simulations at speeds above 400 km/h highlight the significant effect of geometry deviation, with a 15% error when not considered. The quantitative analysis reveals that at speeds below 400 km/h, the difference in results between ideal and realistic geometries is minimal (below 5%), but this disparity increases to over 14% at 440 km/h. These findings emphasise the need to incorporate geometry deviation in the design of 400 km/h and above railway catenary systems, indicating a necessity for updated assessment and validation standards at such speed levels.},

The goal oriented reward function is constructed to train agents to make decisions, which combines the advantages of RL algorithm and ACC model. The simulation results show that the proposed GuidDDPG algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher efficiency than the DDPG algorithm and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithm. For the mixed vehicle platoon, the unified vehicle platoon control model is developed. The GuidDDPG algorithm is used to build a generalized RL agent to learn the optimal control strategy.

  abstract     = {Battery Swap technology represents a promising solution to overcome the main obstacles to a widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in urban environment, like the limited range of EVs and the long battery charging time. Furthermore, with respect to traditional charging stations, it offers higher flexibility in dynamically managing the EV electricity demand to prevent the risk of power grid overload. Nevertheless, proper scheduling of the battery charge process is crucial to offer effective e-mobility services, trading off cost, Quality of Service (QoS) and feasibility constraints. We consider a renewable powered multi-socket Battery Swapping Station (BSS) and design two algorithms based on Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically adapt the battery charging scheduling to the stochastic nature of the system. Both approaches result effective in remarkably increasing the capability to satisfy the customer demand for EV battery charging, at a lower cost with respect to benchmark approaches, with RL outperforming ADP under any budget constraint. In particular, under RL the probability of not satisfying the EV demand is decreased by up to more than 40% with respect to benchmark approaches, and cost can be significantly reduced by almost 20%, jointly with a greener system operation. Furthermore, our results show that a fine tuning of hyper-parameters is fundamental to properly trade off cost and QoS constraints according to varying business needs. Finally, we analyse how the proposed strategies may affect the battery health due to their impact on battery degradation, hence influencing the BSS management cost.},

The control objective is to achieve high-precision formation control tasks for the ASVs while ensuring transient performance, connectivity, collision avoidance, and communication resource conservation. Collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are achieved by defining novel predefined performance functions. The radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is utilized to approximate the uncertainty of the unknown model dynamics in the form of a minimum learning parameter (MLP). The ‘algebraic loop’ issue frequently encountered in the back-stepping method is resolved by the inherent properties of the radial basis function. A novel switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (SDETM) is developed, which can save the communication resources in case of oscillations and satisfy the high-precision formation control task. By utilizing Barbalat&#39;s Lemma and the Lyapunov function method, it has been proven that the formation tracking errors can converge to zero as time tends towards infinity.

In this paper, a cooperative ramp merging strategy for CAVs at multi-lane area with three lanes on main road and one lane on ramp is proposed based on cooperative game theory with transferable utility (TU) and optimal control. On main road, the lanes are allocated based on the driving payoff of each vehicle via cooperative game, while the first-regularization-then-action (FRTA) method is introduced to achieve the real-time cooperative lane changing based on optimal control. Afterwards, the merging sequence (MS) containing vehicles on inner lane and ramp is also determined by cooperative game and the merging trajectory is computed via optimal control. The combination of game theory involving side payment and optimal control achieves a win-win situation at the decision-making level and the cooperative control at the execution level. The simulation results of different cases verify the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed framework, while the comparison result indicates that the proposed framework can improve the traffic efficiency and economic benefit of transportation system.},

  abstract     = {Highways, as a type of high-grade road, are an essential component of intelligent connected vehicle testing and a crucial aspect in achieving fully autonomous driving technology. To effectively predict the driver behaviors when encountering merging vehicles in high-speed merging areas, this paper proposes a high-speed main lane vehicle driving behavior model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Residual Structure with a Transformer network. This model takes input in the form of the target vehicle&#39;s motion state information and surrounding vehicle interaction data, and predicts the current driving behavior state of the target vehicle as well as the next-stage driving behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of this model is validated on the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and the Exits and Entries Drone (exiD) dataset. Comparative experiments with the Time Series Transformer (TST) model and the Multi-head Attention CNN-LSTM (MCNN-LSTM) model are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other models in aspects such as driving behavior recognition, with a correct identification rate of 94% and 95% in the two major datasets, respectively. The driving behavior prediction model presented in this paper can assist intelligent connected vehicles in high-speed ramp merging decision-making and planning.},

To emulate the core functionality of stock ACC systems, which have proprietary control logic and undisclosed parameters, the constant time-headway policy (CTHP) is adopted. Leveraging the multi-layer artificial neural networks as universal approximators , the developed PiNN serves as a surrogate model for the longitudinal dynamics of ACC-engaged vehicles, efficiently learning the unknown parameters of the CTHP. The PiNNs allow the integration of physical laws directly into the learning process. The ability of the PiNN to infer the unknown ACC parameters is meticulously assessed using both synthetic and high-fidelity empirical data of space-gap and relative velocity involving ACC-engaged vehicles in platoon formation. The results have demonstrated the superior predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in learning the unknown design parameters of stock ACC systems from different car manufacturers. The set of ACC model parameters obtained from the PiNN revealed that the stock ACC systems of the considered vehicles in three experimental campaigns are neither ${\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ nor ${\mathcal{L}}_{\infty}$ string stable.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based driving policies enable connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to adapt to complex environments but lack guarantees of safety and decision transparency. For this reason, we propose a hybrid decision-making system that integrates DRL with a learnable, rule-based safety module, wherein the latter offers enhanced driving safety and decision transparency. However, as collision data is limited for a single CAV during the DRL learning process, it becomes necessary for CAVs to collectively learn such a rule-based safety module to accelerate the learning process. Given the potential for conflicting safety rules learned from different CAVs, we propose a two-stage collective rule learning framework for the safety module. In the first stage, the multi-access edge computing (MEC) network aggregates rules from CAVs based on occurrence frequency and generalization capability. In the second stage, CAVs compute rule weights based on local data satisfaction and violations, followed by the MEC network aggregating these weights. The aggregated weights resolve conflicting rules and help filter out insignificant rules to maintain a compact safety module. The safety module makes comprehensive decisions by aggregating all the weighted rules. Simulation results in the highway driving simulator demonstrate that the two-stage collective rule learning framework effectively aggregates learning outcomes from CAVs, and the proposed hybrid decision-making system further reduces collisions compared to the existing approach.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/ Inertial Navigation System (INS) combined system is an undoubtedly vital component of Land Vehicular Navigation (LVN). However, the performance of the GNSS/INS integrated system still experiences a decline in GNSS-compromised environments, as the INS drift cannot be entirely suppressed by the insufficient GNSS observations. Before laboriously incorporating other sensors (such as camera, odometer and lidar) as the mainstream solution, it is very important and interesting to assess whether the GNSS information has been fully exploited, especially for the routes that are not completely covered. This manuscript proposes a method to fully utilize GNSS information by using multiple antennas, which is usually driven by the same quartz clock to save cost and volume. Based on the property of equal clock bias, the raw GNSS observations of these antennas are used to tightly combine with INS, which can significantly increase the available GNSS information. Experiment results show that the horizontal position root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of dual/four-antenna GNSS/INS integrated system are reduced by 42.8/67.8% and 45.1/52.1% with respect to the single-antenna system in two tests, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a hierarchical motion planning framework for a swarm of collective vehicles with a lower maximum speed to race against a single adversary with a higher maximum speed, where the swarm gains a competitive advantage by collaborating. The proposed path planner framework consists of two planning layers: the decision layer and the execution layer. The racing strategy of the swarm is planned in the decision layer, which determines the discrete path and changes the formation of the cooperative vehicles according to the game&#39;s progress. A Gestalt Nash Game (GNG) framework is designed to depict the racing game and determine the strategy of each swarm member: cooperative block or all-full sprint. Then, an interaction-enhanced iterated best response algorithm is introduced to solve each vehicle&#39;s optimal trajectory and infer the adversary&#39;s planning path, searching the Nash equilibrium solution for this multi-vehicle racing. Furthermore, the execution layer employs the discrete trajectories obtained in the decision layer as the B-spline control points and considers the kinematic constraints to get smooth and feasible trajectories. We also combine the MPC method with the simplified Pacejka tire model to drive the vehicle motion. Illustrative simulation examples with different initial conditions are presented, showing that the slower group can beat the faster adversary with a higher probability using the proposed hierarchical path planner.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial systems, namely drones, have greatly improved and expanded drastically over the years. Due to their efficiency and ease of use, drones have been utilized in a wide range of applications. Despite various potential uses, drones are also being utilized for illegal operations and exposing security threats to citizens. It is vital to install an effective anti-drone system to identify and defend against intruding malevolent drones to protect national security. Although there has been tremendous advancement in the development of machine learning to deploy lightweight architectures in the sensor industry, no such drone detection approach has yet been described in the literature. Therefore, this paper proposed a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN), namely RFDNet, to investigate the problem of 17 types of drone RF fingerprint classification problems in the low SNR regime. The network is configured with two principle modules, which are leveraged by the grouped and depth-wise convolution layers, incorporating accuracy improvement while keeping the complexity low. Notably, most existing networks fail to outstandingly detect drones at low SNR levels because the RF signal envelope is distorted and the transient information is lost in the noise. To solve this issue, we collected an open-source RF dataset that stores 17 types of drone RF signals at 30 dB SNR. To investigate the RF dataset at various SNR levels, we regenerate the dataset at different SNRs (i.e., $-10$ dB to 30 dB SNR with the 5 dB interval) and analyze the performance of the proposed network. The empirical results show that RFDNet performed outstandingly compared to the existing deep learning-based drone detection methods and achieved an overall 99.07% accuracy at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

  abstract     = {The development of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations has been a key consideration for enabling the evolution of EV technology and continues to support the fosterage of this technology. Notably, fast charging enhances the EV user&#39;s adaptability by reducing the charging time and supporting long-mile travel. The optimal operation and erratic power demand of a fast charging station (FCS) are still challenging. It is necessary to understand EV charging scheduling and FCS management, which can jointly overcome the problem of EV users on account of optimal operation. However, joint optimization needs detailed future information, which is a formidable task for prediction. This paper aims to address the joint optimization issue using combined game theory and the Lyapunov optimization approach. This hybrid approach could ease the data forecast requirement and minimize the operating costs of FCSs while optimally dispatching EVs to FCSs and satisfying their energy demand. Further, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems. The first subproblem addresses a network of FCSs that try to maximize their revenue through a dynamic pricing game with EV customers who have different behavioral responses to the prices. The pricing game determines the electricity selling prices in a distributed manner as well as the energy demand of users. Subsequently, EVs are assigned to local FCSs, taking into account the distance from and the queue at the stations. Finally, the third subproblem exploits Lyapunov optimization to control the operation cost of each FCS, considering the impact of demand charges. In this paper, the proposed method is validated through a numerical analysis using the real data of FCSs in Boulder, Colorado. Moreover, the presented results revealed that the proposed method is efficient regarding dynamic pricing and optimal allocation of EVs to stations.},

This paper proposes a backtracking in-motion alignment framework using enhanced Lie group (LG-EKF- w ) to replace troublesome EKF. The LG-EKF- w captures the nature of 3-dimension rigid body motion, which guarantees the consistency and improves the accuracy of state estimation. Land and sea field experiments evaluate the performance of LG-EKF- w compared to EKF, state transformation extended Kalman filter (ST-EKF) and LG-EKF- i .

  abstract     = {Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has revolutionized Ethernet with real-time and deterministic transmission capabilities, making it one of the most potential solutions for future vehicular and industrial networks. Compared to time-aware shaper (TAS), the cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) protocol simplifies the gate control list (GCL) configuration process, reducing the deployment difficulty of TSN in large-scale networks. Much research has proposed incremental scheduling approaches for the CQF. However, existing methods often inadequately consider and insufficiently integrate network and flow characteristics, limiting scheduling performance. This paper introduces a novel CQF scheduling method, IRFS, which integrates queue resources and flow features for efficient searching of scheduling priority, routing path, and start offset. A priority sorting function is proposed that deeply combines network and flow characteristics while considering both spatial and temporal resource allocation. IRFS achieves efficient scheduling and load balancing by constructing combinations of $(flow, path, offset)$ , where the elements respectively represent flow features, the spatial distribution, and the temporal distribution of resources. The IRFS is validated in different network scenarios, including simple, complex, and In-Vehicle Networking (IVN) settings. It is compared against other state-of-the-art CQF scheduling algorithm. The IRFS demonstrates superior performance in scheduling success rate, load balancing, and computation time across these scenarios.},

  abstract     = {6G is anticipated to play a foundational role in realizing various emerging entertainment applications and critical societal services, such as smart agriculture, public safety, and so on. Providing the underlying communications for these applications will substantially increase demand for data rate, reliability, and resiliency. Given these requirements, Terahertz (THz)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to support the essential functions within the future 6G networks. Meanwhile, due to the dynamic environment in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network with multiple UAVs, using model-free multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) becomes a promising approach to optimize scarce resources. However, satisfying cooperative safety constraints is not guaranteed in most previous MADRL techniques. Consequently, this paper aims to address the cooperative safety guarantee challenge in the joint design problem of UAV trajectory and channel allocation in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network. Specifically, the goal of the proposed scheme is to maximize energy efficiency, considering the quality of service of each IoT device, the speed limitation of UAVs, and the collision avoidance constraint between UAVs. The problem is mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), known as NP-hard to solve. Thus, we propose a novel distributed safe MADRL (DSMADRL) approach for the safe trajectory design of UAVs using a data-driven uniformly ultimate boundedness stability method. Moreover, we theoretically show that the DSMADRL approach guarantees satisfying the cooperative safety constraint of collision avoidance between UAVs as well as maximizing energy efficiency. Furthermore, the matching method is used to allocate THz sub-bands distributively. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated by comparing them with the existing multi-agent RL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Lack of Internet access in most rural and hard-to-reach areas has become a challenge worldwide. Cost-effective non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless backhauls via diffraction can help these communities connect to the Internet. Accurate prediction and modelling of the diffraction is necessary for the planning and design of such wireless systems. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis to examine the influence of the accuracy of various digital elevation models (DEMs) on the predicted diffraction loss for NLOS wireless backhaul through a single blocking obstacle at an unlicensed 5.8 GHz band. The diffraction loss is predicted using the following terrain-based diffraction models: the irregular terrain model (ITM), the knife-edge (KE) diffraction model, and the rounded-obstacle (RO) diffraction model. We have used various freely available DEMs as the main input for the propagation models. Then, we examined the elevation accuracy of these DEMs compared to reference data obtained from light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based elevation dataset. Measurement data of diffraction loss for various rural sites are used to verify the analytical results. The results show that some DEMs may inaccurately estimate the terrain elevation and obstacle height for the path profile between the transmitter and receiver. This highly impacts the accuracy of the predicted diffraction loss depending on their vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution, particularly in the case of shallow diffraction angles. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the elevation data accuracy before applying the terrain-based radiofrequency (RF) propagation models.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. In RIS-assisted wireless communication systems, practical channel measurements and modeling serve as the foundation for system design, network optimization, and performance evaluation. In this paper, a RIS time-domain channel measurement system, based on a software defined radio platform, is developed for the first time to investigate the small-scale fading characteristics of RIS-assisted channels. We present RIS channel measurements in corridor and laboratory scenarios and compare the power delay profile of the channel without RIS, with RIS specular reflection, and with RIS intelligent reflection. The multipath component parameters and cluster parameters based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model are extracted. We find that the power delay profiles (PDPs) of the RIS-assisted channel fit the power-law decay model better than the common exponential decay model and approximate the law of square decay. Through intelligent reflection, the RIS can decrease the delay and concentrate the energy of the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) path, thereby reducing the delay spread and mitigating multipath fading. Furthermore, the cluster characteristics of RIS-assisted channels are highly dependent on the measurement environment. In the laboratory scenario, a single cluster dominated by the VLoS path with smooth envelope is observed. On the other hand, in the corridor scenario, some additional clusters introduced by the RIS reflection are created.},

  abstract     = {Towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been regarded as an indispensable part due to its flexible deployment, wide coverage, and high mobility. This also creates challenges for channel research. Scatterers are normally present in the structure of clusters during UAV communication, and cluster-based channel modeling is significant. In this paper, the variational Bayesian-Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) algorithm is proposed for clustering, which takes into account the time-space properties. Cluster tracking is implemented using the multipath component distance (MCD) algorithm. Intra- and inter-cluster characterization, such as the number of clusters, cluster power distribution, angular/delay offset, and angular/delay spreads, are well studied. Moreover, cluster lifetime and birth-death (B-D) properties are extracted and analyzed. Based on these cluster characteristics acquired by machine learning (ML) method, a novel UAV-to-ground communication channel model is proposed, and a four-state Markov chain is also introduced to portray the evolution of clusters. Simulation results match well with channel measurements, which verifies the practicality of the proposed model.

In this paper, a UAV-assisted FSO relay system with a decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme is analyzed. We examine the effects of path loss, atmospheric turbulence, nonzero boresight pointing errors, angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations, and other parameters on the performance of the system. Using Málaga distribution as the atmospheric turbulence model, closed-form expressions are derived for channel fading coefficient probability density function (PDF), outage probability, bit error rate (BER) and other parameters. Based on the closed-form expression, numerical results are then utilized in order to determine the optimal values for various tunable parameters to maximize system performance. The results indicate that the performance metrics are strongly dependent on tunable parameters, such as beamwidth, UAV&#39;s position and receiver&#39;s field-of-view (FoV) angle, the optimal UAV&#39;s position is highly correlated with the beamwidth at the receiver of destination. Moreover, when using DF relaying, we observe that the end-to-end system performance is dependent on the link with inferior performance. Therefore, when other tunable parameters are already determined, the UAV&#39;s position should be adjusted to balance the performance of two links for the purpose of improving the end-to-end system performance.},

To solve this complex problem, we also optimize the length of relaying time slots in HD and the transmission power allocation for the UEs and the UAVs in FD. Then, we transform the problem to one-to-many matching and propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm for the joint offloading decision and UEs association solved together with the duplex selection. We show that our proposal reduces the sum energy consumed by the UEs and UAVs for the tasks offloading by up to 40% compared to related works.},

Diversity analysis is an effective method in predicting error performance of an OTFS system. Recent works have studied OTFS diversity in a time-varying channel assuming constant delay-Doppler (DD) channel realization per frame. However, in practice, DD channel realizations may vary in a frame due to the rapid changes in channel geometry relative to a frame duration, leading to a block time-varying (BTV) channel. This paper analyzes the OTFS diversity in such BTV channels. Specifically, we derive the pairwise error probability of the system and analyze its diversity by finding the minimum rank of the pairwise error matrix and its associated multiplicity. We also compare it with other known schemes and demonstrate its improved diversity. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the analytical results.},

Inspired by the idea of distributed computing, a scheme of distributed edge computing-based task offloading for ISCC is designed and various assisted edge nodes (AENs) are introduced in a stochastic geometry approach to alleviate the dilemma of energy consumption. After analyzing the proposed joint optimization problem for energy minimization, a double-iteration joint optimization algorithm (DIJOA) is developed to derive the solution. The results of the performance evaluation not only verify the plausibility of the proposed model, but also indicate that the introduction of AENs can significantly reduce system energy consumption and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes by over 2.5% in energy consumption, which corroborates the superiority of the proposed scheme through numerical simulations.},

In DeepMBS, a multi-objective problem is firstly formulated to optimize system throughput and energy efficiency. Then, the optimization problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the original deep Q-network is extended with a parameterized action space to simultaneously determine the beam hopping (discrete action) and power allocation (continuous action). In addition, we design an empirical filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of DeepMBS. Finally, the results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepMBS can gain a better performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency compared to the baseline algorithms.

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key technology in future wireless networks. One of the main challenges in realizing ISAC is developing dual-functional waveforms that can communicate with communication receivers and perform radar sensing simultaneously. In this paper, we consider the joint design of a dual-functional orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) signal and a receiving filter for the ISAC system. The problem of ISAC waveform design is formulated as the minimization of the weighted integrated sidelobe level (WISL) of the ambiguity function and the interference term from ISAC waveform, with constraints on signal-to-noise ratio loss. The majorization-minimization algorithm combined with alternating iterative minimization is implemented to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that the WISL and the interference term can be significantly decreased to guarantee achievable data rates and detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) is structured on a multi-tier architecture comprising of macro-base stations (MBSs) and small-base stations (SBSs). MBS and SBS are deployed to accommodate a large number of users for the purpose of achieving higher data rates, coverage, and improved outage performance. Recognized for its spectrum efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges as a viable multiple-access technique for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. To maximize power efficiency and reduce outage probability, the power amplifier at the base station is operated close to saturation, which results in nonlinear distortions. Thus, it is vital to understand the fundamental performance guarantees of practical NOMA-enabled HCN systems (HCN-NOMA) under nonlinear distortions introduced by high power amplifiers (HPA). In this paper, we employ an analytical performance evaluation of HCN-NOMA using stochastic geometric approach consisting of a multi-tier architecture with nonlinear distortions produced by HPA. We compare and highlight the impact of HPA operating in the linear and nonlinear regions on orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA in multi-tier HCN. The performance is assessed and compared in terms of outage probability, system throughput, and energy efficiency. It is observed that the performance is improved by up to 96.6% in HCN employing NOMA versus OMA while considering the nonlinear region of operation of HPA.},

RIS, as a secondary transmitter (STx), can enhance primary transmission from the primary transmitter (PTx) to the primary receiver (PRx). Simultaneously, STx transmits its own information to the secondary receiver (SRx). In addition, RIS-assisted covert communications have a broad development prospect, and covert communication is considered in which Willie eavesdrops passive signals from RIS (Alice) to SRx (Bob). By jointly optimizing active beamforming vector at PTx and passive beamforming matrix at RIS, the achievable rate of PRx is maximized subject to the covertness constraint and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint for secondary transmission. The optimization problem is challenging because of the non-convex objective function and the coupling between variables. Thus, the deep unfolding algorithm based on gradient descent (DUAGD) is proposed for the beamforming design. Specifically, we first transform the optimization problem with constraints into the dual domain. Then inspired by gradient descent algorithm, deep unfolding unfolds the original iterative process into a multi-layer network structure. Results from simulations show that the proposed algorithm has fast convergence while maintaining performance.},

However, harsh propagation environments often lead to significant communication performance degradation due to high penetration loss. To overcome this issue, we introduce the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the CF mMIMO system as a low-cost and power-efficient solution. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the joint precoding design of the RIS-aided CF mMIMO system to maximize the sum SE. This involves optimizing the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. To tackle this problem, we propose a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that incorporates fuzzy logic (FL). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on alternating optimization techniques, our FL-based MARL algorithm only requires local channel state information, which reduces the need for high backhaul capacity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FL-MARL algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity while achieving similar performance as conventional MARL methods.},

This shift complicates traditional far-field beam training designs, which struggle with near-field spherical-wave-based modeling, thereby compromising channel capacity. Specifically, in near-field systems, unfavorable computational complexity and pilot overheads become almost inevitable, given that beam training codebooks are coupled with both angles and distances of scatterers in significant propagation paths. Moreover, the power leakage effect in the near-field system can erode beamforming gains if not addressed. To counter these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage learning-based beam training protocol that independently manages angles and distances. Building on this foundation, we present a hierarchical codebook design with modular narrow codeword units termed hierarchical codebook design via accumulation (HCD-A) to alleviate the power leakage problem. Our simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed solutions at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

The key idea is to reformulate the primary operations of the NBP decoder as matrix-vector multiplications by introducing weight matrices and transformations. Based on this, the acceleration of the NBP decoder is achieved by speeding up matrix-vector multiplications using coded distributed computing. Extensive experiments conducted on Amazon EC2 cluster demonstrate that CNBP achieves notable acceleration and scalability performance without any loss in error correction performance.},

This paper proposes an efficient cooperative beamforming design with coupled transmission and reflection phase shifts to exploit the capacity improvement potential of multiple IOSs for the cell-free system under the practical coupled constraints, aiming at maximizing the weighted sum-rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the coefficients of IOSs. Specifically, in the case of the coupled constraints of IOS, the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework is employed to move the constraints for a tractable problem form, deriving close-form solutions to optimize the amplitude and the phase-shift coefficients alternatively. Additionally, due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated maximization problem, we reformulate it into an equivalent one to facilitate decoupling variables, and then the subproblems are solved by adopting the block coordinate descent (BCD) method in the proposed cooperative design where the optimal BS transmit beamformers are obtained locally.

The system splits a deep learning model between an edge device (ED) and an edge server (ES), where the ED feeds raw images to its local model and transmits the output semantic features to the ES for classification. We address two key challenges in transmitting continuous features through modern digital wireless communication systems. First, we devise a smooth sine-based surrogate function to approximate the non-differentiable quantization computation applied to the continuous feature vector during model training. This approach results in stable gradient backpropagation and efficient training convergence. Second, we propose a novel task-oriented automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism, namely TARQ, to overcome communication error. Compared to the conventional bit-error detection based ARQ, TARQ makes retransmission decisions based on the current SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and inference result, effectively reducing the retransmission probability without degrading the inference accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme enjoys fast training convergence and attains an inference accuracy only 0.62% lower than the ideal performance. Meanwhile, it reduces the inference delay of conventional ARQ scheme by 25.5% on average, achieving an efficient tradeoff between inference accuracy and delay.},

The problem of minimizing the total latency per training round by jointly optimizing user scheduling, time allocation, computing frequency, and energy allocation, subject to the maximum energy consumption constraint and the maximum computing frequency constraint of each user, is investigated. Based on the particular problem structure, the optimal computing frequency and energy allocation are derived as the functions of time allocation. On this basis, a heuristic user scheduling policy is proposed and the optimal time allocation is obtained via convex optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is of low-complexity and close to optimal.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the utilization of multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) in cell-free networks to enhance capacity. Equipped with reflective and refractive circuits, as well as negative resistance-based amplifiers, the MF-RIS is able to simultaneously reflect, refract, and amplify incident signals. As such, the signal received by all users in the whole space can be enhanced significantly in a cost-efficient manner. To maximize the weighted sum-rate of the considered network, a non-convex problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit precoding and MF-RIS beamforming. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve this challenging problem efficiently. Simulation results show that, through coordinated manipulation of the amplitude and phase shift of reflected and refracted signals, the MF-RIS improves the throughput of cell-free networks significantly compared to benchmarks with/without existing RIS.},

In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted UAV multipair communication system, in which the IRS establishes a communication link between each pair of base stations (BSs) and users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum transmission rate by using relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The optimization problem is nonconvex and difficult to address due to the presence of binary and coupled variables. Therefore, we relax the binary variables into continuous variables and decompose the problem into three subproblems for iterative optimization, leading to the derivation of the optimal solution. Initially, we address the optimization of resource allocation and IRS phase shift variables. Subsequently, we apply the SCA technique to resolve the UAV trajectory optimization problem. Finally, the above three subproblems are iterated until the algorithm converges. Numerical results indicate that the minimum transmission rate is effectively enhanced by employing the proposed algorithm.},

Omni-digital-RIS (omni-DRIS) is one of the newly introduced variants of optical RIS that can successfully be driven by bit sequences to control lights emerging from simultaneous reflection and refraction processes, impacting both the achievable rate and the required number of omni-DRIS elements. In this paper, we analyze the effects of omni-DRIS-assisted transmission environment parameters to maximize the achievable rate and highlight the corresponding number of omni-DRIS elements. Furthermore, we show that the number of omni-DRIS elements that yields the highest achievable rate largely depends on the number of bits per omni-DRIS control sequence. On the other hand, this rate is determined by the remaining parameters of the transmission system and environmental factors, which include the total transmit power, transmission bandwidth, number of transmitters and users, and the channel DC gain.},

Meanwhile, the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation can provide a strong Doppler resilience and facilitate reliable transmission for high-mobility communications. Hence, in this work, we investigate an OTFS-based AirComp system in the presence of time-frequency dual-selective channels. In particular, we commence from the development of a novel transmission framework for the considered system, where the pilot signal is sent together with data, and the channel estimation is implemented according to the echo from the access point to the sensor, thereby reducing the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. Hereafter, based on the CSI estimated from the previous frame, a robust precoding matrix aiming at minimizing mean square error in the current frame is designed, which takes into account the estimation error from the receiver noise and the outdated CSI. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust precoding scheme by comparing it with the non-robust precoding. The performance gain is more obvious in a high signal-to-noise ratio in case of large channel estimation errors.},

However, most of the current cellular systems may only provide service for the UAV through base station (BS) antennas&#39; sidelobes and thus result in frequent handovers. Ensuring reliable connectivity for such UAV systems is a significant challenge. Introducing multi-connectivity (MC) can reduce data plane interruptions and achieve higher reliability. However, existing works adopting reference signal received power (RSRP)-based handover in MC may not be ideal in cellular-connected UAV communications. In this paper, we therefore propose a multi-criteria handover scheme under MC based on fuzzy logic (FL) to reduce the handover rate and provide more reliable communications for cellular-connected UAVs. First, we consider the average RSRP, the average change rate in RSRP, and the average BS loads as the multiple handover criteria. Then, we adopt FL to combine the considered multiple criteria and obtain the scores for each BS. Finally, we update the serving BS set according to the scores of each BS. Simulation results show that the proposed handover scheme can significantly reduce the handover rate, and provide more reliable connectivity and higher throughput.},

  abstract     = {Radio signals are used broadly as navigation aids, and current and future terrestrial wireless communication systems have properties that make their dual-use for this purpose attractive. Sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies enable widespread coverage for data communication and navigation, but typically offer smaller bandwidths and limited resolution for precise estimation of geometries, particularly in environments where propagation channels are diffuse in time and/or space. Non-parametric methods have been employed with some success for such scenarios both commercially and in literature, but often with an emphasis on low-cost hardware and simple models of propagation, or with simulations that do not fully capture hardware impairments and complex propagation mechanisms. In this article, we make opportunistic observations of downlink signals transmitted by commercial cellular networks by using a software-defined radio and massive antenna array mounted on a ground vehicle in an urban non line-of-sight scenario, together with a ground truth reference for vehicle pose. With these observations as inputs, we employ artificial neural networks to generate estimates of vehicle location and heading for various artificial neural network architectures and different representations of the input observation data, which we call wiometrics, and compare the performance for navigation. Position accuracy on the order of a few meters, and heading accuracy of a few degrees, are achieved for the best-performing combinations of networks and wiometrics. Based on the results of the experiments we draw conclusions regarding possible future directions for wireless navigation using statistical methods.},

  abstract     = {Tracking mobile targets is a basic task for many applications, e.g., wildlife protection, area surveillance, battlefield reconnaissance, disaster rescue, etc. In these cases, multiple edge devices are usually deployed to collect images or videos from the target area. Two mainstream tracking methodologies have been proposed to recognize and track targets from such data sources cooperatively. The centralized strategies collect data from the edge devices and thereafter run mining and learning algorithms upon such data. On the contrary, the distributed strategies implement such algorithms in a distributed manner. However, these methods incur either high transmission costs or slow convergence speeds. To this end, this paper presents a novel cooperative tracking framework (i.e., FedTrack) based on adaptive federated learning. A dual reputation mechanism has been formulated, and subsequently, an adaptive node selection algorithm has been suggested to ascertain the nodes suitable for involvement in the training process. Furthermore, a strategy for selecting the aggregation node based on capability has been developed to enhance the efficiency of aggregation. As far as we know, FedTrack is the first federated learning framework for collaborative tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that FedTrack achieves comparable or even better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, yet needs much fewer data transmission costs and much less time consumption.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Vehicular Edge Computing (BEVEC) framework that employs a dual-layer verification process empowered with a permissioned blockchain to ensure data accuracy and integrity. A novel system utility function is designed to measure the performance of the BEVEC, which also serves as the basis for a consensus mechanism of the permissioned blockchain. To optimize this utility, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to enable timely service delivery in BEVEC. Simulation-based results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when compared to existing approaches. On average, it obtained an 18% reduction in latency, a 38% improvement in successful service delivery, and a 65% decrease in energy consumption.},

However, computing resources (CR) are not fully utilized, and the heterogeneity of CR cannot meet the demand for high-quality services; meanwhile, the distrust between computing nodes or with CRS platforms may hinder the implementation of CRS. In this paper, we propose a CRS framework based on blockchain and collaborative offloading of edge computing. In this framework, to achieve dynamic and efficient CRS among computing nodes, each computing resource requester (CRR) can freely contribute the CR obtained from the computing resource provider (CRP) for blockchain mining and AI services. We also propose a new honestly based distributed PoA via scalable work (HDPoA), in which the honesty of each computing node is considered. CR heterogeneity is formulated as a transaction probability problem. The CRS interactions between CRPs and CRRs are modeled as a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game, and an efficient method is developed to find the game&#39;s equilibrium point. Then, extensive simulations prove the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed framework and interaction model. Finally, we build a prototype of the CRS framework using Python and quantitatively measure and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in terms of transaction latency.},

The intra-group consensus of the WRBFT algorithm adopts weighted Raft, and the best node is selected as the primary node to lead the intra-group consensus by comprehensively evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), data processing capacity and storage capacity of the nodes. The inter-group consensus adopts practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) based on BLS aggregate signature with nonlinear coefficients to ensure that the inter-group consensus can tolerate 1/3 of Byzantine nodes.

  abstract     = {As user equipments (UEs) and infrastructure evolve, the network architecture becomes increasingly heterogeneous, presenting challenges in managing diverse communication technologies and varied network demands. Recognizing these challenges, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and device-to-device (D2D) communication emerges as an effective strategy to enhance network capacity and address the complexities of a heterogeneous network. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC), facilitated by servers at the network edge, significantly reduces data processing latency and alleviates backhaul congestion. This paper proposes a UAV and D2D-enabled heterogeneous MEC framework that supports two offloading modes for UEs: the first is to offload tasks to UAVs equipped with computing servers, and the second is to offload tasks to nearby idle UEs via D2D links. Unlike existing schemes, the selection of offloading modes is determined by the network load, which improves resource utilization. To further reduce computing latency, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly considers UAV trajectory planning, resource management, and task offloading policy. Since the problem is non-convex and challenging to solve in polynomial time, we decompose it into a joint resource optimization and an offload scheme optimization. Based on this, an optimization algorithm based on block descent and potential game is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results indicate that compared to typical UAV-based MEC without D2D, our solution can reduce latency by about 20%. In comparison to equivalent resource allocation, the proposed algorithm can reduce latency by about 25%.},

Even though the literature suggested several techniques to address the QoS issues in this emerging technology, but we have not come across a single article that addresses this issue in a cooperative environment, considering the impact of communication congestion and contention by taking into account emergency vehicles and traditional vehicles. Given that, in this paper, we introduce a hybrid framework known as the Traffic Congestion and Priority-Aware Algorithm (TCPAA). This innovative paradigm leverages the capabilities of computer vision, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Dijkstra algorithm to strategically incorporate the transmission channels and network entities with an objective to improve the QoS metrics in emergency vehicles. Initially, we developed a dataset with computer vision algoritms “real-time (OpenCV ”Background Subtraction”) to evaluate and chose the best machine learning algorithms among random forest, support vector machine (SVM), k-means clustering, and DNN. Based on the result statistics, we select DNN, and classified vehicles into two classes: Emergency and traditional vehicles to train the model. Subsequently, we set standard for two type of communications such as regular and prioritized traffic. We incorporate a micro base station (ÂµBS) in the network for prioritized traffic to facilitate congestion-free communication of emergency vehicles, while the Dijkstra algorithm is used to managed the communication of traditional vehicles. Considering the nature of operation of future autonomous vehicles, we managed most of the decisions processes at the client-side by categorizing the traffic based on the vehicle requirements. Through reliable client-side management, the high performance and accuracy of TC-PAA underscore its efficiency compared to established field-proven schemes. Adhering to reliability metrics such as latency, packet loss ratio, communication cost, data availability, and traffic priority, the proposed model improves QoS metrics in high-demanding areas of IoV networks.},

  abstract     = {Mega low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are regarded as an emerging paradigm shift in the next generation of network. However, the challenges posed by the mega LEO satellite constellations, such as dynamic network topologies, limited on-board resources, and the multimodal data services present significant obstacles for existing routing algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose a clustered multi-criteria routing (CMCR) algorithm for multimodal data services in mega LEO satellite constellations. First, we develop a clustering approach for mega LEO satellite constellation by taking into account the flying direction, line of sight (LoS) inter-satellite link (ISL) and latitude of satellites, which divides the CMCR into intra- and inter-cluster routing. Then, we construct a time-varying graph to represent the dynamic topology of mega constellations. Both intra- and inter-cluster routing start with the identification of satellites that can establish an ISL based on the time-varying graphs, and then compute the dominant paths for multimodal data services. We introduce the attribute consistency to reflect the relative preference of ISLs for each data service, and the CMCR compares the attributes consistency of ISLs to determine the dominant paths. Thus, our CMCR algorithm selects a routing path for the multimodal data services from the dominant paths with the most preferred attribute, and we define a routing algebraic for our CMCR to demonstrate that it can converge to the optimal path. Simulation results validate that the CMCR outperforms the existing routing algorithms according to preference of multimodal services.},

Their deployment for disaster mitigation and management operations is seen as one of their most important applications over the past decade. In such UAV networks, routing plays a crucial role in determining network performance parameters such as network lifetime, data transmission latency, and packet delivery ratio. This paper presents a novel routing mechanism - Multi-Objective Markov Decision Based Routing (MOBMDP) for UAV networks carrying out search-based operations. MOBMDP models routing decisions in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and uses Q-learning to take decisions. It compares routing paths using three metrics, viz., Remaining Energy of the Minimum Energy Node (REMEN), Power Distance ratio (PD), and Expected Delay (ED). Amongst these metrics, PD is a novel metric proposed by this work. PD simultaneously optimizes the energy efficiency and energy distribution in the network. Further, MOBMDP uses a novel reinforcement learning inspired method to estimate transmission delay in a given path. Intensive simulation studies compare MOBMDP to four state-of-the-art routing protocols. Results show a significant improvement in network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, average data transmission delay, and error in delay estimation.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) has catalyzed the emergence of vehicular crowdsensing (VCS) applications, wherein sensing tasks are assigned to ICVs with abundant sensing resources and high mobility. To select workers whose future trajectories have sufficient spatio-temporal similarity with the target sensing area, workers unavoidably need to upload their trajectories to the VCS platform that is not fully trusted, thereby triggering location privacy concerns. Recently, numerous privacy-preserving worker selection schemes have been put forth. Nevertheless, they either fail to enable flexible arbitrary query ranges or incur substantial communication and computation costs, which severely limits their suitability for VCS applications. To tackle the above two issues simultaneously, we propose a novel efficient and privacy-preserving VCS worker selection scheme that supports flexible arbitrary spatial ranges. By utilizing the Bloom filter technique and lightweight cryptographic tools, our proposed scheme allows the VCS platform to efficiently collaborate with the fog server to compute the spatio-temporal similarity without leaking location-derived Bloom filters. Rigid security analysis shows that our scheme effectively preserves the location privacy of both workers and the query user. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that our scheme is significantly more efficient in both communication and computation compared with the state-of-the-art scheme.},

However, there are still many security problems associated with data sharing, such as privacy breaches.

Specifically, the scheme first exploits an autonomous and controllable dynamic pseudonym mechanism to protect the privacy of vehicles&#39; location, thereby preventing the leakage of vehicle trajectory information. Secondly, SEDS utilizes homomorphic encryption to aggregate data at the edge of the network to achieve privacy protection of data content. Thirdly, SEDS uses batch verification with privacy protection to achieve integrity and authenticity of data, and can effectively filter false data. Finally, SEDS applies blockchain technology to store shared data, which can guarantee the immutability of shared data. The security proof and analysis show that SEDS has security features, containing confidentiality, location privacy, authentication and data integrity, filtering false data and immutability. Experimental results exhibit that the SEDS is superior to other recently proposed schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead, as well as network performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have emerged as a promising means to mitigate safety hazards in modern transportation systems. On highways, emergency situations associated with vehicles necessitate a reliable media access control (MAC) protocol that can provide timely warnings of possible vehicle collisions. In this paper, we present an edge-assisted cluster-based MAC protocol (ECMAC) for packet dissemination in software-defined vehicular networks. To reduce the control messaging overhead for clustering, ECMAC separates the cluster control plane (i.e., managing cluster formation) from the data plane (i.e., actual data transmission and forwarding) by using a software-defined network controller in a cellular network edge server. For transmitting packets, we design a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule algorithm to guarantee a high reliability and a low latency. The TDMA schedule in ECMAC is determined by a joint optimization process in the cellular edge, which is formulated as a binary integer linear programming problem and solved by a heuristic approach based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. This joint optimization process minimizes the signal interference by jointly considering channel assignment and time slot allocation, thereby ensuring reliable communication. Through extensive simulations, our performance results show that ECMAC improves the successful delivery ratio of emergency packets by at least 25 %, compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the growing prominence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), there is an unprecedented generation of vehicular data, which harbors immense potential for diverse applications. Considering the convergence of blockchain technology and IoV, blockchain can be used as a distributed ledger to establish a decentralised and autonomous trading platform for IoV networks. However, the limitations in the power and computational capacities of IoV devices hinder their direct involvement in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) process. Addressing this challenge, offloading the computational demands of PoW to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers emerges as a feasible solution. This scenario has prompted us to conceptualize the computational resource management in blockchain consensus as a two-layered resource game, aimed at optimizing both the profits of computing power providers and the utility for vehicles. In the Blockchain Market Layer subgame, we employ a game-theoretic framework to analyze the interactions between MEC servers and vehicles within a PoW-based blockchain network. To optimize the system utility, we introduce a centralized evolutionary game-based pool selection algorithm. Simultaneously, in the Edge Cloud Network Layer subgame, a reverse auction algorithm is implemented to align the computing power supply with the demand within the blockchain market. Here, the cloud data center functions as the seller of computing power, while the edge servers aggregate the computing demand from IoV devices. A broker is then tasked with the allocation and pricing of computing resources, in accordance with the bids, ensuring adherence to economic principles of authenticity and individual rationality. Simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism enhances system efficiency while ensuring revenue, thereby enabling an effective distribution of computing resources between vehicles and cloud data centers.},

While many works aimed for the prediction of the next cell visited by the User Equipment (UE), the prediction of future UE locations has received less attention. In fact, only a few works deal with the prediction of the next UE location while other few works aim to predict the future direction of UEs arriving at a crossroad. This paper presents a methodology for the prediction of the trajectory followed by the UEs inside the cell. First, UE trajectory patterns are learnt by means of an off-line clustering of historical UE trajectories. Then, the obtained trajectory patterns are used for on-line prediction of the UE trajectory inside the cell, the prediction of the next cell that the UE will visit and an estimation of the time to reach this new cell. A dataset with UE trajectories moving around a large real-life cellular network has been considered.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) combining radio access network (RAN) slicing shows tremendous potential in satisfying diverse service level agreement (SLA) demands in future wireless communications. Since the limited computing and transmission capacities, efficient hybrid resource allocation (RA) from the perspective of computing and transmission resources is crucial to maintain a high SLA satisfaction rate (SSR). However, in cooperative multi-node MEC-assisted RAN slicing systems, the complexity of the multi-node cooperation in spatial dimension as well as the contextual correlation of system state in time dimension pose significant challenges to the hybrid RA policy optimization. In this paper, we aim to maximize the SSR for heterogeneous service demands in the cooperative MEC-assisted RAN slicing system by jointly considering the multi-node computing resources cooperation and allocation, the transmission resource blocks (RBs) allocation, and the time-varying dynamicity of the system. To this end, we abstract the system into a weighted undirected topology graph and, then propose a recurrent graph reinforcement learning (RGRL) algorithm to intelligently learn the optimal hybrid RA policy. Therein, the graph neural network (GCN) and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are combined to effectively extract spatial features from the equivalent topology graph. Furthermore, a novel time recurrent reinforcement learning framework, namely recurrent actor-critic (RAC), is designed in the proposed RGRL algorithm to cope with the time-varying and contextual network environment. Simulation results in different use case scenarios demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the average SSR, the performance stability, and the network complexity.},

  abstract     = {Industrial wireless networks (IWNs) are generally time-sensitive and interference-limited to guarantee real-time and reliability for critical industrial tasks. However, the high-concurrent access of heterogeneous industrial tasks poses great challenges for IWNs which are generally resource-limited. By employing multi-access edge computing (MEC) to enhance the computing capability, this paper proposes a multi-priority computation offloading scheme to realize end-edge orchestrated computing for time-sensitive and interference-limited IWNs based on deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we study a general scenario that multiple industrial end devices offload tasks to multiple MEC-enhanced industrial base stations to cooperatively accomplish a complex industrial work. By fully considering different task deadlines, edge computing capabilities, maximum transmit power and peak co-channel interference power, we formulate an overall task delay minimization problem with respect to computing decisions, offloading ratios and transmit powers. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we reformulate it by Markov decision process and design a priority-driven reward, where multiple priorities are assigned according to different deadline requirements. To approximate the optimum solution in the explosive state space, we employ the double and dueling architectures on the basis of deep Q-network (namely D3QN), and propose the D3QN-based multi-priority computation offloading scheme (D3QN-MPCOS). Extensive experiments are performed to validate the suitability and superiority of D3QN-MPCOS for IWNs, where eight benchmark schemes are compared. The results show that D3QN-MPCOS can converge with a higher reward and a smaller overall task delay than other schemes, and satisfy the deadline requirements of heterogeneous industrial tasks under different interference constraints.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) poses great challenges to resource-constrained vehicles. To tackle this issue, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) enabling offloading on-vehicle tasks to edge servers has emerged as a promising approach. MEC jointly augments network computing capabilities and alleviates resource utilization for IoV. Nevertheless, the efficacy of MEC depends heavily on the adopted offloading scheme, especially in the presence of complex subtask dependencies. Existing research has largely overlooked the crucial dependencies among subtasks, which significantly influences the decision making for offloading. This work attempts to schedule subtasks with guaranteed dependencies while minimizing system latency and energy costs in multi-vehicle scenarios. First, we introduce a subtask priority scheduling method based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topological structure to ensure the priority order of subtasks, especially in the scenarios with complex interdependencies. Second, in light of privacy concerns and limited information sharing, we propose an Optimized Distributed Computation Offloading (ODCO) scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), alleviating the conventional requirement for extensive vehicle-specific information sharing to achieve optimal offloading performance. The adaptive $k$ -step learning approach is further presented to enhance the robustness of the training process. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared to the existing state-of-the-art offloading schemes. For instance, the ODCO achieved a system utility of approximately 0.80 within 300 episodes, obtaining utility gains of about 0.05 compared to the distributed earliest-finish time offloading (DEFO) algorithm with around 500 episodes.},

The main objective is to maximize the achievable sum rate for each relaying mode by jointly optimizing the beamforming at TBS and UAV, and the location of the UAV, subject to the power budget constraints at both the TBS and the UAV, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) constraint and the required quality-of-service at all ground devices. In order to tackle the highly-coupled decision variables, an efficient algorithm is designed by considering the alternating optimization approach which divides the original problem into a beamforming design optimization sub-problem and a UAV positioning optimization sub-problem, which are alternatively solved. The two sub-problems were tackled with the aid of the successive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our solution approach and show the potential gains in the achievable sum rate brought by integrating the FD/HD aerial relay in NOMA networks.},

  abstract     = {The emerging beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and envisioned sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are considered as key enablers in supporting a diversified set of applications for industrial mobile robots (MRs). The scenario under investigation in this paper relates to mobile robots that autonomously roam on an industrial floor and perform a variety of tasks at different locations, whilst utilizing high directivity beamformers in millimeter wave (mmWave) small cells. In such scenarios, the potential close proximity of mobile robots connected to different base stations may cause excessive levels of interference having as a net result a decrease in the overall achievable data rate in the network. To resolve this issue, a novel MR optimal path planning scheme via a mixed integer programming formulation is proposed where robots&#39; trajectory is considered jointly with the interference level at different beam sectors. To combat the curse of dimensionality, a geographical division clustering based MR path planning heuristic scheme is proposed to enable scalability and real-time decision making. The proposed heuristic aims to find a low interference path for each mobile robot whilst achieving a near-optimal performance. A wide set of numerical investigations reveal that the proposed optimal and heuristic path planning schemes for the mmWave connected mobile robots can improve the overall achievable throughput by up to 93% compared to an interference oblivious scheme without penalizing the total travel time.},

However, the limited computational capacity and energy of UAVs pose significant challenges to the efficiency of UAV-assisted MSAR systems. To address these problems, in this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV assisted MSAR system consisting of multiple Surveillance UAVs (S-UAVs) and a Relay UAV (R-UAV). Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum total latency among all S-UAVs via jointly making the computing offloading decisions, R-UAV deployment, and the association between a S-UAV and rescue targets while ensuring that all targets are monitored by S-UAVs. Since the formulated optimization problem is typically hard to solve due to its non-convexity, we propose an effective iterative algorithm by breaking it into three sub-problems.

However, due to the dynamic IoV environments and varying resource conditions, not all intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) can effectively participate in the client-server based FL framework. Thus, dynamic vehicle client selection becomes essential for federated AI in IoV to achieve high model accuracy and low system overhead. To overcome the client selection challenge due to resource heterogeneity and vehicle mobility, a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based dynamic client selection mechanism has been proposed in this paper. Specifically, an IoV system is modeled as a multi-agent system (MAS), where the ICVs are regarded as agents. The optimization problem of client selection is cast to a decentralized partial observation Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP). Subsequently, a policy-gradient multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm, MAPPO, is developed to resolve the DEC-POMDP problem. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MAPPO-based federated client selection mechanism optimizes the system overhead and model accuracy of federated model training compared to the benchmark mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have evolved to a new stage where they integrate sensing, communication, and computing capabilities, giving rise to a multitude of vehicular applications that cater to contemporary demands. These applications are characterized by a high degree of integration, coupled functionality between sensing, communication, and computing (SCC), and the need for timely scheduling. Most studies on the integration of sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) for vehicular networks focus on directly matching SCC resources to task demands. However, in the era of ISCC, the interdependence among tasks is critical and therefore cannot be ignored during the task scheduling process. For instance, the computing task can only start after the sensing task is finished. In addition, the SCC resources and task demands fluctuate significantly as time goes by due to the high mobility of vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a dependency-aware task scheduling strategy for ISCC-based vehicular networks, which takes both task interdependence and high mobility into consideration. With the proposed strategy, the demands of vehicle application tasks on SCC resources are determined after the relationship between the tasks is examined. In addition, the mobility of vehicles is taken into consideration in order to properly match the demands of the sources on different vehicles. Finally, a meta deep reinforcement learning-based task scheduling (MTS) algorithm is used to make the appropriate task scheduling decision. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce dependent task processing delay in dynamic vehicular networks. In addition, the MTS approach ensures that the proposed strategy can quickly adapt to new vehicular network environments.},

  abstract     = {High-definition (HD) maps will serve as the key enabler to achieve autonomous driving. To maintain up-to-date information in HD maps, we explore crowdsourcing from connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). It is, however, challenging to achieve live HD maps under complex dynamics in automotive edge computing networks. In this paper, we propose a new crowdsourcing HD map ( EdgeMap ) to enable collaborative computation between CAVs and edge servers. We formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total usage of transmission and computing resources under the constraint of end-to-end latency. To solve the problem, we design a new DATE algorithm to adaptively partition vehicular offloadings and reserve multiple domain resources, based on asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning and expected gradient descents. We develop an end-to-end network simulator, including vehicle and edge computation and radio transmission in the 5G network, to evaluate the performance of EdgeMap . The results show that EdgeMap can achieve more than 30% reduction in total resource usage as compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of connected devices and the increasing demand for more precise and reliable positioning information, the fusion of 5G and GNSS localization systems holds immense potential to overcome the current limitations of standalone approaches. In order to tackle this challenge, in this paper we explore the potential of the fusion of 5G-NR and satellite localization systems to jointly enhance their accuracy and reliability. The designed solution, termed 5GNSS , is explained in detail, describing its five main building blocks and corresponding mathematical foundations. An extensive performance evaluation has been conducted, considering urban, suburban, and rural vehicular scenarios, as well as a varying number of visible satellites and 5G base stations. Our results show that 5GNSS can outperform standalone GNSS, 4G-LTE and 5G-NR positioning systems consistently across all these scenarios with an average error reduction in the $\sim$ 60-40% range. Based on these results, we conclude that future positioning systems would strongly benefit from incorporating 5GNSS-like fusion solutions.},

  abstract     = {Energy-efficient federated learning (FL) is important for decentralized learning-based edge computing. The energy consumption of FL is largely affected by the efficiency of local training in edge devices and their communication efficiency to the central server. The majority of studies have focused on improving the latter while continuing to use traditional neural networks for local training. This can be computationally heavy for edge devices, especially given their limited energy supply and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a joint lightweight design and energy-saving algorithm (LDES) for efficient FL training and parameter uploading in the wireless edge. In the lightweight design of LDES, we investigate lightweight models in local training by deploying sparse or binary neural networks (SNN or BNN) at the edge, in order to reduce the uploaded data volume and the energy consumption. We develop an enhanced stochastic gradient descent algorithm with guaranteed convergence to handle the issues of non-smoothness and weight constraints (NSC-SGD) in training sparse models. In the energy-optimization part of LDES, we optimize power, bandwidth, and learning parameters to jointly minimize computing, uploading, and broadcasting energy. The numerical results show that LDES can reduce 56.21% energy consumption compared to benchmark FL schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) serve as an emerging technology to provides great promise for building intelligent transportation systems with convenient, enriched, and smart transportation services. Furthermore, VANET provides an intelligent platform that enables vehicles and infrastructures to share relevant information through communication, facilitating vehicle predictions of road conditions and reducing traffic accidents. Therefore, VANET faces intricacies and vulnerabilities to various security threats. Generally, to further achieve secure communication, the authentication key agreement (AKA) protocol is a crucial technology in VANET. However, the existing AKA protocols for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication still have some challenges. Firstly, most protocols can only achieve one-to-one identity authentication, and can not authenticate with multiple users at once, which is inefficient. Secondly, some schemes have one-to-many authentication functions but also have a linearly increasing storage cost, and their complex operations pose an expensive computational burden on resource-constrained devices. To further address these shortcomings, we propose a novel AKA protocol that utilizes the vehicle&#39;s attributes as identity, allowing for multiple identity authentication. In the extended Canetti-Krawczyk (eCK) security model, our protocol satisfies the unforgeability of messages and indistinguishability of session keys based on the hardness of the complexity assumptions. Furthermore, we conducted simulations of our protocol using ProVerif, a formal proof tool, which confirms that our protocol satisfies the security properties. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we analyzed it using JPBC, a cryptographic library based on the Java language, as well as Veins (Omnet++ and Sumo), and the results indicate that our proposal outperforms other schemes and is suitable for deployment in high-traffic, high-density, and resource-constrained VANET scenarios.},

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a FR2 5G network deployed in an operational factory scenario at 26 GHz. The experimental characterization, performed with autonomous mobile robots that self-navigate the industrial lab, leads to the analysis of the received power along the factory and the evaluation of reference path gain models. The proposed assessment deeply analyzes the physical layer of the communication network under operational conditions. Thus, two different network configurations are assessed by measuring the power received in the entire factory, providing a comparison between deployments. Additionally, beam management procedures, such as beam recovery, beam sweeping or beam switching, are analyzed since they are crucial in environments where mobile agents are involved. They aim for a zero interruption approach based on reliable communications. The results analysis shows that beam recovery procedures can perform a beam switching to an alternative serving beam with power losses of less than 1.6 dB on average. Beam sweeping analysis demonstrates the prevalence of the direct component in Line-of-Sight conditions despite the strong scattering component and large-scale fading in the environment.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for uninterrupted connectivity emphasises the pivotal role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in facilitating real-time video streaming, despite the challenges associated with highly dynamic air-to-ground communications. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based solutions (on-policy) are designed to optimize specific quality of experience (QoE) objectives, such as video quality and smoothness when networks fluctuate. However, they are vulnerable to different hyperparameters and have poor sample efficiency. To overcome this problem, we propose an improved off-policy soft actor-critic (SAC) solution, named I-SAC, which provides an exceptional exploration-exploitation trade-off for UAV-based aerial video streaming. I-SAC trains a neural network by jointly considering the video playback status, UAV flight metrics like altitude, velocity, and acceleration, as well as prior network conditions with the goal of maximizing the overall QoE. We design a new QoE metric that considers video quality, video quality oscillations, re-buffering, latency, and bandwidth utilization. We evaluate I-SAC with extensive real-world bandwidth settings, UAV flights, and multi-duration segment datasets. The trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that I-SAC significantly outperforms the closest on-policy and off-policy DRL-based alternative solutions in terms of QoE. Specifically, I-SAC achieves average QoE improvements of up to 54.32% under different testing scenarios.},

The key to such a system is the constrained joint transmit waveform design, which constitutes the main contribution of this work. Per the practical requirement of waveform design, we introduce a new realistic power constraint, referred to as peak-to-valley-power-ratio control with energy budget (PVRC-EB), to remedy the shortcoming of the traditional energy constraint in terms of the transmit elemental power uniformity control. To realize the integrated function of radar and communication, we formulate two joint transmit waveform designs, which achieve a tradeoff between radar function and downlink communication subject to spectral or spatio-spectral energy constraints for accommodating simultaneous uplink communication. For the first design with only spectral constraint, we derive an efficient algorithm based on successive alternating projection (SAP), with its convergence theoretically being proved to approach a stationary point. For the second design with spatio-spectral constraints, we propose a method, referred to as SAP-ADMM, which incorporates the derived SAP steps into the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised methods and a good balance among the three functions can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a novel technology that provides $360^{\circ}$ coverage and new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). They are also capable of manipulating signal propagation and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This paper introduces a novel STAR-RIS-aided secure SWIPT system for downlink multiple input single output rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). The UERs are also capable of wiretapping the IR streams. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the information transmitter, but only imperfect CSI for the UERs is available at the energy transmitter. By exploiting RSMA, the base station splits the messages of the IRs into common and private parts. The former is encoded into a common stream that can be decoded by all IRs, while the private messages are individually decoded by their respective IRs. We find the precoders and STAR-RIS configuration that maximizes the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate of the IRs under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs, and subject to constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is non-convex and has intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-step iterative algorithm based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the RSMA-based algorithm implemented with a STAR-RIS enhances both the rate of confidential information transmission and the total spectral efficiency. Furthermore, our method surpasses the performance of both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-OMA (NOMA).},

In this paper, we formulate a sequential decision problem to jointly perform band assignment and beam management. We propose a method based on hierarchical RL (HRL) to handle the complexity of the problem by separating the policies for band selection and beam management.

  abstract     = {Grant-free random access (GFRA) is now a popular protocol for large-scale wireless multiple access systems in order to reduce control signaling. Resource allocation in GFRA can be viewed as a form of frame slotted ALOHA, where a ubiquitous design assumption is device homogeneity. In particular, the probability that a device seeks to transmit data is common to all devices. Recently, there has been an interest in designing frame slotted ALOHA algorithms for networks with heterogeneous activity probabilities. These works have established that the throughput can be significantly improved over the standard uniform allocation. However, the algorithms for optimizing the probability a device accesses each slot require perfect knowledge of the active devices within each frame. In practice, this assumption is limiting as device identification algorithms in GFRA rarely provide activity estimates with zero errors. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent for optimizing slot allocation probabilities in the presence of activity estimation errors. Our algorithm exploits importance weighted bias mitigation for stochastic gradient estimates, which is shown to provably converge to a stationary point of the throughput optimization problem. In moderate size systems, our simulations show that the performance of our algorithm depends on the type of error distribution. We study symmetric bit flipping, asymmetric bit flipping and errors resulting from a generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. In these scenarios, we observe gains up to 40%, 66%, and 19%, respectively.},

Addressing these challenges, our work introduces an innovative adaptive rate encoding mechanism that captures the intrinsic semantics of images and fine-tunes the coding rate based on semantic interconnection probability. We employ a cross-attention model to construct a layered semantic probability graph parsed into a hierarchical semantic tree, which represents the probabilistic relationships of image semantics and unravels the latent semantic structure. This not only delineates the image&#39;s semantic architecture but also enables our adaptive encoding to dynamically allocate resources, minimizing redundancy and enhancing efficiency. Our experiments confirm that our approach provides a more judicious bit allocation to complex image features and allocates more bits to semantically rich features while achieving superior compression of simpler content. The proposed method not only improves upon existing semantic fidelity metrics but also reduces the bit demand for transmitting complex images. Our adaptive encoding strategy represents a significant stride in leveraging the endogenous semantic information of images for more accurate and efficient communication.},

In this paper, a novel joint spectrum sensing and resource allocation (JSS-RA) scheme in the CIoV system is investigated. The JSS-RA process is divided into two phases. In the spectrum sensing phase, our scheme considers the dynamic vehicular environment to adjust the decision threshold individually for each vehicle. In the resource allocation (RA) phase, we first propose a general utility-efficiency function. The various parameters contained in this function enable its transformation into many mainstream objective functions. Subsequently, the RA issue is formulated as a joint orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol and power optimization, which is also known as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We solve the original optimization by decomposing it into two subproblems. The theorems prove that the global optimum solution can be obtained by combining the results of two decomposed subproblems. Besides, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is discussed. Finally, numerical simulations verify the excellent performance and robustness of our JSS-RA scheme.},

  abstract     = {The coexistence of Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) brings significant challenges for service pairing and resource allocation in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless networks. To meet the reliability requirement of URLLC services and improve the fairness of eMBB services, we first develop a supervised learning-based resource allocation policy for eMBB services. Then, a two-phase resource allocation framework is proposed for URLLC services: 1) eMBB/URLLC service pairing and 2) URLLC resource allocation . In the first phase, matching theory pairs eMBB and URLLC services for better fairness. In the second phase, URLLC resource allocation policy is optimized by a constrained unsupervised learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can achieve better trade-offs among fairness, throughput, and reliability compared with two existing baselines. For example, a dynamic proportional fairness algorithm can meet the reliability requirement of URLLC when its average packet arrival rate is below 0.7 packets/mini-slot. The proposed algorithm can support URLLC services with an average packet arrival rate of 1.6 packets/mini-slot.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to play a prominent role among emerging technologies in future wireless communications. In particular, a communication radar coexistence system is degraded significantly by mutual interference. In this work, given the advantages of promising reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted radar coexistence system where a STAR-RIS is introduced to improve the communication performance while suppressing the mutual interference and providing full space coverage. Based on the realistic conditions of correlated fading, and the presence of multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS, we derive the achievable rates at the radar and the communication receiver side in closed forms in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Next, we perform alternating optimization (AO) for optimizing the STAR-RIS and the radar beamforming. Regarding the former, we optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS through a projected gradient ascent algorithm (PGAM) simultaneously with respect to the amplitudes and phase shifts of the surface for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) operation protocols. The proposed optimization saves enough overhead since it can be performed every several coherence intervals. This property is particularly beneficial compared to reflecting-only RIS because a STAR-RIS includes the double number of variables, which require increased overhead. Finally, simulation results illustrate how the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart, and show how the various parameters affect the performance. Moreover, a benchmark full instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) based design is provided and shown to result in higher sum-rate but also in large overhead associated with complexity.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms play an effective role in timely data collection from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. Optimizing the collective behavior of swarms can improve data collection performance. This paper puts forth a new mean field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize age of information (AoI) of sensory data, where balancing the trade-off between the UAVs&#39; movements and AoI is formulated as a mean field game (MFG). The MFG optimization yields an expansive solution space encompassing continuous state and action, resulting in significant computational complexity. To address practical situations, we propose, a new mean field hybrid proximal policy optimization (MF-HPPO) scheme to minimize the average AoI by optimizing the UAV&#39;s trajectories and data collection scheduling of the ground sensors given mixed continuous and discrete actions. Furthermore, a long short term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in MF-HPPO to predict the time-varying network state and stabilize the training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MF-HPPO reduces the average AoI by up to 45% and 57% in the considered simulation setting, as compared to multi-agent deep Q-learning (MADQN) method and non-learning random algorithm, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have been considered as promising solutions to providing high data rate and seamless coverage, where satellite beam management plays a key role. However, due to the limitation of beam resource, dynamic network topology, beam spectrum reuse, time-varying traffic arrival and service continuity requirement, it is challenging to effectively allocate time-frequency resource of satellite beams to multiple cells. In this article, aiming at reducing time-averaged beam revisit time and mitigate inter-satellite handover, a beam management problem is formulated for dynamic LEO satellite communication networks, under inter-cell interference and network stability constraints. Particularly, inter-cell interference constraints are further simplified into off-axis angle based constraints, which provide tractable rules for spectrum sharing between two beam cells. To deal with the long-term performance optimization, the primal problem is transformed into a series of single epoch problems by adopting Lyapunov optimization framework. Since the transformed problem is NP-hard, it is further divided into three subproblems, including serving beam allocation, beam service time allocation and serving satellite allocation. With the help of conflict graphs built with off-axis angle based constraints, serving beam allocation and beam service time allocation algorithms are developed to reduce beam revisit time and cell packet queue length. Then, we further develop a satellite-cell service relationship optimization algorithm to better adapt to dynamic network topology. Compared with baselines, numerical results show that our proposal can reduce average beam revisit time by 20.8 $\%$ and keep strong network stability with similar inter-satellite handover frequency.},

In the field of spectrum sensing, various eigenvalue-based algorithms are proposed by analyzing the distribution of eigenvalues of the sampling covariance matrix. In those algorithms, the detection performance is limited by the number of equipped antennas under low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio condition. This paper proposes a spectrum sensing algorithm based on the cyclic reorganization of the sampled signal using the difference between the maximum eigenvalue and the geometric mean of the eigenvalues (CRDMGM). By cyclically shifting the sampled signal data, the number of virtual antennas can be increased to obtain more information related to the sampling signal. As a result, the estimation accuracy of the eigenvalue is improved, which mitigates the impacts on the detection performance caused by the insufficient number of antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that under the conditions of limited antenna numbers and low SNR, the CRDMGM algorithm significantly outperforms the algorithm of the difference between the received maximum eigenvalue and the geometric mean of the eigenvalue (DMGM) and the improved version (IDMGM) based on split reorganization.},

  abstract     = {The sparsity of millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the angular and temporal domains is beneficial to channel estimation, while the associated channel parameters can be utilized for localization. However, line-of-sight (LoS) blockage poses a significant challenge on the localization in mmWave systems, potentially leading to substantial positioning errors. A promising solution is to employ reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to generate the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) paths to aid localization. Consequently, wireless localization in the RIS-assisted mmWave systems has become the essential research issue. In this paper, a multiple measurement vector (MMV) model is constructed and a two-stage channel estimation based localization scheme is proposed. During the first stage, by exploiting the beamspace sparsity and employing a random RIS phase shift matrix, the channel parameters are estimated, based on which the precoder at base station and combiner at user equipment (UE) are designed. Then, in the second stage, based on the designed precoding and combining matrices, the optimal phase shift matrix for RIS is designed using the proposed modified temporally correlated multiple sparse Bayesian learning (TMSBL) algorithm. Afterwards, the channel parameters, such as angle of reflection, time-of-arrival, etc., embedding location information are estimated for finally deriving the location of UE. We demonstrate the achievable performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our studies show that the proposed localization scheme is capable of achieving centimeter level localization accuracy, when LoS path is blocked. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has a low computational complexity and outperforms the legacy algorithms in different perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Recently, cognitive radio (CR) has become an effective method for wideband spectrum sensing (WBSS) based on sub-Nyquist sampling to enhance the sensing range as much as possible and alleviate the spectrum resource constraint. However, most of the previous work tends to ignore the spatial correlation between channels, making the sensing performance degraded. The few works that consider spatiality often suffer from excessive computational complexity and overhead. In this paper, we consider space-dependent MIMO channels and propose two compressive subspace learning (CSL) algorithms (mCSL-improved MUSIC and vCSL-improved MUSIC). Both algorithms exploit spatial diversity, with mCSL exploiting the antenna averaged temporal decomposition and vCSL exploiting the spatial-temporal joint decomposition. By the singular value property of the statistical covariance matrix (SCM), we present the analysis of the MUSIC algorithm under two structures. To further reduce the computational complexity, we demonstrate the feasibility of improving the cut-off conditions of MUSIC based on the orthogonality of signal and noise, and give the mCSL-improved MUSIC and vCSL-improved MUSIC algorithm procedure and calculate the complexity. The proposed algorithm can ensure the performance of wideband spectrum sensing in the presence of noise while also reducing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the correctness of this work and its performance improvement of wideband spectrum sensing over related works.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for enhancing quality of service in communication systems, but deploying numerous antennas increases detection complexity. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel detection scheme called DeepEigen-Tabu, combining the deep learning-based eigen network (DeepEigNet) with probabilistic Tabu search (P-TS). In the proposed scheme, DeepEigNet, a deep neural network, is constructed to utilize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the channel matrix to provide approximate symbol estimates. Subsequently, these estimates serve as the initialization and are prioritized according to their probabilities of correction to support the P-TS. Furthermore, the P-TS integrates an early stopping mechanism based on correction probabilities to eliminate unnecessary iterations during the Tabu search process. Finally, computer simulations and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed DeepEigen-Tabu scheme outperforms existing methods while maintaining lower complexity. For instance, in communication scenarios with both transmit and receive antennas set to 16, the proposed DeepEigen-Tabu method demonstrates savings of approximately signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 0.8 dB at bit error rate (BER) $10^{-3}$ , compared to existing approaches in 4-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (4-QAM) symbol modulation. When the number of antennas is increased to 24 and using 16-QAM, the proposed DeepEigen-Tabu provides an improvement of 0.5 dB in SNR performance. Specifically, the proposed DeepEigen-Tabu not only achieves superior performance, as mentioned earlier, but also incurs a lower computational cost. The performance enhancements can be attributed to the DeepEigNet&#39;s provision of effective initialization, along with the early stopping and efficient candidate movement mechanisms employed by the P-TS method.},

  abstract     = {The development of technologies in the smart home provides convenience to our living life, however, the resource-constrained characteristics lead to its frequent exposure to various attacks. Previous techniques for attack detection in the Internet of Things (IoT) are primarily fitted to simple attacks (i.e., single-step attack) but are insufficient analysis for dynamic detection of so-called complicated attacks (i.e., multi-step attacks). Usually, there are three challenges for deploying a multi-step attack prediction system under IoT: 1) resource-constrained, 2) frequently unknown multi-step threats, and 3) high demand for real-time. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a multi-step attack prediction architecture (namely, MS-ZeroWall ) applied in the smart home. Firstly, the MS-ZeroWall does not need expensive software, which can be easily deployed on resource-constrained IoT. Then, it captures the characteristics of known threats through the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and uses a VAE-based dual-domain defense strategy (DVAE) to achieve unknown multi-step threat identification. In addition, MS-ZeroWall automatically model any multi-step attack by combining the hidden Markov model (HMM) and VAE, and it uses an aggregated HMM (AHMM) approach to improve the multi-step attacks prediction under low time-delay windows so as to satisfy real-time. We evaluate the MS-ZeroWall on a publicly available multi-step attack dataset, with an $F1$ -score of over 0.96 on unknown multi-step threat identification, and an average accuracy improvement of 12.3% on low-latency multi-step attack prediction.},

Serving all UEs by all APs leads to inefficient use of spectral resources as well as energy under low traffic load. This work focuses on minimizing the energy consumed to transmit a bit in the cell-free massive MIMO system for given spectral efficiency (SE) requirements. First, we propose an algorithm to achieve the max-min fairness in DL communications while minimizing the total power consumption of the cell-free system. Secondly, we present an algorithm to reduce the total power consumption for a given minimum target SE of the system by temporarily switching off a set of APs that is not contributing to overall system performance. Finally, we suggest a technique to reduce the average number of state transitions of APs in a system with dynamic UEs, over a period of time. It minimizes the average transition power consumption over a period where large-scale fading values change multiple times. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms reduce the overall energy consumption of the system compared to the situation where all APs are active.},

However, several practical challenges as the appearance of interference channels need to be addressed. Interference alignment (IA) is a powerful technique to manage multiple concurrent transmissions in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). The fully digital (FD) IA has been widely studied. However, the research on IA with hybrid digital-analog beamforming (HB) for massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) scenarios, is limited. The reported works on HB-IA are designed assuming ideal phase shifters (PSs) without quantized phase constraints. Therefore, their performance severely degrades in practical systems with low-resolution PSs. Although quantized phase restrictions were considered in some HB schemes, they were limited to scenarios with a single transmitter, either single-user or multi-user. Thus, they fail when applied to UDNs since interference from neighboring cells is not considered in the design. Then, a new HB-IA is proposed for UDNs based on an iterative partial construction (IPC) procedure with the novelty of awareness of PSs quantization. The IPC algorithm relies on algebraic properties to iteratively compute the analog and digital matrices, via a partial submatrix composition, such that the Euclidean distance to the FD-IA solution is reduced. An additional digital block, based on an IA algorithm, is also applied to cancel the residual interference. Numerical results reveal that this proposal, referred as HB IPC-IA, significantly outperforms reported works achieving a near FD-IA performance. The obtained results provide practical insights for HB design in UDNs.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as one of the key features of the sixth-generation wireless networks. However, the coverage and sensing-communication performance are limited due to the uncontrollable environments, especially when operating in the high-frequency bands. To address this issue, we utilize the benefits of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in reshaping the propagation environments and propose a distributed IRS-aided ISAC framework, in which the impacts of IRS deployment on both sensing and communication performances are investigated. Specifically, in the proposed framework, multiple IRSs including both passive IRSs (PIRSs) and semi-passive IRSs (SIRSs) are deployed to realize communication and sensing simultaneously. We first design a distributed IRS-aided location sensing scheme, by invoking communication signals. Using the sensed location information, a distributed-IRS beamforming scheme is designed to enhance the transmission rate with low overhead. Numerical results show that a high positioning accuracy of millimeter-level can be achieved. By using the sensed location information, the proposed distributed-IRS beamforming scheme achieves comparable performance to the benchmark with perfect channel state information. We also show that, with a fixed total number of IRS elements, a distributed deployment with 2 SIRSs is preferable in terms of location sensing performance and a distributed deployment with more PIRSs is preferable in terms of communication performance.},

  abstract     = {Artificial noise elimination (ANE) has arisen as a promising strategy to counteract artificial noise (AN) at the eavesdropper (Eve). However, conventional ANE schemes rely on the attainable channel state information (CSI) between the transmitter (Alice) and legitimate receiver (Bob), which may reduce the feasibility of ANE. To break the gridlock, we focus on the ANE without the Alice-Bob link CSI by minimizing the artificial-noise-to-signal ratio (ANSR). Specifically, the detailed minor component analysis (MCA)-based ANE scheme is proposed to eliminate the AN for a specific classification. Moreover, the principal component analysis (PCA)-based ANE scheme is proposed for the case of binary phase shift keying (BPSK). Furthermore, the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based ANE scheme is proposed to exploit the additional information from the unclassified samples. To evaluate the cost of computing, the computational complexity of the aforementioned ANE schemes is analyzed. Meanwhile, the minimum required numbers of observed vectors for the MCA and PCA are derived. Finally, our numerical simulations show that proposed ANE schemes outperform the conventional hyperplane clustering (HC) scheme and can achieve the ANSR of ${\mathbf {1}}{{\mathbf {0}}^{{\mathbf { - 4}}}}$ at the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 25 dB.},

In this scenario, a shared uplink LTE-based spectrum is divided into multiple frequency-orthogonal channels, enabling the parallel sensing of multiple primary user (PU) signals. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and Rao principles are utilized to develop five parallel multiband SS algorithms. It is analytically demonstrated that four of the proposed detectors maintain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) against noise variance uncertainty. In addition, a new threshold-setting strategy is introduced to ensure that the non-CFAR detector maintains a false alarm rate below a predetermined level, resulting in a fixed level-of-test instead of a fixed size-of-test (CFAR test). Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results and compare the proposed algorithms with existing frequency-domain energy detector (FD-ED) and the cyclic prefix (CP)-based detector.},

  abstract     = {The multiple-input-multiple-output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) receiver aims to softly decode the transmitted information from the observed received signal. However, soft-output detection requires additional computation and leads to higher overall detection complexity in high-dimensional MIMO and higher-order modulation. Therefore, accurate and low-complexity soft-output detection is a challenging task in such systems. The conventional likelihood ascent search (LAS) detectors perform well in large antenna setups, however, multiple symbol updates and the soft-output estimation using brute force search further boost its complexity. In this paper, we propose a model-based soft-output LAS detector to jointly detect and precisely estimate the soft output in MIMO-OFDM systems. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven deep-LAS (Deep LAS) architecture for MIMO detection which is a multi-layer perception (MLP), and a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based hybrid trainable learning framework to unfold the proposed two-stage LAS algorithm by directly learning the soft output from the received equalized signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage soft-output LAS detector precisely computes the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and provides better performance than the conventional LAS detector. Alternatively, the proposed Deep LAS efficiently estimates the LLR values by achieving a performance gain of 2.55 dB and 3 dB compared to the conventional LAS algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed Deep LAS outperforms the counterpart model-based and standalone data-driven learning schemes and provides a comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gap of 0.4 dB and 1.2 dB with the optimal soft output sphere decoding (SD) to achieve a BER of $ \text{10}^{-\text{5}}$ for 4-QAM and 16-QAM, respectively.},

In this study, UAV base stations (UAV-BSs) consisting of position-known assisted UAVs (A-UAVs) and position-unknown assisted UAVs (U-UAVs) are employed to transmit data to MUs. Specifically, a bi-directional angle-aware beam tracking with adaptive beam reconstruction (BAB-AR) algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal beam that can quickly adapt the movement of the target MU. First, the angle-aware beam tracking is realized within the UAV-BSs using a proposed global dynamic crow search algorithm without historical trajectory. Furthermore, the Gaussian process regression model is trained by A-UAVs to predict the azimuth and elevation angles of MUs. Meanwhile, we focus on the beam width and design a time interval adjustment mechanism for adaptive beam reconstruction to track high-speed MUs. Finally, the performance of the BAB-AR algorithm is compared with that of benchmark algorithms, and simulate results verifies that the BAB-AR algorithm can construct an accurate beam capable of covering high-speed MUs with the half power beam width in a timely manner.},

In addition, by deploying communication and sensing equipment and supporting efficient resource sharing of communication and sensing technologies, UAVs are expected to act as high-performance aerial platforms which integrate communication and sensing technologies. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV-enabled joint communication and sensing scenario is examined by jointly considering the flight energy of the UAV, multi-antenna transmissions, and the user service requirements. Two optimization problems are respectively formulated for various UAV states. In particular, the problem of communication precoding and UAV flight trajectory optimization is formulated as a minimum user rate maximization problem and the joint optimization problem of UAV sensing position, communication and sensing precoding is formulated as a minimum target detection probability maximization problem. Since the minimum-rate maximization problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to solve directly, we decompose the original optimization problem into a communication precoding design subproblem and a UAV trajectory design subproblem, and solve the two subproblems successively by applying an alternate iteration method. Specifically, a zero forcing (ZF) algorithm is put forward for solving the communication precoding design subproblem. A successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is applied to determine the optimal trajectory of the UAV. Based on the optimal trajectory of the UAV, the sensing position optimization problem is modeled as a weighted distance minimization problem, and then a heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal positions. Finally, a ZF algorithm-based joint communication and sensing precoding is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a candidate technology in future wireless communications for their appealing advantages in controlling the direction of the beam. In addition, as a new paradigm to realize large-scale antenna arrays with reduced cost and power consumption, dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) have great potential to be deployed at the base station (BS) as a low-cost alternative for conventional array antennas. For the best mutual benefit of RIS and DMA technologies, we amalgamate them to investigate the hybrid RIS and DMA assisted MIMO interfering broadcast channel with high communication sum-rate at low implementation cost, wherein a DMA-based BS communicates with multiple multi-antenna users via the assistance of RIS. Due to the physical implementation of RIS and DMA, conventional MIMO interfering broadcast channel models are no longer valid. Focusing on the weighted sum-rate performance of the system with additional interference-plus-noise among users, we propose an efficient mechanism to jointly design the transmit precoding matrices at the BS, the phase shift matrix at the RIS, and the weight matrix at the DMA. By transforming the original weighted sum-rate maximization problem to a solvable one, we propose an alternating algorithm where the three optimization variables are all obtained in closed-form expressions. Simulation results verify the superior weighted sum-rate performance of the proposed algorithms. We also find that under the considered framework the performance loss brought by the mutual coupling in the DMA is negligible compared to the conventional array antennas.},

In the proposed problem formulation, a visible light communication (VLC) receiver collects signals from a number of light emitting diode (LED) transmitters via line-of-sight (LOS) paths and/or via reflections from IRSs. We derive the Cramér--Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for generic three-dimensional positioning in the presence of IRSs with arbitrary configurations. In addition, we consider the problem of optimizing the orientations of IRSs when line-of-sight (LOS) paths are blocked, and propose an optimal adjustment approach for maximizing the received powers from IRSs based on analytic expressions, which can be solved in closed form or numerically. Since the optimal IRS orientations depend on the actual position of the VLC receiver, an N-step localization algorithm is proposed to perform adjustment of IRS orientations in the absence of any prior knowledge about the position of the VLC receiver. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via simulations and compared against the CRLB. It is deduced that although IRSs do no provide critical improvements in positioning accuracy in the presence of LOS signals from a sufficient number of LED transmitters, they can be very important in achieving accurate positioning when all or most of LOS paths are blocked.},

  abstract     = {The air and ground cooperative mobile edge computing (MEC) network provides a new paradigm for the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), which enhances the coverage of the terrestrial base station (TBS) and deploys computing resources near IoT devices. In this paper, we construct a UAV-assisted MEC system for IoT networks and design a data processing procedure. The UAV collects data from devices as a relay and makes decisions to offload some tasks to the central server connected with the TBS, while the onboard edge server in the UAV can perform local computing. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the device association, UAV&#39;s trajectories, task offloading, and resource allocation to reduce the energy consumption of the entire system. To solve this problem, we decompose it into three tractable sub-problems and use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize each set of control variables. Among them, device association is formulated as a linear programming problem, while UAV&#39;s trajectory optimization is transformed into a convex problem by introducing slack variables and using successive convex approximation (SCA). The offloading and resource assignment problem is proved to be convex via theoretical analysis and problem transformation. In addition, we derive the optimal relationship between computation duration and computing energy, which greatly reduces the complexity of problems. Simulation results show that the designed system and the algorithms can significantly reduce the total energy consumption, and the offloading strategies have a decisive impact on computation energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks, the continuous trajectory designs generally suffer from infinite variable number and inherent trajectory continuity. In this paper, we aim at addressing the trajectory continuity and achieving globally optimal joint continuous trajectory and resource allocation design. We consider a UAV-assisted wireless network serving a ground deployed user and focus on the energy-constrained communication. Taking the practical power control capability into account, we target at maximizing the overall throughput via joint power control and UAV trajectory design. However, the practically discrete choices for power control have lead the problem highly intractable. We start with the ideal power control case and via dual analysis characterize the optimal power control as function of a dual variable and UAV position, such that the dual function can be transformed to pure trajectory design problems. Inspired by a novel mechanical equivalence idea, we convert pure trajectory designs into a series of equivalent mechanical rope equilibrium problems with adaptively defined potential field, which can be solved optimally via physical principles. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is proposed for obtaining the optimal dual solution, from which the optimal joint solution is recovered in a closed form. Afterwards, the proposed design methodology is extended into scenario with practical discrete power control and corresponding optimal joint design is eventually achieved. Finally, compared with benchmark, the optimality and low design complexity in our obtained closed-form solution are verified via numerical results. The necessity of considering practical discrete power control is also highlighted.},

In the context of constantly changing task requirements caused by dynamic environments of IoV, lifelong model update is essential to maintain high-quality inference performance. Given the mismatch between the resource demanding update process and limited system resource, it is critical to strike a balance between update quality and the update frequency. In this paper, we propose a performance metric called Age of Model (AoM) to characterize the inference performance degradation of AI models under dynamic task requirements. We derive the closed-form expressions of AoM at both edge tier and cloud tier, where various queues are exploited to abstract the model update process with single server or multiple servers. The obtained analytical framework describes the dependency among update request frequency, computing rate and training data diversity, which can serve as performance metric for system optimization.

However, its performance crucially depends on well-designed multi-dimensional codebooks. In this paper, we propose a novel progressive codebook optimization scheme that can achieve near-optimal performance over downlink fading channels. By examining the pair-wise error probability (PEP), we first derive the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the sparse codebook in downlink channels, which is considered as the design criterion for codebook optimization. Then, the benchmark constellation group at a single resource element is optimized with a sequential quadratic programming approach. Next, we propose a constellation group reconstruction process to assign the sub-constellations in each resource element (RE) progressively. For the current RE, the assignment of the sub-constellations is designed by minimizing the error performance of the product distance of the superimposed codewords in previous REs. The design process involves both permutation and labeling of the sub-constellations in the benchmark constellation group. Simulation results show that the proposed codebooks exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art codebooks in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region over various downlink fading channels.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of spectral and energy efficiency (EE) of cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO)-aided URLLC system with short blocklength communications. The conventional finite blocklength coding rate is commonly used in URLLC regime, while it is only applicable to moderate-to-long blocklength regime, typically greater than 200. To overcome this issue, we first derive the novel error probability and achievable rate that provide more accurate performance characterization by considering the effect of short blocklength transmission, mathematically expressed by the third-order term, and then derive the asymptotic spectral efficiency (SE) with a scalable power allocation scheme. A significant challenge in deploying CF mMIMO for URLLC is managing the heightened energy consumption while meeting the rigorous latency and reliability requirements, thus the EE based on the realistic power consumption model is analyzed, which can be used to depict the influences of both URLLC targets and system parameters. Simulation results show the asymptotic behaviors of the derived results, and quantify the impact of the URLLC targets, system parameters, and network architecture on the SE-EE trade-off. It is confirmed that there exists performance gap between the derived results and the conventional ones under short blocklength communications, and the overestimated SE and EE can be observed if conventional results were used. Moreover, under short blocklength regime, the EE degrades drastically as the latency constraint decreases uniformly. Finally, the cell-free architecture can better support URLLC traffic compared to the co-located one but at the price of higher power costs.},

  abstract     = {The dramatic increment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become a challenging problem in wireless communications. The IoT devices have the characteristic of sporadic transmission, which causes severe signaling overhead and latency problems for the grant-based multiple access systems. To solve this problem, grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA), with user equipments directly performing uplink transmission to the base station, has emerged as a promising solution. Without pre-allocating the resources, the active user detection (AUD) is required in GF-NOMA, and the massive number of devices operated under limited frequency resources makes the AUD problem challenging. Inspired by the interference cancellation framework, we propose a novel model-based deep learning (DL) architecture, called active user detection-interference cancellation neural network (AUD-ICNN), to address the AUD problem under the frequency selective fading channel, without needing the channel state information (CSI) and the user sparsity information. Specifically, the proposed AUD-ICNN exploits the signal structure to estimate the activation probability and then cancel the interference according to the estimated activation probability. Simulation results show that the proposed AUD-ICNN outperforms the conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms and significantly reduces the error rate compared to the state-of-the-art DL architectures. Meanwhile, the complexity is reduced by 6.9 and 13.9 times compared to the state-of-the-art DL and CS methods, respectively. Furthermore, unlike the existing DL-based architectures, the proposed AUD-ICNN uses a single neural network to deal with different user sparsity. Finally, a transfer learning method is proposed to extend the proposed AUD-ICNN to a robust sparsity estimation neural network.},

In this paper, the performance of OTSM is explored by considering the joint effects of multiple hardware impairments (HWIs) such as in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI), direct current offset (DCO), phase noise, power amplifier non-linearity, carrier frequency offset, and synchronization timing offset for the first time in the area. First, the discrete-time baseband signal model is obtained in vector form under all mentioned HWIs. Second, the system input-output relations are derived in time, delay-time, and delay-sequency (DS) domains in which the parameters of all mentioned HWIs are incorporated. Third, analytical expressions are derived for the pairwise and average bit error probability under imperfect channel state information (CSI) as a function of the parameters of all mentioned HWIs. Analytical results demonstrate that under all mentioned HWIs, noise stays additive white Gaussian, effective channel matrix is sparse, DCO appears as a DC signal at the receiver interfering with only the zero sequency, and IQI redounds to self-conjugated sequency interference in the DS domain. Simulation results reveal the fact that by considering the joint effects of all mentioned HWIs and imperfect CSI not only OTSM outperforms OFDM by 29% in terms of energy of bit per noise but it performs same as OTFS in high mobility DSCs.},

More specifically, a subset of full pilot sequence is activated based on the legitimate channels at the legitimate transmitter, and the full channel coefficients are estimated from the received pilot symbol subset at the legitimate receiver with the aid of our channel interpolation. Additionally, despite the non-reciprocal channel due to the presence of a Doppler shift and an additive noise, our scheme achieves high SKG reliability in comparison to that without our reduced pilot selection or channel interpolation.

To optimize the power distribution constraints and coordination of the hybrid precoding structure, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed, which operates in a distributive manner.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secure transmission problem in a cache-aided relaying network, where we assume that the source sends data to the destination via multiple cache-aided relays and the communication from the relays to the destination is wiretapped by an eavesdropper. Unlike the ideal assumption of Gaussian input signals, this paper considers practical finite-alphabet inputs, such as phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Our objective is to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by optimizing the beamforming vectors and power control at the source and relays as well as caching coefficient under constraints of transmit power, quality of service, and network congestion. For the formulated nonconvex multi-variable problem, we use the M/G/1 queueing theory to analyze the network congestion performance and reveal that the congestion decreases with increasing caching coefficient and increasing source-to-relay link rate but increases with increasing relay-to-destination link rate. Then, it is shown that the formulated problem can be solved by dividing it into two optimization subproblems. Subsequently, an auxiliary-variable based alternating optimization (AVAO) framework is developed, where the beamforming at each relay is designed by introducing the Moreau-Yosida regularization (MYR) technique and rank-one decomposition procedure (RDP) and the corresponding power control is derived by applying the optimality condition. Also, the complexity and convergence of the proposed framework are analyzed. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed framework. Specifically, the algorithm based on finite-alphabet inputs proposed in this paper exhibits superior performance compared with the algorithm based on Gaussian inputs. Moreover, the secrecy rate increases with the congestion probability tolerance, the caching coefficient threshold, and the number of relays.},

  abstract     = {Passive tags in bistatic backscatter networks have a myriad of industry applications. However, due to insufficient energy harvesting (EH), tags have poor communication ranges, activation distances, and data rates. To overcome these challenges, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance the incident radio frequency power at the tag. We consider linear and non-linear EH models and analyze single-tag and multi-tag scenarios. For single-tag networks, we optimize the RIS phase shifts to maximize the incident power at the tag and the signal-to-noise ratio of the reader. Key metrics, such as received power, harvested power, achievable rate, outage probability, bit error rate, and diversity order, are also derived. The impact of RIS phase shift quantization errors is also studied. For the multi-tag case, an algorithm to compute the optimal RIS phase shifts is developed. Numerical results and simulations demonstrate significant improvements compared to the benchmarks of no-RIS case and random RIS-phase design. For instance, our optimal design with a 200-element RIS increases the activation distance of tags by 270% and 55% compared to those benchmarks.

  abstract     = {An unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) is exploited for securely collecting sensing data from massively deployed batteryless devices on the ground. Specifically, signals emitted by the UAV have the following functions: jamming hostile wardens (HWs) and powering legitimate devices (LDs). The transmit power of both the LDs and the UAV as well as the UAV&#39;s flying trajectory are jointly optimised for maximising the uplink throughput of data collection, while ensuring that the uplink transmissions of LDs to the UAV cannot be detected by HWs. The formulated optimisation problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity. Therefore, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimisation (AO) is proposed for obtaining a near-optimal solution. In our design, the UAV does not need the exact locations of the HWs, while it is robust to the optimal cooperative detection among the HWs with a greedy scheduling (GS) based algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that the uplink-throughput can be substantially improved by our joint design.},

Considering the energy causality constraint and the decoding error in the process of successive interference cancellation (SIC), we derive the expressions for PT&#39;s outage probability and BT&#39;s average block error rate (BLER). The analytical results show that the fixed SIC decoding scheme considered at IR may lead to a poor performance for both the outage probability and the average BLER.

Computer simulations verify our derivations, confirm the superior performance of the improved SIC decoding scheme compared to the fixed one, and provide insights into the influences of different parameters (e.g., PT&#39;s transmission power, BT&#39;s power reflection coefficient, power allocation of the relay node) on the achievable outage probability and average BLER.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel relay-based mixed free space optical-radio frequency (FSO-RF) communication system utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to assist two users over RF-hop. Assuming non-availability of direct FSO-link, we consider the deployment of an optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS). Moreover, we deploy an RF intelligent reflecting surface (RIRS) in the vicinity of far user to improve its performance. We adopt simultaneous lightwave-information and power transfer (SLIPT) technology to harvest energy at relay node, which is utilized to forward the information signal over RF-hop and thus, makes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of RF-hop dependent on the FSO-channel coefficients. For the proposed system with generalized Malaga ( $\mathcal {M}$ )-distributed FSO-link with pointing error and Nakagami- $m$ faded RF-link, we evaluate the system&#39;s performance in terms of outage probability (OP), coverage probability (CP), and throughput (TP). We also derive asymptotic outage at high SNR and obtain diversity order analytically. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm for designing of reflection coefficients of RIRS elements to maximize the downlink SNR of far user. Numerical results are provided to see the impact of system and channel parameters including imperfect SIC conditions, imperfect CSI of far-user channel, and power allocation coefficients on system&#39;s performance. Simulations are given to show the extension of the proposed system to multiple user scenario. The integration of OIRS and RIRS exhibits significant improvement in the performance of the considered NOMA-based system.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide wireless data access for ground users (GUs) in various applications. In the scenario where GUs are far away from the gateway, both the access and backhaul links in UAV networks significantly affect the system performance. In this paper, we study the UAV deployment problem in an integrated access and backhaul network (IABN), where a number of UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations (ABSs) and aerial relays (ARs) to forward GUs $^\prime$ data packets to the remote gateway via multi-hop transmissions. Aiming at minimizing the system cost, which is defined as the weighted sum of UAV deployment cost and the energy consumption required for data transmission, a constrained system cost minimization problem is formulated, where the joint UAV deployment, GU association, route selection and resource allocation strategy is optimized. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an alternative iteration method, which includes two subalgorithms. For the first subalgorithm, we focus on the optimal design of the access links and propose a joint ABS deployment and resource allocation algorithm. Specifically, a modified K-means based clustering scheme is proposed to determine ABS deployment and GU association strategy, then an iterative Lagrange-based power allocation strategy and a greedy Kuhn-Munkras algorithm-based subchannel assignment strategy are presented, respectively. Given the obtained ABS deployment strategy, for the second subalgorithm, we then design a joint AR deployment, route selection and power allocation scheme for the backhaul links and propose a minimum circle algorithm-based AR deployment and route selection strategy. Finally, the suboptimal solution is obtained by alternatively handling the two subalgorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV deployment algorithm can achieve a 19% performance gain over the existing scheme when the packet size is $6\times 10^{6}$ bits and system bandwidth is $0.5\times 10^{6}$ Hz.},

  abstract     = {We consider a transmitter that encodes data packets using network coding and broadcasts coded packets. A receiver employing network decoding recovers the data packets if a sufficient number of error-free coded packets are gathered. The receiver does not abandon its efforts to recover the data packets if network decoding is unsuccessful; instead, it employs syndrome decoding (SD) in an effort to repair erroneous received coded packets, and then reattempts network decoding. Most decoding techniques, including SD, assume that errors are independently and identically distributed within received coded packets. Motivated by the guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) framework, we propose transversal GRAND (T-GRAND): an algorithm that exploits statistical dependence in the occurrence of errors, complements network decoding and recovers all data packets with a higher probability than SD. T-GRAND examines error vectors in order of their likelihood of occurring and altering the transmitted packets. Calculation and sorting of the likelihood values of all error vectors is a simple but computationally expensive process. To reduce the complexity of T-GRAND, we take advantage of the properties of the likelihood function and develop an efficient method, which identifies the most likely error vectors without computing and ordering all likelihood values.},

The beamforming of the signal and that of AN and the phase shift matrix of IRS are jointly optimized to promote the secrecy outage transmission rate under the constraint of secrecy outage probability. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, a slack variable is introduced and the problem is transformed into a two-layer optimization problem. The first layer of the optimization is to find the optimal slack variable and the second layer is to find the optimal beamforming and phase shift under a given value of the slack variable. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation.

To address the challenge of achieving high EE while considering the URLLC-mandated finite blocklength achievable rate, we formulate a joint power control and user association problem. We introduce a convex lower bound for the intractable achievable rate using successive convex approximation (SCA), enabling us to reformulate the original problem as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem.

Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal performance compared to BnB and outperform the conventional CF mMIMO approach, which assumes equal power allocation and coherent transmission.

To facilitate real-world implementation, this paper tailors a market-based mechanism to incentivize EVs to provide frequency regulation services. Firstly, a detailed EV charging model considering the battery equivalent circuit and AC-DC conversion loss is proposed. The nonconvexities are approximated and convexified with accuracy guarantee. Then, based on the self-interest behavior of EVs, a non-cooperative game is adopted to model the competition in providing frequency regulation service. The aggregative game is used to approximate the original non-cooperative game. Thereby, the existence, uniqueness, and approximation accuracy of the aggregative equilibrium is theoretically proved. Moreover, the rolling look-ahead iterative frequency regulation service clearing mechanism for EV parking lot is designed based on the decentralized equilibrium searching algorithm of the aggregative game. Finally, the effectiveness, computational efficiency, and approximation accuracy of the proposed market-based mechanism are validated by a series of numerical tests with EV populations at 50, 100, 200, 300, 600, and 900.},

However, it is found that the coupling effect can cause unstable levitation problems during long-term operations. Hence, to solve the coupling problem of the two levitation units, a cooperative levitation controller based on the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman incorporated multi-agent reinforcement learning (HJB–MADRL) is proposed. The MADRL is adopted for the two-point levitation control considering the coupling effect between the two levitation units. To improve the training of the value network in the MADRL, the HJB function is used to evaluate the optimality of the value function. The proposed algorithm shows an improved performance compared to the original MADRL algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative controller using the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with a conventional proportional-integral-derivatve (PID) controller and a model-guided controller. The robustness of the HJB–MADRL controller is examined in the presence of pitch motion, change in train load, disturbance force, and track irregularity.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel vehicle sideslip angle estimator, which uses the physical knowledge from an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based on a non-linear single-track vehicle model to enhance the estimation accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model-based and data-driven approaches interact mutually, and both use the standard inertial measurement unit and the tyre forces measured by load sensing technology. CNN benefits from the UKF the capacity to leverage the laws of physics. Concurrently, the UKF uses the CNN outputs as sideslip angle pseudo-measurement and adaptive process noise parameters. The back-propagation through time algorithm is applied end-to-end to the CNN and the UKF to employ the mutualistic property. Using a large-scale experimental dataset of 216 manoeuvres containing a great diversity of vehicle behaviours, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of the proposed architecture over the current state-of-art hybrid approach combined with model-based and data-driven techniques. In the case that a limited dataset is provided for the training phase, the proposed hybrid approach still guarantees estimation robustness.},

  abstract     = {As the unique power-discharging channel for high-speed trains, the ‘train-rail’ mobile coupling grounding system plays a vital role in sending the traction power back to the terrestrial substations, through the electrical contact between the rotating wheel and the steel rail. The whole system is composed of two kinds of grounding modes: working grounding is in charge of draining the traction power into the rail track; the protective grounding provides the reference grounding potential for the vehicle-mounted equipment. Different from the fixed terrestrial grounding technique normally implemented in power system, when the relative motion occurs between the train and the rail, both the ‘catenary-to-train’ and ‘train-to-ground’ impedances vary transiently, which may lead to the current flowing through each grounding wheel varying unpredictably. Herein, the ‘catenary-train-rail’ mobile coupling grounding model was built based on the equivalent circuit modeling technique for evaluating the transiently-varying tendency of the grounding impedances and currents flowing through each grounding wheel. To cope with different operational conditions, the adjustable grounding impedance methodology is firstly proposed for adapting the unpredictable variation of the grounding impedance, when the relative motion occurs between the train and the rail. Ultimately, the validity of the novel grounding system applying the adjustable grounding impedance technology is verified under different operational conditions, with the consideration of both TB current and voltage.},

Primarily, a full-order state observer is modeled to estimate the immeasurable states of the system. Based upon this observer design, a fault-tolerant controller is well-established to confront the partial loss and to adopt the actuator fault inevitably. Subsequently, a proper METS is proffered to mitigate the frequent packet transmission in the network channel. In contrary with the conventional event-triggered scheme (ETS), the prescribed METS can produce some newest triggering events by utilizing the current released packets. Thereby, the event generator can make more precise determinations, resulting in an improved control performance. Notably, the cyber-attack phenomenon is described by the Bernoulli distributed stochastic variable. By engaging Lyapunov function and integral inequality technique, sufficient condition in the structure of linear matrix inequality (LMI) assure the asymptotic mean-square finite-time boundedness (AMFTB) of the half-car active suspension model with a prescribed $H_\infty$ performance attenuation. Moreover, the controller and observer gain matrices are stipulated from the attained LMI conditions.

The operation on the primary side facilitates zero-voltage switching (ZVS), reducing switching loss significantly. Additionally, it mitigates voltage ringing effects induced by the transformer leakage inductance to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). Furthermore, inspired by the popular double step-down (DSD) converter topology, the proposed IHB converter adopts a series-capacitor current doubler rectifier on the secondary side, achieving phase current balancing and minimizing DC offset in transformer magnetizing current. An experimental prototype of the converter was implemented using PCB planar transformer. Accommodating an input voltage ranging from 24 V to 60 V, it achieves an extreme voltage step-down conversion to 1 V with a peak efficiency of 92.7%. It delivers a maximum load current of 30 A, achieving a box power density of 52 W/in 3 . Compared to the conventional symmetrical IHB converter with the same design specifications, this converter improves power efficiency by 4.5% at a light load of 5 A. It reduces peak EMI by 9 dB at the switching frequency of 500 kHz and by 7.1 dB at the resonant frequency of 16 MHz.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to developments in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, 5G communication networks, and more. However, the connection between the in-vehicle network (IVN) and external network exposes vehicles to potential intrusion risks. In particular, the controller area network (CAN) protocol, a typical IVN responsible for electronic control unit cooperation, lacks defense mechanisms like encryption or authentication, further making vehicles vulnerable to intrusion. Therefore, many scholars propose countermeasures to address the weakness of CAN, namely message authentication and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Given that the former may occupy extra bandwidth and computational resources, we prioritize IDS in this paper. Thus, we propose a generative adversarial network assisted contextual pattern-aware IDS (GPIDS) against several typical vehicle attacks, including bus-off, spoofing, masquerade, replay, fuzzy, and same origin method execution (SOME). The SOME attack stems from the Internet of Things field and possesses high disguise property, which can mimic physical features as normal messages in IVN, like clock skew, traffic, voltage, and so on. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present an IDS capable of effectively addressing SOME attacks. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four real vehicles, demonstrating that GPIDS can accurately detect the aforementioned attacks with low latency.},

Firstly, the major influencing factors of communication delay are analyzed as the mean and standard deviation of probability distributions. Gaussian distribution is used to describe the probability distribution of communication delays. Markov chains are used to describe the probability distributions of delayed state shifts to calculate the probability distributions of associated vehicle trajectories. Secondly, the corridor expansion is performed based on the maximum probability trajectory of the associated vehicles. Therefore, the trajectory planning is constructed based on the corridor expansion of associated vehicles. Improved constraints and objective functions are defined, and experiments are conducted using the quintic polynomial of the Frenet frame. The results showed that the best stability is achieved when the trajectory planning duration is 6.0 s. Meanwhile, the stability of the model is better in all cases when the trajectory frequency is between 0.2 s and 0.5 s. By comparing and analyzing the model in this paper, the traditional human trajectory planning model and the state sampling trajectory planning model, it is found that the model in this paper is the best choice in terms of stability, safety and accuracy.},

Firstly, a multi-body dynamics model of an EMS-type maglev vehicle with a fractional-order PID control system is developed. To fulfill the multi-objective requirements and optimize the fractional order parameters, an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed. The Sperling index and the magnitude of the vertical suspension gap variation are employed as the optimization objectives. Then, the aforementioned multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied to the constructed multi-body dynamics model to perform multi-objective optimization of the control parameters. Finally, the Pareto front solution is calculated and the optimal control parameters are obtained. The results demonstrate that the optimized control parameters can significantly reduce the vertical suspension gap and Sperling index during operation, with the reduction in the vertical suspension gap amplitude and its standard deviation being 10∼73%, and the reduction in the Sperling index being 8∼13%.},

Specifically, we develop an end-to-end multi-task model with a unified and streamlined segmentation structure.

This eliminates the need for customizations and enhances the model&#39;s generalization capabilities.

We achieve competitive results on the BDD100 k dataset, particularly in visualization outcomes. The performance results show a mAP50 of 81.1% for object detection, a mIoU of 91.0% for drivable area segmentation, and an IoU of 28.8% for lane line segmentation.

However, the existing single navigation source of vehicles makes it difficult to realize real-time and high-precision positioning in different scenarios. The current multi-source information fusion methods have the problems of low generalization ability, poor expansibility, and high computational complexity, so it is challenging to apply in the field of vehicle positioning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a vehicle heterogeneous multi-source information fusion positioning method (MIFP) based on information probability, which converts the multiple heterogeneous navigation sources into information probability models to realize the unification of the time-frequency parameter format and designs an information fusion algorithm to realize the rapid fusion based on the theory of relative entropy. Through simulation tests and experimental verification by comparing with mainstream information fusion methods, such as the UKF method, the FGA method, and the NNA method, the MIFP method has high positioning accuracy and strong real-time performance. It can effectively solve the problems of weak expansion ability and large calculation amounts of current vehicle fusion positioning models. In the case of interference or mutation, the MIFP method can also suppress the influence of sudden errors on vehicle positioning.},

By the distributed ledger, the cold-chain logistics data cannot be tampered with as the cost of tampering with the transaction is incalculable. Then, to protect privacy security, a linkable ring verification model has been introduced, and a linkable ring signature (LRS) scheme has been proposed to guarantee the verifiability and traceability of transactions in the IoV-powered BCCL system. This LRS can enable the traceability of all transaction records for the same cold-chain product. Moreover, the security proof shows that this LRS can capture the anonymity, unforgeability, and linkability. The comparisons of key size and time costs show that this LRS is also efficient. In addition, the transaction performance evaluations show that the linkable ring verification model can support secure and efficient data-sharing transactions through the IoV-powered BCCL system.},

  abstract     = {Road condition monitoring schemes allow a severe reduction of traffic queues and drastically improve road safety. In these schemes, authorized vehicles communicate the current road condition via a Road Side Unit (RSU) or fog node. The reaction time for these schemes greatly improves in case the RSUs are capable of locally determining the validity of the messages and if relatively low-cost cryptographic operations are involved to ensure the required security features like confidentiality, mutual authentication, anonymity, untraceability, etc. The current literature on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not cover all these mentioned issues profoundly. We show that a recently outperforming scheme called the V2F authentication scheme (VFAS) suffers from several severe issues like no protection against impersonation, traceability, perfect forward secrecy, and ephemeral leakage attacks, no possibility to revoke certificates, scalability problems, and being vulnerable for a semi-trusted third party. We propose an improved scheme, called iVFAS, to address all the required security features and which has better computational, communication, storage and energy consumption performance with respect to most of the related literature, including VFAS. In addition to this, we also evaluated performance under unknown attacks and practical implementation using NS3. Moreover, this new scheme also includes a variant of the Elliptic Curve Qu Vanstone (ECQV) certificate scheme in the registration phase, which is resistant to the extended Canetti–Krawczy adversary model.},

However, existing collaborative perception methods tend to focus solely on the spatial features of semantic information, while neglecting the importance of the temporal dimension. Consequently, the potential benefits of collaboration remain underutilized. In this article, we propose Select2Col, a novel collaborative perception framework that takes into account the s patial-t e mpora l importanc e of semanti c informa t ion. Within the Select2Col, we develop a collaborator selection method that utilizes a lightweight graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the importance of semantic information (IoSI) of each collaborator in enhancing perception performance, thereby identifying contributive collaborators while excluding those that potentially bring negative impact. Moreover, we present a semantic information fusion algorithm called HPHA (historical prior hybrid attention), which integrates multi-scale attention and short-term attention modules to capture the IoSI in feature representation from the spatial and temporal dimensions respectively, and assigns IoSI-consistent weights for efficient fusion of information from selected collaborators. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate that our proposed Select2Col significantly improves the perception performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

This paper studies a two-tier trajectory optimization problem for mixed platooning to improve fuel efficiency, ride comfort, and operational safety during vehicle operations. The proposed model follows a two-tier control logic to plan the trajectory of platooning vehicles with three objectives, including minimizing fuel consumption, maximizing ride comfort, and enhancing the anti-disturbance performance of the platoon. The first is the planning tier, which aims to design the optimal trajectory for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) based on the optimal fuel consumption and comfort and obtain the expected acceleration curve of CAV. The second is the control tier, which aims to ensure the safe operation of platooning vehicles in the presence of uncertain disturbances in real time. Specifically, we propose a robust tube MPC control method, which dynamically adjusts the CAV acceleration according to the reference trajectory obtained by the planning tier to resist the effects of uncertain disturbances, and the tracking behaviour of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) is offline solved by the robust optimal velocity model. Finally, we design simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-tier optimization framework. The experimental results show the effectiveness and advantages of the two-tier framework in terms of fuel economy, ride comfort, and robustness against different noise disturbances.},

  abstract     = {The tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is critical to the control of assisted and autonomous vehicles. However, direct measurement of TRFC by existing sensors is impossible. In this paper, we aim to develop a scheme to estimate TRFC based on the mathematical model and measurable vehicle states. To address this issue, we first develop a vehicle dynamics model and a wheel rotation dynamics model. Based on the two models, we propose two robust proportional multiple-integral (PMI) observers for the longitudinal and lateral tire-force estimation. To reduce the conservative of conventional $H_{\infty}$ observer, a novel optimization problem is formulated and solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the observer gain. Next, an multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to estimate TRFC from the estimated tire forces, slip rate, and slip angle. However, based on data analysis, we find that the tire forces are not sensitive to the TRFC when the slip ratio and slip angle are relatively low, and these data frames would degrade the performance of MLP. To balance the performance and generalization ability of MLP, we determine the threshold for slip ratio and slip angle to exclude the insensitive data frames and train the MLP with the remaining data. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified under different scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method could estimate the TRFC more accurately than the traditional method. Furthermore, the proposed method has the advantage that its estimation does not depend on the initial states.},

Dynamic target tracking technology has wide application potential in fields such as maritime rescue, countering illegal fishing, border and coastal defense. These tasks always necessitate the USVs intercepting the target with a specified Line-of-Sight (LOS) angle. In the majority of existing moving target tracking methodologies, the constraints associated with the terminal LOS angle have not been comprehensively studied. Addressing these issues, a target tracking guidance, constrained by the terminal LOS angle, is presented to guide the defender USVs in tracking a moving target in a specific direction. In the context of the general target tracking problem, the definitions of tracking errors have been precisely explained within the inertial frame. Then, the relative acceleration is derived by employing the back-stepping and mathematical induction. The course control strategy, formulated by incorporating both the relative distance and terminal LOS angle into the relative acceleration, has been developed in the horizontal plane. Distinct from existing approaches that employ switching logics to satisfy distance and angle constraints, our proposed guidance integrates angle constraints and target tracking into a unified framework, resulting in enhanced accuracy and robustness in dynamic tracking scenarios. The results of the simulations indicate that the proposed method can successfully restrain the terminal LOS angle as the relative distances decrease. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified via experimental results.},

By combining the actor-critic RL algorithm with adaptive backstepping technique, a novel RLAO control framework is established for each follower to stabilize the tracking errors and optimize the control performance. The proposed RLAO controller does not depend on the exact topological matrix and vehicle dynamics, as only the input and output data from the tracking error dynamics are involved in updating the control input. Based on the optimal control and dynamic programming, a useful algorithm is proposed to implement the RLAO controller such that all the error signals of the platoon control system are ultimately uniformly bounded. Particularly, the tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood of zero by setting appropriate parameters. Furthermore, the platoon disturbance string stability is guaranteed. A comparative analysis based on simulation examples is discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLAO controller.},

Additionally, an adaptive formation maintaining and transformation strategy is presented for UAV swarm to comply with the environment with narrow passages.

In this paper, based on vehicle dynamics model, a novel approach of cleverly introducing the velocity-related safe distance into the artificial potential field function is proposed. The improved traffic environment potential field is then combined with model predictive control (MPC), and lateral stability constraints such as lateral load transfer rate are added to the MPC when solving for the control quantity. We name this method AutoPField-MPC, and it offers the following advantages: First, it allows AVs to automatically adjust the distance from other obstacles in more complex scenarios, while also dynamically influencing steering and braking time. Second, it reduces extensive parameter adjustment work when considering the safe distance. Third, the improved design of the potential field function in this paper makes the method more concise and universal. The simulation results from CarSim and Simulink demonstrate that the method presented in this paper can simultaneously achieve multiple active safety objectives, such as speed maintenance, self-adaptive distance adjustment, lane keeping, lateral stability, emergency braking, and emergency steering, with good real-time performance. As a result, it can effectively address the security issues of vehicles and pedestrians when AVs avoid obstacles in various complex scenarios, such as wet roads, multi-obstacle vehicles, and emergency obstacle avoidance.},

CAVs achieve their objectives by employing wireless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to establish connections with vehicles within the same network and roadside units. However, it has been observed that certain vehicles violate network constraints by transmitting erroneous messages, resulting in abnormal behaviour. Consequently, there is a growing need for a system that can verify the accuracy of information broadcast by each vehicle regarding its vehicle coordinates (along with relevant data depending on the application) at designated frequencies and under authorized pseudo-identities. Addressing the limitations faced by prior generative AI model applications, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), this paper presents an unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) optimized for CAVs.

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning-based intelligent vehicle control systems have played an important role in real-time road conditions assessment applications. It relies primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for specific target retrieval, especially Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) technology, to provide support for road observations and environmental monitoring. Existing CC-ReID methods mainly focus on the invariant features of the front and rear views that are independent of clothing; among them, global color enhancement is a commonly used strategy. However, this method usually reduces the chromatism between the target foreground and background, which can easily lead to the loss of features unrelated to clothing and reduce the model&#39;s performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a data augmentation framework with Local Invariant Feature Transformation and Clothing Adversarial Parsing (LIFTCAP) for CC-ReID. The proposed framework is equipped with a Local Invariant Feature Transition (LIFT) module and a Clothes Adversarial Parsing (CAP) module. The former aims to extract invariant features for the same person with different clothes using the local transition manners. CAP is devoted to finding adversarial associations and parsing contour differences between clothing styles. Subsequently, a feature correlation strategy is alternately implemented between the two modules to complete the optimization procedure. Extensive experiments were conducted on the public CC-ReID datasets (LTCC and PRCC), demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method over the latest methods. Furthermore, our method achieved competitive performance, particularly on a surveillance video dataset (CCVID). In addition, based on the LIFTCAP strategy, the proposed algorithm can achieve a time efficiency as low as O(n) for detecting specific targets when deployed on a UAV server (Feisi X200) for real-time road conditions assessment and monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining an ever-growing popularity in the society as the green vehicles of the next future, i.e., vehicles independent of oil and not producing greenhouse gases. The modelling of these vehicles is made complex by their higher-order nature. Hence, reduction methods are more and more proposed in the literature. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first paper proposing to exploit both the rank exponent (RE)-based reduced order (RO) modeling of higher-order electric vehicle system (HOEVS) of order five, and the error minimization based reduction approach by employing the grey-wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The Markov parameters (MaPas) and time moments (TiMos) of HOEVS, and its ROEV model (ROEVM) are exploited for obtaining the desired ROEVM of order two. For error minimization, a weight associated objective function is framed by utilizing HOEVS&#39;s and ROEVM&#39;s MaPas and TiMos. The weight ascertainment is done based on transient and step responses of desired ROEVM with respect to HOEVS. The GWO algorithm is then employed to optimize the weighted objective function under defined constraints. Firstly, steady state matching constraint is employed to ensure that ROEVM accurately captures the steady state behavior of HOEVS. Secondly, the Hurwitz stability criterion is incorporated as a constraint to guarantee the stability of ROEVM. To validate the effectiveness of the presented approach, a comparative analysis with other reduction methods has been carried out, in terms of the step, impulse, Nichols, Bode, and error plots along with time domain specifications and error indices. The responses and tabulated data showcase the superiority of the proposed method, thus confirming the efficacy and efficiency of our approach in reducing the order of electric vehicle systems.},

  abstract     = {Lateral stability is a remarkably critical metric for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), and its loss is probable to cause a fatal accident. Various vehicular sensors, which play a key role in the lateral stability system, are coordinated to monitor the AGV&#39;s driving states. However, sensor attacks will inevitably push the AGV&#39;s lateral stability system into a insecure situation. In this paper, therefore, we investigate the security and insecurity conditions of the AGV under sensor attacks. Firstly, the dynamics output control protocol and the anomaly detector are developed in the lateral stability system. Then, we analyze the stealthiness of sensor attacks from the given detector&#39;s viewpoint. To describe how much the AGV is influenced by sensor attacks, we propose an equivalence condition associated with state variations. Besides, it is shown that internal states of the dynamics lateral controller are immune to stealthy sensor attacks. Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition about the insecurity of AGV, which also motivates us how to design parameters to ensure cyber-security. Finally, we give a simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented methodology. Specifically, we design a self-generated stealthy attack sequence, in which this sequence does not involve utilizing the system data in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) that aims to match vehicles across multiple different cameras with non-overlapping views has wide applications in cooperative vehicle infrastructure systems (CVIS), e.g., determining the identity of vehicle images captured by cameras respectively installed on intelligent vehicles (IVs) and roadside units (RSUs). A crucial challenge is to extract abundant and discriminative features from vehicle images without labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotation. In light of this, we propose a novel global-local self-distillation-based multi-branch network capable of learning effective feature representation. Specifically, we first present a partially shared backbone network that allows better flexibility for multi-branch feature learning. Then, we apply channel partition to generate multiple local feature maps as complementary to the global feature map. More importantly, we devise a novel global-local self-distillation method that can transfer knowledge in global feature map to local feature maps as supervision signals. Finally, we train the network by optimizing the loss functions accounting for vehicle Re-ID and self-distillation tasks jointly. Extensive experiments on two public vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate that our model achieves 83.5% mAP on VeRi-776 and 91.8% mAP on VehicleID without the assistance of extra detection or segmentation networks.},

  abstract     = {The Internet ofVehicles (IoV) is a crucial technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that integrates vehicles with the Internet and other entities. The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the Zero-X framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions.},

To deal with these challenges, we introduce a novel framework predicated on dynamic and socially-aware decision-making game theory to augment the social decision-making prowess of AVs in mixed driving environments. This comprehensive framework is delineated into three primary modules: Interaction Orientation Identification, Mixed-Strategy Game Modeling, and Expert Mode Learning. We introduce ’Interaction Orientation&#39; as a metric to evaluate the social decision-making tendencies of various agents, incorporating both environmental factors and trajectory characteristics. The mixed-strategy game model developed as part of this framework considers the evolution of future traffic scenarios and includes a utility function that balances safety, operational efficiency, and the unpredictability of environmental conditions. To adapt to real-world driving complexities, our framework utilizes a dynamic optimization framework for assimilating and learning from expert human driving strategies. These strategies are compiled into a comprehensive strategy library, serving as a reference for future decision-making processes. The proposed approach is validated through extensive driving datasets and human-in-loop driving experiments, and the results demonstrate marked enhancements in decision timing and precision.},

The impact of the delays becomes even more severe if the delay, network structure and formation are all time-varying, a common challenge faced by real-world multi-UAV systems. To address this challenge, we consider time-varying delays that exist in multiple channels caused by transmitting information and internal delays that exist in UAVs themselves caused by obtaining and processing their own data. We design an effective distributed formation control protocol for a multi-UAV system to achieve time-varying formation; this protocol is particularly useful for dealing with time-varying multi-UAV network topologies as well. We provide rigorous convergence analysis for different scenarios with or without hybrid delays and obtain sufficient conditions for achieving the time-varying formation. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for quantifying the maximum delay allowed by the system. Based on the designed formation algorithm, a deployment strategy is proposed to coordinate multi-UAV systems in a practical environment. Numerical analysis and UAV hardware experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the theoretical results and investigate the feasibility of generated flight trajectories.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution large-scale urban traffic speed estimation is vital for intelligent traffic management and urban planning. However, single-source data from commonly used sources like cameras, loop detectors, or onboard devices exhibit limitations due to uneven distribution and significant noise, especially in large-scale urban areas. Consequently, existing approaches relying on these single-source data often yield low-resolution and biased estimations. In this study, we take the first attempt to leverage mobile pedestrian data and car navigation data for multi-source fusion, proposing a model to achieve high-resolution urban traffic speed estimation in large-scale areas. The key questions are how to obtain and utilize relatively static roadside pedestrian crowd sensing data to characterize the speed of moving vehicles, and how to design multi-source heterogeneous data fusion framework to improve the overall estimation performance. Specifically, a meta-learning-based matrix decomposition algorithm is first proposed to impute the missing values adaptively considering history speed data. After obtaining the imputed data, we utilize the self-view speed aggregation algorithm learning from complete spatial information to correct the imputed values. Subsequently, a multi-view speed aggregation algorithm is proposed to fuse multi-source data for tracking actual road conditions which improves road coverage. We evaluated our model with real-world datasets collected from more than 500,000 smartphones in Wenzhou, China. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 7.48 $\%$ and 6.99 $\%$ in MAPE on missing data imputation and multi-source data fusion models, respectively.},

However, due to the lack of base stations (BSs), how to complete rescue while maintaining communication between vehicles is an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we design an efficient and fault-tolerant communication solution by jointly optimizing vehicles&#39; trajectory, offloading scheduling, and routing topology for a heterogeneous vehicle system. First, we model several essential factors in maritime SAR, including the impact of ocean currents, the observational behavior of UAVs, the fault tolerance of relay networks, resource management of mobile edge computing (MEC), and energy consumption. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, aiming at minimizing time and energy consumption while increasing the fault tolerance of relay networks. Then, we transfer the objective into a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and introduce multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to search for a collaborative strategy. Specifically, two MARL approaches with different training styles are evaluated, and three techniques are added for improving performance, including sharing parameters , normalized generalized-advantage-estimation (GAE), and preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets (Pop-Art). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach, named heterogeneous vehicles multi-agent proximal policy optimization (HVMAPPO), outperforms other baselines in efficiency and fault tolerance of communication.},

While most advanced LIO systems are designed for 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) SE(3), which are not ideally suited for ground vehicles, this paper investigates the performance of the vehicle-LiDAR-IMU system by considering the vehicle motion characteristics. The system combines IMU propagation, LiDAR measurements, ground surface measurements and 3 dimension (3D) vehicle kinematic model measurements within an iterated Kalman filter framework. To ensure a robust system bootstrapping, the temporal and spatial parameters of the vehicle-LiDAR-IMU system are calibrated first. Then, in addition to the IMU preintegration and LiDAR measurements, constraints are established between the ground surface and the vehicle pose by calculating the normal of the ground beneath the vehicle in the local point cloud map. Moreover, measurements of the 3D vehicle kinematic model with angular velocity and velocity constraints are adopted. Ground surface is considered in the 3D kinematic model for vehicle angular velocity calculation. The results from simulations and vehicle experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves accuracy compared with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods while maintaining a real-time implementation capability for vehicles.},

Specifically, we initially propose a discrete-time control model for multi-robot flocking that describes the inherent instability in the transmission of robot state information as a Bernoulli variable. Compared to existing controllers, this model requires less information exchange and is more practical for implementation in multi-robot systems. Subsequently, stability analysis is conducted for the controller, revealing that the MRS cannot achieve asymptotic flocking but can attain flocking in expectation when relevant stability conditions are satisfied. The stability conditions are deduced using the Lyapunov method, imposing constraints on the controller gains, the interaction period, and the successful transmission probability of communication links. Notably, the upper bound for the interaction period is significantly improved, thereby alleviating the communication network&#39;s burden. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed control model and the reliability of the derived stability conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the application of low altitude platform station (LAPS) and device-to-device (D2D) techniques in maritime emergency communications. The hovering LAPS acts as an aerial base station to provide emergency telecommunications services, and the D2D technique is used to improve spectrum utilization. To make full use of the advantages of LAPS-and-D2D enabled networks, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly considering the deployment optimization and resource management (DORM). The formulated problem is constrained by the reliability and minimum capacity requirements. To solve this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm (IOA) is designed. First, by using the graphical method, the closed-form solution of optimal power allocation is derived. Next, we transform the spectrum reuse problem into a min-cost max-flow problem, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is employed to solve it. Then, we present a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the LAPS deployment. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the proposed DORM scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in term of the sum rate. In addition, the convergence and performance gap of the designed IOA are demonstrated.},

Full-duplex (FD) systems, enabling simultaneous transmission and reception from a base station (BS), offer the theoretical advantage of doubled spectrum efficiency. However, the presence of strong self-interference (SI) in FD systems significantly degrades performance, which can be mitigated by leveraging the capabilities of RIS. In this work, we consider joint BS and RIS beamforming for maximizing the downlink (DL) transmission rate while guaranteeing uplink (UL) rate requirement. We propose an FD-RIS beamforming (FRIS) scheme by adopting penalty convex-concave programming. Simulation results demonstrate the UL/DL rate of the proposed FRIS scheme across different RIS deployments, RIS/BS configurations and rate requirements. FRIS has achieved the highest rate compared to the other approximation methods, conventional beamforming techniques, half-duplex (HD) systems, and deployment without RIS.},

  abstract     = {The advent of reusable rockets has heralded a new era in space exploration, reducing the costs of launching satellites by a significant factor. Traditional rockets were disposable, but the design of reusable rockets for repeated use has revolutionized the financial dynamics of space missions. The most critical phase of reusable rockets is the landing stage, which involves managing the tremendous speed and altitude for safe recovery. The complexity of this task presents new challenges for control systems, specifically in terms of precision and adaptability. Classical control systems like the model predictive control (MPC) controller lack the flexibility to adapt to dynamic system changes, making the re-design of the controller costly and time consuming. This paper explores the integration of quantum reinforcement learning into the control systems of reusable rockets as a promising alternative. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, quantum reinforcement learning uses quantum bits that can exist in superposition, allowing for more efficient information encoding and reducing the number of parameters required. This leads to increased computational efficiency, reduced memory requirements, and more stable and predictable performance. Due to the nature of reusable rockets, which must be light, heavy computers cannot fit into them. In the reusable rocket scenario, quantum reinforcement learning, which has reduced memory requirements due to fewer parameters, is a good solution.},

Considering the distinctive spherical wave propagation model in NFC, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, such as channel modelling and estimation as well as hybrid beamforming technologies, have recently undergone reevaluation and redesign. Concurrently, as the NFC range continues to broaden, ensuring physical layer security (PLS) has emerged as an equally urgent concern, necessitating immediate attention and resolution. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose a single-user (SU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) near-field directional modulation (NFDM) system toward secure transmissions at both angular and distance scales. Furthermore, considering the hardware cost associated with XL arrays, a fully analog secure precoding algorithm integrated beamforming with artificial noise (AN) as well as power allocation is devised under the modulus-1 constraint of the phase shifters. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed NFDM scheme is capable of guaranteeing security at both angular and distance scales compared with its conventional far-field counterpart.},

Many recent works in the literature have demonstrated the implementation of OFDM transmission from backscattering tags. A persistent shortcoming in such systems is the Bit Error Rate (BER) floor due to increased levels of Inter-Carrier Interference resulting from spectral spreading. In this letter, the authors employ unused subcarriers of the OFDM modulator to design an interference cancellation signal. The time domain signal is matched to the resolution of the impedance switching states of the tag. Significant suppression of the inter-carrier interference is possible with roughly equal numbers of used and unused subcarriers. Lower interference values result in lower BER floors. Furthermore, this technique allows the use of a larger number of data subcarriers than other existing techniques in the literature. The tag energy consumption per bit can therefore be reduced.},

More practically, in this article, we investigate a double-IRS aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with inevitable transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). Specifically, we aim to minimize the mean-square-error (MSE) of the downlink transmission by jointly optimizing the transceiver beamforming matrices and the IRS reflection coefficients. In order to achieve lower hardware overhead and signal processing complexity, we assume that the two IRSs share the common reflection coefficients, which usually leads to a more challenging MSE minimization problem due to the intractable quartic term. To tackle this intractability effectively, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. For the sake of low computational complexity, we also develop a two-stage algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MM-based AO algorithm achieves comparable performance to the case of double-distinct-IRS scheme, while the two-stage algorithm can strike a balance between the complexity and the system performance.},

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time.},

However, DFL faces several challenges, such as the severe heterogeneity of data distributions in diverse environments, and the transmission outages and package errors caused by the adoption of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in D2D networks. These challenges often degrade the convergence of training DFL models. To address these challenges, we conduct a thorough theoretical convergence analysis for DFL and derive a convergence bound. By defining a novel quantity named unreliable links-aware neighborhood discrepancy in this convergence bound, we formulate a tractable optimization objective, and develop a novel Topology Learning method considering the Representation Discrepancy and Unreliable Links in DFL, named ToLRDUL. Intensive experiments under both feature skew and label skew settings have validated the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating improved convergence speed and test accuracy, consistent with our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, physical layer (PHY) anonymous precoding has become imperative in applications that carry personal and sensitive data. While manipulating the signaling pattern of transmitted signals for obtaining high communication utility, the anonymous precoding masks the sender&#39;s PHY characteristics for the purpose of sender anonymity. Nevertheless, the anonymity provided by anonymous precoding has only been numerically demonstrated, and the relevant literature still lacks analytic results regarding the detection error rate (DER) performance. In this paper, we give the first attempt to show an analytic DER result of generic precoders. Tight closed-form DER expression is derived, as a function of the precoder employed at the sender, block length, propagation channel, and noise status. Some important properties are revealed, such as the impacts of block length, noise, and channel correlation on the DER result. Finally, simulation results validate that the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the closed-form and actual DER results is on the levels of $0 \sim 10^{-1}$ . The proposed analytic DER results help easily quantify the anonymity performance of existing anonymity-agnostic and anonymous precoders.},

By exploiting the potential joint sparsity of the delay-Doppler-angle (DDA) domain channel, the channel estimation problem is transformed into a sparse recovery problem. To solve it, we first apply the spike and slab prior model to iteratively estimate the support set of the channel matrix, and a higher-accuracy parameter update rule relying on the identified support set is introduced into the iteration. Then the specific values of the channel elements corresponding to the support set are estimated by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method. Both our simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed JSPL channel estimation scheme achieves an improved performance over the representative state-of-the-art baseline schemes, despite its reduced pilot overhead.},

Although theoretical models for RIS-empowered communications have covered a variety of applications, yet, very few papers have investigated the modeling of real propagation characteristics. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing an empirical statistical channel model to describe the small-scale channel variations for an RIS-assisted broadband system at 2.6 GHz. Based on empirical channel measurements in outdoor, indoor and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environments, we compare and analyze the global, inter-cluster and intra-cluster parameters. Measurement results indicate that the deployment of an RIS with proper phase configurations can significantly improve the channel quality by enhancing the $K$ -factor and reducing the time dispersion. The small-scale fading is well characterized by the proposed statistical model and empirical channel parameters. These results are essential for the design of emerging RIS-assisted wireless systems for future applications.},

Different from the existing recursive least square (RLS) detection algorithm which only supports a single antenna in each distributed unit (DU), the proposed GRLS allows for multiple antennas in each DU, rendering it adaptable to a variety of practical scenarios. Moreover, among the total $C$ DUs and with an integer parameter $C_{0}$ , the computational complexity of $C-C_{0}$ DUs in GRLS can be significantly reduced by leveraging the channel hardening property. Through analysis, we demonstrate that the convergence of the GRLS algorithm is guaranteed if $C_{0} \geq \lfloor {(\sqrt{{{B}}/{2}}+\sqrt{K})^{2}}/{B} \rfloor$ holds, where $K$ and $B$ denote the numbers of antennas at the user side and each DU, respectively. Furthermore, based on the daisy-chain architecture, the proposed GRLS algorithm also enjoys excellent scalability, which can be easily extended with extra DUs for further improvement. Finally, the detection complexity and data bandwidth analysis are also provided to unveil the superiority of GRLS compared to other distributed detection schemes for massive MIMO.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can serve users positioned on either side of the surface by means of transmitting and reflecting the incident signal. The deployment angle of the STAR-RIS is pivotal to the gain of the received and transmitted signals, and the STAR-RIS with rotatable angles has the potential to boost the spectral efficiency (SE). In this paper, the power allocation, transmission and reflection coefficients (TARCs), and deployment angle of the STAR-RIS is jointly optimized to maximize the SE. However, since the non-convex of the objective function and the manual coupling of variables, it is challenging to solve this problem. To this end, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where the deployment angle of the STAR-RIS is obtained by using deep learning (DL) according to channels from the BS to STAR-RIS and from the STAR-RIS to users. Then, the power allocation and TARCs are iteratively optimized in an alternating manner. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve superior system&#39;s SE.},

The coverage probability is derived by leveraging an accurate approximation of the aggregate interference distribution that captures the effect of beam misalignment and THz fading.

Traditional car-following models, which primarily focus on individual vehicle pairs, exhibit limitations in complex traffic environments. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced state representation for the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in platoon-following scenarios. Specifically, the proposed representation, influenced by feature engineering techniques in time series prediction tasks, thoroughly accounts for the intricate relative relationships between different vehicles within a platoon and can offer a distinctive perspective on traffic conditions to help improve the performance of MARL models. Experimental results show that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in platoon-following scenarios across key metrics such as the time gap, distance gap, and speed, even reducing the time gap by 63%, compared with traditional state representation methods. These enhancements represent a significant step forward in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and reliability of platoon-following models within the context of autonomous vehicles.},

We assume these UAVs are equipped with transceivers, allowing them to establish connections with low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Serving as relay nodes, these UAVs are responsible for forwarding data packets received from ground users to LEO satellites with buffers with allocated channel resources. For resource allocation, we introduce a latency-optimized approach that aims to equalize the queue lengths of the UAVs as a convex optimization problem. However, this approach is not only myopic, as it centers on minimizing the maximum of the one-step-ahead queue lengths, but also relies on statistics related to arrival rates of data packets from ground users and LEO channel conditions. To address these issues, we also employ reinforcement learning for resource allocation. This strategy capitalizes on the quasi-periodic behaviors exhibited by channel conditions to the serving LEO satellite, which can be learned over time. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of this strategy. Furthermore, to analyze the proposed resource allocation approach, which equalizes the queue lengths, we examine the effective bandwidth with equalized quality-of-service (QoS) exponents to reflect the equalized queue lengths. This analysis reveals that the behavior of the proposed approach can be accurately predicted using the QoS exponent.},

This process involves uploading a large amount of information related to the vehicle and its location. The security of vehicle-to-cloud communication thus has a significant impact on the safety of the IoV. This paper proposes a vehicle-to-cloud communication system based on lightweight authentication and extended Quantum Key Distribution. The system supports the wireless distribution of session keys between vehicles and the Quantum Cloud Server (QCS) by using a WAN (Wide Area Network), and supports the wired transmission of quantum keys between the QCS and the Telematics Service Provider (TSP) through a LAN (Local Area Network) by using the BB84 protocol. The system can implement encrypted communication based on quantum physical security in a hybrid network. Moreover, we propose a lightweight identity authentication scheme. An analysis of its performance shows that the proposed system requires a small amount of computation and incurs a low communication overhead. This scheme is applicable to most Internet devices with low computing and communication capacity, and can potentially be used in the IoV framework. We conducted simulations of the proposed system and experiments to test its performance. The maximum average delay in communication in experiments was 40.681 ms and the maximum rate of packet loss was 0.1222%. The proposed system can thus ensure safe and efficient IoV communication.},

In cases where direct data transmission from satellites to GSs is not possible due to a dynamic network topology and limited contact time, efficient relay selection or route selection schemes should be employed. This paper considers a satellite communication network in which a number of source low earth orbit(SLEO) satellites are attempting to transmit their data flows to the designated GSs. To improve the transmission performance of the data flows, one geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellite and a number of relay LEO (RLEO) satellites in the network are used as relays. To maximize energy efficiency, a joint route selection and resource allocation mechanism is proposed. The energy cost of the system, which is the sum of the energy cost of the SLEO satellites and the RLEO satellites, is used to formulate the joint route selection and resource allocation as a system energy cost minimization problem. Since the original optimization problem is NP hard, it is transformed into three subproblems: inter-satellite power allocation, satellite-ground power allocation, and route selection. These subproblems are solved using a greedy algorithm, the Lagrange dual method, and a matching-based heuristic algorithm, respectively. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Since each task can be executed on GUs, UAVs and the base station (BS) in parallel, the service assignment, task splitting, trajectory of UAVs, as well as resource and transmission power of both UAVs and GUs should be jointly optimized to minimize the system energy consumption with the subjection of the maximum tolerable latency and computing limitations. To tackle such mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed in the paper to seek a close optimal solution with low-complexity. In specific, the binary service assignment and continuous task splitting are obtained by DRL, while the trajectory planning and resource scheduling are jointly optimized by SCA in sequence to speed up the convergence. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-SCA algorithm equipped with dual-function UAV scheme is more effective in making full use of the on-board resource of UAVs and reducing the overall system energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Existing works mostly use tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) with $\ell _{1}$ norm to effectively recover clean low-rank traffic data from the Laplacian distributed outliers polluted data. However, in some traffic applications, the outliers are more likely to obey structural sparse distribution, which may lead to significant recovery performance degradation, especially under the coexistence of noise and structural outliers. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective structural sparse TRPCA method based on cross-entropy to recover traffic data from mixed pollution cases. In the proposed method, the global characteristics of the low-rank traffic data and the structural sparsity of the outliers are captured by the tensor nuclear norm and $\ell _{2,2,1}$ norm, respectively. Moreover, two new sets (noise probability set $\mathcal {P}_{N}$ and structural outlier probability set $\mathcal {P}_{S}$ ) are defined to clearly describe the uncertainty of different pollution types for each element. Then, a noise regularization term and a structural outlier regularization term with $\ell _{F}$ norm constrained are established via $\mathcal {P}_{N}$ and $\mathcal {P}_{S}$ , respectively, to accurately quantify the element-wise corrupted level of different pollution types. Furthermore, a new cross-entropy (CE) with $\mathcal {P}_{N}$ and $\mathcal {P}_{S}$ is constructed as a regularization term to delicately distinguish the difference between noise and structural outliers. Via the defined CE regularization term, not only can the effects of different pollution types be distinctly quantified and separated, but also the values in the probability sets can be adaptively corrected during TRPCA optimization. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed method can offer lower recovery error ratio and root mean square error with lower computational complexity in comparison to related works.},

However, most existing research on vehicle dispatching with dynamic pricing for the MaaS market is still limited to single-service provider scenarios. In this paper, we propose an economic model that analyzes the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand interactions between multiple mobility service providers (MSPs) and passengers, respectively. We formulate the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game under different pricing schemes, namely, independent pricing scheme (IPS) and competitive pricing scheme (CPS) , considering the vehicle supply-demand relationship and market competition among the MSPs. The MSPs, as leaders, set their service pricing strategies first, and then the passengers, as the followers, determine their service demands. Due to the high-dimensional and complicated nature of the dynamic MaaS market environment, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game, which indicates the optimal pricing and demand strategies for MSPs and passengers. Simulation results and analysis show that the proposed MADRL-based algorithm converges to the optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark schemes under both IPS and CPS in terms of maximizing MSPs&#39; revenue and protecting passengers&#39; benefits. Furthermore, the proposed MADRL-based algorithm under CPS improves MSPs&#39; market attractiveness and long-term benefits, which encourages MSPs to participate in competitive vehicle dispatching in the MaaS market.},

With the increase in data volume and data interaction frequency, the burden of the central server increases dramatically, and it is difficult for resource-limited vehicles to store and verify all messages in the untrusted environment as well. Therefore, a secure and distributed IoV data-sharing scheme needs to be constructed. This paper proposes a hybrid proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain consensus and constructs a secure and efficient distributed IoV data-sharing scheme based on it. In this scheme, participants can store and share data securely in a distributed way through blockchain. The hybrid PoS blockchain consensus, where block producers are chosen based on their own stakes, and multiple trusted managers supervise each other updating head blocks periodically, maintains a more secure blockchain as a consistent and tamper-proof record for data sharing, than some researches using existing consensus, as shown in the security analysis. Every entity can participate in the blockchain consensus equally, without consuming high computation power, which improves the distribution degree and achieves co-governance of the IoV system. The performance evaluation shows that referring to the Gini coefficient, our scheme achieves a higher degree of decentralization than other schemes with only RSUs participants. In this way, vehicles collaborating with roadside units, realize distributed storage and secure data sharing to whoever with their authorization.},

In this paper, we explore how to utilize edge computing to aid in collaborative vehicular perception, an emerging topic within ITS which involves vehicles sharing sensor data with one another to extend each vehicle&#39;s perception beyond what its individual sensors can see. However, achieving real time collaborative perception is a challenge even with the utilization of edge computing; due to the large amount of multi-modal sensor data produced by modern intelligent vehicles, the amount of data transmitted over wireless channels and the complexity of computational tasks will need to be managed dynamically based on the wireless network conditions and available computing resources. As such we propose REFO, a Real-time Edge Fusion Optimization method that combines task partitioning with data reduction and model compression to maximize sensor fusion accuracy while adhering to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We define a performance metric termed effective mean average precision (EmAP), which incorporates both QoS and fusion accuracy, and show that our proposed neural network based REFO action decision framework can outperform the best comparison models by approximately 10% in terms of EmAP over 18 test combinations of network and computing conditions.},

  abstract     = {The multi-access edge computing (MEC) provides opportunities for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform computing-intensive and delay-sensitive applications. To further reduce the time delay and energy consumption of UAVs, in this paper, we study the long-term optimization problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in a multi-UAV multi-server MEC network (JTORA-MUMS), where the task offloading decision and the allocation of CPU frequency, bandwidth, and transmission power are jointly optimized. Furthermore, we formulate JTORA-MUMS as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a discrete-continuous hybrid action space and handle the hybrid action space by mapping part of continuous actions to discrete decisions. To solve JTORA-MUMS, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, DDPG-MHSA, in which a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) based actor-critic model is trained by a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DDPG-MHSA approach outperforms state-of-the-art DRL-based methods and conventional heuristics, with good generalization to the number of UAVs and computing task properties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a joint computation offloading and resource allocation optimization problem for the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system. Specifically, we consider an IRS-assisted multi-device MEC system, where mobile devices (MDs) can either execute the computation-intensive tasks locally or offload their tasks to the MEC server. With the aim of minimizing the maximum weighted consumed energy, the offloading decisions, the transmit power at the MDs, the central processing unit (CPU) clock frequencies at the MDs and the MEC server, the receive beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), and the reflecting coefficient matrix at the IRS are jointly optimized. To handle the underlying mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a bisection search based alternate feasibility verification suboptimal algorithm. In particular, we use the bisection search method to optimize the offloading decision threshold which determines the offloading MDs&#39; set. Subsequently, the alternate optimization (AO) method is employed to solve the feasibility verification problem by decomposing it into four feasibility-checking subproblems and then separately tackling each of them. Finally, we use simulations to validate the advantages of deploying IRS and optimizing its reflecting phase shift for the considered system, and also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its performance gain over the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide computation services to vehicle terminals (VTs) by allowing VTs to offload computation tasks to edge servers in proximity. However, VT mobility affects both the number of VTs and their sojourn time within a given area, and brings about great uncertainty in MEC latency performance. During VT movement, offloading computation tasks to edge servers can efficiently reduce the task completion latency, and may also cause task loss due to the limited sojourn time. In this paper, we investigate mobility-aware computation offloading, and communication and computation resource allocation for nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) MEC in vehicular networks. Specifically, an average task completion latency minimization problem is formulated and decomposed into two tractable sub-problems, i.e., general multicarrier NOMA communication resource allocation, and joint computation offloading and computation resource allocation, which are solved by employing the convex optimization theory. All VTs are classified into two categories according to whether the sojourn time constraint can be satisfied, and an algorithm is proposed to implement computation offloading and resource allocation for different categories of VTs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of latency performance, and VT mobility has significant impact on task completion latency.},

Existing quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols produce a continuous secret key stream, but cannot be deployed at the devices that have no quantum channels. In this paper, we first propose a scheme, called synchronized random measurement (SRM) to improve the secret key rate of a QKD protocol. Then, we further propose the novel idea of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as a physical courier to carrier secret key bits generated through QKD at a gateway to all control devices within coverage area of the gateway. When the UAV does not visit a control device to replenish its consumed secret key bits before the bits are depleted, the device suffers from key deficiency and secure communications are interrupted. We formulate an optimization to minimize the number of UAVs needed to cover all control devices, taking into account the limited battery capacity on-board UAVs and the key deficiency requirement. Through simulations, we have confirmed the key quality and rate improvement of the proposed SRM. We have also evaluated the proposed optimization in finding the minimum number of UAVs to cover different numbers of control devices within a gateway coverage area of different sizes. Increasing the coverage area diameter beyond the UAV flight range may require as many UAVs as the number of control devices for a complete service.},

  abstract     = {In 5G and beyond wireless systems, Network Slicing (NS) feature will enable the coexistence of extremely different services by splitting the physical infrastructure into several logical slices tailored for a specific tenant or application. In sliced Radio Access Networks (RANs), an optimal traffic sharing among cells is key to guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance while minimizing operation costs. The configuration of network functions leading to that optimal point may depend on the slice, claiming for slice-aware traffic steering strategies. This work presents the first data-driven algorithm for slice-aware traffic steering by tuning handover margins (a.k.a. mobility load balancing) per slice and adjacency with a proportional controller based on SLA criteria. The tuning process is driven by a novel indicator, derived from connection traces, showing the imbalance of SLA compliance among neighbor cells per slice. Performance assessment is carried out with a system-level simulator implementing a realistic sliced RAN offering services with different throughput, latency and reliability requirements. Results show that the proposed algorithm improves the overall SLA compliance by 9% in only 15 minutes of network activity compared to the case of not steering traffic, outperforming two legacy mobility load balancing approaches not driven by SLA.},

In DC-MAC, a criterion of link concurrency and a beam tracking algorithm are proposed to reduce interference and enhance transmission efficiency of the network. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we propose an analysis model and consequently derive the closed-form calculation for network throughput. Simulation experiments show that DC-MAC protocol achieves higher throughput and lower control overhead compared to the state-of-the-art protocols. Besides, several experiments are performed to validate the proposed model and analyze the influence of key parameters on throughput, providing a reference for protocol design.},

Considering a general radar network model, we first propose a model-based approach developed under some simplifications of the general model. Then, following the optimization framework of the model-based approach and with the aid of black-box optimization, we propose a non-model-based approach that can jointly optimize the radar deployment and parameter under the general model without any simplifications. Since conducting the non-model-based approach is time-consuming, we further propose a learning-aided approach to accelerate it. We use realistic simulations to evaluate our proposed approaches.

  abstract     = {5G-Advanced and Beyond claims a 3D ecosystem with cooperation between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks to achieve seamless coverage, improve capacity, and enable advanced applications with strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. This complex environment requires a disaggregated Radio Access Network (RAN) deployment with open interfaces, such as the architecture promoted by the O-RAN Alliance. This architecture, supporting the slicing paradigm, is a prominent solution to guarantee dynamism and differentiated traffic management. Furthermore, intelligence is critical for future wireless networks to enable Machine Learning (ML)-based optimization for autonomous RANs, handling ultra-dense heterogeneous environments, and adapting to numerous scenarios. This paper presents an enhanced Dynamic Radio Access Network Selection (eDRANS) algorithm based on Federated Double Deep Q-Network (F-DDQN) and inserted in the novel O-RAN architecture. The proposal selects the most suitable base station (BS) to satisfy multiple service requests, optimizing QoS and slicing resource utilization. Moreover, the solution employs a Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) approach to manage resources in overload situations. This load-balancing process enables the acceptance of new clients without abruptly degrading the active users&#39; perception. eDRANS is adapted to diverse network conditions, multiple service constraints, and several user types with different priorities and mobility behaviors. The proposal is validated through network-level simulations, recreating a heterogeneous environment composed of terrestrial-airborne nodes and using the Max-SINR criterion, a heuristic algorithm, and centralized and distributed ML solutions as benchmarks. Results show that eDRANS correctly learns during multiple trial-and-error interactions with the environment, fulfilling the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and maximizing user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {The new technologies introduced by 5G, such as network slicing, will improve the capabilities of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, enabling the introduction of a new range of services and new forms of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions. In order to deploy these V2X services and the network slices they are associated with over the 5G network while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS), intelligent and proactive network resource managers and orchestrators (RMOs) need to be developed. The ability to forecast the slice resource demand can significantly increase the proactivity of these RMOs. ML-based resource demand predictors (RDPs) are commonly integrated with RMOs to provide accurate forecasts of the slice resource demands in V2X use cases. However, prediction errors are still common, causing the RMOs to reallocate resources to the slices sub-optimally. When an RDP underestimates the resource demand, i.e. predicts less demand than expected, the impact is much more severe for the infrastructure providers (InPs) and service providers (SPs) than when it overestimates the demand. Also, the impact of this misprediction is also different for each InP/SP, for which it is necessary for RDPs to also consider this difference. In view of this, we introduce a new approach that makes ML-based RDPs aware of the asymmetry of misprediction and their dependence to a specific network model, making their forecasts more useful for RMOs. This approach enhances the design of RDPs by embedding within them knowledge of the underlying 5G network and of the relationship between resource demand, resource allocation and service/network performance. We refer to our approach as Network-Aware Loss for Demand Prediction ( NALDEP ), and it improves the prediction quality by 73.3% and 41.0% with respect to accuracy-based and other state-of-the-art predictors, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Emerging Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications in the B5G/6G era have higher demands on real-time information in real traffic scenarios, and the current Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) can hardly support the operation of such applications. To realize the efficient operation of ITS applications, we integrate Digital Twin (DT) technology into IoVs and propose a framework of DT-assisted cloud-edge collaboration IoVs for intelligent transportation. DT synchronization requires vehicular sensing and data uploading, where the sensing capability and sensing policy of different vehicles affect the accuracy of DT, and the simultaneous sensing of neighboring vehicles creates data redundancy. The deployment strategy of Vehicle DTs (VDTs) at the network edge affects the real-time performance of DT. The mobility of vehicles, the low-latency requirements of DT, and the limited heterogeneous resources of edge servers pose great challenges to the deployment of VDTs. To address the above problems, we established the vehicular sensing model considering sensing quality, cost and redundancy. Then, A DT synchronization mechanism is designed and an improved Age of Information (AoI) metric is used to measure the freshness of the real vehicle state data received by the cloud during the DT synchronization process. We proposed a joint optimization problem of vehicular sensing and VDTs deployment to maximize the system Quality of Services (QoS), which is reflected through the vehicular sensing quality, AoI and system cost in DT synchronization process. We develop an algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to solve this optimization problem, called DTSD-MAPPO. Numerical results show that the scheme reduces the system cost and improves the accuracy and real-time in DT synchronization.},

This paper seeks to establish the underlying relationship between data diffusion efficiency and IoV topology, and explore topology optimization criteria to minimize total network delay. Specifically, we establish mathematical models for topology control, parallel transmission, and diffusion delay, respectively. We quantify the spreading index using the complex network spreading dynamics model to formulate accurate diffusion strategies. Simulation verifies the spreading index&#39;s effectiveness and limitations. Based on this index, we propose an efficient topology control strategy and hybrid diffusion strategy for delay reduction. Compared to traditional content-centric network (CCN) and proactive diffusion strategies, our approach is superior in optimizing total delay by leveraging the advantages of a more efficient topology.

  abstract     = {The sixth-generation mobile communication system (6G) puts forward higher requirement for connection density, which is difficult to meet with the existing resource management schemes in real time. In this paper, we investigate the graph neural network (GNN) based algorithms for supporting the massive connectivity in 6G. Using the power intensity of the received signal or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a measure of communication quality, we aim to maximize the number of links that meet quality of service (QoS) requirements in a given area through joint admission and power control. Specifically, we consider two models. Among them, the blocking interference model presets the transmit power of the link in advance, and only needs admission control. After the original problem is converted to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, we design a solution based on graph convolution network (GCN) and Q-learning. The accumulative interference model considers all the interference in the scene and controls the power and access jointly. For this model, we propose an algorithm based on graph attention network (GAT). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed GNN based algorithms preserve small computation time and achieve significant performance gain even with large network scale. As such, they are very suitable for the 6G scenario with massive connections.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising technology to support real-time vehicular applications, where vehicles offload intensive computation tasks to the nearby VEC server for processing. However, the traditional VEC that relies on single communication technology cannot well meet the communication requirement for task offloading, thus the heterogeneous VEC integrating the advantages of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), millimeter-wave (mmWave) and cellular-based vehicle to infrastructure (C-V2I) is introduced to enhance the communication capacity. The communication resource allocation and computation resource allocation may significantly impact on the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) performance and the VEC system utility, in this case, how to do the resource allocations is becoming necessary. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous VEC with multiple communication technologies and various types of tasks, and propose an effective resource allocation policy to minimize the system utility while satisfying the URLLC requirement. We first formulate an optimization problem to minimize the system utility under the URLLC constraint which is modeled by the moment generating function (MGF)-based stochastic network calculus (SNC), then we present a Lyapunov-guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to convert and solve the optimization problem. Extensive simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed resource allocation approach is effective.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of edge computing technology, edge-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have become popular, helping with fast and cost-effective data collection in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environments. This paper investigates the online data collection problem for MCS over an edge-assisted UAV network architecture, where UAVs work to collect the data required by tasks at different on-ground point-of-interests (PoIs) in an autonomous and cooperative manner. Different from conventional edge-assisted UAV networks, edge nodes in our paper help distribute, aggregate, share, and update the task state information (TSI, e.g., if a task has been completed, or if it still requires more data), to support efficient and cost-effective data collection, e.g., avoiding repetitive and ineffective task execution. In particular, a UAV can exchange TSI with an edge node when it is within the signal coverage of the edge node, while making decisions on PoI selection and path planning in an online and decentralized manner. To address the issue of edge-assisted UAV data collection, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm using personalized training with decentralized executing (PTDE) architecture. Different from the traditional centralized training with decentralized executing (CTDE) architecture, our considered architecture adopts the agent-specific state for critic networks instead of the joint observation, thus achieving effective utilization of environmental information. Furthermore, we propose an observation enhancement algorithm based on artificial potential field (APF). Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm greatly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of total profit, data collection ratio, geographical fairness, and energy efficiency.},

Then, we analyze how the RSMA-oriented resource allocation influences on the system latency. These analyses enable us to formulate the average latency minimization problem from a joint content caching, dynamic recommendation, and RSMA resource allocation perspective, which is a non-linear, non-convex, and mixed-integer programming problem. To make it tractable, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems, namely, the short-term resource allocation problem for RSMA, the long-term caching optimization problem, and the dynamic recommendation optimization problem. After solving all the subproblems separately, we devise an alternating algorithm to jointly optimize the variables. Extensive simulation results show the convergence performance of our developed scheme and the superiority of our algorithm with respect to system&#39;s average latency and cache hit ratio when compared to the benchmark strategies.},

Especially, many UAVs can form a UAV network in an ad hoc manner, so that they can provide communication service for GUs more effectively. When deploying a UAV network consisting of multiple UAV-BSs, the UAV network needs to cover as many GUs as possible and improve the communication quality of GUs while maintaining its own connectivity. To solve this problem, a UAV network construction algorithm based on virtual force is proposed, so that a connected UAV network can be deployed to cover as many GUs as possible. On this basis, the Air-to-Air connection establishment algorithm is proposed to establish connection relationships among UAV-BSs, and the Air-to-Ground connection establishment algorithm is proposed to determine the GUs served by each UAV-BS. The UAV-BS position adjustment algorithm is further proposed, so that each UAV adjusts its own position to improve the minimum throughput of covered GUs while maintaining the connectivity of the UAV network. The proposed algorithms can be executed in a distributed manner, i.e., the UAV network can be deployed under the constrains that the positions of GUs are prior unknown and there is no central controller.

In this article, we propose a STAR-RIS assisted multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework, where the user offloads the tasks to multiple edge nodes, and the STAR-RIS is deployed to enable and enhance the multiple offloading links at the same time. Meanwhile, the hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (h-NOMA) is adopted to further improve the performance of the STAR-RIS assisted downlink parallel offloading. We aim to minimize the latency by jointly optimizing the offloading order and task division to the edge nodes, the time allocation for the time-division multiple access (TDMA) transmission and the NOMA transmission in the h-NOMA scheme, the transmit power and the decoding orders when employing NOMA, and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients at the STAR-RIS. To solve this highly complex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal solutions of the time allocation and task division in closed forms, and then propose a low-complexity alternative optimizing (AO) algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to optimize the allocation of radio resources. Simulation results show that the proposed STAR-RIS assisted offloading scheme based on h-NOMA can effectively reduce the time latency compared with benchmark schemes, especially when the number of the STAR-RIS elements is small.},

Previous studies often based their UAV logistics delivery strategies on Manhattan distance. However, these methods face difficulties when dealing with the complexities of multi-user scenarios, low-altitude communication, and the non-convex nature of the problem. Innovative approaches are needed to overcome these challenges. This study explores a multi-user UAV cargo delivery system, where a cellular-connected UAV efficiently collects and distributes packages within a delivery area. Balancing task completion speed and reliable communication with ground base stations (GBS) poses challenges due to the problem&#39;s highly non-convex nature. To address this, we propose a two-step approach. Initially, leveraging a graph-theoretic method under communication quality constraints, we determine the shortest path between points ensuring communication connectivity. Subsequently, considering pickup and delivery with capacity constraints based on communication connectivity (PDPCC), we present an efficient solution for obtaining the optimal task sequence and integrating it with the shortest paths. Our numerical results demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s efficacy in reducing delivery task completion time while ensuring continuous online UAV operation through maintained communication connectivity.},

Given the stringent latency requirements, short package transmission is adopted and the approximation of the finite blocklength codes capacity is introduced for the algorithm design. Also in the system design, we fully consider the effect of Doppler spread caused by high vehicular mobility. We formulate the problem of maximizing the number of flows that satisfy delay and reliability requirements while meeting the constrained radio and power resources. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we propose a joint optimization framework for flow scheduling and power allocation.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of $+1$ and $-1$ for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime are biased to either $+1$ or $-1$ , and thus, the learning requires excessive training to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems.},

It makes high-precision localization gain increasing attention in MIMO integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the decimeter-level precise indoor localization is full of challenges due to the multi-path fading and additional noise in indoor propagations. Excessive resource overhead and channel state information (CSI) fingerprint distortion in complex channel environments are the main factors that hinder indoor high-precision localization. To solve the CSI fingerprint distortion while reducing resource consumption, we propose a Swin Transformer-based CSI data-driven indoor localization framework called Swin-Loc. In the proposed Swin-Loc, a channel fingerprint extraction scheme is formulated to enhance the CSI features. Moreover, an improved Swin Transformer-based CSI network (SwinCSINet) model is proposed to improve localization precision. Experiments are conducted on the real-world CSI dataset given by the KU Leuven lab and the simulation CSI dataset generated by the DeepMIMO platform. Simulation results demonstrate that the localization precision on all datasets in the metric of root mean squared error (RMSE) is within 0.3 m, which outperforms current deep neural networks (DNNs) based schemeand attention-based scheme. Furthermore, the storage overhead of the improved SwinCSINet model is reduced to about 33 $\%$ of the DNN regression model, and the real-time performance is optimized.},

In THz-NOMA networks, efficient and effective long-term beamforming-bandwidth-power (BBP) allocation is yet an open problem due to its non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) nature. In this article, the continuous property of power and sub-arrays ratios assignment and the discrete property of sub-bands allocation are carefully treated. In light of these attributes, an offline hybrid discrete and continuous actions (DISCO) multi-task deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the long-term throughput. Specifically, the deployment of multi-task learning enables the actor of DISCO to smartly integrate two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, e.g., actor-critic (AC) that only selects discrete actions and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that only generates continuous actions. Rigorous theoretical derivations for the neural network design and backpropagation process are provided to tailor our proposed DISCO for the BBP problem. Compared to the benchmark no-learning and conventional DRL algorithms, DISCO enhances the network throughput, while achieving good fairness among users.

Consequently, the receiver can infer sensitive information that the sender does not want to disclose. To address this privacy risk, we provide a knowledge discrepancy oriented privacy preserving method (KDPP) for semantic communication. KDPP aims to narrow down the discrepancy between prior knowledge and receiver&#39;s knowledge before privacy preserving. Specifically, we propose knowledge mapping to solve the agnostic problem, matching the unknown knowledge to the known prior knowledge. Moreover, we introduce disambiguation to address the diversity issue, capturing diverse interpretations of ambiguous concepts. Our simulations show that KDPP performs better than existing methods in terms of the inference accuracy and the privacy preserving effect. This demonstrates the validity of private knowledge inference as an effective method for privacy preserving against knowledge discrepancy.},

  abstract     = {The growing popularity of 4 G/5 G mobile devices has led to an increase in demand for wireless security. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technique is an emerging approach for device authentication using intrinsic and unique hardware impairments. In this paper, we propose an RFF-based method to identify rogue/unknown long term evolution (LTE) terminals. This is achieved by combining wavelet transform (WT) coefficient graphs and differential spectrum. The proposed method involves extracting 48 levels of wavelet coefficients from the transient power-off of the physical random access channel (PRACH) signal and representing them in a WT graph. The steady-state part of the PRACH signal after a frequency domain differential processing between the adjacent spectrum is extracted. To detect unknown attack devices, an identification scheme based on an autoencoder (AE) is designed. Two different AE network structures are designed based on the proposed features, and a hybrid identification structure is proposed. An experimental evaluation system is set up with seven mobile phones from three categories and one universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio (SDR) platform. Training and testing datasets are collected under different conditions such as location, working times, and dates. Experimental results show that rogue devices can be identified with an accuracy up to 98.84% for different categories and 90.27% for different individuals.},

In this study, we explore possible channel access schemes for aeronautical ad-hoc networks. We propose Multi-Channel Self-Organized TDMA (MCSOTDMA), a novel variant of randomized, reservation-based slotted ALOHA for LDACS A/A. In particular, we prove that it can achieve an optimal delay by following the $\frac{1}{e}$ -rule of traditional slotted ALOHA&#39;s throughput. This new variant allows users to distributively converge towards an optimal channel access strategy with no a-priori knowledge of their neighborhood. It scales to any number of users and always guarantees a freely chosen, average packet collision probability. We evaluate the performance on the busiest oceanic airspace, and compare it to medium access schemes used in maritime and other aeronautical networks. We demonstrate that arbitrary collision rates can be achieved at the cost of proportional packet delay, establish communication links with deterministic performance, and implement broadcast voice messaging among pilots. We provide access to the simulator and a protocol specification under open licenses, in line with the principles of open science.},

  abstract     = {Emerging services in Tactile Internet are expected to bring immersive experience for customers in watching live sports, action films, and advertisements, which demand ultra-reliable and high-throughput transmission. Since the power budget and the block length are limited for communications, allocating the transmit power and the pilot length becomes critical for efficient data transmission from the base station (BS) to the devices. In this work, taking the coding theory of finite blocklength and the resource allocation over channel estimation and data transmission into account, both data error probability and throughput are analyzed and optimized in terms of the pilot power and pilot length, respectively. It is revealed that both the data error probability and the throughput are quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, with respect to ( $w.r.t.$ ) the pilot length and the power of pilot signal from a block-level perspective. Regarding a frame consisting of multiple blocks, we propose the truncated channel inversion scheme to allocate the data transmission power over multiple blocks. Given the length of pilots, the average data error probability and the average throughput for a frame are proved to be quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, $w.r.t.$ the desired power level of the received data signal. We propose a sub-optimal algorithm for frame-wise throughput maximization to derive the length of the pilots and the desired power level of the received data signal. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the fixed transmission power scheme in terms of the average data error probability for a frame by reducing an order of magnitude under the same system power constraints.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed framework that a server leverages a large number of clients to collaboratively learn a model while keeping the privacy of their local data. However, the heterogeneity of computation and communication resources among clients, which maybe lead to the different time arriving at the server, has a negative effect on the convergence of FL algorithms because the stragglers heavily slow down the runtime. In this paper, we develop a joint optimization model of client central processing unit (CPU) frequency, channel assignment, power allocation and local model accuracy based on a designated global model accuracy to minimize the maximum delay of communication and computation of all participating clients. Unfortunately, this problem is a non-convex mixed-integer programming, which is NP-hard. Thus, an equivalent problem by transforming discrete variables into continuous ones is first developed in order to make the original problem tractable. Then we propose a novel Alternating Momentum Gradient Descent with Variable Similarity (AMGDVS) algorithm to solve the min-max problem, which incorporates a similarity index into the previous partial gradients so as to consider the interaction of variables. The proposed AMGDVS algorithm converges to the first-order stationary point with the accuracy factor being $\eta$ within $\mathcal {O}(\eta ^{-4})$ iterations. Our simulations, conducted under various parameter settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the average training time for learning an FL model on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, both in the Independent Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) scenarios, is noticeably reduced.},

Unlike the conventional receiver, channel estimation and symbol detection are relatively isolated, we design a novel joint receiver combining channel estimation and symbol detection exploiting a partial iterative feedback mechanism. Firstly, we take into account the effect of fractional Doppler and make it approximate gridding. Therefore, the channel estimation problem is transformed into a block sparse signal recovery problem, and an efficient sparse adaptive block orthogonal matching pursuit (ABOMP) algorithm is proposed. Secondly, we propose a low-complexity approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, which provides a reference for selecting high-confidence data symbols and reduces the redundant calculation of multiple detections. Finally, a partial iteration feedback joint detection and channel estimation (JDCE) algorithm is proposed to further reduce the system bit error ratio (BER) and computational complexity.

  abstract     = {The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network is undergoing rapid development with the maturing of satellite communications and rocket launch technologies, and the demand for a global coverage network. However, current satellite communication networks are constrained by limited transmitting signal power, resulting in the use of large-size and energy-consuming ground terminals to provide additional gain. This paper proposes a novel technology called distributed beamforming to address such challenges and support direct communications from LEO satellites to smartphones. The proposed distributed beamforming technique is based on the superposition of Electromagnetic (EM) waves and aims to enhance the received signal strength. Furthermore, we utilize EM wave superposition to increase the link budget and provide the coverage pattern formed by the distributed antenna array, which will be affected by the array structure and the transmitter parameters. In addition, the impact of Doppler frequency shift and time misalignment on the performance of distributed beamforming is investigated. Numerical results show that the enhancement of the received power depends on the angle formed by those radiated beams and can be up to the square of the number of beams; namely, a maximum enhancement of 6 dB could be obtained by using two satellites and a maximum of 12 dB increase through four satellites, which provide a clear guideline for the design of distributed beamforming for future satellite communications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study how to improve the communication quality in millimeter-wave (mmWave) ground-to-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems. The system consists of a ground node with an antenna array and a UAV with a single antenna. Obviously, the communication quality can be maximally enhanced in the case that the trajectories of array beampattern peak and UAV coincide with each other. Achieving this objective through a traditional phased array (PA) approach requires considerable implementation costs, as the phase lags among array elements need to be frequently updated to change the beampattern peak direction. To alleviate this, we design an efficient method based on frequency diverse array (FDA), which tunes the frequency offsets among array elements. As a result, FDA generates a time-variant beampattern, such that the beampattern peak exhibits autonomous spatial movement. By using this characteristic, the complexity of the FDA method is reduced compared to PA, since we can design the beampattern peak trajectory without the necessity for real-time parameter updates. Specifically, subject to the constraints of UAV&#39;s speed, flight time and FDA&#39;s frequency offsets range, we jointly optimize the UAV movement and FDA frequency offsets to maximally align the trajectories of UAV and FDA beampattern peak, thereby improving beampattern gain. However, the formulated problem is non-convex with highly coupled variables. To handle this problem, we further design an algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method which circularly updates the variables, and finally yields a stationary solution of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that, with the same implementation complexity, the FDA approach can achieve a higher communication quality compared to the PA approach and other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the goal-oriented design for mission-critical services like remote control, stands as a pivotal challenge in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). This paper investigates an energy-efficient wireless networked control system with local and remote controllers in SAGIN. Frequent state transmission from sensor to remote controller would improve the quality of control (QoC) at the expense of nontrivial energy consumption. Nevertheless, such a tradeoff for the considered system has received little attention. In this sense, we propose a goal-oriented transmission scheduling design to balance QoC and energy consumption. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem on minimizing the weighted sum of control cost and power consumption by making decisions about whether to transmit the state or not. By formulating a Markov Decision Process framework, the optimal transmission scheduling policy is proven to have a threshold structure tied to the age of information (AoI). Then, the optimal AoI threshold is obtained by means of a discrete-time Markov chain. Equipped with this, we propose an AoI-thresholding mechanism that can provide insights into when to transmit the state in a computationally-efficient manner. Numerical results shed light on the advantages of the proposed policy over the periodical and greedy transmission policies for the considered system.},

In this paper, we investigate the effect of channel aging on the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO systems over spatially correlated channels. We consider a minimum mean square error channel estimator that facilitates the derivation of closed-form spectral efficiency expressions. For the uplink, we compare the large-scale fading decoding method with the centralized decoding method. For the downlink, we adopt the maximum ratio precoding and propose a practical fractional power control method to improve the performance. Based on the analytical framework, we unveil the interplay between channel aging, spatial correlation, and signal processing methods. Our results demonstrate that the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO system outperforms the conventional CF counterpart system in both static and mobile scenarios. Moreover, when the link is weak, the introduction of RIS can lead to even more substantial performance enhancement. Also, RIS can be deployed to compensate for system performance degradation caused by channel aging and potentially lead to energy savings, while still achieving excellent performance. Intriguingly, due to the mutual coupling of RIS element and AP antenna correlations, RIS can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by spatial correlation among AP antennas. Furthermore, we provide a practical rule-of-thumb guideline for designing resource block length, accounting for the impacts caused by channel aging.},

  abstract     = {The next generation wireless networks demand full coverage from the sky to the deep ocean, in which the water-air cross-boundary communication is a critical component in a coordinated uncrewed vehicular network that connects both uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In such a network, optical wireless communication (OWC) is an emerging and promising technology to implement direct high-speed wireless communication through the water-to-air interface. However, due to the high directionality of optical beams and the dynamics of the harsh oceanic environments, it faces significant challenges to achieve reliable and robust seamless cross-boundary communication, as the waves cause beam deflection and the mobility of the transceivers makes the link worse or even results in link disconnections. To deal with these challenges, in this paper, we investigate both static and mobile application scenarios to enable reliable water-air direct optical communications via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. In the static scenario, we propose an active alignment method and derive the optimal beamwidth to satisfy the requirement of bit error rate (BER) and improve the link availability. To cope with the oceanic environment-induced channel dynamics, in the mobile scenario, we design a DRL-based UAV control strategy by incorporating the extended Kalman filter (EKF) prediction technique to enhance reliable communication between the mobile transceivers. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve impressive performance in terms of energy consumption and reliable communications under both the static and mobile scenarios.},

This work investigates the potentialities of this technology to provide secure transmissions by analysing the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of two different implementations of FAS undergoing spatial correlated Nakagami- $m$ fading by assuming $i)$ non-diversity FAS and maximum-gain combining-FAS (MGC-FAS) diversity scheme at the legitimate node and $ii)$ multiple-antennas performing maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the eavesdropper. Specifically, using a novel asymptotic matching method, a simple and accurate closed-form approximations to the end-to-end signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) distributions are derived in terms of well-known functions without incurring tricky functions or multi-fold integrals. Our findings reveal that the secrecy performance of the MGC-FAS beats the non-diversity FAS counterpart only when $i)$ the antenna size of the FAS tube is large enough, and $ii)$ the average SNR of the legitimate path is much greater than that of the eavesdropper link. Finally, numerical results validate our approximations of the SOP for the MGC-FAS scheme and demonstrate its accuracy under different FAS conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, the extent of this enhancement has yet to be defined in a simple and insightful manner, especially when RIS amplitude and phase responses are coupled. In this article, we characterize the fundamental ergodic capacity limits of RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), a.k.a. MIMO-RIS, when considering a practical amplitude response for the RIS, which is coupled to its phase shift response. By studying these fundamental limits, we provide insights into the performance of MIMO-RIS systems and inform the design and optimization of future wireless communications. Accordingly, we first derive a novel expression of MIMO-RIS ergodic capacity from a closed-form expression of the probability density function (pdf) of the cascaded channel eigenvalues. We then provide upper and lower bounds, alongside low SNR, high SNR, and large number of RIS element approximations to illustrate the dependence of the MIMO-RIS ergodic capacity on the amplitude and phase of RIS elements. These expressions helped us to define the maximum SNR gain of MIMO-RIS over MIMO systems. Next, simulations are used to validate the accuracy and correctness of our various capacity expressions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of environmental factors, such as near-field or far-field path loss, on the MIMO-RIS ergodic capacity. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of our MIMO-RIS SNR gain expression and provide valuable insights into the performance of RIS-based systems in realistic scenarios. Consequently, this can contribute to the design of future wireless communications based on MIMO-RIS.},

  abstract     = {Driven by a series of advanced intelligent applications, it is expected to provide low-latency and high-accuracy localization and computing services at the network edge. To this end, this paper aims to realize an efficient integration of localization and computing by leveraging the collaborative capability of distributed multi-node, i.e, multiple base station (BSs) and user equipments (UEs), for the transfer and fusion of localization information and computing data. To enhance the overall performance of integrated localization and computing under limited radio and computing resources, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with the objective of the weighted total energy consumption minimization while ensuring quality of service (QoS) requirements of localization and computing is formulated. By exploiting the structure of this computationally difficult MINLP problem and employing some approximation techiniques, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint offloading selection and resource allocation algorithm to obtain a feasible sub-optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve a good performance both for localization and computing under limited resources, and has an obvious performance gain over the baseline ones, which confirms its feasibility and effectiveness in edge intelligence networks.},

In essence, channel tracking is formulated as a compressive sensing problem with the proposed sensing matrix over the delay domain, which enables low complexity irrespective of the number of available subcarriers, resulting in a new tracking algorithm based on the exact top- $k$ feature selection. To elaborate, the proposed method is based on a novel sensing matrix that exploits the time evolution models of angle of arrivals (AoAs) and angle of departures (AoDs), where the time-varying channel is effectively approximated with a few discrete AoA and AoD candidates. Moreover, the proposed tracking algorithm is refined by introducing multiple sub-sensing subsets, which further improve the tracking performance. Numerical results and complexity analyses in terms of floating operations (FLOPs) confirm that the proposed approaches achieve better trade-offs between complexity and tracking gain than the conventional Bayesian estimator approaches.},

  abstract     = {This article presents in-depth rate-distortion and outage probability analyses for two-stage successive Wyner-Ziv (WZ) wireless communication networks. The system model assumes Lossy Forward (LF) cooperative communication where lossless reconstruction is not necessarily required at the relay. This paper aims to quantitatively derive the relationship in distortions between the Source-to-Destination and the Source-to-Relay links. Hence, the design parameters are the distortion levels at the relay and destination. The admissible rate-distortion regions are first analyzed for the two stages separately, where the relay is referred to as Helper. The rate constraints with the links involved in the end-to-end (E2E) communications are then derived. Distortion Transfer Function (DTF) is introduced as a mathematical tool for analyzing the distortions of networks having multiple stages. It is shown that the higher the correlation between the Source and Helper observations, as well as the larger the E2E tolerable distortion, the larger the admissible rate region. The outage probability of the two-stage successive WZ system is evaluated, assuming that the second stage suffers from block Rayleigh fading while the first stage performs over a static wireless channel. The E2E outage probability is also analyzed with the distortion requirements at Helper and Destination as parameters in independent and correlated fading variations. It is demonstrated that the decay of the outage probability curve exhibits a second-order diversity in a low-to-medium value range of average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) when the helper distortion is relatively low. It is shown, however, that as long as the reconstruction at Helper is lossy, the outage probability curve asymptotically converges to the decay corresponding to the first-order diversity at high average SNRs.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a favourable technique for future wireless networks to meet massive connectivity and high throughput. The primary concept of NOMA is to share the same radio resource block among multiple users. However, each user has a predefined data rate demand. Under the quality of service (QoS) agreement, guaranteeing all users&#39; diversified data rate requirements is necessary. Therefore, this article mainly focuses on designing a QoS-aware NOMA system with two users from a decoding order and power allocation viewpoint. We evaluate the network&#39;s performance regarding the system&#39;s pair outage probability (POP). To characterize the realistic network&#39;s performance, we assume imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at receivers. Focusing on the possibilities of different decoding orders for a NOMA system, we derive POP expressions in closed-form for each possible decoding order with the linear model of imperfect SIC. To achieve the best pair outage performance of the system, we formulate the problem of minimizing the POP by jointly optimizing the decoding order and the power allocation. The formulated optimization problem is combinatorial. Therefore, we solve it by optimizing pair outages analytically over power allocation for each possible decoding order. Thus, the optimal power allocation solution to the formulated joint optimization problem is provided in closed-form. Lastly, numerical results are presented, which validate the analytical claims and highlight the effect of various parameters on achieved pair outage performance. The results show that following the conventional decoding order and higher power allocation to the weaker user than the strong one is not always necessary. We benchmark the jointly optimal solution against different benchmarks FDFP (fixed decoding order and fixed power allocation), FDOP (fixed decoding order and optimal power allocation), and ODFP (optimal decoding order and fixed power allocation), and obtain average gain of 25%, 41% and 15%.},

Motivated by this, we propose a novel enhanced OTFS with index modulation (E-OTFS-IM) scheme which permits changing the number of active grids conveying modulation symbols from any constellation. The proposed E-OTFS-IM scheme alleviates ambiguous detection by jointly mapping information to grid activation pattern in DD domain and 2D modulation symbols. We also propose an efficient encoding method for E-OTFS-IM. In addition, an updated message passing (MP) detection suitable for E-OTFS-IM as well as its low-complexity improvement are developed. We derive a average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound for our proposed E-OTFS-IM scheme employing the maximum likelihood detector. Additionally, we also propose an enhanced scheme named E-OTFS-IM with in-phase/quadrature (E-OTFS-IM-IQ) to further improve the spectral efficiency and reliability. In E-OTFS-IM-IQ, the principle of E-OTFS-IM is extended to in-phase and quadrature branches independently. The efficient encoding method and MP detector for this modified scheme is also introduced. Simulation results confirm that the derived ABEP upper bound is tight in the high signal-to-noise ratio region, and show that our proposed E-OTFS-IM improves the performance of conventional OTFS and OTFS-IM.

The unified MUSIC JCAS sensing scheme can accurately estimate angle-of-arrival (AoA), range, and Doppler based on a unified MUSIC-based sensing module. The DUC JCAS fusion method can distinguish between the sensing results of the communication user and other dumb targets. Moreover, by exploiting the channel reciprocity, it can also improve the sensing and channel state information (CSI) estimation accuracy. Extensive simulation results validate the proposed DUC JCAS scheme. It is shown that the minimum location and velocity estimation mean square errors of the proposed DUC JCAS scheme are about 20 dB lower than those of the state-of-the-art separated DL and UL JCAS schemes.},

The numerical bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed DPPM-DCSK-WC over multipath Rayleigh fading channels are derived and then verified by simulations. The results demonstrate that the DPPM-DCSK-WC can achieve performance gains of more than 2 dB over the conventional PPM-DCSK and DDCSK-WC for multi-user scenarios, and this gain can be up to 5 dB in the high-delay channels at a BER of ${{10}^{-4}}$ . In addition, the superior performance of the proposed scheme is proved over ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless channels, which indicates its great potential for chaotic-based wireless applications.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the quality of experience (QoE) of video services is one of the main driving forces influencing the development of wireless networks. Multi-connectivity, which allows for the independent transmission of the same data across multiple channels, is regarded as an effective way to improve QoE, especially for users in cell-edge areas. Moreover, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can provide rich spectrum resources for large-bandwidth services, and usually adopt hybrid beamforming structures to alleviate the implementation complexity. Most existing works have not considered the combination of multi-connectivity and hybrid beamforming, as well as their support for videos. In this paper, by considering the above factors, we propose a joint cell association, hybrid beamforming, and power allocation scheme in mmWave networks to improve video users&#39; QoE. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the percentage of satisfied UEs, bitrate, initial delay, and pause durations by at least 13%, 80%, 25%, and 95% over the best performance of all baseline methods, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The performance of holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, employing two-dimensional (2-D) planar antenna arrays, is typically compromised by finite degrees-of-freedom (DOF) stemming from limited array size. The DOF constraint becomes significant when the element spacing approaches approximately half a wavelength, thereby restricting the overall performance of MIMO systems. To break this inherent limitation, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3-D) antenna array that strategically explores the untapped vertical dimension. We investigate the performance of MIMO systems utilizing 3-D arrays across different multi-path scenarios, encompassing Rayleigh channels with varying angular spreads and the 3 rd generation partnership project (3GPP) channels. We subsequently showcase the advantages of these 3-D arrays over their 2-D counterparts with the same aperture sizes. As a proof of concept, a practical dipole-based 3-D array, facilitated by an electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) reflecting surface, is conceived, constructed, and evaluated. The experimental results align closely with full-wave simulations, and channel simulations substantiate that the DOF and capacity constraints of traditional holographic MIMO systems can be surpassed by adopting such a 3-D array configuration.},

As vehicles perform extended sensing, exchanging data with nearby GUEs through UAVs and MBSs links, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that jointly optimizes radio resources allocation and beamforming, while accounting for vehicular application requirements, backhaul capacity limits and interference between GUE-UABS and GUE-MBS links. The model allows also to find a trade-off between benefits and cost of UABSs activation. Two system architectures are considered: a distributed model, where MBSs independently run the Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithm sharing information with each other, and a centralized model, where MBSs send information to the network core, where the optimization algorithm runs. The study investigates interference through two resource allocation approaches, considering splitting and sharing of resources among UABSs and MBSs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of using UABSs to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of GUEs. We also compare the two architectures, considering both resource pool assignments, and highlighting the impact of varying UABSs parameters and activation costs.},

However, a thorough analysis of OCDM under doubly-dispersive channels has not been conducted yet to verify its robustness against Doppler spread as well. In this paper, we investigate the input-output relationship of an OCDM system under doubly-selective channel, where we demonstrate that the circular convolution property of OCDM partially holds even under Doppler spread. Building on previous results, we show the difficulties and problems associated with estimating and equalizing the channel at the receiver side in conventional OCDM systems, especially in case of having fractional delay and Doppler shifts. Then, we propose a new OCDM transceiver by adding fast Fourier transform (FFT) and windowing blocks to ensure channel tap separability and reduce the effect of fractional Doppler shift, respectively. Accordingly, a new channel estimation scheme is developed for the proposed OCDM system. The numerical and simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed OCDM system performance under doubly-dispersive channels over the conventional where the proposed leverages a bit-error-rate (BER) gain in perfect channel state information (CSI) of 2 dB and 3 dB for minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and message passing (MP) equalizers, respectively, and show that it holds great promise as an emerging radio access technology for 6G wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {LoRa has become a promising low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology for long-range communications, enabling various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, LoRa requires appropriate settings of transmission parameters on end devices (EDs) to achieve good performance for different IoT applications. We investigate in this paper power-efficient transmissions in LoRa uplink systems. To adapt to the diverse situations of IoT applications, we define two typical scenarios considering per-ED and sum-ED quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, respectively, to optimize the system power consumption. We formulate the problem to minimize the overall transmit power of LoRa EDs, in consideration of factors such as ED and frequency resource block (RB) pairing, spreading factor (SF) allocation, and ED&#39;s minimum data rate requirement. To solve the joint optimization problem efficiently, we first develop an ED-RB pairing scheme, which computes the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each ED, then sorts the EDs in an ascending order according to their average SNRs, and finally selects one RB with the highest SNR for the first ordered ED and then for other EDs sequentially. We also propose to select the appropriate SF to meet the transmission data rate requirements and adjust the transmit power subsequently to facilitate power-efficient uplink transmissions. Furthermore, the complexity of the proposed schemes are analyzed as well. Both numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes save more than 34.6% power in comparison with the baseline.},

The NOMA scheme is applied to eMBB traffic to provide a higher data rate, while the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme is employed by URLLC traffic to guarantee latency and reliability. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a sum-rate maximization of the system while considering the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for each user. A two-stage algorithm is employed, where the resource allocation problem of eMBB users is first tackled using quadratic and Lagrangian dual transforms owing to the non-convexity nature of the problem. Then, the resource allocation of punctured URLLC users is solved, where a hyperparameter is introduced to control the trade-off between the sum-rate of eMBB and URLLC traffic. Simulation results reveal that the proposed user-centric resource allocation algorithm maximizes the sum-rate while fully ensuring the minimum QoS for all users compared to the conventional algorithms.},

However, existing ISAC technologies still require the allocation of time-frequency resources to sensing.

Then, after some appropriate signal processing procedures, the degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) in the transmit domain is obtained, and the range region numbers, namely the index of the range ambiguity region, are discriminated in the transmit spatial frequency domain. Particularly, echoes from different range ambiguity regions correspond to different pointing directions of the equivalent transmit beampattern. Moreover, in order to obtain the range ambiguity index and angle of the target, a three-stage algorithm is developed to enhance the performance against the effect of amplitude and phase errors. At the analysis stage, the parameter estimation performance is assessed in comparison with the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

This paper targets the identified gap. After providing background on the relevant power losses, three forms of actuation, i.e., torque-vectoring through two or four electric powertrains, active suspensions for front-to-total anti-roll moment distribution control, and rear-wheel-steering, are explored through a set of simulations in quasi-steady-state conditions, by using an experimentally validated high-fidelity non-linear vehicle model. The analysis covers a range of vehicle speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and tire-road friction conditions, and determines: a) the most energy-efficient understeer characteristics, i.e., the loci of the front steering angle as a function of lateral acceleration providing the minimum power consumption, for each set of actuators; b) the energy-efficient actuations for achieving given understeer characteristics; and c) the power consumption penalty of each considered configuration with respect to the one with the complete set of actuators.},

  abstract     = {Handheld phone distraction is the leading cause of traffic accidents. However, few efforts have been devoted to detecting when phone distraction happens, which is a critical input for taking immediate safety measures, not only related to the driver but also important to surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and vehicle networks. This work proposes a fine-grained handheld phone-use monitoring system, which detects the start of phone-distracted driving activities and further distinguishes different handheld phone-use scenarios, which enables estimating the impacts on traffic safety to take measures accordingly. Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if the phone is being held in hand or placed on support surfaces (e.g., seat and cup holder), and the unique signal interference resulted from the contact object&#39;s damping, reflection, and refraction is analyzed based on the sounds that return to the microphone. We derive the short-time Fourier transform to describe such impacts and develop a CNN-based binary classifier to distinguish phone use between handheld and handsfree. Moreover, the system leverages the embedded inertial sensors to capture the phone&#39;s motion dynamics and recognize specific handheld phone distractions (e.g., holding the phone for calling). The system periodically samples the driver&#39;s phone-use status and use an error correction window to correct misclassified samples. As a result, the start, end, and duration of each handheld phone distraction activity can be obtained. Extensive experiments show that our system achieves 99.5% accuracy in recognizing handheld phone-use instances and a 0.76-second median error in detecting the start of a handheld phone distraction.},

  abstract     = {The progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technology promotes the development of energy management research for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). To explore the application of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm in multi-objective cooperative control of HEVs, this article proposes a multi-objective cooperative control strategy based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for a four-wheel drive (4WD) HEV equipped with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, the parameters of the HESS of the 4WD HEV are matched. Secondly, the DRL-based regenerative braking control strategy and HESS power distribution strategy are designed. Thirdly, an HEV control method based on MADDPG is proposed, in which different agents are used for training different control strategies for cooperative control. The results show that the MADDPG-based multi-objective cooperative control strategy can achieve a better cooperative optimization effect than the single-agent DDPG-based multi-objective cooperative control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Lithium battery degradation prediction has received wide interest in battery management systems. Battery degradation also indirectly helps improve the deployment of electric vehicles. This paper pioneers a data-driven battery degradation prediction model based on capacity in combination with modified ensemble empirical mode decomposition, mean impact value (MIV) and bidirectional long and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network. The proposed model exhibits superior degradation performance and improves prediction accuracy. First, the original capacity data are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by MEEMD, and then MIV is added to reduce the IMF dimensionality. Second, the remaining IMFs are used as input to the Bi-LSTM neural network. Then, the degradation value is predicted in the next step. The proposed model is trained and tested on two large datasets. In the analysis of the autoregressive degradation model experiment, the proposed model achieves 0.0110 mean absolute percentage error and 0.0143 mean absolute percentage error on the Ames Research Center dataset. This work proves the feasibility and benefits of using the proposed model and also highlights how feature extraction can be used to improve predictions. According to the analysis of the influence of internal parameters on battery degradation, the role of measured voltage, measured current, and temperature in degradation prediction is about 1/3 on the Ames Research Center dataset. Internal parameters are proven to help predict lithium battery capacity in the case of limited access to battery capacity data hindering degradation prediction based on capacity, bringing a new perspective to degradation prediction.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) experience rapid battery degradation due to high peak power during acceleration and deceleration, followed by subsequent charging and discharging cycles during urban drive. To meet the high-power demands and mitigate degradation, EVs are equipped with larger-sized battery energy storage systems (ESS) results in increasing their cost and reducing their overall efficiency. Battery and supercapacitor (SC) powered hybrid ESS (HESS), offers an appealing solution to overcome the limitations of standalone battery ESS (BESS). Real-time power sharing among the sources in HESS to achieve satisfactory mileage and battery cycle life is a significant challenge when optimizing power management and dimensioning of HESS. However, to overcome these problems, an integrated optimization approach is proposed using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and fuzzy logic-based control (FLC) strategy. In the process of deriving the optimal configuration for HESS, the battery capacity is identified based on the required minimum range. Moreover, the optimal arrangement of the SC module is derived by minimizing battery capacity loss, HESS mass, and overall financial cost over vehicle lifetime. In comparison to a high-power (HP) standalone BESS, the optimized HESS governed by the proposed energy management (EM) technique can prolong the battery&#39;s cycle life by 72.8% and 76.38%, as well as remarkable reductions in ESS life cycle cost-to-range ratio of up to 37.5% and 42.14% when following the standard US06 and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) routes, respectively. Involvement of SC resulted in a substantial 34.3% reduction in the mass of the HESS when compared to the HP standalone BESS. This study further demonstrates that an appropriately tuned fuzzy-logic EM method, which can be seamlessly integrated into a vehicle in real-time, exhibits superior performance in comparison to the basic rule-based approach.},

  abstract     = {Railway point machines (RPMs) are important to make the trains operate efficiently and safely. Thus it is vital to research fault diagnosis. Nowadays contactless fault diagnosis attracts more and more attention. In this paper, a sound-based contactless fault diagnosis method is proposed for RPMs by using novel weighted multi-scale fractional permutation entropy (WMFPE) realized by multi-scale algorithm and synchronous optimization strategy. Firstly, to enhance the fault discrimination ability, novel feature named multi-scale fractional permutation entropy (MFPE) is proposed by introducing the idea of fractional calculus to multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE), which is a more powerful tool. Secondly, considering the effect difference of different permutation, new feature named WMFPE is proposed by introducing weight idea. Then, a multi-scale algorithm is developed to reduce information loss during the coarse-grain process, which can improve the diagnosis accuracy. Finally, a synchronous optimization strategy is proposed to optimize the weights of WMFPE and hyperparameters of support vector machine (SVM) at the same time using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison experiments. Results show the proposed method performs best on fault diagnosis of RPMs with an overall accuracy of 99.33% on reverse-normal and normal-reverse switching processes. The proposed method opens a new window for fault diagnosis on RPMs.},

By utilizing a dynamic switched gain, a switched reduced-order state observer is designed to estimate unavailable system states and uncertain system parameters. Subsequently, based on the Nussbaum gain technique, an output feedback fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed to attenuate the influence of the unknown measurement sensitivity on the system output. In addition, an auxiliary switched system is constructed to make up for the effect of the actuator input delays and faults via the backstepping approach. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop switched system are semi-globally uniformly ultimate bounded. Meanwhile, the displacement of the vehicle body and the unsprung mass can remain within a small origin neighbourhood under a set of switching signals with average dwell time. Case studies are utilized to illustrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed control approach and indicate that better stabilization of switched vehicle active suspension delayed systems can be achieved through the proposed adaptive fault-tolerant control strategy against the unknown measurement sensitivity.},

First, a disturbance observer is employed to estimate the model uncertainties and external disturbances on the nominal vehicle model, which are referred to as mismatched lumped disturbances. On the basis of that, a three-time scale singular perturbation control law is proposed, taking advantage of the time scale separation caused by the different rates of various variables. Furthermore, a novel disturbance observer-based anti-windup modification is developed to handle possible input saturation. And stability for the singularly perturbed system subject to actuator saturation is also established, using a method called “manifold reconfiguration” in a geometric view. This results in a relatively simple constrained controller and reduces implementation complexity. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method for path-following of underactuated AUVs exposed to unknown disturbances and input constraints.},

This article proposes a Visual-LiDAR-IMU fusion method for high precision and robust vehicle localization.

In the back end, two critical strategies are proposed to reduce the computation amount of the algorithm. Where the balanced selection strategy is based on keyframe and sliding window algorithms, and the classification optimization strategy is based on feature points and pose estimation assistance. In addition, an improved loop detection algorithm based on Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is proposed to reduce large-scale drift. Experimental results on the real-world scenes show that the average positioning error of our algorithm is 1.10 m, 0.91 m, 1.04 m in x, y, z-direction, the average rotation error is 1.03 deg, 0.81 deg, 0.70 deg for roll, pitch, yaw, and the average resource utilization rate is 32.04% (CPU) and 13.18% (memory), the average consumption time is 24.87 ms.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising approach for the implementation of autonomous driving. By utilizing a trained DRL model as the longitudinal controller, the automated vehicle (AV) can generate optimal action outputs based on the state within a shorter time compared to traditional model predictive control (MPC) methods. However, the non-interpretability of neural networks poses a potential risk for real-world vehicle operation. This paper focuses on applying the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), a state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL algorithm, to train the longitudinal control model for AVs. We confirm the risks associated with the TD3-based longitudinal control model by assessing its violation of the rational driving constraint (RDC), which represents the basic conditions for normal driving behaviors. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel model that integrates the TD3-based model with the intelligent driver model (IDM) using a new indicator called velocity response time (VRT). This indicator identifies risky outputs of the TD3-based model and calculates the combined weights of both the IDM and TD3-based models. This combination allows us to reduce risks associated with the non-interpretability of the neural network while also capturing the effect of engine time lag. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed combined model. The results demonstrate that the proposed combined model outperforms the TD3-based model, IDM, and another SOTA approach in terms of disturbance mitigation, safety improvement, and suppression of traffic oscillation. Additionally, the combined model exhibits greater computational efficiency than MPC, making it well-suited for real-time control of AVs.},

  abstract     = {The Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoVs) is an advanced approach to vehicular networking that connects specialized vehicles to share and exchange information, such as traffic jams, parking spaces, and more. This work aims to establish a network of emergency SIoVs (E-SIoVs) for frequent communication during vehicle movement across intersections to reduce average occupancy and waiting time. To achieve this objective, this work presents a novel software-defined vehicle networking-based E-SIoV framework assisted by a Smart Traffic Light Controller (STLC). Software-Defined Vehicular Networking (SDVN) based on an E-SIoV network utilizes communication between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) for data receiving and control signal dissemination. The SDVN module generates a congestion prevention signal in the form of a new cycle phase duration. To do this, a modified linear-quadratic regulator, Quantize-LQR (QLQR), is proposed and deployed on SDVN-Controller (SDVNC). Following the output of QLQR as feedback, the proposed max-pressure-based STLC generates effective control signals. Further, two levels of prioritization are implemented in the city to improve E-SIoV movement: i) E-SIoV and ii) lanes with E-SIoV. In the first level, higher weight is assigned to E-SIoV, and in the second level, lanes are prioritized based on the quantity of E-SIoVs. A well-known open-source Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator has been utilized to validate the proposed framework on an Indian city&#39;s OpenStreetMap. The proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on several performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Transportation safety is a very important concern for many decision-makers. Not only does it aim at preventing vehicle accidents, but also saves the lives of individuals who may be distracted while crossing the streets. Various traffic conditions can hinder the visibility of pedestrians and other vehicles when only relying on the local sensors attached to these AVs. Therefore, Cooperative Perception (CP) among Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) is suggested to overcome this problem by utilizing inter-vehicle communication. However, communication network limitations, including limited bandwidth, packet loss, operator compatibilities, or even lack of coverage, can significantly impede the performance of these cooperative perception solutions. To this end, we propose a spatial safety-aware clustering algorithm. This algorithm clusters the perceived objects across AVs. This effective idea allows a decrease in communication payload by approximately 20% and efficiently increases the information reception over an infrastructure-less Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) network by 10% compared to ETSI. Furthermore, we suggest integration of the spatial clustering algorithm with existing baselines, showing improvements of up to 18% for road object perception. Lastly, we propose a Spatial and Temporal Clustering (STC) approach that performs a clustering for information sent over the time domain in addition to the spatial clustering. This further decreases the payload by 41% and increases the perception up to 37% while showing more than a 12X increase in the reception of safety-relevant information compared to ETSI.},

  abstract     = {The use of Internet of Drones (IoD) technology has surged across various domains such as logistics, surveying, industrial inspections, emergency response, security, infrastructure monitoring, crop management, and more. However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns. Due to their unique characteristics, including long transmission distances, unstable communication environments, resource limitations, and the highly dynamic nature of UAVs, ensuring the security and privacy of IoD systems is of paramount importance for the success of IoD-based applications. Furthermore, drones are resource-constrained devices, and employing expensive security solutions is impractical, as it would significantly reduce the operational capacity of drones. In this paper, we present the design of an ultralightweight, secure, and robust user-authenticated key agreement framework for the IoD environment, named USAF-IoD. The proposed USAF-IoD is developed by incorporating authenticated encryption (ASCON), cryptographic hashing, XOR operations, and the use of physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs are employed to enhance resistance against physical tampering attacks. The security analysis reveals that the proposed USAF-IoD meets the essential security requirements of the IoD environment. The comparative analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed USAF-IoD, notably excelling in terms of security and functionality characteristics when compared to existing benchmark schemes, and showcasing competitive performance in computation, communication, and energy overheads.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of multimodal multi-object tracking (MOT) applications based on point clouds and images, the current research predominantly focuses on enhancing tracking accuracy, often neglecting the issue of computational efficiency. Consequently, these models often struggle to exhibit optimal tracking capabilities in scenarios demanding high real-time performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a fast multi-object tracking model based on multimodal fusion (MF-Net). The model is divided into three primary modules: object detection, multimodal fusion, and trajectory matching. Firstly, a 2D detector is used to identify objects in the image and compute their posterior estimate, and a 3D classification network extracts the foreground points of the object from the point cloud. Subsequently, a perspective projection module is then designed to determine the transformation matrix and the minimum number of vertex pairs that map the coordinates of the foreground points onto a 2D plane. Based on the model, a Planar Gaussian Function (PGF) model was constructed to fit small and hard objects that were missed in the image according to the foreground points, thus compensating for the limitations of 2D detectors and ensuring accuracy while reducing training time. Finally, the merged object performs trajectory matching. The performance of MF-Net has been verified through experiments in plenty conducted on publicly available KITTI and nuScenes datasets. In comparison to existing competitive models, our algorithm demonstrates a substantial enhancement in both detection and tracking performance, achieving satisfactory accuracy but showcasing superior real-time efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Traditional decoupling trajectory planning strategy deals with complex urban road scenes with many shortcomings, such as stereotyped behavior and poor trajectory quality. Aiming at these problems, the paper proposes a combined spatiotemporal trajectory planning and control method based on reachable set and optimization technique. Firstly, to address the shortcomings of existing reachable set methods in terms of unreasonable risk characterization and lack of risk consideration in the spatiotemporal corridor generation process, a risk assessment model that takes into account the uncertainty of the predicted location distribution and a reachable set spatiotemporal corridor generation strategy that integrates the risk field are proposed. Secondly, a trajectory optimization strategy of rolling iterative optimization within the spatiotemporal corridor is designed by using the iterative linear quadratic regulator (ILQR) and taking into account the dynamics of the vehicle&#39;s transverse-longitudinal coupling. The optimization strategy ensures the dynamics of the trajectory is feasible and realizes the strong coupling of planning and control. Finally, a safety check module is designed to coordinate the time-consuming corridor generation and the real-time application of the algorithm. To verify the performance of the proposed method, the long-time simulation and real-vehicle comparison tests of complex stochastic interaction scenes are fully carried out. The test results show that the proposed method can effectively realize the coordination between driving efficiency, comfort, and safety in high-density complex traffic flow.},

  abstract     = {Visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) is a state-of-the-art technology for estimating the motion and position of moving objects, such as drones and robots. Tightly coupled methods have high accuracy but low real-time performance, while loosely coupled systems are more efficient, especially for resource-constrained systems. This study proposes a real-time loosely coupled stereo VINS based on point-line features. Unlike filter-based or optimization-based approaches, the pose estimation process is modeled as a control system. Firstly, as a loosely coupled scheme, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data is used as the core of the proposed system. Feedback loops are introduced to correct the IMU bias, including a visual-inertial inter-frame bias estimation feedback loop and a versatile quaternion-based filter (VQF) gyroscope bias estimation feedback loop. Secondly, the accelerometer inclination correction based on VQF is introduced in the IMU propagation stage to account for slow inclination drift. To achieve better visual-inertial calibration bias results, line features are introduced in the visual part to improve accuracy and robustness. The scale of the line features is controlled by judging distance and gradient thresholds to improve the real-time performance of the edge drawing lines (EDLines) algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on the EuRoC MAV dataset and tested on the KITTI dataset. The comparisons with previous methods on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy and real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the over-actuated characteristics, the distributed vehicle has more potential for mobility and controllability than the traditional vehicle, making it more suitable for autonomous driving. Motion control of distributed vehicles still faces significant challenges of adjusting longitudinal speed while tracking the reference trajectory and ensuring stability under complex and changeable driving maneuvers. This paper proposes a hierarchical coupling motion control method for the distributed vehicle considering vehicle posture at the handling limit. In the motion-following layer, a coupling motion controller is presented based on variable-time steps discrete linear time-varying model predictive control (VTDLTV-MPC). To improve the predictive model accuracy, the linearization reference point is updated with the predicted state and control sequence of the last moment. While performing coupling motion control, the vehicle posture is coordinated in the heading deviation to enable the reference sideslip angle tracking. By coordinated control of motion and posture, the distributed vehicle can be handled outside the stability region of the traditional vehicle. In the executive layer, a tire parameter online adaptive module (TPOAM) is proposed to update tire parameters online, which does not rely on complex and multi-parameter tire models or look-up tables. Finally, the proposed controller is verified on the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The results show that the proposed controller can adaptively adjust the longitudinal speed and control the distributed vehicle at the friction circle boundary to fully utilize the chassis performance, while tracking the reference posture to realize the decoupling of yaw and lateral motions.},

This paper proposes a novel loop-closure detection algorithm. It employs ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature points from visual data for loop-closure candidate frame detection, confirms loop-closure frames using depth values mapped from LiDAR data onto images, and finally utilizes GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) raw data to validate and correct trajectory drift further. The paper concludes by validating the stability and robustness of the proposed loop-closure algorithm through simulations with various publicly available datasets, thereby assessing its performance in large-scale and complex environments.

The perception safety evaluation problem has been formulated in a probabilistic framework, and theoretical analysis suggests that the existing geofencing or rule-based safety checking is a simplified version of the proposed strategy. The offline testing knowledge and real-time measured evidence are encoded as conditional probabilities and priors in the Bayesian network. The confidence score of the neural networks is utilized as an auxiliary factor to regularize the perception safety evaluation. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety evaluation for perception systems under virtual and real data in city driving.

To design and manage such ILAC systems effectively and efficiently, quantification of its performance bound, i.e., an analytical model that reveals the trade-off between communication and localization performance, is a crucial yet unresolved task. To address this, we proposed an analytical framework for an ILAC system that achieves communication and localization. Specifically, we derived a closed-form expression of the capacity loss versus localization Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) loss through time-domain and frequency-domain resource allocation. Through simulations, we validated our analytical model and observed that frequency-domain resource allocation is preferable in scenarios with fewer antennas at the next generation nodeB (gNB) and a larger distance between user equipment (UE) and gNB. Conversely, time-domain resource allocation is preferable in scenarios with more antennas and a smaller distance between UE and the gNB.},

Then we propose a block interleaved chirp spreading LoRa (BICS-LoRa) modulation to split the multipath interference into small ones at different positions. The probability of interference peak being greater than the direct path peak is reduced, so does the BER. Experiment results show BICS-LoRa can reduce the peak of multipath interference and may result in BER reduction. Besides, the performance gain increases with SF value in most cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of a new design of the intelligent reflecting surface-non orthogonal multiple access (IRS-NOMA) system by considering all the elements of IRS to provide coherent phase shift to both users in a NOMA pair. In addition, we have designed a phase shift matrix of IRS that combines the components from IRS elements with coherent phases across both the users. The closed-form expression for the user&#39;s outage probability (OP) is derived using the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ) and moment-matching method to assess the system performance. Also, system throughput is evaluated in a delay-limited transmission mode. Numerical results reveal that our proposed system model of IRS-NOMA achieves better OP and higher system throughput than the other existing scenarios of IRS-NOMA networks. Finally, the Monte-Carlo simulations are also presented to verify the closed-form expressions.},

We initially develop a high-performance mutual information maximization scheme using closed cut-off rate expression, formulating a standard convex optimization problem for iterative precoder optimization. To address the computational challenges associated with a large number of the possible transmit symbol vectors, we leverage the convexity of the exponential function to simplify the objective function. This approach results in an efficient bound that depends only on the maximum and minimum terms. Consequently, the corresponding optimization problem requires only two auxiliary variables to optimize the precoder, significantly reducing the computational complexity. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the efficiency of our proposed mutual information maximization schemes in terms of performance-versus-computation tradeoff.},

Specifically, the time sequence signals firstly are preprocessed into time-frequency and constellation diagrams which are enhanced by the reciprocal attenuation model. Then, a multi-channel feature extraction network is designed to generate prototypes by extracting and integrating the multi-modal features. The modulation type of the sample to be tested can be obtained by measuring the distance between it with the prototypes.

However, nonlinear self-interference (SI) introduced by nonideal transceiver components is considered as the main challenge in FD systems. Traditionally, nonlinear SI is characterized by polynomial models, which are computationally expensive. In this letter, a novel neural network (NN) structure, refered to as the convolutional NN with Mish activation function based on knowledge distillation (KD-MCNN), as well as three practical methods for NN design and training are proposed to model nonlinear SI with lower computational complexity. To accommodate hardware with varying computational capabilities, nine KD-MCNN models with different scales are provided. The numerical simulations show that KD-MCNN cancellers exhibit superior performance and computational efficiency compared to both polynomial-based cancellers and existing NN-based cancellers. In particular, the nonlinear SI power can be further reduced by approximately 7.70 dB via the KD-MCNN teacher canceller, which is only 2.48 dB above the receiver&#39;s noise floor.},

In this context, a novel RIS structure, which we refer to as coordinated RIS architecture, is formulated, where different RIS elements can be connected by configurable impedances to eliminate the channel fading. In the proposed RIS architecture, both the RIS element connection pattern and the configurable impedances can be optimized, based on the channel state information (CSI). The proposed architecture exhibits higher optimization flexibility than the state-of-the-art single-connected RIS architecture and group-connected RIS architecture, where only the configurable impedances can be optimized. Specifically, when considering base stations (BS) having a single antenna, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) criterion may be harnessed for designing the RIS element connection pattern, while in the case of multiple BS antennas, the alternating optimization algorithm may be employed for iteratively optimizing the BS&#39;s active beamforming vector and the RIS&#39;s passive beamforming matrix. Our numerical results show that the proposed coordinated RIS architecture achieves higher power gain than the group-connected RIS architecture having the same number of configurable impedances. Furthermore, the power gain in our proposed RIS architecture tends to that of the fully-connected architecture upon increasing the number of RIS elements, while requiring significantly fewer configurable impedances.},

This paper designs a new downlink, multi-user, photon-counting UV FSO communication system that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the received signals subject to non-negative transmit signals and the total transmit power of the transmitter, under the practical signal-dependent Poisson shot noises of UV photoelectric conversion. We first derive a new closed-form expression for the MSE. Then, we show the convexity of the MSE expression and minimize the MSE using convex optimization techniques. The resultant MMSE precoder can effectively combat severe atmospheric turbulence and mitigate multi-user interference. In a strong Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading channel ( $\alpha =2.1, \beta =2.4$ ), it can achieve the average bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-5}$ at 25 photons/bit in the presence of four users, substantially better than the existing techniques.},

We address this issue by deviating from the conventional DNN approach, where the output of the network is merely extracted. Instead, we additionally leverage the weights of the network for the beamformer design. In the training stage, the DNN is trained under specific constraints with the argument of the received signal, which is unknown in the inference stage. The trained network is then split into early and later parts for localization using the combined signal in the inference stage. We extract optimized real-valued weights from the early part and combine them for the design of the complex-valued beamformer. Simultaneously, the latter part becomes the localizing function that returns the position with the combined signal argument. Consequently, joint optimization is achieved via DNN. The inference network performs the equivalent localization task with the trained network without awareness of the received signal. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {A near-field secure transmission framework is proposed. Employing the hybrid beamforming architecture, a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential information to a multi-antenna legitimate user (U) against a multi-antenna internal eavesdropper (E) in the near field. Based on the spherical-wave channel state information of U and E, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to maximize the near-field secrecy capacity. In the first stage, the fully-digital beamformers are optimized. Then, the optimal analog beamformers and baseband digital beamformers are alternatingly derived in the closed-form expressions in the second stage. Numerical results demonstrate that in contrast to the far-field secure communication relying on the angular disparity , the near-field secure communication mainly relies on the distance disparity between U and E.},

Then, a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem of the joint design of the hybrid access point (HAP)/devices transmit power, time allocation, and IRS phase shifts by considering the practical imperfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) and the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model is formulated. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm based on the alternating optimization is proposed. Simulation results show that the user-adaptive IRS beamforming scheme significantly outperforms the static IRS beamforming scheme and also show the benefit of IRS for alleviating the practical hardware requirements for SIC.},

Therein, the time-varying CSF is modeled by the first-order autoregressive random process (AR(1)). The impacts of time-varying CSF on OTFS are studied regarding the sparsity of effective DD domain channel, the achievable bit rate, and the bit error rate (BER) under different equalizers. Through simulation, it is revealed that time-varying CSF reduces the bit rate under least square (LS) and zero-forcing decision feedback equalization (ZF-DFE) equalizers, but decreases BER with higher multipath diversity.},

In this correspondence, we propose two adaptive DOA estimation methods that decompose the large weights of the DOA estimating filter into smaller weights using a complex Kronecker product based low-rank decomposition scheme. The smaller weights of the two proposed algorithms are updated using the normalized LMS (NLMS) and recursive least squares (RLS) principles, respectively. Updating the smaller weights parallelly instead of one larger filter results in significantly lower computations, faster convergence along with competitive steady-state performance. We derive the update rules for the smaller weights and study the computational complexities of our methods.

However, coprime planar arrays do not have a contiguous uniform coarray and the absent virtual sensors in the coarray are referred to as holes. These holes prevent the utilization of the extra DOF provided by the coarray when using conventional array processing techniques. In this correspondence, we present a coarray interpolation technique that fills the holes of the coarray without needing extra physical sensors using an alternating projection algorithm. We first introduce an efficient technique to enhance the rank of the coarray auto-correlation matrix (ACM), which is a rank one matrix, using its two-fold Toeplitz structure and then propose to interpolate the holes of the coarray as a matrix completion problem resulting in a generalized 2D coarray interpolation method. Our method utilizes the properties of the coarray ACM to alternately project the incomplete coarray ACM into different sets of matrices until the final complete coarray ACM with the interpolated holes is obtained. The interpolated coarray ACM is then used to perform 2D-DOA estimation. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Although the multiple tire force constraints are complex, through the analysis of the relationship between vehicle motion and tire forces, the problem could be simplified. According to the vehicle dynamics model and the tire friction elliptical cones, the discrete data of the coupled envelope of the feasible longitudinal, lateral, and yaw angular acceleration of the vehicle were obtained. An analytical model for the coupled limits of the longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motion, ACORN, was proposed and adopted to fit the discrete coupled envelope. Based on the Frenet frame, the longitudinal and lateral information of the trajectory was modeled in the form of multi-shooting and was solved simultaneously. Combined with a trajectory tracking controller, the proposed planning module was verified by simulations and experiments with a real vehicle platform, which was effective for both safer driving in extreme maneuvers and faster racing on the course.},

Weak target signals suffer heavily from heavy noise, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, effective noise reduction is crucial to enable better analysis of target signals. In pulse radar applications, the ambiguity function (AF) characterizes the time response of a filter matched to a given finite energy signal and resembles the form of a $\text{sinc}$ function for several types of transmitted signal waveforms. This paper addresses the problem of noise reduction for pulse radar with such waveforms. In particular, the pulse shape is designed in terms of the AF function. Furthermore, inspired by the fact that the signal subspace spanned by the received signals is dominated by the target echoes, a low-rank filter is developed to reduce noise for pulse echoes in the eigen-domain. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are both presented to demonstrate the improvement of SNR and detection probability.},

However, uplink and downlink radio channels may become non-reciprocal due to the different dimensions of Tx-Rx antenna arrays. In this paper, we analyze the reciprocity of radio channels observed by practical antenna patterns with different beamwidths. Two metrics are leveraged to measure spatial channel reciprocity based on 142 GHz outdoor channel measurement data and 28 GHz indoor ray-tracing simulation data. The power angular spectrum reciprocity of uplink and downlink radio channels does not hold when the beam pattern of base station Tx array becomes much narrower than that of Rx array. Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly likely that in the extreme case (e.g., significant beamwidth difference between Tx and Rx beam patterns), pronounced angle reciprocity can still be observed in the sparse channels with less multipath components.},

  abstract     = {To achieve reliable and seamless content delivery services in connected vehicles, it is imperative to gather and employ road environment information through interactions with the surrounding infrastructure. Furthermore, caching the collected information enables rapid utilization within connected vehicles. For this objective, we propose a scenario that leverages infrastructure components such as road side units (RSUs) and macro base stations (MBSs) to cache road environment information. In this context, the age-of-information (AoI) concept serves as a critical factor for ensuring data freshness in ultra-fast time-varying road environments. Adhering to the AoI concept, it is crucial to maintain pertinent content in RSUs, update it prior to expiration, and distribute it to the targeted user vehicles (UVs). To address this goal, we introduce a two-stage algorithm composed of AoI-aware content caching and delay-aware content delivery, which are ultimately re-formulated using the Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization to ensure optimal decision-making in discrete time units. This strategy aims to enhance content delivery performance by minimizing AoI values in MBSs, RSUs, and UVs. Finally, data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study on asynchronous Federated Learning (FL) in a mobile network setting. The majority of FL algorithms assume that communication between clients and the server is always available, however, this is not the case in many real-world systems. To address this issue, the paper explores the impact of mobility on the convergence performance of asynchronous FL. By exploiting mobility, the study shows that clients can indirectly communicate with the server through another client serving as a relay, creating additional communication opportunities. This enables clients to upload local model updates sooner or receive fresher global models. We propose a new FL algorithm, called FedMobile, that incorporates opportunistic relaying and addresses key questions such as when and how to relay. We prove that FedMobile achieves a convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{NT}})$ , where $N$ is the number of clients and $T$ is the number of communication slots, and show that the optimal design involves an interesting trade-off on the best timing of relaying. The paper also presents an extension that considers data manipulation before relaying to reduce the cost and enhance privacy. Experiment results on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets verify our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, users&#39; demand for low latency and high-quality network services has increased. However, executing large computing tasks on vehicles with limited resources still faces significant challenges. To address these issues, users can offload computing tasks to nearby base stations or servers. Nevertheless, due to the dynamic and complex nature of the IoV environment, obtaining the optimal task offloading policy in real-time is a great challenge. In this work, first we establish a queuing model for the incoming task flow, then we propose a profit function for task computation and offloading that takes into account the delay, energy consumption, and the user&#39;s demand for quality of service (QoS). Considering the dynamic nature and the complexity of the IoV scenarios, we abstract the task offloading as a Markov Decision Process. We choose the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to make the task offloading decision and combine Priority Experience Playback (PER) mechanism to evaluate and select actions so as to output the optimal offloading policy. Experimental results indicate that the offloading decision in our proposed method converges more quickly compared to traditional algorithms.We also discussed the impact of priority experience replay mechanism, learning rate and other factors on reward values. Our proposed method can achieve the minimum latency and energy consumption, effectively adapt to environmental changes, and improve user service experience.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is an emerging paradigm that engages participants collaboratively in completing sensing tasks. The mobility and intelligence of mobile devices offer an efficient solution for large-scale sensing applications, such as in smart cities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), considered as mobile devices, can be integrated into MCS to collaborate with human participants in order to meet the task sensing coverage requirement. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-assisted task allocation method (U-TAM) that allocates tasks to human participants and UAVs concurrently. Distinct from existing methods, U-TAM prioritizes minimizing the privacy leakage of human participants while maximizing sensed coverage. To achieve this, it initially predicts their trajectories using a deep reinforcement learning approach, relying solely on the information provided by their start and destination locations. In addition to the predicted trajectories, the proposed U-TAM allocates tasks to human participants based on their tolerance levels and limited budget. This approach aligns with the Pareto optimal theory, seeking to balance the trade-off among participants&#39; tolerance level, limited budget, and the requirement for task sensing coverage. In the meantime, the UAVs sense data efficiently from areas that are not sensed by human participants or other UAVs. To this end, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for multi-UAV trajectory planning, which integrates the greedy method into deep Q-learning. We evaluate the proposed method using simulation and a small-scale practical experiment. Extensive experiments are used to verify the method&#39;s efficiency.},

In this article, we propose a novel MEC framework assisted by multiple UAVs. Our goal is to balance the computation capacity and the energy consumption to maximize the network utility, by jointly optimizing power control, UAV-TD pairing, computation resource allocation, and UAVs&#39; 3D trajectory. In particular, a flexible fairness-aware mechanism is set to maintain the fairness among these TDs. To solve the problem, we characterize the expected offloading rate on the basis of statistical channel information. Then, we propose a joint optimization algorithm based on the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate descent structure. The proposed trajectory optimization algorithm caters the UAV-MEC missions as the proposed algorithm is dedicated for solving the constrained UAV 3D path planning problems, and the results can be implemented in practice. Numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the computation capacity and the energy consumption, and validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in the terms of improving the network utility.},

  abstract     = {The continuous increase in demand for high-speed wireless systems in vehicular communication has led to the need for efficient, conformal, compact, and reliable antenna systems that simultaneously function in multiple frequency bands. Existing full-duplex filtering antennas mainly suffer from conformality, compact size, and vehicular connectivity, which limit their application on a vehicle. The article presents a compact dual-band full-duplex conformal filtering antenna array with a hairpin resonator, coupling topology for Sub-6 GHz Frequency Range (FR1) and vehicular application to address this issue. The two-port filtering antenna is widely used due to its high isolation and ability to operate simultaneously at different frequency bands. Such quality is used in full-duplex operation mode, which reduces the complexity in RF front-end systems. The proposed antenna has multi-functional abilities such as conformality, filtering characteristics, compact size, and full-duplex operations. It is evident from the analysis that the proposed antenna element works at its fundamental mode (TM 11 ) for the desired frequency band. To verify the concept, a 2 × 2 antenna array in planar and conformal conditions is designed and tested. All the measurement and simulation results are well in agreement, showing two full-duplex filtering channels of 3.41–3.76 GHz and 5.65–6.1 GHz for transmitting and receiving purposes, respectively. The offered antenna also shows excellent performance in port isolation, bandwidth, and gain. In the vehicular integration section, the ANSYS Savant simulation tool is used where the conformal array is mounted in the vehicle (roof, front, and rear bumper), and corresponding far-field characteristics are performed.},

However, more and more content-related traffic requested by users poses challenges to the transmission capability of STINs. Thus, how to provide high-quality content delivery service has become an urgent problem in STINs. In this paper, we leverage the caching capabilities of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and devise a cooperative caching scheme to achieve low latency and bandwidth-efficient content delivery service. First, considering users&#39; diverse request preferences in different geographical locations, we propose a region features prediction model based on the ridge regression method to update users&#39; preference information. Second, according to the similarity of predicted region features, terrestrial regions covered by LEO satellites are further divided into multiple cooperative areas. Third, we propose a cooperative caching algorithm based on game theory to achieve distributed caching decisions in every single cooperative area. By implementing this cooperative caching scheme, terrestrial users can acquire high-quality content delivery service through STINs. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed caching scheme can significantly reduce content delivery delay while saving valuable bandwidth resources compared with the existing ones.},

However, servers deployed at fixed sites are static, while the traffic load on road is highly dynamic, incurring the mismatch between the demand and supply from time to time. In this paper, we study using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to act as edge servers for the IoV in a city-wide area. We first build a model on how to dispatch multiple UAVs to multiple hovering locations where they can cover a maximum number of user requests on discretized time slots. As the problem is NP-hard, we design a heuristic algorithm to solve it in polynomial time, namely the UAV pie-eating dispatching algorithm. Next, we propose a matching-based strategy to reduce the total travel distance of the UAVs when they move between the hovering locations, with the purpose of saving energy. We run extensive trace-driven experiments on the trajectory data of the taxicabs in Shanghai. The results verify that our UAV pie-eating algorithm effectively dispatches the UAVs to different locations at different time to adapt to the spatio-temporal demand variation, and our matching-based path planning strategy also reduces the total travel distance significantly compared with other popular strategies.},

Due to the heterogeneity of rendering requirements and edge servers, how to provide adaptable task scheduling capabilities in edge networks becomes an important issue. However, most related studies regard edge servers as self-interested nodes that make scheduling decisions independently, ignoring the potential power of cooperation among edge servers. In this article, we propose a fully-cooperative task scheduling scheme for virtual reality, taking into account parallel multitasking, the randomness of task arrival and leaving, as well as network load balance. By sharing a common objective among distributed schedulers, tasks can be offloaded to proper edge servers in a cooperative way. We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the number of delay-satisfied tasks in the entire edge network. Next, we treat the edge network as a fully-cooperative multi-agent system and transform the problem into a decentralized partially observed Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). Finally, we propose a cooperative task scheduling scheme based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization to solve the Dec-POMDP. Simulation results show that the cooperation among edge nodes brings the network improvement in terms of offloading success rate, delay compliance rate, and load balance.},

However, without knowledge of vehicles&#39; future locations, wireless connections between vehicles and RSUs are too vulnerable to finish offloading processes. Most existing methods allocate computation tasks statically, ignoring latency between task reception and processing in real IoV environments. Moreover, multiple services running on RSUs limit the availability of resources for offloading which require an efficient allocation of limited available resources. Therefore, this article addresses the vehicular computation offloading problem by predicting vehicle mobility. We first introduce the Estimated Time of Arrival service into the vehicular MEC architecture to predict vehicles&#39; driving state. Second, we formulate vehicular computation offloading as a dynamic process that efficiently selects the offloading location for each computation task and satisfies the constraints of limited available resources to balance QoS and response fairness. Third, the cooperation among RSUs in our work optimizes the task QoS, but it increases the search space causing a high time consumption. We use the Dynamic Programming algorithm to optimize QoS and response fairness in the cooperative computation offloading problem and propose two offloading algorithms. To obtain the performance of our algorithms close to real IoV environments, we propose a fine-grained simulation method based on Veins. We evaluate our and existing algorithms based on real datasets from Erlangen, Germany, and Shenzhen, China.},

In this paper, software-defined network (SDN) technology is adopted for the training control among vehicles, and a novel FEEL framework, namely SDN-assisted semi-decentralized FEEL (SSD-FEEL) is investigated, where multiple edge servers collectively coordinate a large number of vehicular models from different learning tasks. By exploiting the low-cost and similar learning tasks among vehicles and edge servers, SSD-FEEL incorporates more training samples, while enjoying the flexibility of edge server assisted model aggregation. Aiming at motivating vehicles to actively participate in training while improving the model accuracy of multiple learning tasks, a joint contract design and task reorganization problem, combined with the evaluation of model convergence and contract performance, is formulated. Then, we propose a two-stage optimization algorithm incorporating iterative reward allocation and task matching, where the model parameters in different tasks are reconstructed according to the matching results with the mobility constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple data sets validate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher cluster utility and outperform the conventional multi-task FEEL schemes in terms of learning performance.},

  abstract     = {In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, where diverse network slices coexist, the adoption of AI-driven zero-touch management and orchestration (MANO) becomes crucial. However, ensuring the trustworthiness of AI black-boxes in real deployments is challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) tools can play a vital role in establishing transparency among the stakeholders in the slicing ecosystem. But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange—in a closed loop (CL) fashion—soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets. In particular, we quantitatively validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called attribution-based confidence metric that is included as a constraint to guide the overall training process in the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as well as Input × Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions for our proposed in-hoc scheme, wherefore simulation results under different methods confirm its success in tackling the performance-explainability trade-off and its superiority over the unconstrained Integrated-Gradient post-hoc FL baseline.},

The goal of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission is to search an unknown area to detect, connect and monitor multiple randomly distributed targets to the ground control station (GCS) while maintaining the connectivity of the UAVs to GCS. To this end, we propose to use two types of UAVs: search and relay. The search drones scan the area via onboard sensors, whereas relay UAVs provide connectivity. We propose three different responses to target detection with increasing adaptability: (i) follow pre-planned paths and inform GCS when possible, (ii) follow pre-planned paths and inject new UAVs to monitor the detected targets, (iii) assign a search UAV to monitor target, and re-plan remaining UAV paths. Furthermore, we implement multi-objective optimization-based planners for single-type UAVs, where the paths are optimized in terms of total coverage time and percentage connectivity. Our results show that less adaptive schemes detect all targets faster; however, the connectivity of the UAVs and the targets to GCS is significantly better for the adaptive schemes. The joint-optimization methods, on the other hand, in their basic form, trade-off detection time to improve connectivity. When they are used in conjunction with relays, the connectivity performance is improved; however, the overall mission times may be up to 40% higher than our proposed methods, depending on the number of UAVs and targets.},

To that end, we derive a distributed estimation algorithm for cooperative localization over a network of aircraft that are partially connected by communication links and are also connected to ground-based anchor nodes. The proposed framework assumes that only a subset of the aircraft may have access to GPS measurements to perform local state estimation, and that the different aircraft exchange messages with neighboring nodes on the network to improve their own state estimates. Simulation results show that cooperation significantly reduces the average 3D root mean-square localization error when part of the aircraft are flying dead-reckoning and that the average vertical error cumulative distribution function remains below 4 meters for 95% of time when all aircraft have access to GPS measurements.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been advocated as a promising technique to handle computation-intensive and delay-sensitive mobile tasks at edge servers. However, the disparate computing resource distribution among edge servers and the high communication and computation cost make it very challenging to find an efficient task offloading decision. This paper considers a task offloading problem with constraints over a cooperative MEC network, where multiple edge servers and a cloud center collaboratively process tasks received from mobile devices. We formulate such a cooperative task offloading problem as a general convex constrained optimization problem. Different from existing models that focus on a single performance measure, our problem formulation can represent diverse performance metrics, such as service latency, energy consumption, and a combination of both. Moreover, in addition to standard linear constraints, we consider nonlinear inequality constraints owing to resource limitations or delay requirements. To solve the formulated convex optimization problem, we develop a novel distributed algorithm based on gradient projection and virtual queue techniques. The proposed distributed algorithm enables each edge server to compute its task offloading decision via local communications only, which does not require any central processors with possible communication/computation bottlenecks. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal workload allocation decision at a sublinear rate. Simulations verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that it has lower computational complexity than the baseline algorithms.},

Moreover, we propose an improved protocol over a special unknown order group called the hard subgroup membership (HSM) group. The HSM group can be used to construct an efficient additively homomorphic encryption with a trustless setup, which is considered a good choice for privacy protection in IoT systems. However, it is a heavy cost to issue public-key certificates for each IoT nodes in the additively homomorphic encryption scheme. Our improved protocol can be used to authenticate each node&#39;s public key over the HSM group without relying on the public key infrastructure (PKI), which saves much more resources for the IoT systems.

  abstract     = {Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) technology has been widely studied to enhance the spectrum sharing efficiency spatially and temporally in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), where the secondary users (SUs) can opportunistically reuse the channels already licensed to the primary users (PUs) for transmission by sensing spectrum holes. SUs are endowed with the global awareness of channels state by cooperating with each other without sweeping across the whole frequency bands. Since the channels occupation of PUs changes dynamically, the accurate sensing and swift information sharing are crucial for CRNs. The paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based CSS method to help SUs efficiently finding a vacant channel by the cooperation with their partners. 1) Two partner selection algorithms are proposed named as Reliable Partner CSS and Adaptive Partner CSS, respectively. For the former, the partner selection is facilitated based on the historical sensing accuracy of SUs. While the latter takes the comprehensive consideration of both the reliability and geographical distribution of SUs to further improve the sensing accuracy. 2) Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) is adopted to resist the dynamically varying channels condition as well as the high-dimension solution space. With the feature of ‘centralized training and decentralized execution’, each SU learns to interact with the environment and select a vacant channel for transmission by its partial observation, which greatly reduces the communication overhead caused by the cooperative spectrum sensing. 3) Numerical simulation demonstrates the convergence and availability of the proposed algorithms. No matter Reliable Partner CSS or Adaptive Partner CSS, the sensing accuracy can be greatly enhanced comparing with other non-cooperative or centralized learning approaches. Besides, the attention mechanism is introduced to MADDPG for Adaptive Partner CSS to reveal the behavior of SUs by the visualization of attention weight, which helps to partially interpret the ‘black box’ issue of DRL.},

Residual offsets left by imprecise synchronization would lead to SNR degradation at the decoder, yet its elimination remains an issue at low SNRs. In this paper we focus on the accurate estimation of carrier frequency offset, and propose a novel frequency estimator with moderate computational complexity, which has wider, signal-length-independent estimation range and lower variance close to the Cramer–Rao bound (CRB), compared to other existing methods. Based on the proposed estimator, we establish a new structure of iterative synchronization embedded decoder by utilizing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The presented decoder exhibits a capability to significantly alleviate the performance degradation caused by residual offsets and to achieve performance enhancement for both the decoder and synchronizer. Furthermore, we develop a general frequency estimation framework for joint acquisition and fine carrier synchronization, which shows superior performance of low error metric. The proposed frequency estimator and improved frameworks will be of great significance to the implementation of the signal reception in high dynamic wireless communication systems at low SNR conditions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-functional antenna array has an ability to significantly simplify the antenna system in multi-functional radar or communication systems since it can work in multiple frequency bands simultaneously. To further reduce the system overhead, such as RF front-ends and digital processing channels, this paper discusses the joint design of antenna selection and receive beamforming for multi-functional antenna arrays. With the assistance of a RF switch network, $K$ antennas selected from an $N$ -element linear array ( $K&amp;lt; N$ ) only require $K$ RF front-ends and digital processing channels. To maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and control the sidelobe levels concurrently, the proposed multi-functional sparse array design can be formulated into a nonconvex constrained optimization problem with a $l_{2,0}$ -mixed norm regularization. This problem ensures that the selected antenna positions are the same in all operating frequency bands while the beamforming weights of each frequency band are jointly optimized. In virtue of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) and reweighted $l_{2,1}$ -norm approximation techniques, a CADMM-based iteratively reweighted algorithm is proposed to handle this problem effectively, where the original problem is converted into a series of subproblems whose optimal solutions are all readily obtained. The convergence and computational complexity are also analysed. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-functional sparse array remarkably reduces the sidelobe level in all operating frequency bands concurrently while maintains the maximum output SINR, and thus has superior performance on interference suppression.},

  abstract     = {The chaotic communication system can be applied to enhance the security of communication between vehicles by utilizing the randomness of chaotic signals. In the traditional multi-carrier chaotic communication system, its application scenarios are greatly limited by bandwidth constraints and channel noise interference. Thus, the paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the reliability and transmission rate of multi-carrier chaos shift keying (MC-DCSK) systems. The proposed multi-carrier chaos shift keying (DL-IM-MCDCSK) system utilizes deep learning (DL) and index mapping (IM) techniques to mitigate the information leakage risk associated with conventional MC-DCSK systems. The system operates without a reference signal and utilizes a two-dimensional reshaping (TDR) index mapping structure to equalize the chaotic signals in both frequency and time domains. In addition, an auxiliary deep neural network (DNN) classifier with an improved LeNet5 architecture is designed to assist the receiver in information demodulation. The DNN classifier mainly consists of two convolutional layers (CLs) for extracting features of chaotic signals and two fully connected layers (FCLs) for classifying information symbols. The offline-trained DNN classifier can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance during information recovery without requiring conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The performance of the proposed system was evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels (RFC). The simulations demonstrated that the system outperforms various conventional multi-carrier systems in terms of transmission rate, spectral efficiency, and reliability.},

To avoid the exact matrix inversions in IB-DFE receivers, an alternative structure of IB-DFE is proposed in this work. The proposed IB-DFE receiver allows to incorporate the conventional iterative methods such as Richardson iteration, Gauss-Seidel iteration, etc. to replace the exact matrix inversions in the IB-DFE receiver. In addition, this work proposes Chebyshev accelerated Richardson iteration to improve the convergence rate of the conventional Richardson method and incorporates it with proposed IB-DFE receiver.

This scheme facilitates energy and spectrum cooperation between BackCom devices and cellular downlink users in 6G ultra-massive machine-type communications (umMTC) scenarios. Given its quasi-uplink nature, the hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied to further improve performance. The data rate of BackCom devices with high quality of service (QoS) requirements is maximized by jointly optimizing backscatter coefficients and the beamforming vector. The use of hybrid SIC and BackCom yields two non-concave sub-problems involving transcendental functions. To address this problem, this paper designs and compares convex optimization-based and unsupervised deep learning-based algorithms. In the convex optimization, the closed-form backscatter coefficients of the first sub-problem are obtained, and then semi-definite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to design the beamforming vector. On the other hand, the second sub-problem is approximated by using a combination of sequential convex approximation (SCA) and SDR. For unsupervised deep learning-based optimization, a loss function is properly designed to satisfy constraints. Computer simulations show the following instructive results: i) the superiority of the hybrid SIC strategy; ii) the distinct sensitivities and efficacies of these two algorithms in response to varying parameters; iii) the superior robustness of the unsupervised deep learning-based optimization.},

Through a single feed, the antenna triggers the TE 011 and TE 101 modes within the cavity, encompassing dual bands. Concurrently, it integrates slotted elements on various surfaces of the cavity to generate antenna beams distinguished by their orthogonal characteristics. A full-metal cavity provides high power handling capabilities without the need for complex feeding networks. For a 1×4 antenna array, we have employed three different designs: dual orthogonal beams, triple orthogonal beams, and quadruple orthogonal beams. This process is carried out to assess the viability of the designs and to fine-tune the shape of the quadruple orthogonal beams through optimization. Subsequently, a 1×4 antenna array featuring quadruple orthogonal beams is constructed and subjected to measurement. The gains of the array&#39;s orthogonal beams are 9.828 dBi and 9.655 dBi, which demonstrates a close correspondence with the simulated outcomes. This serves to affirm the practicality of the design approach.},

However, in highly dynamic wireless networks, this paradigm comes with a number of new challenges, such as performing user activity detection and channel estimation directly upon packet arrival on top of symbol detection and decoding, due to limited signal overhead. In this paper, we consider an efficient hybrid message-passing algorithm, combining belief propagation with expectation propagation, to jointly perform all aforementioned tasks. A new expectation propagation message approximation rule is introduced for the sake of low-complexity Gaussian message-passing, without compromising the performance. Motivated by the need for non-orthogonal multiple access over frequency-selective channels, we validate the proposed scheme over a multi-antenna OFDM-interleave-division multiple access scenario. Numerical performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing ones in the same context.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate unsourced random access for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Firstly, we establish a high-efficiency uncoupled framework for massive unsourced random accesss without extra parity check bits. Then, we design a low-complexity Bayesian joint decoding algorithm, including codeword detection and stitching. In particular, we present a Bayesian codeword detection approach by exploiting Bayes-optimal divergence-free orthogonal approximate message passing in the case of unknown priors. The output long-term channel statistic information is well leveraged to stitch codewords for recovering the original message. Thus, the spectral efficiency is improved by avoiding the use of parity bits. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the proposed Bayesian joint decoding-based massive uncoupled unsourced random access scheme in terms of computational complexity and error probability of decoding. Furthermore, by asymptotic analysis, we obtain some useful insights for the design of massive unsourced random access. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 6G wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {In maritime data collection scenarios, achieving the rapid delivery of data from buoy sensor nodes to the shipboard station is a challenging issue. Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities. Extensive simulation experiments have demonstrated that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of system Age of Information (AoI).},

  abstract     = {As the power Internet of Things (PIoT) are widely connected and intelligent, the coexistence of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services in power grids is becoming increasingly necessary for precise sensing and control. Specifically, eMBB mainly pursues high data rates, while URLLC requires low-latency and ultra-reliable communications. Since network resources are limited, high throughput eMBB users in a shared environment can adversely affect the ability of URLLC users to achieve low latency and high reliability due to resource contention and interference. Therefore it is particularly difficult to overcome the coexistence challenges in PIoT. In this paper, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based collaborative mobile edge computing (C-MEC) heterogeneous network model for PIoT (PNCM-HetNets). The main objective is to minimize the total energy consumption while while satisfying URLLC and eMBB offload requests. We develop an alternating optimization-based energy-minimizing resource allocation (AOEMRA) algorithm for PNCM-HetNets, which decomposes the joint optimization problem into subproblems of subchannel allocation, power control and collaborative computing resource allocation. Numerous simulation results show that our algorithm achieves approximated optimal performance with reduced complexity and outperforms benchmark methods in terms of energy savings for users.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum sensing is essential for cognitive radio, while wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) capabilities could enable secondary users to seize more transmission opportunities in frequency domain, where the signal location of primary users might be unknown in practice. To ensure the system stability, it is necessary for spectrum sensing under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the detection performance of conventional energy detection (ED) methods is unsatisfactory when the SNR of the primary user signal is low. Motivated by the correlation attribute among frequency points of each signal in the wideband spectrum, this paper studies the theoretical relationship between SNR of the PU signal and frequency correlation parameters, i.e., the size of correlation window (CW) and the value of frequency correlation ratio. Based on this, an Adaptive Frequency Correlation-based (AFC) method is proposed. This method that does not require any prior knowledge specifically considers the detection of low SNR signals. These two parameters related to frequency correlation can be adaptively adjusted according to the SNR of each signal to be detected. Moreover, to ensure the detection performance of the proposed AFC method, we present a low-complexity inflection-point estimation algorithm which is capable of estimating the noise power, SNR and possible frequency-domain position of the signal quickly and accurately. Numerical results show that the proposed AFC method is suitable for WSS scenarios with unknown prior information. It is capable of detecting signals with bandwidths greater than their minimum detectable bandwidths which are determined by the size of CWs. Additionally, simulation results indicate that the AFC method outperforms the state-of-the-art ED methods, as it shows evidently better detection performance for low SNR signals with acceptable false alarm rate.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an adversarial scenario with limited channel resources between a pair of legitimate transmitter-receiver communicated with frequency hopping and an intelligent reactive jammer, where the reactive jammer works in a sensing-then-jamming mode and it requires a time interval (or a sensing-slot) for robust sensing of the legitimate signal. More specifically, the legitimate transmitter can mislead the jammer with a faking-slot transmission in each hop due to the repeated appearance of sensing slots. On the other hand, the intelligent reactive jammer performs a sensing-then-jamming action in each hop, and a dynamically-sensing scheme is employed to estimate the action of the legitimate user, which subsequently prompts the jammer to attack one or multiple channels based on the sensing. Taking into account the intricated interactions between the user and the jammer pair, the anti-jamming problem in each hop is formulated under a bi-matrix game framework, and the necessary and sufficient condition for its Nash equilibrium (NE) is derived. Additionally, we prove that the NE solution of the proposed bi-matrix game is equivalent to the global maximum of the corresponding quadratic programming. Finally, we use the quadratic programming method to find the optimal transmission and jamming strategies for the proposed anti-jamming game in several cases. The numerical results show that the user&#39;s and the jammer&#39;s actions are mainly concentrated in the first half of the hop, and the randomized sensing strategies can make the jammer less sensitive to the legitimate user&#39;s faking-slot transmission.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental catalyst for intelligent transportation systems, the utilization of beyond-fifth-generation (B5G) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has garnered global attention. To tackle the performance challenge, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has stipulated in its Release 17 standard that the 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2, from 24 GHz to 71 GHz) can be employed for V2X communication. However, V2X communication, especially vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, is affected by the Doppler shift and delay spread, which becomes more pronounced as the transmission frequency rises. This presents additional obstacles for vehicle communication in the FR2. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-assisted hybrid precoding method for V2I communication on the 5G NR FR2 band, aming to strike a balance between complexity, reliability, and data rate, while considering the impact of strong Doppler shift and delay spread. Specifically, we present a downlink transmission model using massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) and hybrid precoding to assess the influence of these variables, leading to the evaluation of mismatch probability. Subsequently, a DRL-assisted hybrid precoding method is introduced, leveraging a multi-level codebook to optimize spectral efficiency without excessive complexity. Through rigorous data analysis, we highlight the benefit of incorporating RNNs within the DRL framework, enhancing training efficiency. A comparative study reveals the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) model coupled with RNN outperforms other methods in terms of spectral performance.},

Then we confirm that the proposed SUNet achieves SBD within the improved computation efficiency as long as these two architectural conditions are met. With respect to the SUNet, an effective architecture search (EAS) algorithm is proposed. By applying a subpopulation selection strategy, the EAS algorithm automatically searches the desired architectures to fulfill the two architectural conditions of the SUNet, which avoids the labor-intensive task of manually setting the architectures. Furthermore, when the EAS algorithm calculates the individual fitness value, a parameter mapping strategy is proposed to map the parameters of the trained SUNet to the targeted SUNet as initial parameters, which reduces the number of iterations in the training process of the SUNet. Experimental results show that the SUNet reaches 95% of the upper bound of the scalable sum rate, where the sizes of areas as well as the number of base stations (BSs) and users are 5 times of these in training.},

Therefore, radio propagation characterization and channel modeling in subway tunnels for CBTC are significant for designing reliable wireless communication system. This paper presents extensive narrowband propagation measurements conducted in a subway tunnel at 1.8 GHz and 5.8 GHz with different scenarios, which are straight tunnel scenario, station scenario and curved tunnel scenarios. Based on the measurements, some typical large and small-scale channel parameters are extracted and modeled, such as path loss, shadow fading and channel correlation, fading depth, level crossing rate, average fade duration and envelope distribution of fading. Effects of frequencies, polarizations, tunnel scenarios on wireless propagation are discussed in detail. Generally, higher frequency, vertical polarization, station and tunnel curvature will bring additional propagation losses and larger fluctuations of fading. Moreover, it is found that envelope distribution of small-scale fading is fitted well by Nakagami distribution, and parameter- $m$ is proportional to distance. Results can support realization of subway intelligent transportation system.},

  abstract     = {Underwater acoustic backscatter communication, which allows an underwater sensor node (USN) to communicate with the surface sink node (SN) by reflecting the acoustic signal from the SN, is a promising solution for enabling the Internet of Underwater Things. However, underwater backscattering is vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially from a gliding autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can inject jamming signal to the underwater acoustic channel accordingly. This article considers the attack-defense interactions between the AUV jammer and the SN defender in their transmit power allocations of jamming signals and acoustic signals over multiple USNs. We formulate the strategic power allocation problem for the SN and AUV as an asymmetric anti-jamming Colonel Blotto (CB) game model with a finite budget of total transmit powers. In particular, the competitive interactions between the SN and the AUV is modeled as the competition of two players in the game for limited resource budgets over the battlefield set. We analyze the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to the game, and obtain the closed-form performance bound of the defense power allocation strategy. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed CB game based multi-USN secure transmission scheme as compared to the benchmarks in terms of the expected sum-utility.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge computing network in a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) scenario, e.g., a post-disaster urban area with multiple mobile ground terminals (GTs) for resilience. The mission of the UAV is to first collect a set of computation tasks from multiple GT sources, then process them and make joint decisions (computation results) which are finally transmitted to another set of GT destinations. An efficient design is provided aiming at minimizing the total time cost including costs for the task offloading, computations, and decision transmissions, via jointly designing the UAV&#39;s trajectory and the scheduling of communications from and to different GTs. In particular, we take into account the practical assumptions on the GTs&#39; mobility, on the obstacle avoidance to 3D buildings, and on that the UAV is possible to fly among buildings, i.e., the flying altitude can be lower than the buildings&#39; heights. To address the established complex and non-convex problem, we first provide a problem transformation by exploiting Markov decision process (MDP), and then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach-based solution with a multi-step dueling DDQN (D3QN) method. As a result, an efficient solution is achieved, where the UAV acts as the agent to continuously explore and improve its mobile strategy during interacting with the environment under the proposed method. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed 3D trajectory design in comparison to a 2D one. In addition, the results confirm the robustness of the proposed design in terms of different GTs&#39; mobility models and UAV flying height/area limits, and illustrate the superiority of unrestricted feasible domains for the UAV flight.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing works in the area of covert backscatter communication (BackCom) neglect residual hardware impairments (RHIs) that are unavoidable in practical radio frequency (RF) transceivers, and may have an impact on the communication covertness and reliability. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we investigate a covert cooperative BackCom network under RHIs. To characterize the communication covertness, we derive an analytical expression for the eavesdropper&#39;s detection error probability by assuming the availability of statistical channel state information (CSI). To assess the communication reliability, a closed-form expression for the system outage probability is derived via a high transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximation. Using the above results, we prove that RHIs can enhance the communication covertness but significantly degrade outage performance. To further improve the covert performance, we propose to maximize the minimum detection error probability by jointly optimizing the power reflection coefficient and the detection threshold while satisfying the communication reliability requirement. As the formulated problem is non-convex, we use a block coordinated descent (BCD) method to decompose it into two sub-problems, one of which is shown to be convex and the other one is a decreasing function with respect to the power reflection coefficient in the high transmit SNR regime. Then, we develop a BCD-based iterative algorithm to obtain its locally optimal solutions. Simulation results are provided to verify the correctness of our analytical results and the superior performance of the proposed iterative algorithm compared with the baseline schemes in terms of covertness under the same communication-reliability constraint.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based physical-layer secret key generation (PKG) has been used to overcome the imperfect uplink/downlink channel reciprocity in frequency division duplexing (FDD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing efforts have focused on key generation for users in a specific environment where the training samples and test samples follow the same distribution, which is unrealistic for real-world applications. This article formulates the PKG problem in multiple environments as a learning-based problem by learning the knowledge such as data and models from known environments to generate keys quickly and efficiently in multiple new environments. Specifically, we propose deep transfer learning (DTL) and meta-learning-based channel feature mapping algorithms for key generation. The two algorithms use different training methods to pre-train the model in the known environments, and then quickly adapt and deploy the model to new environments. Simulation and experimental results show that compared with the methods without adaptation, the DTL and meta-learning algorithms both can improve the performance of generated keys. In addition, the complexity analysis shows that the meta-learning algorithm can achieve better performance than the DTL algorithm with less cost.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a promising implementation of RIS-assisted systems that enables full-space coverage. However, STAR-RIS as well as conventional RIS suffer from the double-fading effect. Thus, in this paper, we propose the marriage of active RIS and STAR-RIS, denoted as ASTARS for massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, and we focus on the energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) protocols. Compared to prior literature, we consider the impact of correlated fading, and we rely our analysis on the two timescale protocol, being dependent on statistical channel state information (CSI). On this ground, we propose a channel estimation method for ASTARS with reduced overhead that accounts for its architecture. Next, we derive a closed-form expression for the achievable sum-rate for both types of users in the transmission and reflection regions in a unified approach with significant practical advantages such as reduced complexity and overhead, which result in a lower number of required iterations for convergence compared to an alternating optimization (AO) approach. Notably, we maximize simultaneously the amplitudes, the phase shifts, and the active amplifying coefficients of the ASTARS by applying the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Remarkably, the proposed optimization can be executed at every several coherence intervals that reduces the processing burden considerably. Simulations corroborate the analytical results, provide insight into the effects of fundamental variables on the sum achievable SE, and present the superiority of ASTARS compared to passive STAR-RIS for a practical number of surface elements.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the passive detection of a common rank-one subspace signal received in two multi-sensor arrays. We consider the case of a one-antenna transmitter sending a common Gaussian signal, independent Gaussian noises with arbitrary spatial covariance, and known channel subspaces. The detector derived in this paper is a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test. For all but one of the unknown parameters, it is possible to find closed-form maximum likelihood (ML) estimator functions. We can further compress the likelihood to only an unknown vector whose ML estimate requires maximizing a product of ratios in quadratic forms, which is carried out using a trust-region algorithm. We propose two approximations of the GLR that do not require any numerical optimization: one based on a sample-based estimator of the unknown parameter whose ML estimate cannot be obtained in closed-form, and one derived under low-SNR conditions. Notably, all the detectors are scale-invariant, and the approximations are functions of beamformed data. However, they are not GLRTs for data that has been pre-processed with a beamformer, a point that is elaborated in the paper. These detectors outperform previously published correlation detectors on simulated data, in many cases quite significantly. Moreover, performance results quantify the performance gains over detectors that assume only the dimension of the subspace to be.},

  abstract     = {In dense cities, vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands can deliver massive data rates and bridge coverage gaps, but are prone to 3D blockages and suffer from high penetration loss. Drawing on stochastic geometry theory, this paper studies the downlink performance in a mmWave network of Ground Bases Stations (GBSs) assisted by a finite number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Base Stations (UBSs) under 3D blockage effects of buildings. The UBSs are distributed according to Binomial Point Process within a bounded circular area. To mitigate the significant propagation loss, we deploy multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) at the UBS. The buildings are modeled by a Boolean scheme of rectangles with a height following exponential distribution. To depict a hotspot scenario, the users (UEs) distribution is modeled as a Thomas Cluster Process and gathered around the GBSs. Then, we have developed formulas for LoS/NLoS probabilities, that take into account the density, height, and area of blockages. Assuming shadowing, Nakagami- m fading channels, and using the gamma approximation, we evaluate the coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). In addition, a 3D beamforming analysis is performed. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings reveal that in dense areas, UBSs can improve performance with an optimal number, altitude, and tilt angle, that depend on the target area and the city&#39;s blockage density index. Furthermore, MU-MIMO transmission enhances the ASE.},

The IRS reflects both the desired and interference signals through the same fading channels towards the user equipment. In this scenario, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio might become a ratio of correlated random variables. Therefore, this paper aims to identify practical scenarios in which it is acceptable to disregard or necessary to consider the correlation between the desired and interference signals sharing the same fading channels. Furthermore, in the presence of correlated desired and interference signals, the analytical expressions presented in the existing literature are inadequate for evaluating the system performance. To address this limitation, new accurate expressions for the ergodic capacity, outage probability, and bit error rate are derived, which are applicable to both correlated and uncorrelated scenarios. The accuracy of the newly derived expressions is then validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. In contrast to the existing literature, it is revealed that when interferers have line-of-sight (LOS) components, the desired and interference signals are always correlated. It is also revealed that, in the presence of LOS interference, for a very large number of reflecting elements, the system performance reaches a limit, which cannot be improved by increasing the number of reflecting elements.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid analog and digital precoding technology has been widely investigated recently in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems as low-complexity and low-cost alternatives to fully digital precoding. Most existing hybrid precoding studies aim to improve the system&#39;s performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), or mean square error (MSE), which may have limited BER performance. To improve the system&#39;s transmission reliability, this paper investigates the design of the hybrid precoding/combining for minimum BER in the single-user mMIMO system. First, we formulate an average BER minimization optimization problem, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint and the constant modulus constraints for the phase shifters. Further, we equivalently transform the BER minimization problem into a constrained MMSE problem to make it tractable and consequently derive the closed-form digital precoder that can achieve the derived lower bound of the average BER. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) to jointly design the analog precoder and combiner, where a high-performance manifold optimization (MO)-based algorithm and a low-complexity coordinate descent (CD)-based algorithm are presented to overcome the difficulty incurred by the constant modulus constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed minimum BER hybrid precoding significantly outperforms the existing hybrid precoding in terms of BER and achieves the same level as the benchmark schemes in terms of SE.},

Objective of this paper is to characterize the performance of 5G new radio (NR) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink, in terms of lower bounds for sensing purposes; specifically, we evaluate the impact of physical and radio access communication parameters on the sensing performance in terms of detection capability and parameter estimation quality. As a result, it is shown how the effect of the presence of multiple vehicles in the scenario, and the inherent resource allocation policies, have a non-negligible impact on the communication and sensing performance. In particular, it is shown that when considering the interference of multiple vehicles, the influence on sensing performance of the chosen radio parameters, such as bandwidth, modulation and coding scheme, and packet size is different compared to the inference free case.},

Considering these impairments, we derive closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expressions for both RUs and DUs, which observe correlated Rician channels. Our theoretical findings reveal that increasing relay antennas mitigate the DU interference experienced by the RUs. The DUs, in contrast, require additional power scaling at relay to suppress the relay interference. We optimize the non-concave weighted sum SE metric of our system by exploiting minorization-maximization (MM) framework. We show that i) underlaying D2D users not only improve the system SE, but also energy efficiency; and ii) a DF relay can tolerate more hardware impairments than its amplify-forward counterpart.},

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework to tackle the challenges of joint sensing and communication optimization in the considered target-mounted STARS assisted vehicle networks. By deploying agents on both RSU and vehicle, the MADRL framework enables RSU and vehicle to perform beam prediction and STARS pre-configuration using their respective local information. To ensure efficient and stable learning for continuous decision-making, we employ the multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) algorithm and the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm on the proposed MADRL framework. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed MADRL framework in improving both sensing and communication performance through the utilization of target-mounted STARS. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis and comparison of the two proposed algorithms under various environmental conditions.},

For this generic channel model, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic capacity, and also investigate the analytical calculation of the average energy efficiency. The presented results allow us, for the first time, to study the impact of different shadowing conditions, including correlation effects, in aerial communications systems that are also supported by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and mobile edge computing (MEC) have been considered as two promising technologies to satisfy these requirements. However, successive interference cancellation (SIC) and grouping operations in NOMA as well as delay-sensitive IoVT video tasks with different priorities make it challenging to achieve optimal performance in NOMA-assisted IoVT with MEC. To address this issue, we formulate a joint optimization problem where both NOMA operations and MEC offloading are involved, to minimize the weighted average total delay. To tackle such an intractable problem, we proposed a graph theory-based optimization framework, then decompose and transform the problem into finding negative loops in the weighted directed graph. Specifically, we design a priority-based SIC decoding mechanism and propose convex optimization-based power allocation and computing resource allocation algorithms to calculate the adjacency matrix. Then, two negative loop searching algorithms are adopted to obtain the device association and grouping strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces the weighted average total delay by up to $92.43\%$ as well as improves the transmission rate of IoVT devices by up to $79.1\%$ .},

To achieve the dual-polarized ultra-wideband operation in the millimeter-wave band, tightly coupled dipoles are adopted as the array elements. Moreover, based on resonance analysis, the dipole is elaborately designed as an arrowhead shape to shift a TE-mode resonance out of the operating band. Due to a pair of capacitive patches connected to the dipole feeding structure, the highest operating frequency increases significantly, which in turn broadens the antenna bandwidth. To achieve improved wide-angle scanning ability, a meta-surface wide-angle impedance matching (MS-WAIM) layer is employed. The surface waves guided by the MS-WAIM layer are suppressed by adding cross-shaped metal structures at the critical positions within the WAIM layer. Simulated results indicate that the proposed array can scan up to ±60 ° in E/H planes with active VSWRs &lt; 3. An 8 × 8 array prototype is fabricated to validate the accuracy of this design.

In this paper, we investigate a joint resource orchestration problem for IoT-MMEC networks with different service performances. We first develop an identifier space mapping model to represent the matching relationship between access attributes and space resources, which respectively denote the computing task description and the set of allocated resources. To obtain an optimal resource partition policy for dependable and low-budget auxiliary calculation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we devise an identifier-driven resource orchestration scheme, which decouples the problem into computation offloading and resource allocation subproblems. Based on the expected utility function theory and access attributes, we apply a mixed deep neural network inference model to infer the offloading location, for realizing the resource supply-demand balance. To derive the optimal resource allocation scheme, we exploit the quantum genetic algorithm and multi-path offloading factor, which can explore a large search space to find potential solutions while exploiting the best solutions. Finally, the experimental simulations validate our theoretical analysis, and the results indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve lower consumption and enhance offloading reliability.},

Given the practical energy constraints of satellite systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, effective Energy Cost (EC) control assumes paramount importance in the realm of system design. This article studies the age-energy balanced Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest with Chase Combining (HARQ-CC) protocol for polar-coded status update systems in SAGIN. We establish a practical polar-coded status update system in the SAGIN and introduce an update cost metric according to the decision-maker&#39;s preference to measure the age-energy performance. Based on the cost performance analysis of the polar-coded HARQ-CC, we propose an improved HARQ-CC strategy, which minimizes the cost by optimizing the information set and code length of polar-coded HARQ-CC. Considering the long-distance and complicated environment in SAGIN, we further develop a threshold-based fast HARQ-CC to reduce the end-to-end latency and EC. By exploiting the SNR-cumulative effect in HARQ-CC, the proposed fast scheme adaptively skips the unnecessary decoding and feedback operations to cope with the SNR-varying environment. Simulations verify the superiority of the improved HARQ-CC and threshold-based fast HARQ-CC schemes compared to the traditional HARQ-CC in terms of the update cost.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) demonstrate the potential to improve the spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate multiple-RIS-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications. Specifically, we generalize the existing RIS concept conceived for frequency-flat channels to the adjustable-delay RIS by introducing varactor diodes. In contrast to conventional reflecting elements, each adjustable-delay RIS element is capable of storing and retrieving the impinging electromagnetic waves upon dynamically controlling its electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), thus imposing an extra delay onto the incident signals. This allows for aligning multiple signal copies via multiple RISs. To this end, we formulate a rate-maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the RIS reflection coefficients as well as the RIS delays. To address the coupling issue between these optimization variables, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find a high-quality solution to the non-convex design problem by alternately optimizing the transmit power allocation and the RIS reflection pattern, including both the reflection coefficients and the delays. Furthermore, we conceive a low-complexity reflection optimization scheme upon aligning the strongest taps of all reflected channels, while ensuring that the maximum delay spread introduced by extra RIS delays does not exceed the length of the cyclic prefix. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design significantly improves the achievable rate as well as the RIS&#39;s adaptability to wideband signals compared to various benchmark schemes operating without adjustable-delay RIS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a fundamental trade-off between the adjustable delay margin to align different reflected channels and the practical component&#39;s power decay caused by delay.},

In this article, UAV trajectory optimization techniques for free space optics (FSO) communication is studied, especially considering the atmospheric effects of clouds on FSO links. In this model, UAVs communicate with ground terminals (GTs), where UAVs are deployed inside the service boundary. In the presence of clouds, the service boundary will experience disparity in the FSO channel, and thus the UAV deployment will be constrained to places where there is little or no cloud attenuation to satisfy the target data rate. Therefore, several cloud properties (including irregularity in shape) have been considered in finding the communication feasible polygon (CFP). To perform convex optimization of the UAV trajectory, the CFP was transformed into convex subsets, and an algorithm that can find the largest inner convex CFP (ICCFP) is proposed. Using the maximum ICCFP area derived combined with an energy efficiency (EE) ratio maximization trajectory algorithm, the cloud avoidance convex area energy-efficient trajectory optimization (CA2ET) algorithm is formed. Numerical results show that the proposed CA2ET algorithm achieves significantly higher data rates and longer connection time between the GT and the UAV, compared to the existing EEMCT and LCFTM algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To cope with the extremely double-dispersive channels in underwater acoustic (UWA) communication, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been regarded as a potential candidate since delay-Doppler symbols can fully utilize the time-frequency diversity. So far, limited work has been devoted to UWA-OTFS systems, and the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in UWA channels is always ignored in these researches, which causes severe performance degradation and even transmission failure. Though the DSE-aware modeling has been investigated for OTFS-based mobile communications in our prior work, the assumption of system constraints cannot be satisfied in UWA-OTFS scenarios due to the significantly smaller velocity of sound, which forces us to reconsider the input-output evaluation and the corresponding system design. In this article, UWA-OTFS systems are carefully investigated considering DSE. The intuitive characterization of the input-output relation for ideal waveforms is derived at first, where we also offer the design principle of system parameters. The precise closed-form representation with practical waveforms is then provided as the guideline for realistic UWA-OTFS systems. Based on the establishment of the input-output analysis, the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector is applied to carry out the equalization and data recovery iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate the significance of considering DSE in UWA-OTFS systems and the excellent performance of our proposed detection scheme.},

Nonetheless, the task remains highly formidable due to the complex road characteristics and the large computational burdens involved. Consequently, the co-optimization technique in off-road scenarios has rarely received scholarly attention. This paper presents an integrated-optimization control framework with active safety module, a cooperative optimization controller, and a path tracking controller for an autonomous HEV. The active safety module deduces the restrictive relationship of both the environment and the vehicle&#39;s lateral stability on the power distribution and then determines a reasonable feasible region for cooperative optimization. Besides, the model predictive control (MPC)-based control strategies are designed to achieve satisfying control performance for the co-optimization and the path tracking with the stability constraint conditions. Additionally, a continuation/ generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is developed to mitigate the huge computation burden of the online nonlinear MPC controller, thereby benefiting from real-time control capability. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control framework and strategy can achieve an efficient power split and path tracking efficacy while greatly reducing the computational burden in the complex off-road scenarios.},

Given that 1) internal and external driving conditions such as driving maneuvers, road surfaces, and unwanted external disturbances affect vehicle yaw dynamics and 2) the tire cornering stiffness and understeer gradient are decisive parameters in yaw dynamics, the proposed strategy adapts online to these two parameters. Moreover, the proposed strategy adopts an adaptive update rate during the adaptation process to ensure robust disturbance rejection performance under various driving conditions. All control laws are defined solely based on measurable information in mass-production vehicles, without any knowledge of road-tire conditions or uncertainty bounds. In experimental tests, the proposed strategy shows improved control precision, accuracy, and robustness compared to PD controller and non-adaptive SMC. As a result, the proposed adaptation strategy improves the maneuverability of IWM vehicles in both dynamic cornering and straight-line driving situations.},

  abstract     = {Brake-by-wire system (BBW) is quite important for the development of high-level autonomous vehicle which requires fully decoupled structure and superior braking performance. Integrated braking system (IBS) is a state-of-the-art technology of hydraulic BBW, consisting of mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems. However, the inherent nonlinear characteristics of hydraulic transmission dynamics cause delays and fluctuations in wheel cylinder pressure (WCP), which significantly impact brake performance and passenger comfort. Furthermore, the coupling of the subsystems within the IBS system amplifies the intricacies and challenges associated with controller design. This paper proposes a WCP control architecture to shorten the response time of WCP, suppress pressure fluctuation, and ensure stability. Further, a combined extended state observer (CESO) is designed to estimate unmeasurable states and total disturbance which includes model mismatch, uncertainties, and friction. Additionally, a WCP nonlinear controller (WNC) based on the backstepping method is designed and proved stable theoretically. The response time has been shortened 30 $\mathbf{\%}$ approximately and the tracking precision has been improved 50 $\mathbf{\%}$ approximately. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control architecture accurately estimates states, suppresses disturbances, meanwhile improves braking performance. The effectiveness and practical application of this control architecture are further validated through experiments on a test bench.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (IPHEVs), with advanced environmental sensing and integrated communication capabilities, present tremendous autonomy in drive decision-making and high efficiency in energy economy. In this context, the key control of IPHEVs gradually evolves from energy management among the key components of powertrain to the co-operative velocity planning and energy management, which, nonetheless, are strongly coupled. To tackle it, an intelligent strategy based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is explored to online co-optimize the longitudinal traction and energy management of IPHEV, especially in vehicle-following scenarios. The imbedded cooperative critic and actor networks are constructed to endow the ADP with satisfactory learning capability and calculation speed. The instantaneous reward integrating the nonlinear characteristics of IPHEV powertrain is designed for online learning of critic and actor networks. Substantial simulations demonstrate that the developed ADP is computationally efficient to ensure the driving comfort, safety, and fuel economy of the studied IPHEV when simultaneously planning the vehicle speed and allocating the power within the powertrain. To be specific, the developed strategy can reach 98.01% and 94.22% energy optimality of dynamic programming under urban and mixed driving conditions.},

Existing research mostly starts from a global view, treating the entire trajectory as a detection target to determine whether it is anomalous. However, they failed to fully capture the influence of sub-trajectories on the entire trajectory, thus ignoring some anomalous sub-trajectories. This study proposes an anomalous sub-trajectory detection method (GCSL-ASD) based on graph contrastive self-supervised learning, which identifies anomalous sub-trajectories by mining the supervisory information of trajectory data itself. First, we used map matching to project all historical trajectories onto the road network to achieve more accurate trajectory data representation. Then, to enable the model to transform the detection target from individual trajectory segments to sub-trajectories and thus capture anomalies more accurately, we designed a sub-trajectory aggregation module to aggregate continuous trajectory segments into sub-trajectory. Finally, we used graph convolutional network (GCN) to design the generation module and contrastive learning module to capture sub-trajectory anomalies in attribute space and structure space. We conducted comparative experiments on three real datasets to verify the effectiveness of this method and analyzed the reasons for the driver&#39;s local detour behavior.},

  abstract     = {Model-free learning-based control methods have recently shown significant advantages over traditional control methods in avoiding complex vehicle characteristic estimation and parameter tuning. As a primary policy learning method, imitation learning (IL) is capable of learning control policies directly from expert demonstrations. However, the performance of IL policies is highly dependent on the data sufficiency and quality of the demonstrations. To alleviate the above problems of IL-based policies, a lifelong policy learning (LLPL) framework is proposed in this paper, which extends the IL scheme with lifelong learning (LLL). First, a novel IL-based model-free control policy learning method for path tracking is introduced. Even with imperfect demonstration, the optimal control policy can be learned directly from historical driving data. Second, by using the LLL method, the pre-trained IL policy can be safely updated and fine-tuned with incremental execution knowledge. Third, a knowledge evaluation method for policy learning is introduced to avoid learning redundant or inferior knowledge, thus ensuring the performance improvement of online policy learning. Experiments are conducted using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic model in various scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed LLPL framework can continuously improve the policy performance with collected incremental driving data, and achieves the best accuracy and control smoothness compared to other baseline methods after evolving on a 7 km curved road. Through learning and evaluation with noisy real-life data collected in an off-road environment, the proposed LLPL framework also demonstrates its applicability in learning and evolving in real-life scenarios.},

To deal with the uncertainties caused by unknown disturbances and additive faults, the self-organizing neural network (NN) is employed to estimate these composite unknown dynamics. The structure of the NN can be dynamically adapted according to the complexity of the fitted function, which avoids excessive computational burden. A fault-tolerant estimation law is designed to minimize the impact of AUVs when they are subject to actuator partial multiplicative faults, and the actual fault-tolerant controller is designed based on the dynamic event triggering strategy, which reduces the updating frequency of the control inputs while guaranteeing the safe operation of the system. The proposed control framework enables the AUV to ensure the prescribed tracking accuracy during the tracking process, improving tracking safety and reducing energy consumption for accomplishing the task.

The safe operation and optimized navigation of drone swarms are now growing concerns. In this article, we use distributional reinforcement learning to prevent drone collisions via aerodynamic acceleration and deceleration. Although the instantaneous acceleration or deceleration of drones during an encounter influences drone kinematics, we note that drone kinematics itself can prevent collisions via instantaneous acceleration or deceleration. This article&#39;s central question, then, is how to take drone kinematics into account to improve air traffic intersection flow performance. First, the intercommunication between drone swarms is established via an Internet of drones to send and receive the current state of each drone in the swarm and detect potential collisions. In the presence of obstacles, we first use distributional reinforcement learning to find the inevitable change in kinematic height and guide descents and ascents through air traffic intersections. Here, the drone&#39;s energy consumption during instantaneous acceleration or deceleration cannot be ignored. A properly designed speed control is crucial to the power management of the drone. Distributional reinforcement learning is used to control drone acceleration and deceleration to avoid collision risk while minimizing energy consumption according to the reference energy recorded by each drone. We flew drones to gather energy consumption data and, to validate our approach, we subsequently conducted simulations in which travel time and energy consumption were measured. We demonstrate that the proposed kinematics-based drone collision avoidance method exhibits excellent performance in terms of travel time and power management.},

  abstract     = {Potential Field-based path planning methods are widely embraced in the context of autonomous vehicles due to their real-time efficiency and simplicity. While the potential field effectively enforces a rigid road boundary to keep the vehicle within the confines of the road, it can lead to the “blind alley” problem caused by local minima in specific high-speed scenarios, resulting in indecision, erratic behavior, or even accidents. Therefore, the objective of this research is to anticipate and address the aforementioned problem in order to proactively avoid potential collisions. We have also found that existing methods do not offer a root cause analysis or practical solutions for this issue, which limits the practicality of the potential field in handling complicated traffic situations. In this paper, we propose an Emergency-Stopping Path Planning (ESPP) approach that incorporates an adaptive potential field with the clothoid curve. First, we design an emergency triggering estimation to detect the “blind alley” problem. Second, we regionalize the driving scene to search for the optimal breach point on the road PF and the final stopping point for the vehicle by considering the motion range of the obstacle. Finally, we use the optimized clothoid curve to fit these calculated points under vehicle dynamics constraints to generate a smooth emergency avoidance path. The proposed ESPP method was evaluated by conducting the co-simulation between MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim Simulator in a freeway scene. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method shows increased performance in emergency collision avoidance and renders the vehicle safer, in which the duration of wheel slip is 61.9% shorter, and the maximum steering angle amplitude is 76.9% lower than other potential field-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Generating reliable autonomous driving policies is an important goal in developing future transportation systems. Deep reinforcement learning has the potential to achieve this goal. However, policies generated by conventional deep reinforcement learning suffer from poor zero-shot generalization in the face of changes in environment conditions. Domain randomization may provide a solution, yet it brings a high degree of variance and unpredictability to the training process. We utilize multi-teacher policy distillation to circumvent this risk. However, conventional multi-teacher policy distillation paradigms present some issues. First, the teacher agent population is not diverse enough to provide the student agent with various knowledge. Second, the student agent only learns the output activations of teacher agents, without fully leveraging the guidance of teacher agents. Third, some teacher agents may dominate the training process, leading to the neglect of knowledge imparted by other teacher agents. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage multi-teacher policy distillation framework. The first stage is based on a k-determinantal point process. Training environments with dissimilar parameter settings are selected, diversifying the pre-trained teacher agents and providing the student agent with various knowledge. In the second stage, a gradient matching mechanism is applied to enable the student agent to benefit from gradients from multiple teacher agents. In the last stage, we propose a regulation mechanism to adaptively adjust the impact of each teacher agent on the student agent. This mechanism ensures balanced influence from each teacher agent. Experimental results show that our proposed framework effectively improves zero-shot generalization performance in environments with unseen conditions. Additionally, we analyze the influence of some key factors of our proposed framework.},

To alleviate the above issues, this article proposes a novel hybrid gated recurrent unit and temporal convolutional (GRUTC) neural network to evaluate driving safety. First, an evaluation framework consisting of ten indicators is constructed, including evaluating component safety and risky driving behaviors. Second, a long-short sample scoring rule is proposed to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of driving safety. The safety score is first evaluated based on the short samples, consisting of eight actual sampling points. Then, a comprehensive safety score is evaluated based on a long sample, which consists of nine consecutive short samples. Third, all four datasets are evaluated to establish the evaluation model. Verified by the yearlong operation data of dataset #1, the proposed method shows higher evaluating performance than commonly used methods. More importantly, a novel transfer learning method based on accumulated training with progressive datasets is proposed to improve the generalization. A stable and remarkable evaluating accuracy is obtained with the MAPE of 2.68% when the model is directly tested with dataset #4 after two transfers. The aim of this article is to assess the driving safety of real vehicles by means of “driver-vehicle-road” multidimensional indicators and to improve the accuracy of the assessment by using the GRU-TCN model.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to these behaviors due to its powerful environmental adaptability. However, typical RL-based research focused solely on one directional decision-making or output discrete actions in both lateral and longitudinal directions, which is not sufficiently flexible for AD. In view of the close interaction between lane-changing and car-following tasks, this study proposed an integrated framework to realize coupled decision-making using RL. Specifically, double deep Q-network (DDQN) was used to make the lateral lane change command decision-making, and twin delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) used to make longitudinal car-following acceleration decision-making. The integration of DDQN and TD3 was deployed to tackle the problem of discrete-continuous hybrid action space in RL. The lateral decision-making was integrated into the actor-critic network for longitudinal decision-making to generate accurate acceleration in lane-changing or lane-keeping conditions. A series of simulation experiments were conducted in typical two-lane straight driving scenarios, validating the feasibility and applicability of the proposed integrated framework. The results reveal that the RL-based coupled decision-making helps enhance the implementation of AD.},

  abstract     = {Motion cueing algorithms (MCA) are used to control the movement of motion simulation platforms (MSP) to reproduce the motion perception of a real vehicle driver as accurately as possible without exceeding the limits of the workspace of the MSP. Existing approaches either produce non-optimal results due to filtering, linearization, or simplifications, or the computational time required exceeds the real-time requirements of a closed-loop application. This work presents a new solution to the motion cueing problem, where instead of a human designer specifying the principles of the MCA, an artificial intelligence (AI) learns the optimal motion by trial and error in interaction with the MSP. To achieve this, a well-established deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is applied, where an agent interacts with an environment, allowing him to directly control a simulated MSP to obtain feedback on its performance. The RL algorithm used is proximal policy optimization (PPO), where the value function and the policy corresponding to the control strategy are both learned and mapped in artificial neural networks (ANN). This approach is implemented in Python and the functionality is demonstrated by the practical example of pre-recorded lateral maneuvers. The subsequent validation shows that the RL algorithm is able to learn the control strategy and improve the quality of the immersion compared to an established method. Thereby, the perceived motion signals determined by a model of the vestibular system are more accurately reproduced, and the resources of the MSP are used more economically.},

  abstract     = {Most existing research on autonomous vehicle groups mainly focuses on semi-centralized network control, without considering computational difficulties caused by the increasing amount of data. Under external inherent disturbances, it is difficult for autonomous vehicle groups to realize cooperative computing. To cope with these problems, an autonomous vehicle group cooperative model in a highway scene based on edge computing is given. First, a new vehicle-to-vehicle computation offloading method is defined and a hierarchical multi-role autonomous vehicle group formation method is given based on it. Next, the evolution events of vehicle groups are investigated and a dynamic evolution algorithm is proposed. Finally, an autonomous vehicle group cooperation model is proposed by considering the reliability, cooperativeness, punctuality, stability, and evolvability of an autonomous vehicle group. Simulation results show that the proposed method can form higher-performance vehicle groups than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by connected and autonomous driving technologies, this paper proposes a closed-loop Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) method to address the problem of longitudinal platoon control disturbed by V2V communication noise. In particular, a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based vehicle platoon control model subject to stochastic disturbances is first developed. Vehicle control and state are imposed with probabilistic chance constraints, and a state feedback structure is designed to ensure the stability of the platoon system, which poses a significant challenge to the platoon control system. To solve this computationally intractable DRMPC model, a Ball ambiguity set is constructed using the characteristic information (expectation and variance) of random variables. The original DRMPC model is reformulated into a computationally tractable robust counterpart approximation framework. Furthermore, the recursive feasibility of the proposed DRMPC and the string stability of the platoon vehicles are demonstrated by introducing an initialization strategy for nominal states. Finally, a simulation study in a platooning system consisting of six vehicles is performed to verify the validity of the DRMPC model under stochastic V2V noise disturbances.},

Firstly, an equivalent linearization model of MHSTs and a transmission model accounting for sensor bias are constructed. Subsequently, a distributed model free adaptive iterative learning control (MFAILC) scheme using quantized signals is proposed. We then prove that the tracking error under the quantizer-based MFAILC is uniformly ultimately bounded, followed by further investigation on the impact of uniform quantizers. Finally, through a series of test conducted on the StarSim hardware-in-loop (HIL) semi-physical platform using quantified indicators, both the learning advantages of MFAILC and the influence of the quantization mechanism and measurement bias on MHSTs are verified.},

To avoid collision when the driver is stressed to produce an unreasonable handwheel steering input, this paper proposes a cooperative control strategy of emergency collision avoidance for human-machine shared driving. The improved circular arc docking collision avoidance path is adopted in the collision avoidance path planning layer based on the relative motion state and position relationship between the vehicle and the obstacle, and its geometric discontinuities are smoothed considering vehicle size and common driver steering perception. A nonlinear dynamics model of the vehicle is established in the tracking control layer, and a multi-constraints Model Predictive Control (MPC) method is utilized to calculate the additional yaw moment to correct for driver&#39;s excessive stress handwheel input. A brake wheel preference and torque distribution strategy are used to ensure vehicle stability. The co-simulation results show that the cooperative control algorithm efficiently ensures the safety and stability of human-machine shared driving vehicles in emergency collision avoidance at high speeds and low road adhesion coefficients.},

In this paper, the high-precision direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem is solved by using a deep learning (DL) framework. Most existing on-grid DL-based methods have an upper limit of one-degree resolution. The DOA estimation performance under such resolution is still far behind conventional methods, and is not accurate enough in practical applications. Hence, we introduce a two-stage multi-layer perceptron (TS-MLP) framework to achieve higher resolution of DOA estimation with low complexity by dividing the problem into two main parts. The first MLP is used to determine the coarse grid point nearest to the source angle, and the second MLP fine tunes the estimate within the coarse grids. In addition, we propose a solution to the source association problem between the two stages when handling multiple targets. Our scheme shows much higher accuracy compared with existing DL-based methods, and has comparable performance with traditional high-resolution methods. Moreover, it performs quite robust in the presence of array imperfections.},

The TOBC technique is proposed and investigated by introducing the concept of an imaginary physical plant and equivalently treating the controller as a special unknown input observer (UIO). Unlike the existing disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) (also known as UIO-based control) with a two-stage design procedure, the proposed TOBC method only requires the design of one UIO. In the TOBC framework, two identical UIOs are used to estimate the total disturbance and generate control commands, respectively. Firstly, the issue of path-tracking control is transformed into the problem of yaw rate tracking. Next, a nonlinear UIO capable of estimating first-order disturbances is developed. Based on this approach, twin UIOs with different objectives are combined to achieve path-tracking control of intelligent vehicles in the presence of disturbances or uncertainties. Exponential stability of the UIO is ensured by appropriately selecting design parameters. Furthermore, the stability of the closed-loop system under the composite controller, consisting of twin UIOs, is established. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control technique for path-tracking tasks are demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies, comparative analyses, and experimental verifications.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) represents a new technological paradigm. It delivers computational resources via edge nodes situated close to users. This approach not only satisfies the growing computational needs of vehicles but also minimizes communication latency. Such advancements are crucial for the evolution of intelligent transportation systems. To ensure these systems succeed, two key strategies are essential. First, edge servers must be effectively incentivized to engage in computation offloading. Second, vehicles require efficient resource request strategies, particularly when edge resources are limited. In this paper, we consider a duopolistic edge service market for vehicles with the existence of two service stage. For edge servers, they announce their resource pricing strategies before the start of each stage after a game has been played. After the conclusion of the first stage, vehicles generate reviews based on their service experience for both servers. These reviews will affect the vehicle&#39;s choice of edge servers in the next stage. Therefore, edge servers must devise effective pricing strategies to optimize their profits over both stages. Vehicles, after making their choice at any stage based on personal preferences, service quality, and resource pricing, must also engage in a game with other vehicles choosing the same server to determine their resource request strategy. In cases where vehicles prefer not to disclose their resource requests and other information, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to maximize the utility of each vehicle. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our resource allocation scheme based on game theory and deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract     = {The Trajectory Planning Module is a key component of the Autonomous Driving System which is central to the realization and widespread use of Autonomous Vehicles. However, in the models adopted by mainstream trajectory planners, only crude representations of the geometrical sizes of vehicles are usually made, a limitation that cannot guarantee the kinematic feasibility of the driving process. But accounting for kinematic constraints will present a further challenge as the model itself will be non-convex due to the inherent angularity of vehicles. To cope with this challenge, a trajectory planning method considering kinematic feasibility based on the convex optimization framework is proposed. Instead of employing solving techniques that loosen non-convex effects, our method directly addresses the problem of convex kinematic feasibility by constructing a collision-free constraint regarding a vehicle&#39;s precise size and a variable boundary constraint regarding the vehicle&#39;s inherent limitation. Moreover, we present a “Bi-state Obstacles Avoidance” strategy designed to overcome the disadvantages in typical trajectory planners that only consider a static obstacle avoidance constraint in the path generation phase of trajectory planning. By introducing an external parameter “time”, the staticization representation of dynamic obstacles can effectively be implemented, which greatly improves the ability to regulate velocity. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new planner were tested using both simulated and real-world driving data, the results of which show that the proposed method can plan safe and efficient trajectories in real-time, an essential requirement for implementation in real-world autonomous vehicles.},

IoD presents a multitude of advantages in smart city settings, facilitating services like traffic monitoring, environmental surveillance, and disaster management by harnessing the potential of IoT and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) infrastructures. However, the transmission of sensitive messages between drones in IoD-based smart cities is disseminated over insecure channels, leaving them exposed to security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, drones operating in IoD architectures are prone to physical capture attacks as they operate in unattended environments with minimal human intervention. Moreover, the limited resources of drones pose challenges to the practicality of employing computationally intensive cryptographic methods. In response to these challenges, we introduce PAF-IoD, an authentication framework that prioritizes security and efficiency. PAF-IoD leverages physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and the AEGIS authenticated encryption scheme to guarantee trustworthy and secure communication between users and drones in smart cities. In terms of security validation, we perform both random and real model-based formal analyses. Furthermore, we employ the Scyther tool to ensure the resilience of PAF-IoD against different security vulnerabilities. Additionally, an informal analysis is conducted to demonstrate the resilience of PAF-IoD against various attacks. By introducing PAF-IoD, we offer a secure solution that addresses vulnerabilities and resource limitations associated with drone communication. The proposed framework guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of data while optimizing computational and communication resources, thereby enabling reliable and effective IoD operations in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most significant components of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), traffic prediction has gained much popularity given its enormous application value in vehicular communications, traffic management, and traffic control. As such, many traffic prediction models have been proposed. The current methods commonly adopt graph convolution networks (GCNs) to capture spatial correlations. GCN-based approaches mainly focus on pair-wise interactions between road vertices (i.e. dyadic relations). However, the interactions between road vertices are not necessarily dyadic, but also can be high-order (i.e., multivariate relations). Further, few existing works focus on how to mine correlations between different types of traffic data. To this end, we develop STGHCN, a spatial-temporal gated hypergraph convolution network, that not only captures pair-wise and high-order spatial patterns between vertices but also characterizes the type-aware traffic data influences. Specifically, we adopt a spatial gated graph convolution and a hypergraph convolution to explore pair-wise and high-order interactions. More importantly, we design a spatial-temporal aware channel attention mechanism to mine hidden patterns between cross-type traffic features. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets validate the effectiveness of STGHCN, with STGHCN&#39;s MAE, RMSE, and MAPE at between $6.91\%-10.00\%$ , $5.42\%-8.90\%$ , and $2.54\%-5.03\%$ lower than the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, there exist a few researches that have considered both the case of cooperative and antagonistic relationships between vehicles. Therefore, we aim to develop an effective approach to tackle the predefined-time bipartite time-varying formation tracking (BTVFT) problem of networked ASVs subject to external disturbances in this article. Firstly, the predefined-time hierarchical control (PTHC) algorithm is proposed to address the aforesaid issue. More specifically, by utilizing directed signed graph, the ASVs are divided into two subgroups to form their own time-varying formation configurations on both sides of the dynamic leader and keep the same distances from the leader. More notably, the convergence time can be designed in advance according to actual demands. Then, the corresponding sufficient conditions for achieving the predefined-time BTVFT are obtained by systematic analysis and Lyapunov stability analysis. Eventually, numerical simulation experiments on Cyber-Ships II are carried out, which vividly reflect the effectiveness and feasibility of the developed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In urban road traffic environments, intention estimation and trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles are necessary prerequisites for autonomous vehicles to plan their own trajectories reasonably. In this article, a greedy trajectory prediction method of autonomous vehicles based on Gaussian process-information entropy probability framework in discrete-time dimension (DTDGP-IE) and hazard index graph is proposed. Firstly, a greedy road grid search method based on urban road traffic rules is employed for intention estimation of surrounding vehicles. Secondly, to further improve the accuracy of prediction and realize the uncertainty estimation, a hazard index graph is utilized based on DTDGP-IE, focusing attention on vehicles with higher hazard index. Eventually, trajectory prediction of vehicles with higher hazard index selected by hazard index graph is carried out utilizing the fusion of greedy road grid sequence and state of surrounding vehicles predicted by DTDGP-IE. In addition, the lane keeping and lane changing scenarios are tested on a public autonomous driving dataset. By comparing with the classical trajectory prediction algorithms of LSTM and GRU, and analyzing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, it can be proved that the proposed algorithm is possessed with better prediction ability and faster calculation time under the same computational cost, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A practical scenario is considered where no agents have prior environmental knowledge, and only a subgroup of agents, defined as leaders, is equipped with obstacle-detection sensors. The primary objective is to drive agents towards the goal position while safely avoiding unknown obstacles and navigating through choke points. First, we ensure that the leader agents achieve a prescribed formation within a fixed time, and then, the follower agents converge inside a convex hull spanned by the leaders. After that, motion planning and choke point navigation algorithms are developed to achieve group obstacle avoidance and choke point navigation missions. The results demonstrate that networked agents could safely move towards the goal positions, effectively navigating unknown obstacles and manoeuvring through choke points, even when obstacle-detection sensors are limited to leader agents. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme were validated through an in-depth simulation case study and real-time flight experiments on a multi-UAV system.},

  abstract     = {Air Smart Vehicular Networks (ASVNs) have become increasingly essentials in military and commercial industries in recent years, where drones are deployed to interact among each other via wireless medium in airspace due to their agility and versatility. ASVNs can form a closed loop from data perception to final execution by integrating communication devices, computation tools, and control modules. However, the used unencrypted and publicly available navigational signals like Global Positioning System (GPS) and communication over (public) insecure Internet connections, including wireless networks and WiFi, make ASVNs vulnerable to security breaches. Attackers can easily gain access to a drone&#39;s configuration and take control remotely, by launching various attacks such as GPS spoofing, false sensor data injection, maldrone malware injection, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, Denial-of-Service (DoS), replay, forgery, and Skyjack attacks. This paper proposes a robust and efficient multi-factor biometric-based security mechanism using blockchain as a service to address the security and privacy breaches in ASVNs. A comparative study demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides superior security and better functionality features with low communication and computation overheads as compared to the existing analogous schemes. The feasibility of the proposed scheme in real-life drone applications is also demonstrated through a real-time testbed and blockchain simulation. Furthermore, a detailed security analysis using the automated software validation tool, namely Scyther, verifies the proposed scheme&#39;s significant level of security.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) allows the collaborative training of a global model in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs): data is maintained on the owner&#39;s device and the local gradient updates to the model are aggregated through a secure protocol. However, despite its many advantages, FL is vulnerable to various attacks from malicious clients. Current defenses have several weaknesses. For example, the server may still select malicious clients for aggregation even after they have been identified in previous rounds. They haven&#39;t considered the continual monitoring of clients to resist their possible defection or collusion that occurs throughout the FL training process. In response to the weaknesses, we describe a new aggregation model with continuous authentication suits for VANETs. The authentication implementation relies on a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof which preserves privacy. We also minimize the computation and communication overhead by designing a two-phase aggregation scheme, while introducing the Edge Devices (EDs) to assist the FL procedure. Finally, we introduce an application of such a model for VANETs. We describe the prototype implementation and experimentally confirm that the aggregation overhead of the client grows linearly and achieves training speed up over the prior work.},

Subsequently, to solve the problem that the weights of LEO satellites mismatch their actual process noises, we introduce an adjusted moving horizon estimation (AMHE) strategy to optimize the positioning performance. Thereafter, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to verify the availability of LaGNSS and evaluate the theoretical position accuracy. Finally, the GPS and Orbcomm joint field experiments are used to analyze the suitable application scenarios for LaGNSS using the AMHE algorithm. The experimental results show that the robustness and applicability of AMHE are better than those of extended Kalman filter (EKF) for LaGNSS when the GPS satellites are insufficient.},

  abstract     = {The GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) becomes indispensable for long-distance remote outdoor positioning tasks, but its stability is susceptible to various types of interference, such as suppression jamming and spoofing jamming, etc. In such scenes, global real-time positioning is hard to achieve through only visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) or INS (Inertial Navigation Systems), especially in remote outdoor areas due to the prevalence of sparse features and accumulative INS accuracy degradation. In this paper, we explore a two-stage global real-time positioning framework under specific environmental conditions, which may be useful for localization applications in remote areas with sparse features. The first stage is to achieve coarse-level positioning using a single-scale feature fusion network to retrieve images from historically captured road datasets. In the second stage of fine-level positioning, we perform feature matching between the current taken image and the retrieved image, to calculate the camera pose transformation, to refine the position error between the two images. Specifically, the features are obtained from a specially designed combination of an image-level DNN (Deep Neural Network) and a ridge line feature detector, to better adapt to the low-texture environments. After that, we use the calculated camera pose and the retrieved historical image labeled with GNSS information to obtain the current image&#39;s GNSS. Experiments show the proposed image retrieval network and feature matching method achieve good results in terms of performance and accuracy. They also prove that our framework achieves global real-time positioning under GNSS suppression in our specific sparse feature datasets.},

In this study, we explore adaptive and robust estimator for time-varying mmWave channels, considering the use of more general arbitrarily shaped IRS, in contrast to classical regular IRS elements arranged on a grid. Firstly, we establish a consistent-sparse-subspace relationship between direct and reflective channels using linearly modified atomic norm minimization. Secondly, we formulate joint estimation as a low-dimensional and robustly sparse matrix reconstruction programming, resolving efficiently through alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Additionally, to reduce complexity, we propose a learning-based solver using fixed-point iteration and a cascaded deep-learning network framework. This solver can adjust its network depth according to the time-varying channel, achieving linear convergence and reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that both proposed channel estimation methods outperform current state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, the aliasing effect influences the measurement accuracy, which is related to the auto-correlation function of the echo signal. To this end, a novel complementary coding-based waveform is proposed in this article. First, we establish a current velocity measurement framework for broadband ADCP (BBADCP), consisting of a complex auto-correlation algorithm and an ambiguity-resolving algorithm. Second, we find that the waveform design criteria are proportional to or inverse proportion to the symbol length, symbols repetition times, and bit-width, resulting in mutual constraints of each other. Thus a parameter compromise scheme is proposed to solve the mutual constraints among various metrics, including depth cell thickness, velocity accuracy, and maximum measurable velocity. Third, we propose an aliasing effect count-measure method by transmitting two repeat coding pulses using a pair of complementary codes with a time delay. We also offer a concatenation method to extend the complementary codes, which improves the velocity estimation precision without affecting the range resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the waveform embedding extended complementary codes provides advantages in both velocity estimation accuracy and maximum measurable velocity.},

  abstract     = {Triggered by the introduction of higher frequencies (above 24 GHz), there has been a long-standing debate in the radio propagation community on whether higher frequency radio channels are sparser relative to channels below 6 GHz. Here, sparsity implies a few dominant multipath components containing the vast majority of the electromagnetic energy. This discussion has recently been revisited with the study and interest in bands above 100 GHz for future wireless access. In this paper, the level of sparsity is examined at 6, 26, and 105 GHz carrier frequencies by conducting channel measurements in an indoor office environment. By using the Gini index (value between 0 and 1) as a metric for characterizing sparsity, we show that increasing carrier frequency leads to increased levels of sparsity. The measured channel impulse responses are used to derive a Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-style propagation model, used to calculate the Gini index for the comparison of the channel sparsity between the measurement and simulation based on the 3GPP model. Our results show that the mean value of the Gini index in measurement is nearly twice the value in simulation, implying that the 3GPP channel model does not capture the effects of sparsity in the delay domain as frequency increases. In addition, a new intra-cluster power allocation model based on measurements is proposed to characterize the effects of sparsity in the delay domain of the 3GPP channel model. The accuracy of the proposed model is analyzed using theoretical derivations and simulations. Using the derived intra-cluster power allocation model, the mean value of the Gini index is 0.91 in the sub-THz band, while the spread of variability is restricted to 0.01, demonstrating that the proposed model is suitable for 3GPP-type channels. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to perform measurements and analysis across a wide range of frequencies for the evaluation of channel sparsity in the same environment.},

  abstract     = {The advent of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications has posed significant challenges to channel modeling. Channel measurements cannot cover all scenarios and frequency bands for 6G, and conventional models lack accurate predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel 6G space-time joint predictive channel model to predict channels in the space-time domains, which can rebuild lost measurement data and correct abnormal data. The proposed model designs a space-time generative adversarial network (STGAN) framework, conditioned on channel large-scale and small-scale characteristics, to synthesize sufficient space-time channel datasets, effectively overcoming data shortages. Accompanied by path identification and characteristic classification, the coupled gated recurrent unit (GRU) framework conducts precise predictions for unknown channels in the space-time domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s superiority over other methods, including the geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM), GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The model&#39;s effectiveness can be attributed to its architecture to capture complex space-time variations and accurately predict non-linear channel characteristics based on continuous measurements. Validation on both indoor and outdoor channel measurements further confirms the model&#39;s generality and accuracy. The proposed model provides a robust solution in the space-time joint channel prediction for advanced wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular communication (V2X) is one of the challenging use cases in the context of 5G and beyond networks due to its temporal and spatial dynamics. It is very specific and demanding from the perspective of a mobile network, especially since it covers a wide range of services with different requirements. On the other end, one of the key ideas behind the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) concept is to embed intelligence into the RAN to allow network and resource optimization through tailored applications. This is possible due to the introduction of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), along with xApps and rApps. In this paper, we bring both of these worlds together and propose the use of Traffic Management and Traffic Steering applications in V2X scenarios. We also emphasize the usage of enrichment information (EI), enabled by O-RAN, specific to vehicular services (e.g., car platoon geolocation, or emergency situation notifications) which allows for optimal policy control. The numerical results for multiple V2X use cases show that the flexibility, provided by the O-RAN architecture enables optimized handling of the resources through policy control when dynamic changes occur on the road. Thus, we conclude that O-RAN is fit for purpose for the V2X scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Direct communication among vehicles, namely vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), as part of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system, will enable most of the upcoming Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) applications. Nevertheless, the challenging requirements imposed by the vehicular environment necessitate advanced control mechanisms. Traditional Radio Access Networks (RANs) lack the necessary flexibility to address these control needs. The emerging Open RAN (O-RAN) concept offers a promising solution for orchestrating the V2X network. However, the seamless integration of these ecosystems remains an unresolved challenge. This article promotes a novel integration architecture that ensures the V2X control within O-RAN. We propose a novel architecture that establishes a low frequencies O-RAN-based control plane to ensure reliable and efficient multi-hops connectivity among CAVs at millimeter wave (mmWave). To examine and test the technological feasibility of this integrated architecture, we extend current Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) modules, leading to a simulation framework for experimenting with O-RAN-empowered V2X system. Such an integrated framework is used to show the benefits in a specific V2V challenge: link and relays selection. This case study serves as a practical example of a new O-RAN solution that effectively addresses the challenges of V2X communications. Numerical results showcase the improved reliability up to 60% of the proposed xApp-controlled V2V network, with low latency and negligible overhead, when compared to distributed and unmanaged solutions, supporting the viability of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract     = {Open RAN (ORAN or O-RAN) revolutionizesRadio Access Networks (RAN) by offering flexibility and cost-efficiency through inter-vendor equipment interoperability.More importantly, it addresses emerging security threats, such as jamming attacks, by incorporating network softwarization and leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. However, AI-based systems face challenges such as limited training data, slow convergence, and vulnerability to dynamic attack patterns like Zero-day attacks. To enhance jamming attack mitigation in O-RAN, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been introduced for improved flexibility and robustness. However, MARL requires data sharing, which consumes network bandwidth and slows down training, and the curse of dimensionality limits its benefits due to the exponential growth of the state-action space. To overcome these limitations, we provide a novel framework that combines federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for efficient jamming attack detection in O-RAN. FL allows decentralized agents to train local models using their data sources, and the models are aggregated into a global model at a Non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) to guide decision-making. The federated learning process enables distributed intelligence, while deep reinforcement learning ensures adaptive and robust jamming attack detection. Our proposed framework improves security, privacy, and resilience in ORAN through collaborative FL and adaptive DRL. Extensive simulations demonstrate its superiority in detection accuracy, resource efficiency, and scalability.},

This paper focuses on enhancing the performance of the Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol, focusing on cooperative vehicular networks supported by aerial drone relays. While QUIC outperforms traditional protocols, its default congestion and flow control mechanisms do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by volatile networks spanning the terrestrial and aerial domains, as they are characterized by frequent topology changes, and high propagation delay volatility. We analyze QUIC&#39;s congestion and flow control and propose enhancements to optimize its performance in such networks, specifically designed for C-V2X communications in Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN).

  abstract     = {The recent advancements in cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) and edge computing paradigms foster novel use cases for connected and automated vehicles that come with strict performance requirements. These guarantees can be provided by network slicing, which is currently enabled by the virtualization and cloudification of mobile networks, following the 5G/6G core service-based approach and the cloud-native Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) principles. However, a significant challenge arises when considering the movement of end users: ensuring network slice continuity as they transition between different network operators. In this paper, we introduce a novel cloud-native orchestration framework for network slice federation that incorporates well-defined interfaces to exchange federated service and slice resource templates among operators. The proposed framework is fully compliant with i) standardized slice service models, and ii) GSMA efforts that are building the fundamental aspects for Edge Federation to allow the sharing of network resources across mobile operators. To validate our approach, we have designed and deployed a cloud-native federated 5G experimental platform. An extensive series of experiments have been carried out, revealing that the federation implementation directly influences federation time, and the operator&#39;s slice deployment strategy significantly impacts both infrastructure and end user performance.},

  abstract     = {Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)-based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%.},

Traditional ground networks and facilities (e.g., open random access networks, Open-RAN) simply provide two-dimensional (2D) and limited-coverage services at low altitudes. SAGIN are designed to overcome these limitations and promise to provide 3D and seamless services and connectivity opportunities. Meanwhile, network softwarization (NetSoft) is highlighted as dominant 6G attribute. Through incorporating NetSoft, dedicated network appliance will be isolated as software blocks and general-purpose hardware. Initiated and customized services will be realized by chained software blocks and share the same underlying hardware. Thus, the resource usage and service diversity can be simultaneously achieved by adopting NetSoft. In current literature, SAGIN and NetSoft are well investigated. However, their joint research is at early stage. Therefore, we investigate the resource allocation in softwarized SAGIN for achieving open and seamless access services. We propose the efficient resource allocation and orchestration framework, abbreviated as Slice-Soft-SAGIN . Our framework approach is designed to achieve efficient resource allocation solution per slice service. Each time receiving one tailored slicing service, the first checking available resources will be conducted by our Slice-Soft-SAGIN . When passing the preliminary resource checking, the formal resource allocation of slicing service will be executed in order: first terrestrial node, second aerial node, third satellite node. In addition, our Slice-Soft-SAGIN executes wireless (spectrum) and wired (computing and storage) types of resources when serving this slicing service. This is one crucial highlight of our Slice-Soft-SAGIN framework. With the purpose of confirming merits of Slice-Soft-SAGIN , the comprehensive evaluation work is executed. Typical works and three extra counterparts constitute the whole evaluation. We analyze the evaluation results carefully.},

  abstract     = {The automobile industries are undergoing a technological revolution, which has facilitated the emergence of multiple Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The conventional resource allocation methods are no longer applicable in V2X due to the diverse vehicular services with different QoS requirements in various practical scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-service resource allocation strategy for V2X. Specifically, the problem of allocating resources for multiple V2X services is decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., resource allocation between slices, and resource scheduling within slice. Then, a heuristic resource allocation algorithm is adopted to solve the resource allocation between slices sub-problem. For Real-Time (RT) and Non-Real Time (NRT) services in the vehicular network, specialized scheduling has been designed for the near-real-time Radio Access Network (RAN) Intelligent Controller and non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller in the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, to meet the heterogeneous QoS service requirements of vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the modified largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) algorithm, the proposed resource allocation strategy can enhance the AoI of the proportional fairness (PF) services by 15%, and provide 7.39% transmission rate gain for NRT services.},

However, few institutes researching ORAD-based CV2x can satisfy the enormous demand of labeled data. This issue is known as few-shot learning. Thus, we deeply explore the issue of few-shot learning for ORAE-based CV2x. Meta-transfer learning is a good alternative to solving few-shot learning. Most of them, however, are still plagued by catastrophic forgetting. Numerous studies have demonstrated that deliberately applying gradient sparsity can significantly increase a meta-model&#39;s capacity for generalization. In this article, we propose a pre-training framework named Distilling for Sparse-Meta-transfer Learning (DSML). It is a combination and enhancement of meta-transfer learning, multi-teacher knowledge distillation, and sparse Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (sparse-MAML). It utilizes multi-teacher knowledge distillation to address the catastrophic forgetting in the meta-learning phase. Simultaneously, it utilizes sigmoid function to fundamentally address the gradient anomaly problem of sparse-MAML. We conducted ablation experiments on Sparse-MAML and prove that it can actually increase the meta-model&#39;s generalization capacity. We also compare DSML with the state-of-the-art algorithm in the univariate time series classification field. The results demonstrate that DSML performs better. Finally, we present two case studies of applying DSML to ORAN-based CV2x.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with ultra-dense sensors are crucial for several industries, such as smart agricultural systems deployed in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). The WSNs employ multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs) and relay it to the central controller for processing. UAVs also provide resources to SNs and extend the network coverage over a vast geographical area. The O-RAN allows the use of open standards and interfaces to create a wireless network for communications between the UAVs and ground SNs. It enables real-time data transfer, remote control, and other applications that require a reliable and high-speed connection by providing flexibility and reliability for UAV-assisted WSNs to meet the requirements of smart agricultural applications. However, the limited battery life of UAVs, transmission power, and shortage of energy resources SNs make it difficult to collect all the data and relay it to the base station, resulting in inefficient task computation and resource management in smart agricultural systems. In this paper, we propose a joint UAV task scheduling, trajectory planning, and resource-sharing framework for multi-UAV-assisted WSNs for smart agricultural monitoring scenarios that schedule UAVs&#39; charging, data collection, and landing times and allow UAVs to share energy with SNs. The main objective of our proposed framework is to minimize the UAV energy consumption and network latency for effective data collection within a specific time frame. We formulate the multi-objective, which is a non-convex optimization problem, and transform it into a Markov decision process (MDP) with a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed MADRL algorithm reduces the energy consumption cost when compared to deep Q-network, Greedy, and mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by 61.92%, 68.02%, and 69.9%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The use of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) in vehicular networks can lead to better connectivity, reliability, and performance. However, communication in this setting is often done over an unsecured wireless network, which creates a challenge in verifying the validity of received transactions by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to the untrusted network. It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework named “STIoV” has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract     = {Open radio access networks (RAN) enhance the capabilities of traditional RAN by introducing features such as interoperability, open interfaces, software/hardware separation, and intelligence. Open RAN has several use cases in cellular vehicle-to-everything communications such as low-latency information exchange between vehicles and RAN intelligence controller (RIC). However, efficient data sharing between vehicles and RIC suffers from the challenges of signal loss due to mobility and dynamic channel conditions. In this regard, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have emerged as an intriguing concept of reconfigurable and smart environments to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. In the proposed research, our main focus is on a multi-IRS aided single input single output system, where open RAN base stations (BS) convey information to a remote vehicular user. The transmitted signal is reflected by IRSs via multi-hop passive beamforming over pairwise line-of-sight links. To maximize the overall network sum-rate, we propose an IRS assignment method that allocates either a single IRS or multiple IRSs to each BS-user pair. In particular, the proposed algorithm consists of two stages, where in the first stage we perform $k$ -means clustering to group the IRSs according to their location. In the next stage, for each group, we select the best IRS-assisted path (based on received signal strength) by transforming the original network into a trellis graph and using a trellis-search method. Simulation results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing IRS selection techniques in multiple IRS-enabled multi-hop communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) was introduced to support autonomous driving through 5G and beyond networks. C-V2X leverages cellular network infrastructure to integrate vehicle-to-network, vehicle-to-pedestrian, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. It has been suggested that Open RAN can be used to achieve the latency requirements essential to realize C-V2X as it achieves real-time optimization through the use of AI in Near real-time RAN Intelligence Controller (Near-RT RIC). The Open RAN will allow the access to historical traffic data or acquisition of data from vehicles. The data will then be transferred to Near-RT RIC for detecting network anomalies while maintaining reliable communication, which is essential for realizing autonomous driving. Open RAN also supports non-real-time RAN intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) that allows more complex ML workflows such as policy-based feature extraction and optimization to guide vehicles when real-time acquisition is not available. Open RAN provides support for edge cloud, i.e. Open Cloud that helps to interface the Near-RT RIC with Open RAN central unit&#39;s user and control plane. Together, the Open RAN and C-V2X are considered to be the key-enabling technologies for achieving low-latency in autonomous vehicular communication networks. The issue attracted over 100 high-quality submissions from all over the world, among which 12 original contributions were eventually selected for publication. The novelty and key contributions of these articles are summarized as follows.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic routing has emerged as a promising technology for future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), offering the potential to enhance service performance and optimize resource utilization. However, the dynamic nature of network topology and resources poses challenges in establishing deterministic routing. These challenges encompass the intricacy of jointly scheduling transmission links and cycles, as well as the difficulty of maintaining stable end-to-end (E2E) routing paths. To tackle these challenges, our work introduces an efficient temporal graph-based deterministic routing strategy. Initially, we utilize a time-expanded graph (TEG) to represent the heterogeneous resources of an NTN in a time-slotted manner. With TEG, we meticulously define each necessary constraint and formulate the deterministic routing problem. Subsequently, we transform this nonlinear problem equivalently into solvable integer linear programming (ILP), providing a robust yet time-consuming performance upper bound. To address the considered problem with reduced complexity, we extend TEG by introducing virtual nodes and edges. This extension facilitates a uniform representation of heterogeneous network resources and traffic transmission requirements. Consequently, we propose a polynomial-time complexity algorithm, enabling the dynamic selection of optimal transmission links and cycles on a hop-by-hop basis. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm yields significant performance gains in traffic acceptance, justifying its additional complexity compared to existing routing strategies.},

In this paper, we focus on load balancing in multi-UAV-enabled wireless networks, where UAVs serve ground user equipments (UEs) with time division multiple access (TDMA). The UEs have spatiotemporal heterogeneous requests to transfer data which need to be fulfilled in time, the unfinished part called unfinished user request. To improve the quality of service (QoS) and promote the overall system performance, we exploit the flexibility of UAVs to propose a flexible and efficient multi-UAV-enabled load balancing (MULB) scheme. Taking the load balancing effect into consideration, the network optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the maximum unfinished user request by jointly optimizing user association, UAV trajectory, and time slot allocation. Due to integer constraints and non-convexity, we exploit block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that our proposed MULB scheme outperforms existing multi-UAV scheduling schemes in terms of not only the load balancing ability but also the overall system throughput.},

Moreover, an iterative localization algorithm called MinMax-DV-hop is proposed to tackle the nonconvex and non-differentiable objective function of proposed model too. Specifically, auxiliary variable is introduced to recast the minimum-maximum optimization into one with a linear object function, convex constraints and nonconvex constraints. And then, nonconvex constraints are tightened to linear inequality constraints by using its first-order Taylor expansions, thus a successive convex approximation method can be designed to iteratively solve the optimization problem finally.

Leveraging the Hadamard matrix as the CS measurement matrix, the cost function for emitter source determination is first established with the sub-Nyquist sampled signals. Hence, the full signal recovery error and cumbersome computation are avoided compared with existing passive localization methods with CS signals. In addition, the Carmér-Rao Lower bound (CRLB) is theoretically derived and points out the trade-off between localization accuracy and sparse signal sampling rate.

  abstract     = {Due to the dependence of task processing on the task-related models and databases, edge service caching and multi-access edge computing (MEC) are tightly coupled. The service caching placement, offloading and resource allocation have become the key to guarantee the latency and computing requirements of tasks. However, much of the existing work is based on unrealistic assumptions that caching and other resources can be scheduled simultaneously, which lead to frequent cache switching and high system overhead. To address this, we propose a two-timescale multi-dimensional resource optimization scheme based on a Markov decision process (MDP), which jointly optimizes the long-term service caching and short-term task offloading, computing, and bandwidth resource allocation to minimize the long-term system delay and cache cost. To accommodate the two-timescale characteristics, we propose a centralized dual-actor deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, where there is a dual-actor network producing both long-term and short-term resource management decisions, and a centralized critic network directing joint actions. Such a structure strengthens the learning process, enabling the dual-actor network to generate different timescale decisions that align with consistent objectives. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce delay and cache cost compared to the existing scheme.},

We first analyze the false alarm probability (FAP) and miss detection probability (MDP) for the covert communication and investigate the detection error probability by considering the location and channel uncertainty of warden. Then, aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of our proposed system subject to reliability and covertness constraints, we optimize the UAV transmit power and hovering point jointly and design a low-complexity solution based on alternating optimization (AO), Dinkelbach method and successive convex approximation (SCA) solutions. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and highlight the fundamental trade-off between the EE and covertness constraint.},

  abstract     = {In the ever-expanding and collaborative vehicular network, the formation of vehicle clusters is crucial for maintaining stable communications within each cluster. However, traditional cluster generation schemes often prioritize prolonged maintenance time rather than the better collaboration performance. This is due to the inherent conflict between extended maintenance and optimal collaboration. To tackle this issue, a novel cluster generation scheme is introduced with a specific focus on collaboration, particularly task offloading. The scheme jointly optimizes task offloading and cluster generating decisions to minimize the total task execution delay, while considering the cluster stability issue. Moreover, to ensure efficient resource utilization for vehicles with limited resources, the scheme jointly optimizes the allocation of computing resource and transmission power. To solve the optimization problem, an alternating iterative algorithm with fast convergence is designed. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can achieve the minimum total task execution delay and enhance cluster stability.},

  abstract     = {The existing computation and communication (2C) optimization schemes for cellular-based vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks are done without considering the influence of the social trust. Computational tasks may be offloaded to the untrusted vehicles, making it difficult to accurately execute computational tasks. This may lead to a re-offloading of the computational tasks, consuming additional power, and decreasing the EE for offloading. To address the issue, this work devotes itself to investigate social-mobility-aware underlaid C-V2X framework and proposes a novel EE-oriented 2C assignment scheme. In doing so, we assume that the task vehicular user (T-VU) can offload computation tasks to the service vehicular user (S-VU) and the road side unit (RSU) by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We formulate an EE maximization problem to assign the 2C resources simultaneously through joint optimization, which turns out to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve it, we transform it into separated computation and communication resource allocation subproblems. Dealing with the first subproblem, we fully integrate the characteristic of both social and mobility, and design a heuristic algorithm to achieve edge server selection and task splitting. Then, to address the complex co-channel interference in the second subproblem, the power allocation and spectrum assignment solutions are obtained utilizing a tightening lower bound method and a Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm. Finally, we solve the original problem through an iterative method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the system EE.},

A density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN-) enhanced expectation-maximization (EM-) generalized approximate message passing (GAMP-) based estimator is developed. Firstly, the AOA estimation problem is converted as detecting supports of cluster-sparse signals and then solved by modified EM-GAMP in a single snapshot. Secondly, the coarse AOA estimates from multiple snapshots are clustered by DBSCAN to estimate the source number and improve the AOA estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the quantized PO measurements scheme is more energy-efficient than the conventional complex-valued measurements scheme. The AOA and source number estimation performance of this scheme is superior to that of the one-bit quantized measurements scheme due to the extreme quantization loss of the latter. Furthermore, the DBSCAN-enhanced estimator incorporates the AOA estimate results from multiple snapshots and effectively eliminates outlier AOA estimates, thereby improving the AOA estimation performance, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

We notice that the throughput of SR systems with multiple passive IoT devices highly relies on how these devices are scheduled, i.e., which backscatter device (BD) transmits passively when there is an active ambient terminal. Due to the dynamics of wireless channels and the random access of terminals in ambient networks, the scheduling of BDs needs to be adjusted adaptively while ensuring fairness among them. In this work, we design a transmission protocol for an SR network where an ambient system adopts a contention-based channel access protocol, and formulate a multi-BD scheduling problem considering fairness among BDs. To solve this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic-based learning algorithm. Simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The Laplace transform of the interference experienced by SIs and FCs is quantificated and the service capability of sensory data transmission is obtained.

Simply extending existing semantic communication systems to the two-way situation requires bidirectional information feedback during the training process, resulting in significant communication overhead. To fill this gap, we investigate a two-way semantic communication (TW-SC) system, where the information feedback can be omitted by exploiting the weight reciprocity in the transceiver. Particularly, the channel simulator and semantic transceiver are implemented on both TW-SC nodes and the channel distribution is modeled by a conditional generative adversarial network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TW-SC system performs closing to the state-of-the-art one-way semantic communication systems but requiring no feedback between the transceiver in training process.},

  abstract     = {Massive devices in Internet of Things (IoT) typically have limited resources, and thus it is hard to satisfy the computation demands of various IoT applications by local computation of the collected data at the devices. Mobile edge computing (MEC) tackles this challenge by acquiring and computing the collected data at the network edge. In this article, a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme that combines the merits of the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and the conventional NOMA is proposed for data collection and offloading in MEC networks. Specifically, the proposed novel NOMA scheme takes advantage of the strengths of both TDMA and conventional NOMA by allowing only a subset of devices to offload data and the remaining devices to collect data simultaneously. Based on the proposed novel NOMA scheme, optimal and low-complexity suboptimal solutions to the total offloading throughput maximization problem are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed novel NOMA scheme compared to the TDMA, the frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and the conventional NOMA schemes.},

  abstract     = {Long-Range Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) has been recently introduced in the scope of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), aiming at alleviating packet collisions and increasing the network capacity. Such accomplishment is achieved by replicating the header and fragmenting each data packet into smaller segments while distributing them randomly across multiple channels, enhancing the robustness against interference. In the scope of LR-FHSS, recent works have suggested that the error rate of the headers are in fact dominant in the overall error rate of the system. Moreover, it is well-known that repetition codes are not optimal in terms of error correction capability. In this work, rather than simply replicating the headers, we propose the use of a network-coded-aided inter-header combination scheme, aiming at increasing the header protection against both erasures and collisions. We show through analytical and simulation results that the proposed scheme can considerably reduce the packet error rate by more than one order of magnitude under several scenarios.},

It will be revealed that the distributed APs in CF-mMIMO allow not only legitimate users but also eavesdroppers to reap the diversity gain, which seriously degrades secrecy performance. In addition, by the principle of order statistics, the secrecy performance is further degraded as the number of eavesdroppers increases. Motivated by these, this work proposes an artificial noise-aided secure power control scheme for CF-mMIMO under passive eavesdropping aiming to achieve a higher secrecy rate and/or guaranteed secrecy performance, i.e., minimum secrecy rate. In particular, it will be demonstrated that the secure power control is especially important to guarantee the secrecy fairness.

Specifically, the user in the BackCom mode can always use the signal transmitted by the user in the active mode for more data transmission in a spectrum-sharing manner. To evaluate the proposed protocol, a computation efficiency (CE) maximization-based optimization problem is formulated by jointly power control, time scheduling, power reflection coefficient (RC) adjustment, and computing frequency allocation, while adhering to constraints on energy budgets, computing frequency thresholds, minimum computed bits, and harvested energy. To solve this non-convex problem, Dinkelbach&#39;s method and quadratic transform are first employed to transform the complex fractional forms into linear ones. Then, an iterative algorithm is designed by decomposing the resulting problem to obtain the suboptimal solution. For analytical insights, we not only provide some closed-form solutions, but also derive the analytical performance gain with reciprocal mode.

A neuromuscular dynamics model is responsible for capturing the dynamic interaction between the steering system and the neuromuscular system of the driver, whereas a LSTM network is used to describe the visual behaviors of the driver accurately during manual takeover. A series of high-fidelity driving simulator experiments with 12 participants were conducted to acquire driver behaviors during manual takeover under PCA conditions. Scenarios with manual takeover steering and conventional manual steering were compared to analyze driver behaviors under PCA maneuvers. In terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error, and determination coefficient, the experimental results indicated that the proposed method had higher identification accuracy than a method combining two-point visual modeling and neuromuscular dynamics. The proposed method also captured the dynamic interaction between the vehicular steering system and the neuromuscular system. Thus, in the interest of developing manual takeover control systems of automated vehicles, the proposed method can better represent lateral behaviors of drivers.},

On the other hand, real-time search methods use terrain information, but they are only practical when a single UAV serves a single user. In this paper, we put forward two methods to avoid building blockage in a multi-user system by collecting prior terrain information and using real-time search. We proposed four algorithms related to the combinations of the above methods and their performances are evaluated and compared in different scenarios. By adjusting the height of the UAV based on terrain information collected before networking, the performance is significantly enhanced compared to the one when no terrain information is available. The algorithm based on real-time search further improves the coverage performance by avoiding the shadow of buildings. During the execution of the real-time search algorithm, the search distance is reduced using the collected terrain information.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent driving has advanced significantly in recent decades, paving the path for the transportation of the future. Digital twin (DT) technology, which can bridge the physical and virtual space gaps in real time, plays an important role in the collaboration of vehicles and roads for intelligent driving. In this paper, we design the Digital Twin empowered Cloud-native Vehicular Networks (DT-CVN) architecture as well as the workflow for task execution aiming at executing intelligent driving tasks efficiently and reliably. In DT-CVN, we propose a design and implementation scheme for digital twins, in which different modules of the same digital twin entity can be deployed in different network locations in a distributed manner by taking advantage of the distributed features of microservices based on cloud-native technology. Furthermore, we design the modules reuse and requests aggregation mechanisms of digital twins invocation for task scheduling in DT-CVN, which can improve its efficiency even further. Then we model the task scheduling in DT-CVN into a combinational optimization problem and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based adaptive task scheduling algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the efficiency of task scheduling while reducing energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Semantic communication has gained significant attention from researchers as a promising technique to replace conventional communication in the next generation of communication systems, primarily due to its ability to reduce communication costs. However, little literature has studied its effectiveness in multi-user scenarios, particularly when there are variations in the model architectures used by users and their computing capacities. To address this issue, we explore a semantic communication system that caters to multiple users with different model architectures by using a multi-purpose transmitter at the base station (BS). Specifically, the BS in the proposed framework employs semantic and channel encoders to encode the image for transmission, while the receiver utilizes its local channel and semantic decoder to reconstruct the original image. Our joint source-channel encoder at the BS can effectively extract and compress semantic features for specific users by considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and computing capacity of the user. Based on the network status, the joint source-channel encoder at the BS can adaptively adjust the length of the transmitted signal. A longer signal ensures more information for high-quality image reconstruction for the user, while a shorter signal helps avoid network congestion. In addition, we propose a hybrid loss function for training, which enhances the perceptual details of reconstructed images. Finally, we conduct a series of extensive evaluations and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc networks (VANET) enhance traffic efficiency and safety through wireless broadcasting of traffic-related messages. Secure communication, mutual authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation are, arguably, the most essential security requirements of vehicles in a VANET. To meet those security goals of VANET, we develop an efficient and secure communication protocol (SL-PPCP). The signcryption cryptographic primitive and the random oracle model are at the heart of the protocol, which accomplishes the requirement of public-key encryption and signature at a relatively low cost. For computation efficiency of the protocol, we design a systematic Offline/Online signcryption scheme with provable security. The scheme runs in two phases, namely, online and offline. The workload of the online phase is reduced by performing the costly operations, namely exponent, pairing and inversion, in the offline phase without knowledge of the message. The scheme proposed ensures existential unforgeability under a Chosen Message Attack, indistinguishability under an adaptive Chosen cipher-text attack, and insider security. For instance, the experimental results show that the computational time reduces approximately to 20.96%, 48.33%, 50.28% and 12.52% than of HOOSC, IP-HSC, MOHSC and LPPTE schemes respectively while performing the signcryption and unsigncryption of a single plaintext. Furthermore, the computational time for multiple ciphertext unsigncryption reduces significantly.},

In this paper, we develop a stochastic geometry-based analytical framework for analyzing the downlink coverage probability and rate coverage of moving networks, where the service distance distribution of a typical UE (an arbitrarily selected receiving UE) associated with an MSBS is characterized as a joint distribution of backhaul-access pair, and its closed-form expression is derived at various MSBS movement locations. By utilizing this characteristic, we further derive the coverage probability based on the Laplace transform of the interference power distribution. Furthermore, the downlink rate coverage for the typical UE is derived using backhaul-access pair and Voronoi mosaics to characterize the mean and particular load on the serving MBS and MSBS, respectively. Our simulation results show that there exists an optimal ratio of wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation maximizing the rate coverage for given network parameters such as the density and selection bias of MSBSs. Additionally, we also observe that there are saturating values of the network parameters in the process of improving the network metrics without the need to be blindly increased.},

Sub-6 GHz assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is a promising solution to address this challenge. The sub-6 GHz channel serves as the control plane to facilitate peer discovery of mmWave equipped vehicles, while the mmWave technology provides high throughput data transmission. Considering the huge amounts of data and the conflicts among mmWave links, a sub-6 GHz assisted mmWave scheduler is indispensable. In this article, we study the mmWave scheduling problem that captures Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication features, i.e., data importance and data freshness. We formulate the scheduling problem into a novel mixed-integer sum-of-ratios problem by leveraging discretized mmWave transmission slots. For this nonlinear NP-hard problem, we derive an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem with significantly reduced computational complexity. Extensive comparative simulation studies with the baseline brute-force algorithm, the greedy coloring algorithm, our previously developed Maximum Weight Matching-based Iterative Algorithm (MWMIA) and Parameterization-based Iterative Algorithm (PIA) are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

We design a LoRa mesh server that runs on a private cloud of the 5G network to manage the LoRa mesh network. We integrate edge computing into the network and design a cloud-edge-terminal collaborative architecture with three algorithms for timely significant-change updates, packet loss detection, and adaptive thresholds to reduce the packet rate and data volume of the network. We validate the design by implementing a proof-of-concept on the 5G testbed at the University of Glasgow.

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a novel approach to address the problem of minimizing the total cost in wireless digital twin network (WDTN) through the design of an intelligent digital twins (DTs) placement algorithm. The total cost is defined as the weighted sum of latency and energy consumption, evaluating the importance of these two factors. The dynamics in the WDTN require an adaptive and flexible approach to perform DT placement over time. To efficiently tackle the non-convex and non-stationary optimization problem for DT placement, we develop a multi-armed bandit (MAB) driven algorithm. Initially, we remodel the original problem of DT placement as a variation of the budgeted-MAB problem to enhance the efficiency of resources utilization within a fixed budget. Subsequently, we exploit the contextual information about the DTs and edge servers to establish associations across different time slots, effectively addressing the non-stationary nature of the problem. To further make the DT placement decisions and reduce uncertainty of the placement strategy, we propose an extension of the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy. This extension incorporates both the efficiency of resources utilization and contextual information of the WDTN while considering energy consumption, latency, and other relevant factors. Extensive and comprehensive numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our devised algorithm. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of energy consumption, latency, and total cost when compared to various baseline schemes. These findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our developed algorithm in achieving significant improvements in cost reduction for WDTN.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a paradigm in which the computation of traffic and services is moved from a centralized cloud to the edge of the network and closer to the customer. This paradigm is expected to effectively reduce latency, making it suitable for real-time applications. A key technology for this paradigm is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mount edge servers that meet customers&#39; computing requirements. The use of UAVs in MEC is attractive because they are close to customers and can be deployed dynamically. In real-time applications, users update the terrestrial network with their locations and computing needs by sending real-time requests. Therefore, from the terrestrial network&#39;s perspective, both the locations and arrival times of tasks are randomly distributed. It is crucial to manage the UAV efficiently to maximize the number of computational tasks completed during its flight time, as UAVs have limitations in terms of energy, power and speed. Due to the random nature of the arrival of tasks, existing studies address this problem with the traditional approach of using machine learning (ML). This approach suffers from two drawbacks: 1) ML algorithms are computationally intensive and 2) they are heuristic methods that offer no guarantees of optimality. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for UAV management. We propose an algorithm for UAV routing and task scheduling based on Lyapunov optimization that has a low computational cost while considering energy consumption and path stability. We also developed Theorem 1, which provides upper bounds on the long-term performance of the UAV. Numerical results based on realistic UAV parameters show the feasibility of our proposed algorithm and its advantage over ML algorithms. We have also investigated the conditions that can further improve the performance of task offloading in terms of uplink power, UAV speed, and CPU resources.},

  abstract     = {Precise underwater localization has been very challenging due to the unsynchronized clock, stratification effect, and anchor location uncertainties. Although some localization methods have been proposed, they are all based on very strong and certain impractical assumptions, such as perfect time synchronization, constant underwater sound speed, or absolutely accurate anchor location information. In this paper, we investigate the underwater localization problem under more realistic conditions. By jointly considering the isogradient underwater sound speed profile (SSP) and anchor location uncertainties, an unsynchronized localization algorithm based on time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements will be presented. The target node initiates the localization process and anchors will respond by reporting their location with the corresponding time stamps. Due to the isogradient SSP, the linear relation between the propagation delay and distance no longer exists. Therefore, we will need to iteratively linearize the observation equations and update the localization result through Newton&#39;s method. As a benchmark for performance evaluation, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We also compare the performance of the proposed scheme with other existing methods, in terms of localization accuracy and computational complexity. Comprehensive simulations are conducted, and the results show that the proposed method can achieve the CRLB and performs better than existing solutions.},

Our focus lies on perturbing the trained GNN model during the test phase, specifically targeting its vertices and edges. To achieve this, four distinct adversarial attacks are proposed, each accounting for different constraints, aiming to manipulate the behavior of the system. The proposed adversarial attacks are formulated as optimization problems, aiming to minimize the system&#39;s communication quality. The efficacy of these attacks is investigated against the number of users, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and adversary power budget. Furthermore, we address the detection of such attacks from the perspective of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the system. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that involves analyzing the distribution of channel eigenvalues before and after the attacks are applied. This formulation results in a Min-Max optimization problem, allowing us to detect the presence of attacks. Through extensive simulations, we observe that in the absence of adversarial attacks, the eigenvalues conform to Johnson&#39;s SU distribution. However, the attacks significantly alter the characteristics of the eigenvalue distribution, and in the most effective attack, they even change the type of the eigenvalue distribution.},

  abstract     = {One of the security issues in a wireless network is jamming attacks, where the jammer causes congestion and significant decrement in the network throughput by obstructing channels and disrupting user signals. Recent works have proposed using a deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) model to confront the jamming attacker due to its capability in predicting the jammer decisions and pattern recognition. Training a DRL model from scratch may take a long time. We first propose a recurrent neural network architecture to minimize the number of parameters for training a DRL model. We further propose a transfer learning (TL) approach to enable the DRL agent to learn fast in dynamic wireless networks to confront jamming attacks effectively. To make our proposed TL method adaptive to different network environments, we propose a novel method to quantitatively measure the difference between the source and target domains, using an integrated feature extractor. Afterward, based on the measured difference, we can choose an optimal setting for the TL model. We also show that the proposed TL method can effectively reduce the training time for the DRL model and outperforms other existing TL methods.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and edge intelligence are essential components for the next generation wireless networks. ISAC provides a spectrum-efficient paradigm to collect and transfer sensing data for edge intelligence. Multi-station sensing, as a cooperative sensing scheme to perform the sensing tasks towards a number of targets, can improve the sensing efficiency and flexibility. In this article, we propose an edge intelligence oriented ISAC via a multi-cell cooperative approach, in which multiple ISAC stations sense a group of targets with the sensing scheduling, and offload the sensing data to an edge server with sufficient computing capacity for model training. Specifically, we investigate the joint optimization of the beamforming for radar sensing, the beamforming for offloading transmission and the ISAC stations&#39; sensing scheduling, with the objective to minimize the overall power consumption of all ISAC stations. To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we firstly propose a layered algorithm to decompose the problem into a top-layer problem that optimizes the sensing scheduling and a bottom-layer problem that optimizes the beamformings for radar sensing and offloading. Then, the bottom-layer problem is further decomposed with the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and solved efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate the performance advantage of our proposed scheme of edge intelligence oriented ISAC with multi-cell cooperative sensing and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

To achieve the performance requirements of ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC), we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided URLLC scheme for the edge users, in which the age of information (AoI) is utilized as the indicator of system latency. Inspired by the pylon turn of gunboat aircraft, the same flight pattern is used at the fixed-wing UAV in the proposed scenario. To reduce the AoI of edge users, we optimize the hovering radius of the UAV while considering its aerodynamic model. In addition, to reduce the complexity of solving, we simplify the original AoI minimization problem and derive its closed-form result as a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV-aided URLLC scheme is beneficial as its average AoI is lower than those of the fixed radius schemes, and the near-optimal AoI performance is achieved by the proposed low complexity method.},

  abstract     = {Guaranteeing stable connectivity for emergency communications in rural and remote areas (e.g., to transfer high-quality video for remote surgery) has been challenging for any cellular network generation. With many initiatives proposed to expand the network coverage in 6 G, emergency communications are supposed to be enhanced significantly. For example, with line-of-sight propagation and high mobility advantages, aerial-assisted vehicular networks are expected to be key technologies in 6 G to enable broadband connectivity from the sky to emergency vehicles in rescue missions. However, deploying a group of low-altitude short = ABS, long=Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) to provide connectivity for emergency vehicles remains an open issue due to the challenge of maintaining the trade-off between connectivity quality guarantee and efficient flights. This work presents a hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning-based scheme with Accumulative Training, namely EVRELAY, to address the problem. Based on a pre-trained signal map, the system can provide the best trajectories for deploying high-capability ABSs. Each DRL agent can dynamically adjust the ABS&#39;s movements to serve the maximum number of EVs based on the average signal power, remaining capacity (available data rate and energy), and collision avoidance with surrounding obstacles. The simulation results show that our method can maintain the highest overall connectivity coverage and data rate, 7% and 25% better than the existing methods while maintaining 10% lower energy consumption. The system is particularly efficient in large-scale deployment scenarios with many emergency vehicles departing simultaneously.},

We envision a scenario wherein passengers interact with each other on the same or different trains in real-time by offloading computationally intensive and delay-sensitive tasks to the track-side MEC networks for HSRs and computation results are multicast to the receivers. To improve the quality of data services, we propose a novel approach to optimize network throughput by admitting as many tasks as possible, subject to delay constraints, and multicasting the maximum number of results. The high mobility of trains and the frequent handovers during train-ground communication are factored into our scheme, which presents significant challenges to jointly consider the dynamic multicast grouping and admission/rejection policies for tasks/results. We introduce the multi-group-shared Group Steiner tree (GST) model and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that reduces the multicast routing problem to finding a GST for each candidate cloudlet.

Caching at edge UAVs is an effective emerging solution for relieving the wireless backhaul congestion and reducing content fetching latency for hotspot areas. This article investigates a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled multi-UAV collaborative caching network, where the multimedia contents are delivered from UAVs to ground users. UAVs cache popular contents and collaboratively share with each other. The optimization problem of joint caching decision, 3D trajectory planning and spectrum resource allocation is formulated for minimizing the system content retrieving delay. It is an NP-hard mixed integer nonconvex optimization issue with extra difficulty that the content popularity is highly dynamic. To tackle this challenging problem, we decouple the original issue into two subproblems: (1) UAV collaborative caching decision making and (2) joint optimization of UAV trajectory planning, power allocation, and channel reusing. We develop a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm for the former to achieve the maximum weighted content hit ratio and propose a matching-DRL solution for the latter. Numerical evaluations confirm that the proposed approach is capable of rapid convergence and achieves superior performance in terms of content hit ratio, content retrieving delay, and system throughput compared to other benchmark algorithms.},

Thus, future connectivity networks should face an unprecedented demand of digital services on mobility, together with a high variability of requirements and specializations. One of the most promising methods to provide such flexible and scalable connectivity is deploying base stations of different sizes closer to users: the ultra dense networks (UDNs) paradigm. UDNs will have to be optimized taking into consideration several factors, among which energy consumption and security are two key features that cannot be left apart. This paper proposes a secure &amp; green optimization procedure to jointly select the users&#39; serving base station and its transmission power with the aim of improving security and reducing power consumption. Towards this goal we introduce a metric that jointly considers secrecy-rate and power consumption in a UDN scenario and does not depend neither on the eavesdropper position nor the channel state, since it is derived by averaging the considered ratio over the whole network. The formulated problem is solved by resorting to a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. The accuracy of the solution is proven by comparing the obtained results with other algorithms and with the optimal solution. Moreover, the efficacy of the applied metric in finding a suitable trade-off between secrecy-rate and power consumption is shown in comparison with different association metrics.},

In this article, we investigate communication resource scheduling for remote autonomous driving (AD) to improve the performance of the remote control system when network resources are constrained. Specifically, we introduce a novel performance metric, i.e., value of information (VoI), to capture how sending a packet will affect the performance of CAV driving safety and efficiency, i.e., the value of the packet on the considered CAV system. The formulation of VoI is derived using the Lyapunov optimization method, and the lower-bound for the performance of the AD system with a VoI-based scheduling strategy is analyzed. Then, a communication resource scheduling approach is proposed based on the VoI of each packet. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed VoI-based resource scheduling approach is capable of accurately assessing the impact of information transfer on system performance, while ensuring the CAV&#39;s safety and enhancing traffic efficiency.},

The key technology lies in high-resolution multi-sources DOA estimation. UAV cluster systems with traditional element-space structure often suffer the extreme demands of Radio Frequency (RF) chains, resulting in high hardware complexity and computation burden. Additionally, the unknown phase differences among all the UAV units caused by asynchronous crystal oscillators and imprecise unit locations further complicates this problem. To address these issues, a beamspace ESPRIT based multi-sources DOA localization method is proposed in this paper. The beamspace pre-processing with the hybrid structure is used to handle the RF chain number problem, while the rotation invariance between beam clusters is built to solve the unknown phase difference problem in DOA estimation. The performance analysis is also provided to show the contributions of some key physical parameters on DOA estimation performance. The simulation results show that the DOA localization precision depends on the DOA estimation performance and Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP). The proposed method achieves a similar performance to the existing methods, but both the RF chain number and the computation complexity are significantly decreased.},

A dual-polarized patch antenna fed by a branch line coupler is designed as the C-band unit cell (UC). The phase-shifting for the C-band right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) can be independently controlled by adjusting the phase delay lines connected to the coupler. In contrast, the Ka-band dual circular polarization independent beam-shaping is based on the strategy of combining the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase and dynamic phase. Two different kinds of Ka-band UC are designed and planted into the metallic and non-metallic regions of the C-band patch antenna, forming a heterogeneous Ka-band RA that is seamlessly integrated into the C-band RA. By properly selecting the size and rotating angles of the Ka-band UCs, the RA can also independently manipulate the LHCP and RHCP wavefronts in Ka-band. In addition, the phase-shifting for C-band and Ka-band do not affect each other. Note that the proposed strategy differs from state-of-the-art works, which either interleave UCs or place different UCs in separate layers. A RA operating at 4.4 GHz (C-band) and 30 GHz (Ka-band) with dual CP decoupled beams are fabricated and experimentally verified for demonstration.},

However, beamforming design and RIS-user equipment (UE) association in multi-RIS-aided massive MIMO systems under the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) maximum criterion is infeasible due to the high computational complexity. To reduce the complexity of the beamforming design, signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) was adopted as a novel criterion. In this paper, we jointly consider the RIS-UE association, active beamforming design, and passive beamforming optimization for maximizing the sum-SLNR of the considered system. We firstly construct the SLNR-based bipartite graph and solve the RIS-UE association problem through the classical Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Then we present an active beamforming design based on a generalized Rayleigh quotient to further maximize the SLNR. Moreover, we leverage the semidefinite relaxation method and alternating optimization techniques to solve the passive beamforming optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a larger achievable sum rate (ASR) compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is receiving more and more attention, and waveform design is an important research direction. In the ISAC system of multi-user communication and multi-target sensing, system performance requirements limit the freedom degree of the integrated waveform. This paper studies the joint waveform design and passive beamforming in the ISAC system aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We consider the practical constant modulus waveform design and study the minimization of weighted mean square cross-correlation pattern (MSCCP) under the unit modulus constraints of RIS reflection phase shift, target illumination power and multi-user interference (MUI) constraint. We decompose the original non-convex problem into multiple sub-problems for alternating optimization (AO). The redundant constraints are incorporated into the objective function of the subproblem as penalty terms to obtain a problem whose feasible region is manifold. Then, an efficient Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The simulation results show that under the constant modulus waveform constraint, the introduction of RIS can significantly improve the freedom of waveform design. The MSCCP between the beams transmitted by the BS can be reduced under the constraint of the target illumination power and MUI.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a cooperative user relaying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), in which the near user (NU) works as a relay for the far user (FU) to convey data from the base station (BS). Two situations are explored: (1) No direct link (NDL) between the BS and the FU, and (2) Direct link (DL) between the BS and the FU. The NU communicates in half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) mode using a decode-and-forward mechanism. Channel coefficients are obtained using Nakagami- $m$ distribution, whereas self-loop interference at the NU in FD mode is modelled using Rayleigh distribution. Three performance metrics are analyzed: outage probability, ergodic rate, and energy efficiency. For these parameters, closed-form expressions are derived considering different possible scenarios, or asymptotic expressions are provided. Simulation results show an error floor in the outage probability plots in the FD NOMA case. The system throughput for two NOMA users is investigated in delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Using the DL helps to improve the diversity of the FU in both the HD and FD modes. A throughput ceiling exists for the NU in the FD NOMA case and the FU in both the HD and FD modes. It is clear from the simulation results that FD NOMA outperforms HD NOMA in terms of the considered performance metrics in the low and mid-SNR regions. Numerical studies explain how diverse system factors, including self-loop interference, variable node distances, source transmit power, and power allocation coefficients, affect various performance indicators.},

In the IBFD mode, however, the transmitted signal causes severe interference at the receiver. This paper proposes a novel low-complexity frequency-domain differential interference cancellation (F-DIC) scheme for IBFD orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems. Without the need for channel state information (CSI), the proposed F-DIC method cancels the static interference and extracts the moving target echo signals by leveraging the invariant property of the interference. After the residual interference evaluation of the proposed method, the interference cancellation ratio of the F-DIC scheme is analyzed, and a closed-form formula of the target detection probability under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion for OFDM ISAC systems based on the proposed scheme is also derived. Simulation results show that the proposed F-DIC method with promising low computational complexity performs similarly compared with the conventional frequency-domain interference cancellation method based on least squares (LS) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms.},

Nevertheless, a comprehensive signal model of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink (UL) systems with multiple numerologies remains unclear. Most previous studies have solely considered the signals of two numerologies within only one least common multiplier (LCM) symbol duration, which is the time duration for synchronizing distinct numerologies, and aimed to address inter-numerology interference (inter-NI). However, the inter-NI from OFDM symbols in the previous LCM symbol duration should also be considered in UL systems. Accordingly, this paper provides a generalized baseband signal model with an arbitrary number of numerologies that encompasses all the inter-NI. In addition, we conduct an analysis of signal power and derive a tractable form of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression. Based on the analysis, we propose linear combining designs with respect to the zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria for multi-numerology systems. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed linear combiners. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed ZF combiner is able to perfectly eliminate all the inter-NI. Furthermore, the simulation results verify that the derived lower bound of the achievable rate with the proposed ZF combiner is very tight.},

While each UAV is designed to serve a particular group of users, whether a UAV is assisted by RIS depends on the distance between the UAV and the terrestrial RIS. As such, a joint optimization problem of the allocation of RIS clusters for each associated UAV and the computation of phase rotations corresponding to terrestrial RIS elements is formulated. Based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD), we develop an algorithm to solve the problem efficiently for this mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP) in two cases: 1) treating interference as noise (TIN) and 2) applying successive interference cancellation (SIC) at user terminals. Through extensive simulations, we provide evidence of our algorithm&#39;s superiority over existing methods, including alternating optimization and multi-task learning. By checking the upper and lower bounds provided by the proposed algorithm, we show that our algorithm attains the global optimality for the considered simulations. Notably, our results also reaffirm the common belief that SIC decoding can provide performance enhancement over TIN decoding in the UAV-RIS-assisted systems.},

However, AMC in dynamic vehicular channels poses significant challenges for traditional machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a novel CNN-based approach named Reparameterization Causal Convolutional Network (RepCCNet) to achieve highly accurate and noise-robust AMC performance. RepCCNet incorporates causal convolutions and structural reparameterization techniques to extract long-term time-domain features. A bottleneck structure with channel attention dynamically calibrates feature channels, retaining only helpful information. Multi-sample dropout is integrated during training to improve generalization capability. We demonstrate RepCCNet&#39;s state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the two widely used datasets, RadioML 2016.10a and RadioML 2018.01a, across varying signal-to-noise ratios. Compared to existing methods, RepCCNet achieves highly competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches, utilizing fewer than 40 k parameters. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the proposed architectural innovations.

Hence, these tasks require intensive computational power and real-time response and it is difficult to complete them by a single node. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a joint optimization method of task offloading and resource scheduling of multiple AGVs for smart factory patrol service. The goal is to minimize the overall energy consumption of the AGVs, by jointly using MEC and D2D offloading, while meeting the constraints of the delay, power, available computing capacity and bandwidth of AGVs. We first analyze the impact of information collection and cooperation tasks on transmission delay and formulate an energy consumption minimization problem. Then, we propose a two-step algorithm to get the solutions of the optimization problem. For resource allocation sub-problem, we design an efficient algorithm for power and bandwidth allocation by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition based on the properties of convex bandwidth. To solve the nonlinear task offloading problem, we transform it into a linear mixed integer problem by introducing slack variables and use Gurobi for the solution. Simulation results show that compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm has good performances on convergence speed and energy conservation of AGVs in the process of patrol tasks under different scenarios.},

Nevertheless, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is suitable for assisting ISAC because it can manipulate the incident signals with relatively lower power consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes a user localization and environment estimation problem with the assistance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and RIS. Considering that carrier frequency offsets (CFO) will impact the location estimation in OFDM, we first investigate the joint estimation of time of arrivals (TOA) and 2-D direction of arrivals (DOA) without CFO estimation by taking advantage of matrix transformation. In order to increase the ability of environment estimation of wireless signals, we develop an efficient environment estimation method with the help of RIS to adjust the directions of the incident signals in different frequencies. Finally, by taking the space-time continuity of user movement and the geometry features of environment into account, we establish the probability transition model of the estimation process for user&#39;s location and environment by factor graph. The performance of our factor graph-based estimation algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results.},

To reduce the array element number and achieve the best sparse array configuration, the ISO algorithm employs the Sobol sequences for population initialization, resulting in enhanced uniformity and comprehensive coverage of the solution space as compared with the conventional random initialization method. Besides, the ISO algorithm employs the Cauchy mutation operator to escape local optimization and suppress the sidelobe levels of the conformal array. To increase array sparseness and optimize the radiation patterns, the ISO algorithm is further equipped with a nonlinear time-varying factor inspired by the whale algorithm and a modified flag control function, which improve its capacity for global exploration and local development. Simulation verification of a sparse cylindrically conformal array has demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed ISO algorithm over conventional optimization algorithms. It achieves a 50% array sparsity, and lower sidelobe levels as compared with the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimizer and traditional snake optimizer (SO). Moreover, it features notably faster convergence rates, outpacing the SO by 10% and GA by 46%, respectively. In addition, the sparse conformal array exhibits good radiation characteristics over a relatively wide beam scanning range of 54° in the azimuthal plane and 90° in the elevation plane, respectively.},

To address this issue, we propose a Channel State Information (CSI)-free scheme that maximizes received energy in a specific direction and covers the entire space through phased beam rotation. Furthermore, we take into account the impact of an imperfect IRS and meticulously design the active precoder and IRS reflecting phase shift to mitigate its effects. Our proposed technique does not alter the existing IRS hardware architecture, allowing for easy implementation in the current system, and enabling access or removal of any Energy Receivers (ERs) without additional cost. Numerical results illustrate the efficacy of our CSI-free scheme in facilitating large-scale IRS without compromising performance due to excessive pilot overhead.

In the network, the HAP first transfers radio frequency (RF) energy to multiple IoT devices in the downlink via time division multiple access (TDMA), and then the IoT devices concurrently transmit their individual data to the HAP by using the harvested energy in the uplink via the frequency division multiple access (FDMA). We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered network by jointly optimizing the grouping strategy of IoT devices and antenna allocation of the HAP for wireless energy transfer (WPT), sub-timeslot allocation of the downlink and uplink transmissions, as well as bandwidth allocation for wireless information transmission (WIT). To address the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, a two-stage design method is proposed to obtain the near-optimal solution. In the first stage, by fixing the sub-timeslot of WPT while maximizing the conditional harvested energy of all IoT devices, the stable grouping strategy with the optimal antenna allocation is obtained based on the principle of two-side exchange stability (TES). In the second stage, we derive the optimal sub-timeslot and bandwidth allocations for maximizing the EE by leveraging the Dinkelbach algorithm with the Lagrange dual method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve a close-to-optimal performance for energy harvesting in the downlink. In addition, the EE can be significantly enhanced in comparison to the competitive schemes.},

  abstract     = {An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) allows to control signal propagation and may substantially improve the energy utilization efficiency for sixth-generation mobile communications. We previously proposed a wireless communication system using a standalone IRS that solves two problems: 1) channel estimation overhead for the reflective elements and 2) shared IRS use by multiple wireless network operators. The standalone IRS sweeps the reflected beam by periodically switching the phase shift to cover a wide area. However, when the user area is limited, signals with a phase shift that is not reflected in the user direction are lost. Hence, we propose a method for the standalone IRS to automatically detect useless phase shifts and update the phase-shift switching schedule according to the communication environment. Furthermore, we propose an indoor localization method that supports the automatic update for potential applications such as smart factories and smart homes, in which both communication and the localization of user equipment are required. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the communication efficiency and localization accuracy by properly updating the phase-shift switching schedule.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide a convenient mobile communication environment for vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. However, data confidentiality, access permission leakage, and privacy disclosure, are major issues of concern in such systems. Therefore, we present a publicly accountable data-sharing scheme for VANETs based on an expressive ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm. In this paper, we use white-box traceability and auditing technology to enforce accountability of both traitors and the key authority, and we employ two authorities to generate user keys collaboratively to weaken the power of one component and prevent the authority from tampering with users&#39; identities. Considering the flexible change of vehicle attributes, we implement the revocation of malicious users or vehicles by updating partial keys and ciphertexts related to revoked user&#39;s attributes. Our method also supports attribute revocation and attribute update to deal with the complex and changeable environments of VANETs and achieves privacy preservation by adopting partial policy hiding technology. Multiple fog nodes are deployed at the edge of the cloud server to assist users who are short on resources in completing the encryption and decryption calculations. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme has many advantages over others in terms of key storage consumption and the computational time consumption of encryption and decryption operations.},

In this channel, the relay uniformly quantizes amplified received signals before forwarding them to the destination. Firstly, a maximum likelihood (ML) detection at the destination, known for its high computational complexity, is presented for the MIMO AQF relay channels. To address this complexity, a suboptimal near-ML (NML) detection method is proposed. Furthermore, a MIMO deep learning (MIMO-DL) detection approach is proposed by strategically modifying the metric used in the NML detection, resulting in significantly reduced complexity. The MIMO-DL detection utilizes multiple parallel detection networks, which are trained to detect signals in real-time for time-varying fading channels. Numerical results validate that the NML detection achieves error performance very close to that of the ML detection. Moreover, the MIMO-DL detection, employing only a few number of detection networks, achieves error performance comparable to the NML detection within the interested signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. In particular, the MIMO-DL detection method facilitates the use of memory-limited AQF relays in the MIMO relay channels.},

The proposed method comprises a two-stage precoder, consisting of a fractionally spaced prefilter (FSP) per subcarrier to equalize the channel across each subcarrier band. This is followed by a conventional precoder that concentrates the signals of different users at their spatial locations, ensuring each user receives only the intended information. In practical scenarios, a perfect channel reciprocity may not hold due to radio chain mismatches in the uplink and downlink. Moreover, the channel state information (CSI) may not be perfectly known at the base station. To address these issues, we theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed precoder in presence of imperfect CSI and channel reciprocity calibration errors. Our investigation covers both co-located (cell-based) and cell-free massive MIMO cases. In the cell-free massive MIMO setup, we propose an access point selection method based on the received SINRs of different users in the uplink. Finally, we conduct numerical evaluations to assess the performance of the proposed precoder. Our results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed precoder when compared with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) method as a benchmark.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radio (CR), compressed spectrum sensing (CSS) is an attractive technology for detecting spectrum holes over a large band with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Traditional compressed spectrum (CS) reconstruction methods exhibit poor reconstruction performance and high complexity, due to the unknown and dynamically changing sparsity order of the observed signal, the hand-crafted optimization parameters involved in solvers, and dozens or hundreds of iterations. To cope with these challenges, we propose a wideband signal CS reconstruction algorithm by merging the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and deep learning (DL) through deep unfolding and refer to it as the ISTA deep reconstruction network (ISTADR-Net). The parameters in ISTADR-Net (e.g., regularization and step size parameters) are learned end-to-end rather than being adjusted manually. Next, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) network (CNNWSS-Net), which makes full use of the sparse characteristics of the reconstructed signal in the frequency domain to improve the WSS performance. The simulation results show that the proposed CSS scheme combining ISTADR-Net and CNNWSS-Net works well in low and high compression ratio scenarios, low and high signal–to–noise ratio (SNR) regions. Compared to the traditional CSS methods and other DL-based CSS methods, the proposed CSS scheme yields superior performance in terms of the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. Furthermore, the computational complexity and computation time of the proposed CSS scheme are reduced compared to the traditional CSS methods.},

In contrast to a conventional RIS, a STAR-RIS allows multiple users to transfer data simultaneously in all directions by obtaining a UWOC channel despite underwater turbulence, beam attenuation, blockage, and pointing errors. Underwater turbulence-induced fading was obtained by using exponential and generalized Gamma distributions, and numerical analysis were performed to evaluate the outage probability, bit error rate (BER), and channel capacity of a direct UWOC channel, conventional RIS assisted UWOC channel, and STAR-RIS assisted UWOC channel. The BER performance was also evaluated according to the number of reflective elements, type of modulation scheme, impact of pointing errors, blockage levels, and varying the transmit-reflection coefficient. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to validate the analytical results for the BER and outage probability with respect to the average signal-to-noise ratio. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the received luminous intensity performance with respect to the incident beam luminous intensity of the proposed STAR-RIS assisted UWOC channel.},

In this article, we consider a RIS enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network, in which the UAV serves as a base station for a terrestrial legitimate user accompanied by a terrestrial eavesdropper. Specifically, security performance of the considered network is enhanced under both instantaneous and statistical eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). To maximize the average secrecy rate and minimize the secrecy outage duration, the trajectory and beamformer of UAV and the phase shift matrix of RIS are jointly optimized. For the instantaneous CSI scenario, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm as a baseline solution, where the collective optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems and solved separately. After that, benefiting from the state-of-the-art proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is developed to solve the average secrecy rate maximization problem from a holistic perspective. For the statistical CSI case, the close-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived to expound the secrecy outage duration. Since the secrecy outage duration minimization problem is hard to be solved via the SCA based algorithm, the developed DRL based algorithm is utilized again. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmark algorithms, both the security performance and complexity of the proposed DRL based algorithm are competitive.},

  abstract     = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in military and civilian applications, which identifies the modulation schemes of received signals before signal demodulation. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology against the frequency-selective fading channel is widely applied in fourth generation (4G) and fifth generation (5G) communication systems, which may suffer from various hardware impairments, including in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and carrier frequency offset (CFO). This paper proposes an OFDM modulation classification framework, which incorporates the initial blind IQ imbalance and CFO compensation modules and the cross-selective kernel network (Cross-SKNet). Firstly, a small segment of OFDM signals is utilized for consecutive IQ imbalance and CFO compensation modules to estimate compensation coefficients and reconstruct the received burst OFDM symbols. Subsequently, the Cross-SKNet is initiated using the reconstructed signals. The network comprises the consecutive Cross-Down sampling (Cross-DS) module, the Cross-selective kernel (Cross-SK) module, and the channel and spatial attention classifier, which integrate asymmetric convolution to extract intra-symbol and inter-symbol correlation with reduced computational complexity and leverage selective kernel technology to adaptively learn the receptive field. The proposed framework can identify four different OFDM modulation formats and enhance performance by IQ imbalance and CFO compensation with a fraction of additional computation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Cross-SKNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and exhibits superior generalization capabilities at low SNR conditions. Based on the simulation results of the generated dataset, the Cross-SKNet achieves a classification accuracy of over $\bm {95\%}$ at SNR $\bm {&amp;gt;8}$ dB. Moreover, the incorporation of IQ imbalance and CFO compensation modules enhances the performance of the Cross-SKNet, which can obtain an accuracy gain of $\bm {8\%}$ at low SNR condition of $\bm {-10}$ dB.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the synthesis, design, and implementation of wideband 3-D transmitting/reflecting pattern manipulation structures (PMSs). Firstly, the design of the basic element is systematically investigated. Based on our established equivalent transmission line model, the basic element is synthesized and designed with a simple 3-D structure to effectively convert spatial waves into guided waves under prescribed performances. Then, two basic elements are antipodally placed and electrically connected by a true-time delay line, forming a transmitting element. In this way, the spatial wave can nearly perfectly propagate through the transmitting element with a manipulated transmission phase. Employing this type of element, a wideband 3-D transmitting PMS is designed for the directing angle of ( θt = 40°, φt = 90°). In addition, the reflecting element is constructed by introducing the short-circuited true-time delay line in a basic element. After that, a wideband 3-D reflecting PMS is accomplished for a pointing angle of ( θr = 40°, φr = 90°). Finally, these two PMSs are implemented with fabrication and testing. Measurements agree well with simulations, proving our proposed design concept. Within the operating bandwidth of 64.9% in fraction (6.5–12.75 GHz) for the transmitting PMS, the simulated and measured average efficiencies are higher than 82.5% and 77.8%, respectively. For the reflecting PMS, an operating bandwidth of 70.1% in fraction (6.25–13.0 GHz) is realized, where the in-band average efficiencies for simulation and measurement reach 82.5% and 77.4%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed wideband 3-D transmitting/reflecting PMS has been evidently confirmed and can be potentially employed as a promising selection to manipulate the radio wave for future networks.},

First, we focus on minimizing the maximum bit error rate (BER) among all ground devices (GDs) while meeting the minimum communication rate requirements by jointly designing the active transmit beamforming and flight trajectory of the UAV as well as IRS reflective phase shifts. Then, we develop an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD) technology to address this optimization problem. Specifically, the optimization problem is decoupled into three sub-problems to be alternately solved, which are solved by invoking the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Moreover, the convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed.

In this work, we investigate the ISAC beamforming design to maximize the mutual information between the target response matrix of a point radar target and the echo signals, while ensuring the data rate requirements of the communication users. The scenarios in this paper are considered from two perspectives: one is from the perspective of the number of communication users, and the other is from the perspective of the type of echo interference caused by other interfering scatterers. For the case of a single communication user, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, we consider three types of echo interference, no interference, a point interference, and an extended interference. For the case of multiple communication users, the interference is also an extended one, and furthermore, each user&#39;s communication rate requirement needs to be satisfied. To find the optimal beamforming design in these problems, we provide a closed-form solution with low complexity, a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, a low-complexity algorithm based on the Majorization-Minimization (MM) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, and an algorithm based on MM method and SCA method, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to the ISAC beamforming schemes based on the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) metric, the beampattern metric and the MSE metric, the proposed mutual information metric can bring better beampattern and root mean square error (RMSE) of angle estimation. Furthermore, our proposed schemes designed based on the mutual information metric can suppress the echo interference from interfering scatterers in the environment effectively.},

  abstract     = {In order to break through the development bottleneck of modern wireless communication networks, a critical issue is the out-of-date channel state information (CSI) in high mobility scenarios. In general, non-stationary CSI has statistical properties which vary with time, implying that the data distribution changes continuously over time. This temporal distribution shift behavior undermines the accurate channel prediction and it is still an open problem in the related literature. In this paper, a hypernetwork based framework is proposed for non-stationary channel prediction. The framework aims to dynamically update the neural network (NN) parameters as the wireless channel changes to automatically adapt to various input CSI distributions. Based on this framework, we focus on low-complexity hypernetwork design and present a deep learning (DL) based channel prediction method, termed as LPCNet, which improves the CSI prediction accuracy with acceptable complexity. Moreover, to maximize the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE), a joint channel prediction and beamforming (BF) method is developed, termed as JLPCNet, which seeks to predict the BF vector. Our numerical results showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework, and demonstrate the superior performance of LPCNet and JLPCNet in various scenarios for fixed and varying user speeds.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is a critical requirement for Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G vertical applications. However, URLLC scenarios seriously restrict packet length in the physical layer, which makes it difficult to exploit both time/frequency diversity and degrades transmission reliability. Cell-free massive MIMO (mMIMO) is a promising technology that can provide sufficient antennas for space diversity to fulfill the high reliability demands and improve the performance of cell-edge users. In this article, we propose a short packet transmission scheme in a cell-free mMIMO system for URLLC scenarios. To mitigate inter-user interference and pilot contamination, we employ zero-forcing combining and propose a pilot assignment algorithm. The closed-form expressions for performance metrics are derived and used for joint power allocation to enhance the performance of users located at the cell-edge or those experiencing strong interference. The simulation results confirm the tightness between the closed-form performance metrics and Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed pilot assignment algorithm and joint power allocation method has been successfully verified.},

  abstract     = {A spectrum-sharing satellite-ground integrated network is conceived, consisting of a pair of non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) constellations and multiple terrestrial base stations, which impose the co-frequency interference (CFI) on each other. The CFI may increase upon increasing the number of satellites. To manage the potentially severe interference, we propose to rely on joint multi-domain resource aided interference management (JMDR-IM). Specifically, the coverage overlap of the constellations considered is analyzed. Then, multi-domain resources - including both the beam-domain and power-domain - are jointly utilized for managing the CFI in an overlapping coverage region. This joint resource utilization is performed by relying on our specifically designed beam-shut-off and switching based beam scheduling, as well as on long short-term memory based joint autoregressive moving average assisted deep Q network aided power scheduling. Moreover, the outage probability (OP) of the proposed JMDR-IM scheme is derived, and the asymptotic analysis of the OP is also provided. Our performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed JMDR-IM scheme in terms of its increased throughput and reduced OP.},

In this paper, the effects of the auxiliary array parameters on the interference suppression performance are analyzed, and the maximum acceptable area model is proposed. After deriving and simplifying the analytical solutions of the weights and the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) after interference suppression, the efficient acceptable rule inherits suppression requirements of the communication radio, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed model focuses on maximizing the acceptable area in view of this rule. The gain of the auxiliary antenna is also obtained by the proposed model. Based on theoretical analysis, we designed the auxiliary structure, which can fully absorb the advantages of the loading and matching technology and avoid the limitations of the independent strategy. However, the structure parameters, including the topology and components of the antenna, are complex and interactive. Therefore, the intelligent method named the homogeneous Grasshopper optimization algorithm was adopted to consider these parameters comprehensively. Finally, it leads to a remarkable improvement in the optimization efficiency for not only the spacing but also the antenna parameters. Experiments based on communication radio demonstrate that the proposed model is very efficient and promising for auxiliary array optimization, and the implemented antenna achieves ideal radiation characteristics and high gain in a wide frequency band.},

Results show that up to 6 orders of magnitude improvements are observed with beamwidth optimization, and MaxActive with EP performs close to CFB and STD schemes with WF in all scenarios, even under realistic beam misalignment fading instances (low and high). For drone-to-drone communications, our results prove that the THz band can provide high capacity, in the order of Tbps, which can be preserved well with beam alignment/adjustment. Evaluating also the complexity of all considered resource allocation techniques, it is concluded that MaxActive with EP allocation stands out as the most feasible scheme in terms of practical implementation with the best performance.},

  abstract     = {With the growing development of human-robot collaboration systems, large-scale network topology and node heterogeneity lead to new communication problems. Focusing on these actual requirements, we propose variable cluster routing (VCR) to ensure the communication stability of large-scale human-robot collaboration systems (called large-scale heterogeneous self-organizing networks in the communication field). VCR is characterized by variable window (VW) and a top-down cluster head selection. Each VW includes one or more rounds. In the first round of each VW, base station adjusts the number of rounds (also called the window length) and broadcasts the window length. Then, each node randomly generates its round ID from 1 to the window length and only participates in its round-ID clustering. Therefore, nodes are uniformly assigned to different rounds for transmitting data packets. By adjusting the window length, VCR avoids network congestion and instability effectively. Besides, according to the information of last-round nodes, base station uses a top-down approach to select the present-round cluster heads and then broadcasts cluster head list to accomplish the assignment of cluster heads. This approach ensures network connectivity. We compared other protocols with VCR. VCR outperforms others. Moreover, these results indicate that VCR can extend to large-scale wireless sensor networks, high-density UAV swarms in the military, large-scale human-machine heterogeneous systems, smart open-pit mines, and so on.},

Thereby, the information forwarding at the UAV will be solely powered by its harvested energy. We aim to maximize the aggregate end-to-end throughput by optimizing the transmit power of the source and UAV, PS ratio, and UAV trajectory. Since the optimization variables are closely coupled, the formulated problem is non-convex. To tackle this issue, we adopt a block coordinate descent method to divide the optimization variables into two blocks, each of which is alternately optimized while fixing the other. We optimize the transmit power, PS ratio, and UAV trajectory by applying the Lagrange duality and the sequential convex programming algorithm, respectively.

To guard AmBC from wardens, existing studies widely rely on covert communication, but consider only one warden and require the warden&#39;s position known to legitimate users. In this paper, we propose a covert AmBC scheme against randomly distributed wardens, which maximizes the covert rate subject to the covertness constraint by utilizing a full-duplex receiver to transmit varying-power interference signals. First, we give a comprehensive performance metric analysis in terms of the covertness, reliability, and overall covert rate by considering the joint decoding performance of the cooperative receiver in the AmBC system. Then, we derive a strong covertness constraint that one of the wardens can be located at the optimal detection location and always uses the optimal detection thresholds. Under this worst situation, we optimize the maximum artificial noise (AN) power and transmission rate to maximize the covert rate. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which achieves a positive covert rate for any randomly varying range of jamming power and transmission rate that satisfies the covertness constraint, even in the presence of multiple wardens.},

However, the uneven distribution of users, the coupling of multi-dimensional resources, complex inter-beam interference, and time-varying network topologies all impose significant challenges on effective communication resource management. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of beam direction and the allocation of spectrum, time, and power resource in a dynamic multi-beam LEO satellite network. The objective is to improve long-term user sum data rate while taking user fairness into account. Since the concerned resource management problem is mixed-integer non-convex programming, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems, namely beam direction control and time slot allocation, user subchannel assignment, and beam power allocation. Then, these subproblems are solved iteratively by leveraging matching with externalities and successive convex approximation, and the proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of stability, convergence, and complexity. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposal can improve the number of served users by up to two times and the sum user data rate by up to 68%, compared to baseline schemes.},

It consists of two cross-arranged dipoles, four parasitic elements, a feeding network, and a ground plane. The radiation arm of the dipoles is shaped in a truncated elliptical form to broaden the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth. To stabilize the radiation pattern and improve the axial ratio at higher frequencies in the proposed cross-dipole antenna, four sequential rotating patches are strategically positioned on the two cross-arranged dipoles. The design incorporates a specialized and highly-integrated feed network, comprising a miniaturized 90° stripline coupler and two double-sided parallel lines. This feed network is meticulously engineered to excite the dipoles, resulting in the generation of dual-circularly polarized radiation. Through the implementation of this innovative approach, an ultra-wideband dual-circularly polarized antenna having stable radiation pattern is designed, manufactured, and measured. The proposed cross-dipole antenna achieves impedance bandwidth (Reflection coefficient ≤−10 dB) from 1.25 to 4.7 GHz and axial ratio bandwidth (Axial ratio ≤ 3 dB) from 1.3 to 4.7 GHz, indicating that the overlapped impedance and axial ratio bandwidth reaches 113.3%.

  abstract     = {The vacuum tube train can break through the difficulties of wheel-rail resistance, air resistance and noise of traditional wheel-rail railways. It can reach ultra-high speed of more than 600 km/h, and greatly shorten the world distance. However, the vacuum tube has extremely high penetration losses to radio waves, and the ultra-high-speed movement of trains can also cause more serious problems such as group handover and Doppler effect than traditional high-speed train communication. In this paper, we focus on the train-to-ground millimeter wave (mmWave) communication scheduling problem of vacuum tube trains. We propose an effective multi-hop out-pipe communication architecture. The ground communication adopts a novel centralized base band unit (BBU) resource pool and distributed radio remote unit (RRU). A radio-over-fiber (RoF) technology is used to build mobile cells to achieve handover-free and improve the efficiency of train-to-ground communication. The wireless transmission within the pipeline uses specially designed leaky waveguides to overcome the Doppler spread caused by the flying movement of ultra-high-speed trains. This cleverly avoids the stubborn problems in high-speed railways. In addition, we also propose a scheduling scheme to maximize the number of successfully scheduled user request flows within a superframe. By discretizing the continuous superframes into multiple time slot segments, the complexity of the scheduling algorithm is lowered.

  abstract     = {Vehicles today are equipped with different sensors, such as GPS, camera, and LiDAR. We propose Omni-CNN, a machine-learning (ML) based framework that accepts one or more of such available sensor inputs to speed up beam selection in vehicular networks, instead of performing an exhaustive search among all possible beams. Omni-CNN proposes a modality-agnostic approach, where a single shared model can accommodate any combination of these sensor inputs but with appropriate weight-selection masks specific to each modality. In Omni-CNN, we first use the residual capacity of the shared model to learn the predictive task for the current modality. Second, we propose an adaptive algorithm to calculate the required capacity on a per-layer basis and release the excess capacity for the next modalities. In our design, we use the gradients to identify the sparsity constraints that result in minimum capacity usage, while maintaining the accuracy. Third, given the sparsity constraints, we solve an optimization problem to select modality-specific sub-models using Alternating Directions-Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Finally, we include decision level aggregation to handle scenarios, where more than one modality is present. Results on a challenging real-world dataset reveal that Omni-CNN reduces the overall model size by 91.4%, while achieving 80.89% accuracy in the prediction of the optimal beam. Furthermore, it reduces the beam selection overhead by 99.37% while retaining 93.34% of the throughput, compared to the 802.11ad standard.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and index modulation (IM) have been proven as potential technologies for improving the performance of next-generation wireless communication systems. In this paper, we consider the study of a receive diversity RIS-assisted wireless communication system employing two IM schemes, namely, space-shift keying (SSK) and spatial modulation (SM) for data transmission over Nakagami- $m$ fading channels. Considering the RIS to lie in close proximity to the transmitter, a receiver structure based on a greedy detection rule is proposed to select one of the receive diversity branches with the highest received energy for demodulation. Based on this system model, novel closed-form expressions for the probability of erroneous index detection (PED) of the considered target receive diversity branch, and the corresponding asymptotic expressions at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained using a characteristic function approach. Furthermore, closed-form and asymptotic expressions at high SNR for the bit error rate (BER) for the SSK-based system and the SM-based system employing $M$ -ary phase-shift keying and $M$ -ary quadrature amplitude modulation schemes are also derived. The dependencies of the performance of the considered system are also corroborated via numerical results. The asymptotic expressions and results of PED and BER at high and low SNR values lead to the observation of a performance saturation and the presence of an SNR value as a point of inflection attributed to the greedy detector&#39;s structure.},

In this paper, we focus on a millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO ISAC system, where a mono-static MIMO ISAC node equipped with large transmit and receive antenna arrays wishes to sense a target while concurrently serving a communication user equipment (UE). We propose a cost-effective analog beamforming method, where double-beam codebooks are designed for both the ISAC transmitter and receiver based on sub-array methods. The proposed double-beam codebook can formulate double beams flexibly and it includes the conventional single-beam codebook as a special case. For sensing and communication purposes, the ISAC transmitter needs to direct signals towards the sensing target and communication UE concurrently, and the ISAC receiver requires to formulate receive beams to effectively receive the echoes reflected from the sensing target. To achieve this goal, we further propose the novel simultaneous beam sweeping schemes to search the optimal transmit and receive beams of ISAC, where both simultaneous single-beam and double-beam sweeping schemes are proposed that can achieve different balances between the beamforming gain and required time overhead for beam sweeping. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed double-beam codebook design and beam sweeping schemes compared to the conventional benchmarks.},

However, existing studies usually model the C/U-planes as two separate homogeneous networks, neglecting the dependence among the two planes and users. To address this problem, we analyze the coverage probability, spectrum efficiency (SE) and delay considering the dependent features among CBSs, DBSs, and non-uniformly distributed users based on stochastic geometry. Firstly, we present an analytical model for CUPS, where the DBSs are deployed at user hotspots based on Poisson point processes (PPPs), users are clustered around DBSs based on Poisson cluster processes (PCPs), and CBSs are deployed according to a dependent thinning of locations of DBSs based on Matérn hard-core processes (MHCPs). Secondly, we design novel distance-based fractional frequency reuse (FFR) schemes by exploiting the properties of PCP and MHCP to improve the coverage of cell edge users. Thirdly, we derive the distributions of user downlink rates, which are used to analyze the average queueing delay under M/M/C queueing model. Numerical results are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed model compared to independently distributed BSs and users, and show the dependent BS deployment could significantly improve the coverage of the network.},

Evaluation on two datasets shows that the MAQ expands the warning area by approximately 1.675 and 1.34 times compared with that of raw polygons.

To this end, we devise a framework to maximize radar detection probability, taking into account the combined aspects of transmit beamforming and RIS phase-shift vector formulation, ensuring we adhere to set standards for communication quality of service (QoS), transmit power limitations, and phase-shift parameters. Firstly, we obtain the target angle by maximum likelihood estimation. Then, we perform target tracking by solving a Quadratic Semidefinite Programming (QSDP) problem. Next, we maximize the detection probability for different scenarios, i.e., general case and special case respectively. In the special case, we obtain the explicit expression for the transmit beamforming and employ Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) to determine the phase-shift vector of the RIS. Finally, we demonstrate simulation results that validate the performance of the proposed method and confirm the efficacy of the proposed Majorization-Minimization (MM) and Penalty-aided Block Coordinate Descent (PBCD) algorithm across various scenarios.},

To overcome this challenge, we intrinsically integrate index modulation (IM) with CE-OFDM for the purpose of realizing the full potential of frequency diversity gains, yielding improved BER performance without occupying too many bandwidth resources. We have also develop a pair of detectors for the proposed CE-OFDM-IM scheme, including the optimal but high-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector, the low-complexity phase detector, and the novel reduced-space ML receiver, offering flexible designs for different optimization goals. Moreover, the theoretical performance of the proposed CE-OFDM-IM scheme is mathematically quantified through derivations. Our simulation results confirm the precision of the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of providing a favourable performance gain over the original CE-OFDM scheme, especially for channels with substantial multi-path components.},

This article takes into account the case of multiple users and an eavesdropper (Eve) in the target beam. In particular, we consider the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle to generate artificial noise in order to confuse Eve, while acting as a relay for the legitimate users. In addition, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy is used to support multi-user communication and to improve the transmission rate. Considering the constraints due to quality of service, total and per-beam transmit power of the satellite, two robust secure precoding algorithms are presented to maximize the minimal achievable secrecy rate of the legitimate users for both non-critical and critical applications. Since the formulated optimization problems are non-convex, we first use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality to solve the non-convex constraint of the successive interference cancellation decoding order, and the logarithmic parameter form is addressed by using the first-order Taylor series expansion. Besides, the secure outage probability constraint of the critical case is effectively resolved by applying the Bernstein-type inequality/decomposition-based large deviation inequality. Moreover, semi-definite relaxation and penalty function optimization methods are adopted to design the transmit power of the satellite in two cases, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust precoding design methods.},

For the upcoming sixth-generation wireless networks, the spectrally efficient non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is utilized to serve a large number of users. To increase power efficiency and improve outage probability, the power amplifier at the base station is operated close to saturation, which causes non-linear distortions (NLD). Thus, it is essential to understand the underlying performance guarantees of NOMA-enabled HCN systems (HCN-NOMA) under the non-linear distortions by the high power amplifiers (HPA). This study applies the stochastic geometric approach to analyze the performance of HCN-NOMA under imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) in HCN with NLD. Orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA under both perfect and ipSIC in multi-tier HCN are compared. The performance is assessed and compared in terms of outage probability, ergodic capacity, system throughput, and energy efficiency. It is observed that the performance is improved by up to 96% by employing NOMA as compared to OMA while operating in the non-linear region of the HPA.

In this paper, we investigate the joint reliability optimization and beamforming design problem for a STAR-RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) URLLC system in an industrial IoT scenario. A system sum-rate maximization problem is formulated, subject to the STAR-RIS amplitude and phase shift constraints, power and reliability constraints. To solve this problem, we design a joint optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. The algorithm determines the optimal access point transmit precoding matrix, STAR-RIS reflection- and transmission-coefficient matrices, and the packet error probabilities for actuators based on the channel state information (CSI). On this account, the proposed algorithm dynamically tunes the STAR-RIS to make the optimal beam response for real-time channel changes. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide substantial performance benefits over several baseline schemes. Moreover, the actual channel model with channel estimation error is also considered for reliability to evaluate the impact of imperfect CSI on system performance.},

The closed-form expressions for effective throughput of the BU for the NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes are derived in the two fading scenarios with the corresponding resource allocation schemes. Numerical results are presented to verify our analysis and give more insights into system performance. The results show that the proposed resource allocation schemes are effective in their corresponding fading scenarios.

Initially, we develop iterations based on convex quadratic solvers (CQ) to tackle the problem of maximizing the users&#39; minimum rate (MR). Given that the computational complexity of these CQs is cubic, leading to high costs in large-scale computations, we introduce a pair of surrogate objectives. These objectives are designed in a way that their constrained optimization can be efficiently managed through iterations of closed-form expressions with scalable complexity, rendering them practical for large-scale computations. This pair of surrogate objectives comprises the maximization of the geometric mean of users&#39; rates (GM-rate maximization) and the soft-maximization of users&#39; MR (soft max-min rate optimization). Remarkably, they not only enhance MR but also contribute to the improvement of the sum-rate (SR). Building upon the GM-rate optimization, we further propose addressing the energy efficiency problem, which achieves a high ratio of SR to power consumption and MR to power dissipation through closed-form expressions. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed solutions.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) communications appear to be one of the most promising paradigms for future wireless communication networks, because of their high flexibility in providing on-demand communication services. In this context, this article investigates a fast and fine-grained UAV deployment scheme so as to improve the network throughput and meet the real-time communication demands of users. The key novelty of the proposed scheme lies in that the UAV deployment problem is formulated as a computer vision problem and a novel UAV deployment method, i.e., a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based UAV deployment method is proposed to solve it. By taking advantage of the classical CNN models such as VGG-Net, AlexNet, the UAV deployment position can be determined timely. Compared with the existing work, this work not only reduces the computational time overhead for determining the deployment positions of UAV, but also shortens the deployment response time of UAV. The superiority of the proposed UAV deployment scheme is investigated and verified. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide a fast and on-demand UAV deployment solution while guaranteeing the throughput performance of the UAV network.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DOA) plays an essential role in wireless communications, which has been widely utilized in localization and intelligent navigation. Recently, with explosive growth of wireless communication devices, the electromagnetic environment has become more and more complicated. In such electromagnetic environment, it remains a challenge to achieve robust DOA estimation while maximizing source discrimination with limited physical sensors. Additionally, conventional DOA methods are usually based on Gaussian noise assumption, while these methods would suffer from performance degradation in impulsive noise. Aiming at addressing these issues, we propose a novel robust DOA estimation method with high degree of freedom (DOF). In the proposed method, firstly, a novel mirror coprime array (MCA) structure is proposed for DOA estimation. Relying on the properties of non-circular signals, MCA can make full use of the received signals from limited physical elements to accurately estimate more DOAs with high DOF. Next, a novel square-based correntropy operator (SCO) is defined to effectively suppress impulsive noise in complicated electromagnetic environment. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SCO in impulsive noise suppression theoretically. Further, accurate and robust DOA estimation with high DOF can be realized through the proposed MCA-SCO-MUSIC method, which innovatively fuses the pseudo-covariance matrix generated by SCO into MCA based DOA estimation method. Finally, we conduct a series experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed method, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing DOF without adding physical array elements. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits better performance compared to contrastive methods in impulsive noise.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the fingerprint-based three-dimensional (3D) user positioning issue for wide-area cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To adequately capture the multipath channel features, we propose a novel angle-space channel power matrix (ASCPM) fingerprint, which is shown to be closely related to the geographical position. Through further analyzing the distribution of fingerprint sparsity, we reveal that each sub-region possesses a unique fingerprint-position mapping relationship, which is intractable for the bulky whole-region-enabled positioning neural networks to obtain. Therefore, a handcrafted hierarchical localization framework is designed for wide low-altitude stereo coverage scenes. To be specific, we exploit the weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithm based on the coarse-grained received signal strength (RSS) to quickly identify the sub-region to which the user belongs. Subsequently, an adaptive three-stage residual convolutional neural network (ATResNet) with fine-grained ASCPM fingerprint as the input is adopted to determine accurate 3D position estimation. By intensive simulations in a ray-tracing signal propagation scenario based on the Wireless Insite (WI) software, the proposed hierarchical framework is demonstrated to achieve high 3D positioning accuracy with low computational complexity and storage overhead.},

  abstract     = {Massive MIMO systems are appropriate technology for providing service to numerous high-rate Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In uncoordinated access, devices are not required to inform the BS when they have transmitted the pilot. Consequently, the current paper focuses on channel tracking of both active and inactive devices in an uncoordinated practical scenario. To this end, some suboptimal algorithms are introduced due to the intractability of the optimal uncoordinated practical scenario (O-UPS) tracker. An efficient MMSE-UPS (M-UPS) tracker is developed by inferring the concept of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm per access slot, resulting in a significant reduction in complexity. The performance of M-UPS is shown to be monotonically non-decreasing, concerning the increase in the activity probability of devices. When the channel state is stable, the following results are analyzed: I) upper and lower bounds for the MSE of M-UPS, II) stability and convergence of M-UPS, and III) a tight upper bound on the efficiency degradation between O-UPS and M-UPS. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition to prove the stability of M-UPS for an unstable channel state is characterized. It is demonstrated that, under a certain assumption, the M-UPS tracker&#39;s error converges to O-UPS. More importantly, this paper indicates that the stability and convergence of M-UPS are identical to those of O-UPS, which is a significant property of M-UPS. Moreover, a new heuristic tracker is developed, and its stability under a necessary assumption is examined using Riccati difference equations. Finally, the simulation results reveal the designed trackers&#39; performance.},

Precisely, the two criteria are to apply the least-squares and absolute errors, respectively, to approximate a desired transmit beampattern. Both criteria result in nonconvex constrained optimization problems. For the former, the solution is derived via reformulating the initial problem into a quadratic form, which can be solved by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). For the latter, the design problem is formulated into an ${l_{1}}$ -norm real-valued form, which is solved iteratively by using a nested ADMM (N-ADMM) algorithm. Moreover, both the convergence and computational complexities of these two algorithms are discussed. Numerical simulations show that the obtained beampatterns by the proposed algorithms can well approximate the given beampattern under the required constraints.},

  abstract     = {Recent urbanization has posed challenges for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to provide accurate navigation solutions. This is especially true in GNSS-denied environments, where the clear line of sight (LOS) path between the satellites and receiver is lacking. For such environments, fusion-based techniques relying on external sensors and/or other signals are widely used. However, such external sensors and signals may not be feasible and/or cost-effective every time. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a system that makes explicit use of past available measurements, under certain assumptions, to generate new synthetic measurements. For this purpose, two functions are proposed in this work: a geometrically decaying series and a linear combination of past measurements. To enhance the overall performance of the system, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used as an additional measurement source in the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In addition, an approach to adapt the noise co-variances that support the generation of synthetic measurements is proposed. Furthermore, we derive the optimal gain under specific assumptions for a concrete theoretical understanding of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated through two real-world datasets collected in Hong Kong, one corresponding to a moving vehicle inside a significantly long sea tunnel and another set in a harsh urban area, involving complex trajectories. A detailed analysis of the results has been performed with respect to all the aforementioned contributions. Additionally, the proposed algorithm has been compared with other existing algorithms. Experimental results show that a mean error of about 4 m is attained inside the tunnel, while it is around 4.6 m for the second scenario set in a harsh urban environment.},

However, enhancing the accuracy of deep learning algorithms with limited data remains a challenge. Furthermore, contrastive learning based on CNN has proven to be effective in enhancing the model&#39;s generalization performance. This article proposes a recognition algorithm for radar active deception jamming based on contrastive learning and tensor decomposition (CL-TD), specifically designed for recognizing compound jamming with relatively large sub-jamming energy difference in scenarios with limited samples. Specifically, the proposed method aims to decompose the compound jamming signal into single jamming signal resorting to tensor decomposition algorithm. Then, the signal features of single jamming are then extracted by applying contrastive learning, even with a small number of labeled samples. Finally, by supervised training of both the feature extraction and classification modules, the classification results of jamming signals can be obtained. The proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition performance, as demonstrated in experiments conducted on a simulated dataset consisting of 12 different sample types.},

However, the openness of the Internet of Vehicles and wireless communication has introduced substantial privacy and security concerns, necessitating the adoption of identity authentication technology to ensure secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In response to the challenges posed by single point of failure and high computational costs in traditional centralized identity authentication schemes, this study proposes a blockchain-based batch authentication scheme for the Internet of Vehicles BBASV. By leveraging a non-pairing certificateless mechanism, the BBASV scheme effectively addresses these limitations, reducing the computational complexity and network traffic in the authentication process, thereby enabling efficient batch authentication. Additionally, identity-based prefix-key encryption is utilized to preserve the privacy of vehicle identities during proxy vehicle broadcasting. Moreover, the proxy vehicle leverages signature fusion technology to perform batch authentication on neighboring vehicles, alleviating the authentication burden on roadside units. The effectiveness of the BBASV scheme is rigorously evaluated through theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation, demonstrating its resilience against various security threats, including DoS attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and simulated attacks. Furthermore, the scheme exhibits favorable attributes such as low computational requirements and network traffic, rendering it a promising solution for ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication within the Internet of Vehicles domain.},

  abstract     = {Railway running gears with Independently Rotating Wheels (IRW) can significantly improve wear figures, comfort, and safety in railway transportation, but certain measures for wheelset stabilization are required. This is one reason why the application of traditional wheelsets is still common practice in industry. Apart from lateral guidance, the longitudinal control is of crucial importance for railway safety. In the current contribution, an integrated controller for joint lateral and longitudinal control of a high-speed railway running gear with driven IRW is designed. To this end, a novel adhesion-based traction control law is combined with Linear Time-Variant (LTV) and nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes for lateral guidance. The MPC schemes are able to use tabulated track geometry data and preview information about set points to minimize the lateral displacement error. Co-simulation results with a detailed Multi-Body Simulation (MBS) show the effectiveness of the approach compared with state-of-the-art techniques in various scenarios, including curving, varying velocities up to 400 km/h and abruptly changing wheel-rail adhesion conditions.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimating the state-of-charge (SOC) of Li-ion battery contributes significantly to electric vehicle safety. Existing methods typically focus on the traditional recurrent neural networks to encode time series features for SOC estimation. However, these methods rely solely on their own structure to extract time series correlated features, ignoring a significant amount of information on temporal dimension. To address this issue, this paper proposes a temporal transformer-based sequence network (TTSNet) that can make full use of temporal dimensional information to model the relationship between the input and SOC. Specifically, the proposed network splits the raw data into three branches including voltage, current, and temperature, as well as extracts the corresponding primary semantic features. It then uses a temporal transformer to effectively encode the features of temporal dimensional information. The resulting features are further fed into an attention-guided feature fusion module to interact information among voltage, current, and temperature branches for subsequent SOC estimation. To enhance the network&#39;s resilience for long time sequences, a sliding time window technique is introduced to pre-process the raw data. Besides, a Kalman filter is incorporated as post-processing to smooth the output to guide a more accurate SOC estimation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on battery open datasets and vehicle operation datasets to verify the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and strong robustness in both datasets, with average MAE, RMSE, and $\mathrm{R^{2}}$ values of 0.506%, 0.694%, and 99.791%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {It is a critical issue for achieving dynamic average consensus (DAC) in the presence of privacy eavesdroppers and false data injection (FDI) attacks, and this scenario is applicable to intelligent transportation systems. A dynamic event-triggered privacy preserving DAC (DET-PPDAC) control scheme is proposed. Firstly, in a privacy-sensitive scene, different time-varying terms are added to communication states by hiding real information from eavesdroppers. An observer and a compensator are designed to construct a control scheme for compensating for the impact of FDI attacks over a channel between a control signal and an actuator. Adaptive auxiliary variables are introduced for compensating for residual errors owing to asymmetric encryption/decryption functions. Dynamic event-triggered conditions are constructed to reduce the number of data as well as the risk of leakage by eavesdroppers, and continuous monitor from neighbors is removed. Our DET-PPDAC control scheme can also be applied to a directed graph. Stability analysis shows that the control scheme finally achieves DAC with bounded errors and Zeno-free behaviors while satisfying the requirement of privacy preservation. Simulation examples with formation of vehicles are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

According to the least squares method, the AUV position is calculated based on the isogradient sound speed model and the round-trip time of the localization signals. The localization error averaged over different beacon sets is evaluated to formulate the localization policy distribution. Deep neural network is designed to estimate the expected long-term discounted utility with higher feature extraction efficiency for the underwater networks with a large number of beacons. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds of the proposed localization schemes are derived to analyze the effect of the position fluctuation of beacons on the localization accuracy.

  abstract     = {Using wireless communication and sensor detection technologies, the cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) can acquire a wealth of vehicle and road information to provide data support for traffic participants. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proven to be a promising method for real-time decision-making based on high-dimensional data, which is widely used in traffic control. However, the existing DRL-based research mostly ignores the deep cooperation between the vehicle and the road. In this paper, we present a cooperative optimization of traffic signals and vehicle speed based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (COTV-MADRL), aiming to reduce unnecessary stops at the intersection and enhance traffic efficiency. The proposed COTV-MADRL includes two types of agents, called the Light-agent and the Vehicle-agent, which make the policy for traffic lights and vehicles, respectively. To achieve refined control and smoothen traffic flow, the Light-agent adopts a hierarchical architecture to realize the macro-control of the signal cycle and the micro-control of the phase. Meanwhile, the Vehicle-agent also smoothens the traffic flow by harmonizing the speed and the reward design considers the trade-off between efficiency and comfort by referring to human driving behavior. With the support of CVIS, Light-agent and Vehicle-agent can collaborate in the form of information interaction. We conduct experiments on 108 signalized intersections using real online car-hailing data, and the simulation results show that the proposed COTV-MADRL significantly outperforms the conventional methods and several baseline DRL methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent cooperative positioning (CP) is widely applied in many applications of unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is an effective tool to conduct CP on a large scale. However, the performance of traditional GNSS-based CP algorithms is limited by the accuracy of single-agent self-positioning. In this paper, we propose a robust GNSS-based cooperative algorithm to achieve instantaneous precise positioning of multiple agents. In the proposed algorithm, precise point positioning-real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK) is utilized to conduct single-agent self-positioning, which is capable of achieving centimeter-level positioning rapidly with precise atmospheric corrections. Moreover, inter-agent associations derived from double-differenced carrier-phase observations and inter-epoch associations obtained via time-differenced carrier-phase observations are integrated with single-agent self-positioning by a factor graph-based optimizer. To evaluate the proposed scheme, real-world experiments with four agents in different scenarios were carried out. Based on the 30-minute field experimental results, the proposed scheme showed superior positioning performance with minimum and maximum three-dimension root mean square errors (3D-RMSEs) of 5.9 cm and 10.3 cm, respectively. It turned out that benefiting from PPP-RTK&#39;s characteristic of achieving precise positioning, the proposed method can converge to centimeter-level accuracy instantaneously.},

  abstract     = {Kinematic description of a nonholonomic articulated N-Trailer vehicle includes two kinds of parameters: trailer lengths and hitching offsets. In the case of picking up of various trailers by an automated tractor in logistic hubs or transshipment terminals, the kinematic parameters of trailers can be uncertain or even unknown to a control system of the automated tractor. Since an accurate kinematic model is usually required to keep effective functionality of automated vehicles, it seems justified to provide a model-learning capability to the automated or intelligent tractors of N-Trailer vehicles. In this paper, we propose a scalable (with respect to any finite number of trailers) parametric identification procedure applicable to any type of N-Trailer kinematics with non-steerable trailers&#39; wheels. The key idea results from a reformulation of joint-angles kinematics in an iterative form of linear regression models with only two parameters. The proposed estimation algorithm assumes availability of measurements of articulation angles and characteristic velocities of the tractor. Numerical results obtained for the 5-Trailer nonholonomic kinematics and for a high-fidelity TruckSim vehicle model equipped with three trailers illustrate effectiveness of the proposed data-based modeling approach and large-sample statistical properties of the applied estimation procedure.},

Up to now, there is no strategy that effectively lowers the influence of such instability on the accuracy of positioning. Moreover, recent studies showed that indoor positioning techniques are vulnerable to noise in RSSI data and cyber-attacks, which make them more expensive. In this study, a new Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is proposed for the indoor positioning of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) using a deep convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method handles signal processing by converting the RSSI signal into an image. In which, the 1-D RSSI signal is converted into 2-D image data in order to generate the new features based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and then the proposed deep CNN is implemented for the indoor positioning system. The test results show that the proposed model can outperform other state-of-the-art positioning techniques with small position errors. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model is validated against various adversarial attacks.

To address these issues, we propose a novel reinforcement learning method named RL4V2X for decision-making and motion-controlling of autonomous driving. This method is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a gate recurrent unit (GRU) and three gate networks. Specifically, the CNN extracts a vehicle spatial distribution to better represent the traffic. The GRU constructs the sequence features to characterize the dynamics of traffic, which can be used to compensate for the lack of information when V2X communications are interrupted. In addition, the gate networks assign the confidence to different features according to the interruption situations. Extensive simulation results in different traffic conditions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, road safety has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners in the intelligent vehicle domain. As one of the most common and vulnerable groups of road users, pedestrians cause great concerns due to their unpredictable behaviour and movement, as subtle misunderstandings in vehicle-pedestrian interaction can easily lead to risky situations or collisions. Existing methods are usually limited by their poor generalization ability across scenarios and high demand on human calibrations. This work tackles the listed problems by proposing a Pedestrian Risk Level Prediction (PRLP) system. The system consists of three modules: data collection and processing module, pedestrian trajectory prediction module, and risk level identification module. Firstly, vehicle-perspective pedestrian data are collected. A collision-model-based risk indicator, Time-To-Collision (TTC), and spatial-temporal features, relative position and speed of pedestrian, are extracted. Using the long short-term memory model, the pedestrian trajectory prediction module predicts the relative positions in the subsequent five frames and yields speed and TTC predictions. To learn pedestrian risk patterns, a hybrid clustering and classification method is adopted to learn from the risk indicator and the spatial-temporal features, and train a risk level classifier using the learned patterns. Upon predicting the spatial-temporal features of pedestrians and identifying the corresponding risk level, the risk patterns between the ego vehicle and pedestrians are determined. Experimental results verified the capability of the PRLP system to predict the risk level of pedestrians, thus supporting the collision risk assessment of intelligent vehicles and providing safety warnings to both vehicles and pedestrians.},

  abstract     = {The growing urbanization and the development of new energy automobiles have motivated a significant increase in the number of vehicles on the highway, which has put increasing pressure on existing transportation systems. Platooning control is an effective scheme to enhance road traffic safety and alleviate traffic congestion. In this paper, platooning control under multiple description encoding schemes (MDESs) is investigated for automated vehicles with nonlinear dynamics. A learning-based observer with MDESs is first utilized to acquire the vehicular state, where a neural network with a weight updating rule is created to approximate unknown nonlinearities. In light of estimated states as well as the features of encoding-decoding errors, some sufficient conditions are derived in the framework of the Lyapunov stability to attain the desired platoon with given constant inter-vehicle spacing. In addition, a set of matrix inequalities is used to solve the desired gain parameters based on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the communication topology. Finally, an illustrative example demonstrates the validity of the developed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Subways have become a preferred mode of transportation in metropolitan cities due to their punctuality, safety, and speed. The traditional methods of train localization, such as track circuit-based schemes, while effective, face challenges in precisely determining a train&#39;s location. In contrast, communication-based train control (CBTC) systems offer more precise localization but come with installation and maintenance costs. They also restrict access to train location data due to safety concerns. To address these challenges, We investigate wireless communication-based subway localization schemes, offering accurate localization without additional infrastructure. Most subway lines already have wireless communication networks, reducing costs. However, there have been limited studies on real-time subway train localization using these networks, especially in tunnels or underground where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is unavailable. We propose two innovative subway train localization algorithms based on wireless cellular communication systems, including a moving window-based scheme and a Kalman filter-based scheme. These algorithms were validated through a field test using long-term evolution technology, utilizing precise reference position data from the CBTC system. The results demonstrate the feasibility of wireless cellular communication-based subway train localization, particularly in environments where GNSS is unavailable, addressing the need for accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility in subway localization.},

The presence of any unusual obstacles on the rail track can pose a serious safety risk to rail transit. Accurate track-side obstacle intrusion detection can assist trains in positioning correction and improve train autonomous operation capability. Existing intelligent obstacle intrusion detection approaches ignore the onboard resource constraints, and the detection model does not consider the practical rail transit environment. This article proposes a train-to-edge cooperative computing framework for track-side obstacle intrusion detection. We propose a deep learning model consisting of two stages, which allows for the detection of obstacle intrusion and the calculation of the distance between the train and the obstacle in a lightweight manner. In order to reduce detection time, we have developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning model that formulates the task of offloading the detection model inference and migrating edge computing tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage intrusion detection model can achieve higher accuracy, and our proposed collaborative train and edge computing framework can offer real-time computing services to the train.},

That means only certain messages can be timely computed, making it a challenging work in concern of urgent messages response in the vehicular network. Current work focuses on prioritizing messages by a single attribute or manually setup, omitting an efficient framework for deciding how to prioritize messages for multiple attributes in the dynamic vehicular environment. In this paper, we propose a decision-theoretic framework enabling deterministic real-time support for prioritizing messages based on their contents. Specifically, we utilize the computation and storage resources of Roadside Units (RSU) to generate utility functions. Firstly the RSUs profile received messages to decide attributes, and generate utility functions which represent the current traffic status. These functions are then broadcast to the nearby vehicles, helping them to prioritize received messages using decision theory.

While a low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) integrated system have the potential to achieve the pursuit, its performance can be significantly affected by the occasional GNSS outage and variable measurement noise in complex driving environments. Inspired by AI-type solutions for predicting vehicle behavior, and to get rid of their disadvantage of environmental sensitive, we abstract vehicle behaviors in urban environments as constraint models. A multiple constraint fused Kalman-based navigation (MCKN) method for INS/GNSS integrated navigation system is introduced by combining multiple model interaction principle with zero-velocity update (ZVU) error correction algorithm. This novel MCKN approach allows multiple zero-velocity constrained models to work in parallel. The optimal navigation results are obtained by calculating the weights of each model at every positioning epoch. Road test results in the Zhongguancun area of Beijing show that the MCKN method effectively limits the accumulation of low-cost INS errors. During 1-hour experiment, the positioning and velocity error of MCKN method in ±3 σ interval were 1.72 m and 0.12 m/s respectively, maintaining a high-level performance.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles have received considerable attention, yet high-speed path following control remains a critical and challenging issue. At high speeds, achieving perfect control based on an accurate dynamic model of autonomous vehicles is difficult due to the nonlinear model parameters that change at the driving limit. Moreover, the strong coupling relationship between longitudinal control and lateral control also affects control performance. To address these challenges, a reinforcement learning-based control approach (RL-controller) is developed in this paper and applied to the high-speed path following task. The proposed RL-controller overcomes the challenges of explicit modeling and tight coupling control. Firstly, to obtain efficient learning features, our RL-controller is developed using a deep soft actor-critic method that incorporates multi-layer dense connection networks with skip connections and feature reuse. Secondly, an estimation method of the lane curvature is developed, which is chosen as prior knowledge to augment the input state of reinforcement learning. We model the lane using a transformer-based network structure that utilizes a third-order polynomial and train the model on our self-collected dataset. Thirdly, intuitive reward functions are built from the cross-track error, the angle error and the sideslip angle. At last, we verify our proposed RL-controller utilizing an open autonomous driving simulator. Compared with imitation learning and model-based optimal control methods, our RL-controller outperforms them in terms of the driving speed and compound error.},

In this paper, we design an intelligent railway construction system based on edge computing, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are deployed in the construction scenario to provide spectrum and computing resources for intelligent construction devices. In order to improve the real-time performance of computing in the intelligent railway construction system, we formulate the communication and computing resources optimization process as a two level game model. In the low-level game, we address the inherent personal selfishness exhibited by construction devices. To enhance spectral efficiency, we propose a non-cooperative potential game among these devices. In the high-level game, a single UAV server faces challenges in promptly handling all incoming computation tasks. To address this issue, we present a cooperative game model aimed at optimizing load balancing among UAV servers.

Compared with the rule-based strategy, the tracking accuracy, driving comfort, man-machine conflict, driver and controller load indexes are designed to evaluate the ICSSC strategy.

  abstract     = {The effective prediction of the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of the railway track can provide key information for intelligent operation and maintenance. However, accurate prediction of railway track RUL is still challenging due to the issues such as serious data noises, large sampling data interval, and small samples in the track inspection dataset, which are usually caused by the complex and various operating environment. To address these issues, a new prediction method for railway track RUL, which is the combination of Dynamic Multi-Scale Gated Dilated Causal Convolution (DMGDCC)and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) called DMGDCC-GRU, is proposed in this work. Firstly, an adaptive filtering module was constructed based on dynamic convolution to solve the problem of insufficient feature extraction that is caused by time-varying noise interference in the data. Secondly, a feature extraction network with multi-scale gated dilated causal convolution structure was designed to monitor the damage feature at different scales as well as to generate the boundary representation for the degree of damage at each time-step by the gating mechanism. Based on these, a GRU, which can improve the performance of time-series feature extraction, was introduced to learn the feature of damage trend in full life cycle of railway track efficiently. Finally, an innovative pre-training method for transfer learning from bearing to rail was developed to mitigate the problems about the small samples and long sampling interval. Among the many state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods, experimental evaluations with the actual rail degradation datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve 38.9% reduction in RMSE and 13.4% increase in R 2 (Degradation due to rail peeling), 31.7% reduction in RMSE and 8.2% increase in R 2 (Degradation due to rail corrugation). Significantly, the validation results of rolling bearing datasets also proved the high generalization performance of the proposed method.},

However, the traversal simulation process based on discrete element terrain models is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a double neural networks enhanced global mobility prediction model. Firstly, acceleration of the vehicle-terrain contact simulation is achieved by developing an artificial neural network surrogate model. This model predicts stress and strain relationships based on a multiscale representative volume element terrain model, effectively replacing complex mechanical calculations. Secondly, the generation of the global mobility map is expedited by introducing a boundary data enhanced artificial neural network model. This model generates a training dataset by simulating Gaussian sampled terrain data and additional enhanced terrain data at the mobility classification boundary. The trained artificial neural network is subsequently utilized to predict the mobility map, thus circumventing the time-consuming process of traversing simulations. The simulation tests validate that our proposed method not only significantly reduces computation time but also ensures high prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles integrate offloading into traditional transportation systems and migrate tasks from resource-constrained vehicles to other vehicles or infrastructures for collaborative tasks through this technology, effectively improving the overall utility and reducing the task computing time. However, few of the existing task offloading schemes have effectively considered the mobility characteristics of vehicles, which leads to frequent task offloading failures. In this paper, we take the future motion trajectory, resource load, and offloading delay of vehicles into account and propose a dyFnamic task offloading scheme based on location forecasting. The scheme that combines the location prediction model can effectively improve the task offloading success rate while reducing the offloading delay. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we conduct simulations and real-world scenario experiments. The results of the simulations and real-world scenario experiments show that our proposed scheme outperforms other comparative baseline schemes in both offloading delay and offloading success rate dimensions. In detail, our scheme can reduce the offloading delay by up to 56.68% and 88.63% compared to the other two schemes, and improve the offloading success rate by up to 14% and 16.5% compared to the other two schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the trajectories of vehicles in a driving environment composed of various traffic participants is very significant for the driving safety of intelligent vehicles. The critical difficulties of trajectory prediction lie in clarifying the interaction between traffic participants and describing the uncertainty of a vehicle&#39;s driving intention. This article proposes a vehicle trajectory prediction method based on the combination of a serial dual attention mechanism and a sampling generation model in graph structure mode. The serial dual attention mechanism describes the impact of different types of traffic participants on the vehicle. The edge attention mechanism in the serial structure considers the features of nodes and the direction of interaction simultaneously to analyse the vehicle&#39;s degree of attention to each agent of the same kind of traffic participant. In addition, a driving intention representation module based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) maps the aggregated features of the vehicle and its surrounding nodes into the latent variable space to describe the distribution of the vehicle&#39;s driving intention. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset indicate that our method is superior to state-of-the-art prediction frameworks. Our method can consider the impact of traffic participants on the vehicle at different levels and reasonably predict the multimodal trajectory of the vehicle according to its driving intention. The result of the real-vehicle experiment shows that our method can guarantee high prediction accuracy in the practical application as well.},

Path-following is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance are essential for safe flight. In this article, we investigate how to efficiently and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks, as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion, based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.},

This article aims at addressing the MPAR resource allocation so as to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) demanded by both line of sight (LOS) and reflective intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided non line of sight (NLOS) search operations along with communications tasks. To this end, the ranges at which the cumulative detection probability and the channel capacity per bandwidth reach a desired value are introduced as task quality metrics for the search and communication functions, respectively. Then, to quantify the satisfaction level of each task, for each of them a bespoke utility function is defined to map the associated quality metric into the corresponding perceived utility. Hence, assigning different priority weights to each task, the resource allocation problem, in terms of radar power aperture (PAP) specification, is formulated as a constrained optimization problem whose solution optimizes the global radar QoS. Several simulations are conducted in scenarios of practical interest to prove the effectiveness of the approach.},

It is expected that such enormous traffic with diverse patterns will be managed by employing beyond fifth-generation backbone networks, such as satellite networks. Satellite communication resources are scarcer than those of terrestrial communication. Therefore, this study has focused on ensuring efficient satellite network resource operations. Traffic forecasting is a promising approach to facilitate optimal resource allocation. While there are several methods for traffic prediction in terrestrial communication using machine learning, an insufficient number of studies have been conducted regarding satellite communications. Existing traffic prediction approaches consume high bandwidths, which can be a problem for the bandwidth used by users over the limited bandwidth of satellite networks. Therefore, this study proposes a lightweight machine-learning- based traffic prediction method using transfer learning to reduce bandwidth consumption. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method via simulations by comparing its accuracy with conventional approaches.},

We rigorously prove the NP-hardness of the optimization problem and then propose an efficient algorithm to determine the recommendation set per user. Moreover, it is shown that the cache placement subproblem can be optimally solved by the dynamic programming algorithm.

  abstract     = {Satellite networks are emerging rapidly to serve mobile users and vehicles on the ground. To alleviate the downlink transmissions between moving satellites and ground users, [Xie et al. 2022] proposes to adopt coded caching in satellite networks. One key assumption in [Xie et al. 2022] is that, the users are assumed to be uniformly distributed on earth, which could be different from the reality. In this paper, we investigate coded caching in satellite networks with non-uniform user distribution. For arbitrary user distribution, we propose a decentralized coded caching scheme such that satellites can cooperatively serve the users. For the converse bound, basing on the concept of decoupling, we employ cut-set technique to characterize a novel lower bound. This converse bound is based on a novel request pattern construction in a cyclic wrap-around fashion which makes the users in a densely distributed region request more files. With the derived lower bound, we also prove that the upper bound of achievable rate is at most a constant gap from it. Numerical results demonstrates superior performance of our proposed algorithm in satellite networks.},

However, one practical constraint that is often neglected in BC studies is the circuit sensitivity of the backscatter device (BD), which sets the minimum signal strength required to activate it for signal reflection. In this paper, we address the channel estimation (CE) problem in the BC system with a circuit sensitivity constraint. Specifically, we propose three channel estimators for the receiver in the BC system that is unaware of the activation states of the BD, namely the maximum likelihood (ML), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. We derive both the Cram $\acute{\text {e}}$ r-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian Cram $\acute{\text {e}}$ r-Rao bound (BCRB) to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, we provide simulations to validate our analysis. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE and MAP estimators outperform traditional estimators that neglect the circuit sensitivity constraint.},

Numerical results show that the proposed IDD scheme works very well and the proposed LLRs-based approach to select APs outperforms the existing techniques in terms of bit error rate and spectral efficiency while requiring a comparable fronthaul load.},

The efficiency of FL can be improved by using over-the-air computation (AirComp) technology in the process of gradient aggregation. In this article, we propose a relay-assisted large-scale FL framework, and investigate the device scheduling problem in relay-assisted FL systems under the constraints of power consumption and mean squared error (MSE). we formulate a joint device scheduling, and power allocation problem to maximize the number of scheduled devices. We solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem by transforming the optimization problem into multiple sparse optimization problems. By the proposed device scheduling algorithm, these sparse subproblems are solved and the maximum number of federated learning edge devices is obtained.

While a non-orthogonal coexistence of different services on the radio interface may potentially yield higher spectral efficiency, a significant performance bottleneck is set by the mutual interference between heterogeneous devices. Interference management strategies of different complexity – ranging from treating interference as noise to successive interference cancellation – may be implemented at the base station to address this problem. In this context, this work investigates the role that intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) may play in shaping the interference between enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) devices.

With DLI being typically much stronger than the backscattered signal, the detection of the tag signal becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) model known as the backscattered signal recovery network (BSRnet). BSRnet is designed to recover the backscattered signal even in the presence of a strong DLI at the reader side. Given the potential scarcity of training data, BSRnet incorporates an innovative attention mechanism. This mechanism guides the model to focus on and optimize crucial learnable parameters. Distinct from traditional DL models, BSRnet can circumvent bottlenecks created by zero-padding and sampling operations and mitigate issues related to the distribution mismatch. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of BRSnet in comparison to existing models, confirming its advanced design strategy.

In such applications, AI-based decisions should be performed in a real-time manner. These decisions include resource allocation, localization, channel estimation, etc. Considering the black-box nature of existing AI-based models, it is highly challenging to understand and trust the decision-making behavior of such models. Therefore, explaining the logic behind those models through explainable AI (XAI) techniques is essential for their employment in critical applications. This manuscript proposes a novel XAI-based channel estimation (XAI-CHEST) scheme that provides detailed reasonable interpretability of the deep learning (DL) models that are employed in doubly-selective channel estimation. The aim of the proposed XAI-CHEST scheme is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. As a result, the behavior of the studied DL-based channel estimators can be further analyzed and evaluated based on the generated interpretations. Simulation results show that the proposed XAI-CHEST scheme provides valid interpretations of the DL-based channel estimators for different scenarios.},

In these wireless scenarios, one can enhance the system performance by exploiting multiple communication links, where sums of random variables (RVs) commonly arise and, therefore, need to be statistically addressed to evaluate the system behavior. Unfortunately, the statistical analysis of such sums is rather challenging, which has motivated further research to find exact solutions. In this article, we characterize the exact statistics of sums of independent and identically distributed squared FTR RVs. Specifically, we derive novel improved expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Our expressions demonstrated to be lighter, faster, and more manageable than the state-of-the-art solutions. More importantly, we show that the sum PDF and the sum CDF can be written as a random mixture of not necessarily identically distributed gamma PDFs and CDFs, respectively. Capitalizing on our findings, we assess the performance of multi-branch maximal-ratio combining receivers operating over FTR fading channels, considering three essential metrics: average bit-error rate, outage probability, and ergodic capacity. Simulation results confirm the validity and efficiency of our analytical derivations.},

In achieving concurrent MCS detection and demodulation as a task of multi-label classification in deep learning, the ConvLSTM-based receiver includes three parts: data preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi-label classification. The data preprocessing is to guarantee a uniform input for all considered MCSs. Then, the feature extraction extracts the spatiotemporal features of the signals. Finally, the multi-label classification transforms the extracted features into bit streams.

We investigate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem with an electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure constraint. In order to solve the problem, we present a lower bound for the EE and adopt an alternate optimization problem. Then, we propose the Energy Efficient Multi-RIS (EEMR) algorithm to obtain the optimal transmit power of the users and phase shifts of the RISs. Moreover, we study this problem for a system with a central RIS and compare the results. The simulation results show that for a sufficient total number of RIS elements, the system with distributed RISs is more energy efficient compared to the system with a central RIS. In addition, for both the systems the EMF exposure constraints enforce a trade-off between the EE and EMF-awareness of the system.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) consisting of a large number of distributed antennas has shown great potential to provide uniformly good wireless services via coherent transmission or reception. The signal combing for decoding uplink data can be performed in a centralized or distributed manner. Centralized combining outperforms distributed solutions on achievable spectral efficiency (SE) via coordinated interference suppression based on network-wide channel state information (CSI) at the central processing unit (CPU). Distributed combining preprocess the received signal at access points (APs) with a lower computational complexity based on local CSI, but its achievable SE is much lower than centralized combining. In this paper, we utilize decision feedback to narrow the performance gap of distributed combining with its centralized counterpart. We employ the detected signal of the distributed combiner as training data to estimate the equivalent channel at the CPU. Based on the estimated CSI, we propose an iterative decision feedback signal combining scheme and derive its achievable spectral efficiency. Our analytical and simulational results reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively suppress the leakage interference of distributed combiners without additional CSI exchange between APs and CPU, thus leading to significant performance improvement. Moreover, the proposed method provides high robustness against pilot contamination. It can achieve a similar or even higher 90%-likely SE than fully centralized combining with less computational complexity at the cost of higher decoding latency.},

This paper explores the efficacy of RIS in interference suppression over-the-air with discrete reflection coefficients (DRC). First, the paper formulates an interference suppression ratio (ISR) maximization problem to optimize the DRC and proposes an algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation to solve the ISR optimization problem. Then, the upper and lower boundaries of ISR under the proposed algorithm are derived to provide more insight into its performance. The simulation shows that interference channel gain can be suppressed by 32 dB to 40 dB under DRC limitations.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology for last-mile cargo delivery.

Given that existing cellular networks were primarily designed to service ground users, re-utilizing the same architecture for highly mobile aerial users, e.g., cargo-UAVs, is deemed challenging. Indeed, to ensure a safe delivery using cargo-UAVs, it is crucial to utilize the available energy efficiently, while guaranteeing reliable connectivity for command-and-control and avoiding frequent handoff. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach for joint cargo-UAV trajectory planning and cell association. Specifically, we formulate the cargo-UAV mission as a multi-objective problem aiming to 1) minimize energy consumption, 2) reduce handoff events, and 3) guarantee cellular reliability along the trajectory. We leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to jointly optimize the cargo-UAV&#39;s trajectory and cell association.

  abstract     = {Localizing targets outside the anchors&#39; convex hull is an understudied but prevalent scenario in vehicle-centric, UAV-based, and self-localization applications. Considering such scenarios, this article studies the optimal anchor placement problem for Time-of-Arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes such that the worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP) is minimized. Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the Range-Normalized DOP (RNDOP) . We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately, this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition, we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement, characterize the impact of anchor position uncertainty, and then discuss the computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulation results to compare the positioning error and execution time performance of each iterative scheme, discuss the tradeoffs, and provide valuable system design insights for beyond convex hull localization scenarios.},

Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV&#39;s mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and $\mathcal {S}$ -Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.},

The source transmits stochastic status update packets towards the destination which monitors the status to issue prompt control commands. The transmission is done directly or through a relay. The source and relay send their packets subject to slotted Aloha protocol. Then, it is possible to encounter a collision, leading to more staled packets at the destination, i.e., more age of information. We propose two management policies in the case of collision based on prioritizing the source packet or the relay packet, i.e., source prioritization (SP) or relay prioritization (RP) policies, respectively, to reduce the chance of next collisions. We propose an analytical model in order to derive the distribution (i.e., probability mass function) of PAoI in our network scenario. In this model, we trace the status of two typical packets consecutively received successfully by the destination. We will observe that phase-type distribution plays a key role in deriving the PAoI distribution. By obtaining numerical results we observe significant effect of random access relaying in improving PAoI in some conditions. Moreover, we deduce that though SP and RP lead to very close results for mean PAoI, the variances and tail probabilities may be very different. Simulations confirm our analytical approach in different conditions.},

  abstract     = {Similar to numerous problems that gain interest nowadays (like the ones arising in statistics and machine learning), target localization problem can be cast in the framework of convex optimization. Nevertheless, owing to recent eruption in both size and heterogeneity of modern wireless networks which exposes them to various security threats, it is increasingly important to be able to localize the target reliably (securely). On the one hand, the security feature precludes the direct use of most existing localization algorithms in modern networks, since these are vulnerable to malicious attacks (for instance, measurement spoofing). On the other hand, taking security menace into consideration often leads to an under-determined problem formulation which requires certain approximations/relaxations of the problem, resulting in insufficiently accurate solutions. This work argues that the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a well tailored approach to combat the secure localization problem. The proposed solution is a decomposition-coordination scheme, where solutions to smaller local (sub-) problems are bound together to obtain a solution to a larger global problem. To this end, an equivalent reformulation of the (non-convex) maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) as a smooth constrained non-convex minimization problem is derived first, which gives rise to a simple iterative scheme that does not require further approximations nor convex relaxations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is corroborated through computer simulations and experimental measurements.},

In particular, we consider the multi-channel scenario, in which there are multiple channels each at a different frequency band, and the spectrum of each channel is shared by one or more mobile users (MUs) for offloading continuously. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the energy consumption at MUs, by jointly optimizing the offloading time duration, the offloaded task data bits, the bandwidth allocations of different MUs at these channels, and the computing frequencies at both MUs and edge servers. Because the formulated problem has coupled optimization variables, it is non-convex and difficult to get the optimal solution. To address the challenge, we propose to decompose the formulated problem into two levels. For the lower-level problem with given offloading time duration, we employ the block coordinate descent framework to optimize two groups of optimization variables iteratively, for each of which the optimal solution is obtained in well structures with low complexity. For the upper-level problem for optimizing the offloading time duration, we find the optimal solution by performing variable manipulations and transforming the problem to a standard monotonic optimization problem. Numerical results show that our proposed method is effective in achieving the global optimality of the energy minimization problem and its advantages over other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a crucial integrated component in mobile edge computing (MEC) for extending service coverage, where UAVs&#39; and devices&#39; energy consumption are two fundamental problems. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled three-dimensional (3D) MEC network and study the Pareto-optimal aerial and ground energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing offloading time allocation, resource allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory. We first investigate the problem of minimizing energy consumption for the UAV, and then shift our focus to minimize the energy consumption of the devices. To tackle them, we propose two efficient alternating optimization algorithms with different outer and inner structures to address the two optimization problems. To be specific, we split the original problem into two subproblems in the outer structure. The inner structure addresses the subproblems with difference-of-convex (D.C.) framework and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Based on the energy consumption lower bounds for the UAV and devices obtained by these two aforementioned original problems, a Pareto-optimal solution is proposed, in which the aerial-ground energy tradeoff can be balanced. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and reveal two insightful tradeoffs for 3D UAV-enabled MEC networks, i.e., aerial-ground energy tradeoff and altitude-related angle-distance tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-Device (D2D) communication and edge caching are two promising approaches to relieve stress on core networks, and the dynamic topology and complex device types of D2D networks bring more challenges to the design of caching strategies. However, most of the existing research works on D2D caching focus on predictable user mobility without considering its randomness. In addition, they ignore the heterogeneity of user devices. In this paper, we focus on the caching strategies in sophisticated dynamic heterogeneous D2D networks with randomly moving users and heterogeneous user devices. We formulate the average user request delay expectation minimization problem which is proved to be NP-hard. To diminish the impact of coupling user strategies and make full use of the network resources, we propose the policy-network assisted multi-agent collaboration (PAMAC) caching strategy, in which the agents are placed on the user devices and trained collaboratively using a distributed approach. Specifically, in PAMAC, we first propose the collaborative training order optimization (CTOO) algorithm to schedule the training order of the user devices in the network. Then we propose the binary particle swarm policy network (BPSP) algorithm and introduce it to each agent to design the multi-agent collaborative caching scheme. Extensive simulations are conducted to show that PAMAC outperforms other existing caching strategies.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a general multicell wireless powered communication network, in which multiple access points (APs) provide energy to the Internet of Things devices (IoT-Ds), and the IoT-Ds utilize the harvested energy to send information back to their associated AP. Within the network, a scheme enabling information and energy cooperation among APs is proposed to realize data transmission among cells as well as mitigate the risk of energy supply-demand imbalance. Based on such cooperation scheme, APs with surplus energy can share energy with other APs with deficient power supply, and the energy efficiency maximization problem is studied for the considered network of two practical scenarios including APs with energy-storage devices (ESDs) and without ESDs. To solve the optimization problems, a novel distributed scheme is designed to jointly the optimize energy cooperation strategy and time allocation, where each AP communicates only with neighboring APs to independently update its own optimal decision. Different from the centralized methods requiring global parameters such as all channel status information (CSI) that may be unavailable, APs in the developed distributed scheme jointly undertake the computational tasks without knowing all CSI. This results in faster convergence and higher scalability for multicell networks compared to the centralized schemes. Finally, simulation examples of two scenarios are presented to validate the performance of the proposed distributed scheme.},

In order to further enhance the overall performance of the VEC system, we developed an efficient scheme that optimizes task offloading decisions and computation resource allocation in the proposed architecture.

  abstract     = {Estimating the state (i.e., determining the position and orientation) of a rigid body (RB) is a key enabler technology for many applications (e.g., vehicle motion control and autonomous driving). Thus, rigid body localization (RBL), which can obtain both positions and poses of RBs, has drawn great attention recently. Most existing RBL methods mainly focus on estimating a single RB&#39;s state. However, the multi-agent scenario, which can be found in many applications like vehicle-to-vehicle communication, has not been explicitly accounted for. Moreover, these methods undergo significant performance degradation when the communication conditions between sensors and anchors are poor. In this work, we propose a cooperative rigid body localization (CRBL) framework, which additionally leverages the interactions among RBs to achieve accurate and robust state estimation of multiple RBs. To this end, we need to figure out two key questions: 1) how to assess the attainable performance of CRBL; 2) how to use the newly introduced measurements among RBs to enhance the estimation performance. To answer the two questions, we first perform the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis for the CRBL framework to characterize the performance improvement. Theoretical analysis shows that CRBL has a lower error bound than the conventional RBL framework. Furthermore, we propose two efficient CRBL algorithms. The first one is a lightweight method based on the weighted least squares, named WLS-CRBL, which is an optimal algorithm over the small noise region and is computationally efficient. The second one is implemented by the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique named SDR-CRBL, aiming to achieve robust estimation when the noise is high. Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods can achieve their theoretical performance and outperform the conventional RBL algorithms, especially in the case of poor communications between sensors and anchors.},

  abstract     = {Communication relay is necessary for a swarm of collaborative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) executing missions in a large area, such as cooperative exploration, mapping tasks and so on, which assists for the quality of transmission in the swarm network. However, it remains a challenge to plan the mission of Relay UAVs (RUs) to enhance communication of the swarm considering the kinematics of UAVs and task sequences of a swarm. This paper proposes a two-layer relay planning framework for a fixed-wing UAV swarm consisting of coarse planning at the Ground Control Station (GCS) as well as refined trajectory planning onboard. The GCS planning layer evaluates the relay requirements in the swarm network to generate the initial deployment of RUs, aiming to minimize their numbers while maximizing utility. The $\beta$ -weak connectivity model is adopted to evaluate the swarm network topology constructed from the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Meanwhile, a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Problem (MINLP) is employed to determine the initial deployment of RUs including the number and accessing locations. Moreover, the onboard planning layer predicts the states of the Mission UAVs (MUs) connected to the RU using the Kalman filter. Based on these predictions, the trajectories of each RU are autonomously planned online to continuously guarantee stable network connectivity, which is achieved through Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The incorporation of NOMA technology into a 5G mobile communication network has the potential to significantly improve communication performance. First, we establish an mobile cooperative NOMA multi-user network. The exact outage probability (OP) expressions are then derived, and the effect of the power allocation on OP performance is investigated. Finally, we design a CBAM-BiLSTM network and propose an intelligent power allocation optimization algorithm based on system efficiency and user fairness. The CBAM-BiLSTM network is a structure based on convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) and bidirectional long short term memory network (BiLSTM). CBAM performs feature selection and weights the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps to improve the network&#39;s classification accuracy. BiLSTM can fully utilize contextual information and handle long-term dependencies, thereby providing more comprehensive and accurate modeling capabilities and predictive performance. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the Transformer, ShuffleNetV2, and YOLOv5 algorithms, the CBAM-BiLSTM can obtain more accurate power allocation coefficients and improve system performance. Compared to ShuffleNetV2, CBAM-BiLSTM reduces mean square error (MSE) by 42.8%.},

To overcome the challenges posed by the “window” type array response, we propose a novel direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation based on sparse Bayesian inference (SBI). In this method, we treat the distance factor in window function as a nuisance parameter which is estimated by the classical matched filtering (MF) due to the sensing ability. Moreover, we develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based closed-loop tracking strategy to assist communication links. This scheme fully exploits the beam tracking capabilities and its energy-focusing characteristics of ExLAA, resulting in a substantial reduction in communication overhead for high mobility scenarios.

Therefore, the deployment of high-density networks with many small-cell base stations within the coverage area of the macro-cell base station is being considered as a network that can increase the capacity of mobile networks. The open-radio access Network (O-RAN), which divides the functions of the radio access network, has also attracted attention. However, in the networks, the function of the base station stops presumably because of power outages or failures in the event of disasters, resulting in the failure of user equipments (UEs) to communicate with external networks. Then, use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) with base station functionality as alternatives to base stations during disasters is being considered. Therefore, this study examines networks using the aforementioned EVs and highlights the problems caused by inoperable EVs on UEs that cannot communicate with external networks and the need for power consumption by network operation and movement during disasters. Furthermore, we propose a method to rebuild networks by considering the power consumed by network operation and movement. In the proposed method, we model the system, express each power consumption mathematically, and optimize the placement of EVs and transmission power. In addition, the results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various environments.

In contrast, this work has proposed a low computationally complex simple solution which models the future throughput as a multiple linear regression of several present network parameters and present throughput. It then feeds the variance of prediction error and measurement error, which is inherent in any measurement setup but unaccounted for in existing works, to a Kalman filter-based prediction-correction approach to obtain the optimal estimates of the future throughput. Extensive experiments across seven publicly available 5G throughput datasets for different prediction window lengths have shown that the proposed method outperforms the baseline ML and DL algorithms by delivering more accurate results within a shorter timeframe for inferencing and retraining. Furthermore, in comparison to its ML and DL counterparts, the proposed throughput prediction method is also found to deliver higher QoE to both streaming and live video users when used in conjunction with popular Model Predictive Control (MPC) based adaptive bitrate streaming algorithms.},

However, the traditional terrestrial MEC system cannot adapt to scenarios such as rapid network recovery after disasters and emergency rescue due to its poor flexibility and high deployment cost, and assembling edge servers to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in rapidly building mobile edge networks is a feasible solution. Therefore, this paper considers a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network with the optimization objectives of maximizing the processing success rate of computational tasks and fairness of system, while minimizing the processing delay of computational tasks. We investigate the computation offloading problem and the trajectory planning problem from the perspectives of IoT devices and UAVs, respectively. Then model them as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose a joint optimization scheme based on expert knowledge-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

Vehicular fog computing (VFC) can relieve the pressure of fog servers by utilizing the idle resources of neighbor vehicles to complete on-vehicle application tasks, especially in the near future 6G environment. However, the mobility of the vehicle adds tremendous complexity to the allocation of on-vehicular resources. So in the dynamic vehicular network, accurately learning about the vehicle user&#39;s real-time demand and timely allocating idle resources of neighbor vehicles are the keys to the optimal allocation of resources. This paper proposes a three-layer VFC cooperation architecture to achieve cooperation between vehicles, which can dynamically coordinate resource allocation for IoV. The VFC cooperation architecture predicts traffic flow through the deep learning (DL) method, to intelligently estimate the number of vehicle resources and tasks. Further, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is used to dynamically and adaptively decide the matching time between the vehicle resources and tasks, so as to maximize the success rate of vehicle resource allocation. Finally, experiments show that our method improves the matching benefits by nearly 1.2 times compared with the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {The line-of-sight (LoS) condition is important to the quality of wireless communications, especially for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications which are more sensitive to blockages than typical radio frequency (RF) communications. Considering that one blockage would obstruct several channels simultaneously, recently, researchers have studied the correlation of LoS probabilities among multiple channels in the horizontal plane and shown its importance in system performance analysis. The main missing aspect of existing literature in this direction is that the heights of transceivers and blockages have not been considered in the analysis of the LoS correlation. However, the emerging hybrid cellular networks with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) deployed at various altitudes necessitate the LoS analysis accounting for the vertical dimension. In this paper, using stochastic geometry, we formulate a novel joint-LoS-probability framework of two channels among three aerial/terrestrial devices to analyze the LoS correlation both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. We derive the expression of the conditional and joint LoS probabilities. The proposed framework combines (i) accuracy (verified in simulation), (ii) generality (from adjustable parameters of the channels and environments), and (iii) fitting ability (from a cylindrical blockage model to a non-cylindrical blockage model). The numerical results show that the correlation is quite strong when the angle between the two communication channels is small, while it becomes weaker as this angle increases. Moreover, we introduce a potential application of the joint LoS probability in the optimal deployment of an aerial device. Compared to optimization based on the independence assumption of the LoS probabilities, the improvement in the coverage probability intuitively clarifies the advantage of the proposed joint-LoS-probability framework on the aerial-terrestrial network design.},

  abstract     = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly used in civilian and military applications. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications, the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) between UAVs and ground control stations (GCSs) is vulnerable to physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer wireless attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. In this paper, we investigate the secure remote control (RC) issue in multi-UAV systems from a physical layer security (PLS) perspective. We propose a secure RC mechanism based on John Boyd&#39;s OODA loop and introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) from UAVs to safeguard control data from GCS. To quantify the uncertainty of wireless attacks from aerial and terrestrial potential attackers, we first introduce the Nakagami-m fading model and a mixed line-of-sight (LoS) / non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability model to characterize hostile air-to-ground (A2G) channels. We then derive the conditions for successful attacks including passive/active eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing, and formulate the risks of each attack and the overall CJ efficiency based on secrecy outage probability (SOP). To optimize the trade-off between risk costs and CJ power consumption for various situations, we propose three levels of control schemes (centralized, partially centralized, and distributed) applicable at GCS or UAVs, and design three decision-making methods with differing complexities. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under a general scenario that provides diverse physical conditions, threat levels, and security requirements.},

  abstract     = {The high mobility of vehicles in vehicular networks presents difficulties in timely and low-delay content delivery. Edge caching is a promising approach for overcoming these challenges. By properly caching data, we aim to improve service performance and reduce the load on the backhaul network. We propose two unique methods for caching data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), based on the division of IoV data into two groups: safety and infotainment contents. Due to the different nature of each type, two unique methods are proposed for caching each type of content. The Federated Learning-based Mobility-aware Collaborative Content Caching (FM3C) method is designed for infotainment content, while the Spatio-Temporal Characteristics Aware Emergency Content Caching (STAECC) method is designed for emergency content. To predict the popularity of infotainment content, we implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained through federated learning for user privacy protection. The predicted popularity is then combined with other content characteristics through a multi-criteria decision-making method to determine the most suitable content for caching in each Road-Side Unit (RSU). Our proposed cache-aware intelligent routing method, enabled by software-defined networks (SDN), allows for cooperation among RSUs to respond to requests and deliver content. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FM3C and STAECC methods in improving cache hit rate, reducing delay, and enhancing the quality of experience (QoE) for users. In conclusion, our proposed methods offer a promising solution for the efficient provision of content in vehicular networks.},

In this paper, we study the joint optimization of application deployment and task assignment at different time scales in a MEC system constituent of multiple cloudlet service providers. The design objective is to maximize the system profit while meeting the task delay requirements of different applications. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem.

Fortunately, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution to privacy-preserving ML. To balance efficiency and wireless security, this paper proposes a novel secure and efficient FL framework in UAV-enabled networks. Specifically, we design a secure UE selection scheme based on the secrecy outage probability to prevent uploaded model parameters from being wiretapped by a malicious eavesdropper. Then, we formulate a joint UAV placement and resource allocation problem for minimizing training time and UE energy consumption while maximizing the number of secure UEs under the UAV&#39;s energy constraint. Considering the random movement of the eavesdropper and UEs as well as online task generation on UEs in practical application scenarios, we present the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm (LSTM-DDPG) to facilitate real-time decision making for the formulated problem. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed LSTM-DDPG algorithm outperforms the state-of-arts in terms of efficiency and security of FL.},

One of the vital challenges of the IoV is how to provide reliable wireless communication in high mobility scenarios. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is widely concerned due to its robustness in high-speed mobile scenarios at high carrier frequency, which is particularly suitable for IoV communication. This paper proposes a data-driven intelligent receiver from the perspective of signal processing for OTFS communication. The proposed intelligent receiver utilizes the designed efficient MobileNet (EMNet) to jointly optimize all signal recovery modules of OTFS receiver, which complete end-to-end information recovery process. Meanwhile, the lightweight structure of EMNet reduces the computing power and storage capacity of hardware devices required for model deployment. In order to verify the system reliability of the intelligent receiver in IoV, the performance of the traditional receiver and the intelligent receiver for OTFS communication are compared and analyzed under different conditions. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional receiver, the proposed intelligent receiver can recover information with a lower bit error rate and improve the reliability of wireless communication in the IoV.},

In the case of imperfect control channels, the influence of high-speed movement increases the probability of error in sending local spectrum sensing decisions by VUs. On the other hand, Malicious Vehicle Users (MVUs) can launch Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attacks to deteriorate the spectrum sensing decisions, mislead the final spectrum sensing decisions of Collaborative Spectrum Sensing (CSS), and bring serious security problems to the system. In addition, the high-speed movement can increases the concealment of the MVUs. In this paper, we study the scenario of VUs moving at high speeds, and data transmission in an imperfect control channel, and propose a blockchain-based method to defend against massive SSDF attacks in CIoV networks to prevennt independent and cooperative attacks from MVUs. The proposed method combines blockchain with spectrum sensing and spectrum access, abandons the decision-making mechanism of the Fusion Center (FC) in the traditional CSS, adopts distributed decision-making, and uses Prospect Theory (PT) modeling in the decision-making process, effectively improves the correct rate of final spectrum sensing decision in the case of multiple attacks. The local spectrum sensing decisions of VUs are packaged into blocks and uploaded after the final decision to achieve more accurate and secure spectrum sensing, and then identify MVUs by the reputation value. In addition, a smart contract that changes the mining difficulty of VUs based on their reputation values is proposed. It makes the mining difficulty of MVUs more difficult and effectively limits MVUs&#39; access to the spectrum band.

Also, because the sub-THz band requires a reliable line-of-sight link, we propose to use a high altitude platform station (HAPS) as a CPU. At the first time-slot of the proposed scheme, users send their messages to UAVs at the sub-6 GHz band. The UAVs then apply match-filtering and power allocation. At the second time-slot, at each UAV, orthogonal resource blocks are allocated for each user at the sub-THz band, and the signals are sent to the HAPS after analog beamforming. In the HAPS receiver, after analog beamforming, the message of each user is decoded. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of users by finding the optimum allocated power as well as the optimum locations of UAVs.

  abstract     = {In 6G systems, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are poised to address the limitations of terrestrial systems, particularly in unserved or underserved areas, by providing infrastructure with mobility that enhances reliability, availability, and responsiveness. Among various types of mobile infrastructures, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) has the potential to offer extended coverage that supports numerous devices simultaneously with low latency. Consequently, LEO SATCOM attracts significant attention from academia, government, and industry. The dynamic formation problem must be solved to form a swarm connecting to the ground station with the most appropriate satellites to achieve LEO SATCOM systems with higher throughput. Existing solutions use computationally demanding methods to solve the NP-hard problem and cannot be employed for SATCOM systems with short coherence time. Furthermore, precise channel state information (CSI) between the ground station and all candidate satellites is required for formation designs, resulting in significant signaling overheads. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning-based dynamic formation method for real-time dynamic formation capability. Specifically, motivated by the channel features of LEO SATCOM, we develop a CSI estimation method to provide coarse CSI (i.e., imperfect CSI) solely based on available geometrical information of LEO SATCOM and without any signaling overhead. Then, our approach can utilize the obtained coarse CSI as inputs and provide valuable guidelines as priorities to access specific satellites for fine-grained CSI (i.e., precise CSI). The prediction results are validated using a small-scale brute force method to determine the final formation. Our intensive simulation results suggest that the proposed method can aid current LEO SATCOM by providing real-time formation results, particularly in low-transmit power regions. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve 90% of full capacity with only 32% signaling overhead to build high-throughput LEO SATCOM.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we comprehensively investigate robust beamforming schemes for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-cell downlink transmissions in the presence of channel estimation error (CEE), where an RIS is deployed at the joint boundary of multiple cells to assist downlink transmissions to cell-edge users. Specifically, we study a unified robust beamforming framework to maximize the minimum achievable rate or the coverage probability of cell-edge users with a bounded or a statistical CEE model. The bounded and statistical CEE models characterize the absolute robustness and statistical robustness demands of RIS-assisted cell-edge users. In particular, we reformulate the non-convex robust beamforming problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the optimal transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and the optimal phase shifts at the RIS, which are alternately optimized. Moreover, we apply S-Procedure and Bernstein-type inequality to transform non-convex bounded and statistical CEE constraints into convex forms. Consequently, the BS transmit beamforming sub-problem and the RIS phase shifts sub-problem can be solved by a novel penalty-based method. Finally, the two sub-problems are iteratively optimized via a bisection-based strategy to obtain the joint robust beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust beamforming scheme can converge rapidly and outperform reference schemes in the presence of CEE. Moreover, our proposed penalty-based method achieves better performance than that of the conventional semidefinite relaxation method.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel channel and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission over time-varying channels. The proposed design is highly flexible and compatible with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. The new estimator performs the channel and CFO estimation jointly and blindly, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed estimator. The blind CFO and channel estimation are realized by developing a new OFDM frame layout, where phase shift keying (PSK) and amplitude shift keying (ASK) symbols are used to modulate specific subcarriers over successive OFDM frames. An arbitrary modulation scheme can be used to modulate all other subcarriers. The new frame layout enables the use of amplitude coherent detection (ACD) and Viterbi-and-Viterbi (VAV), which are used to perform blind channel and CFO estimation and compensation. A closed-form analytical formula is derived for the exact symbol error rate (SER) of the ASK symbols, which is then used to derive a precise formula for the mean squared error (MSE) for the OMA case. For NOMA, the same approach can be used and the analysis is generally similar, hence, Monte Carlo simulation is invoked to evaluate the performance for the NOMA case. The obtained results show that the new frame layout can improve the spectral efficiency while enabling accurate channel and CFO estimation for both OMA and NOMA with computational complexity analogous to pilot-assisted schemes. The improved spectral efficiency is due to the replacement of pilot symbols with data-bearing symbols. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of MSE and SER for a wide range of operating scenarios, and the results confirm the robustness and reliability of the proposed scheme for both OMA and NOMA.},

However, the massive antennas will lead to high feedback overhead in frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems. To leverage the temporal correlation of the channel in CSI feedback, recent applications of recurrent neural networks have demonstrated promising results but with tremendous complexity. The MarkovNet reduces the overall complexity but owns the high complexity at the user equipment (UE), which is not suitable for practical deployment. In this work, we aim to improve the reconstruction performance and reduce the complexity of the UE. Leveraging the channel temporal correlation, we propose two differential frameworks called DIFNet1 and DIFNet2 to improve feedback accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we explore the real part and imaginary part correlations of channel differential terms to reduce the complexity. Finally, we unfold the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to provide excellent reconstruction performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks improve the reconstruction performance while greatly reducing the complexity of UEs.},

We show that existing DOA estimation methods can be directly applied to estimate the DOA information in the OBF system. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the OOA estimation problem. Three OOA estimation methods are first proposed based on the assumption of accurate DOA estimation. In each method, the OOAs of different transmitting arrays are estimated individually by searching in the one-dimensional parameter space. If the power spectral density (PSD) of the source signal emitted from a transmitting array is known, the OOA of the transmitting array can be estimated by the proposed PSD-based least squares method. Otherwise, the electronical rotation-based OBF (ER-OBF) and single-source-array OBF (SSA-OBF) methods are proposed. In both methods, the OOA of a transmitting array is estimated by detecting the peak in its corresponding orientational beampattern obtained by electronically rotating the receiving array. The electronical rotation of the receiving array is achieved by appropriately delaying received signals according to the DOA of the source signal. Based on the proposed ER-OBF method, the SSA-OBF method further proposes to use a transform matrix to suppress the mutual interference between signals from different transmitting arrays. Simulation results show that the probability of successful estimation of the proposed methods increases as the signal bandwidth and array aperture size increase. Moreover, observing that the DOA estimation error impacts the performance of the proposed OOA estimation methods, a modified random search method is developed to achieve OOA estimation in the presence of DOA estimation error.},

  abstract     = {Wireless virtual reality networks(WVRNs) provide seamless connectivity between virtual reality devices with colossal application and commercial value. However, the main problem restricting its development is the high energy and computational consumption in 3D video rendering on VR devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted system, where the video is rendered by multiple collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) servers simultaneously. Besides, BSs associated with these MEC servers are formed as a CoMP cluster to achieve a high data rate. This paper aims to minimize long-term power consumption by jointly optimizing the video caching and rendering at the MEC servers and the beamforming for both BSs and RIS. We propose an online, hybrid learning framework that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video caching and rendering, and an alternating optimization for the beamforming of all BSs and the RIS. In particular, the reward of each action in the DRL algorithm is calculated by the proposed alternating optimization problem, thus reducing the action space and accelerating convergence speed. Numerical results and comparison experiments show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the long-term average power consumption of the system, satisfy the requirement of 3D video transmission with low computational complexity, and outperform that without CoMP and RIS techniques.},

We develop two transmit beamforming designs to meet the user and tag requirements while mitigating the effect of imperfect SIC. Specifically, we design optimal BS transmit beamforming and power allocation to either maximize the weighted sum rate of NOMA users and the tag or minimize the BS transmit power under the minimum rate requirements while satisfying the tag&#39;s minimum energy requirement. Because both these problems are non-convex, we propose algorithms using alternative optimization, fractional programming, and semi-definite relaxation techniques. We also analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to validate the proposed schemes and to show significant performance gains while keeping the tag design intact. For example, the proposed digital beamforming increases the harvested power and data rate by $2.16\times 10^{3}\%$ and 314.5% compared to random beamforming.},

In this study, we introduce a novel time-slot-based UES-assisted system that aims to conserve energy and extend the overall lifetime of EC networks. Our proposed system operates in discrete time slots, wherein the UES alternates between hovering and serving ECs, or flying to a new position within its coverage area to provide better assistance. To minimize the computational overhead of ECs during hovering and serving within a time slot, we present a new task offloading scheme based on the differential evolutionary algorithm. For optimizing the UES&#39;s flying trajectory, we formulate the UES movement as a Markov decision process, taking into account system state changes. Subsequently, we design an efficient UES trajectory planning algorithm using double deep Q-learning. This algorithm optimizes energy consumption, feedback reward, and the overall system overhead, resulting in a doubling of the system&#39;s lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed task offloading algorithm exhibits high accuracy and fast convergence compared to four other state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, the UES trajectory planning algorithm doubles the system&#39;s lifetime while reducing energy consumption and total system overhead.},

Nevertheless, the potential benefit of CUPS in the separation networks&#39; coverage and data service functions has not been fully leveraged in enabling reliable connectivity. In this paper, we propose a CUPS-enabled Integrated Space-Ground Cellular Network (CUPS-ISGCN). Specifically, Control Base Stations (CBSs) are optimized by deploying them on the space layer to form the Control Plane (CP) and increase coverage for more users over a wide area. Meanwhile, Traffic Base Stations (TBSs) located on the ground layer form the User Plane (UP) and deliver high bit rates within the coverage area of the CP. To maximize CP coverage and improve UP efficiency, we introduce CUPS-enabled SCN into the CP and provide the analytical models to analyze the performance of the CUPS-ISGCN in terms of CP coverage and UP efficiency. By using stochastic geometry, we derive the general closed-form expressions for CP coverage. Then, we thoroughly study UP&#39;s performance as a function of the channel parameters between 2-planes, CP and UP. Based on the analysis results, it&#39;s proved that the proposed CUPS-ISGCN structure improved the CP coverage performance and UP efficiency.},

This limitation hindered overall system throughput improvements. In this article, an intelligent spectrum sharing strategy for integrated satellite-maritime heterogeneous mobile networks is firstly proposed. This strategy aims to operate co-frequency communication transmissions within the interference constraints, as derived from protocols and standards of International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to maximize the overall system throughput and spectral efficiency. Furthermore, considering the limitation that the satellite cannot fully observe channel statuses, we model the spectrum sharing process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We employ an algorithm architecture that combines Dueling Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) and Double DQN to address this challenge, which enables satellites to efficiently evaluate the value of all channel allocation actions, thereby enhancing decision-making accuracy and algorithm convergence speed. Simulation results validate the superiority of our proposed strategy over compared methods in terms of throughput and stability.},

  abstract     = {Predictor antennas (PAs) are a potential solution to severe channel aging that can occur at high vehicular velocities in non line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Channel aging reduces the performance of many advanced communication schemes based on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Although PAs have been shown to work in combination with dense pilots in time and space, prediction performance can be reduced when channel estimates are sparse. This paper answers how densely pilots must be placed for PAs to be feasible when performing basic interpolation between channel estimates. This is important, especially for establishing upper limits on the length of the downlink (DL) frames required in a time-division duplex (TDD) system with PAs. Nearest-neighbor, linear, and spline interpolation are analyzed when applied to stochastic radio channels. A theoretical expression is derived for the power of the expected interpolation error for any interpolation method that can be expressed as a linear function of a set of measured values. The interpolation methods are evaluated on three theoretical channels with Rayleigh, flat, and Rician fading, and on two sets of channel measurements. The results indicate that linear and spline interpolation can be used with down to five and three samples per wavelength, respectively, without affecting the PA-based prediction NMSE. At two samples per wavelength, the prediction NMSE is still at a level that can be useful for precoding design in massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems.},

The recent employment of Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) in combination with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) introduces more degrees of freedom to achieve a flexible and prompt mobile coverage. As the concept of smart radio environment is gaining momentum across the scientific community, this work proposes an extension module for Internet of Drones Simulator (IoD-Sim), a comprehensive simulation platform for the IoD, based on Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). This module is purposefully designed to assess the performance of UAV-aided IRS-assisted communication systems. Starting from the mathematical formulation of the radio channel, the simulator implements the IRS as a peripheral that can be attached to a drone. Such device can be dynamically configured to organize the IRS into patches and assign them to assist the communication between two nodes. Furthermore, the extension relies on the configuration facilities of IoD-Sim, which greatly eases design and coding of scenarios in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) language. A simulation campaign is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal by discussing several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as Radio Environment Map (REM), Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), maximum achievable rate, and average throughput.},

  abstract     = {The intellectual and immense attainment of a smart city and auto-mobile vehicles are gradually growing. This growth drives Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET), a broadly operated complex network for inter-vehicular transmission to acquire information relevant to the vehicle location, road condition, traffic congestion, and speed. Generally, this information is procured through an open-source communication, which is susceptible to various security threats. In broad terms, the privacy of data in VANET is considered an imperative task. In this regard, many authentication protocols are formerly initiated for VANET. Most of these protocols are precarious owing to eavesdropping, replay, and impersonation attacks, etc. Furthermore, most existing protocols operates on enormous communication and computation rate, which turns them inadequate for VANET. This paper exhibits a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication protocol for $n$ number of vehicles in VANET using the physical unclonable function (PUF) technique, and offers efficient and secure communication via public channels. Moreover, we evaluate our protocol formally and informally, showing that it is scalable, lightweight, and safe compared to formerly protocols. The rate of computation and communication is less than most related protocols. We also simulate the proposed scheme using the NS-3 simulator to measure its various network performance parameters. As a result, it is apparent through the beheld statistics that the presented protocol is beyond practical, efficient, and reliable for the secure dissemination of information in VANET.},

  abstract     = {In Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs), Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly used by smart vehicles to process various sensing data. FL is a collaborative learning approach that enables vehicles to train a shared machine learning (ML) model by exchanging their local models instead of their sensitive training data in a distributed manner. Secure aggregation, as a privacy primitive for FL, aims to further protect the local models. However, existing secure aggregation methods for FL in IoVs mostly suffer from poor security against Byzantine attacks, e.g., malicious vehicles submit fake local models, which are common in IoVs and greatly degrade the accuracy of the final shared model without being detected. In this article, we propose a new secure and efficient aggregation approach, RSAM, for resisting Byzantine attacks FL in IoVs. RSAM first securely calculates an approximate median of local models of the distributed vehicles via the divide-and-conquer strategy as the aggregation model in each training round, providing the strong Byzantine robustness that is similar to the real median (a proven robust rank-based statistic) does, where median means the coordinate-wise median. Furthermore, RSAM is a single-server secure aggregation protocol that protects the vehicles&#39; local models and training data against inside conspiracy attacks based on zero-sharing. Finally, RSAM is efficient for vehicles in IoVs, since RSAM transforms the sorting operation over the encrypted data to a small number of comparison operations over plain texts and vector-addition operations over ciphertexts, and the main building block relies on fast symmetric-key primitives. The correctness, Byzantine resilience, and privacy protection of RSAM are analyzed, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) has attracted widespread attention as a promising modern access protocol for machine-type communications (MTC). Since IRSA is a typical short-packet transmission scheme, the decoding error probability caused by finite block-length is not negligible. In this paper, we establish an IRSA-based uplink access model considering the impact of finite block-length transmission. In particular, assuming Rayleigh fading channels, a detection-oriented power allocation strategy is employed to enable the AP to identify collision-free slots based on the power of received signal. We then perform detailed analysis of three performance metrics, i.e., system throughput, user invalid probability, and device energy efficiency, to investigate the optimal behavior of IRSA under the proposed model. It is validated that by carefully setting the two controllable parameters, i.e., fading threshold and packet length, a good compromise between throughput and user invalid probability can be achieved while maintaining appreciable energy efficiency. Furthermore, we derive a new upper bound on the maximal load that the system can support for IRSA, which is a generalization of the existing benchmark and much tighter in erasure scenarios.},

Various methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, but most of them are subject to multiple restrictions such as specific array geometries or requirements for prior knowledge. To bypass these restrictions, we introduce an ABF method for non-uniform linear arrays in multipath environment. Firstly, we design a sparsity-induced decorrelation method that extends the compact formulation for the $\ell _{2,1}$ mixed-norm to a gridless manner by Jacobi-Anger approximation. For computational efficiency, this convex problem is solved in two steps: offline calculations and online iterations, so as to yield a Toeplitz matrix. Next, we extract the direction-of-arrivals (DoAs) and $\ell _{2}$ norms of the signals, by which a matching scheme is proposed to reconstruct the desired and interference-plus-noise covariance matrices. Additionally, we provide a novel proof for the compact formulation, and present an alternative approach for DoA estimation through analysis of the dual problem in the generalized formulation. The superiority of our method over competing approaches is validated through simulations and experimental data.},

However, considering the scarcity of radio resources and the inefficiency of resource allocation, the performance reduction caused by resource collisions may restrict its development in the V2X network. In this paper, we propose a flexible resource allocation scheme, namely Zone cluster Resource Reuse (ZRR), to reduce resource collision and achieve a better delivery performance of NR V2X based VRUP. We then develop a theoretical framework based on stochastic geometry to efficiently characterize the VRUP message delivery process under ZRR, taking into account the specified factors of NR V2X. With the help of the framework, we are able to derive two important performance metrics, namely message delivery probability and the User Equipment (UE) transmit power, and we can further search for the optimal parameter setting of ZRR. Extensive simulation and theoretical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ZRR and the framework. Under the optimal parameter setting, ZRR is very desirable for VRUP message delivery, especially in the resource-constrained and access-intensive scenario.},

For enhanced coverage and connectivity, a novel framework with cellular offloading under the aid of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. The eMBB services aspire for maximum data rates whereas latency and reliability are the major constraints for URLLC users. In this study, we explored the multiplexing of eMBB and URLLC services under the proposed framework, with the objective of maximizing proportional fairness across eMBB users while fulfilling the provisions of URLLC users. Initially, the UAVs have to be deployed with respect to user distribution. To accomplish this, we have implemented a clustering algorithm that uses K-means++ methodology to divide users into distinct groups. At the beginning of the time slot for eMBB resource allocation, a scheduling algorithm with low complexity is proposed. A stability-based matching algorithm is proposed for URLLC resource allocation to evaluate suitable eMBB URLLC pairs for superposition. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is implemented to further enhance the system throughput by adopting the superposition technique. Lastly, the proposed methodology&#39;s significance over other standard methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations that measure the system&#39;s throughput, minimum expected achieved rate (MEAR), and fairness index among eMBB users.},

To minimize the task processing cost of all users, we try jointly optimizing computational offloading decisions, task offloading proportion, and allocation of communication and computation resources in this paper. Herein, the task processing cost is mainly caused by local energy consumption, wireless communication, and edge computing. Although the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we design an efficient algorithm to find its optimum solution. Specifically, by taking advantage of both the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (IAFSA) and the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), a hierarchical algorithm used for computation offloading (HACO) is designed. Then, the convergence, complexity, and parallel implementation of such an algorithm are analyzed. Finally, compared with other existing algorithms through simulation experiments, it is verified that the designed algorithm may achieve better performance in reducing the task processing cost under strict delay constraints.},

  abstract     = {Deploying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is promising for enhancing the transmission reliability of wireless communications by controlling the wireless environment, in which the active beamforming at the base station and the passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly designed based on the acquisition of channel state information. Hence, channel estimation is crucial for RIS-aided systems. Due to the lack of active radio frequency chains at the RIS to process and transmit pilot sequences, only the cascaded twin-hop transmitter-RIS-receiver channel can be estimated, which results in extremely high pilot overhead, when a large number of RIS reflecting elements is used. As a remedy, we propose a channel estimation method relying on low pilot overhead, namely the Karhunen-Loève transformation based linear minimal mean square error (KL-LMMSE) estimator. This exploits the spatial correlation of the RIS-cascaded channels, for our multi-cell multiple-input and multiple-output RIS-aided systems. Furthermore, we extend our investigations to the effects of realistic phase quantization errors. Additionally, we derive the theoretical mean square error (MSE) of our proposed channel estimators verified by numerical simulations, and compare the results to various benchmark schemes. We show that the MSE performance of our proposed KL-LMMSE estimator is better than that of the state-of-the-art low-overhead channel estimators.},

In this paper, we propose a modified neural network architecture based on LSTM to exploit the channel&#39;s temporal correlation inherent for fast and accurate CSI acquisition, named CeLSTM. In the CeLSTM, we design a CSI entropy rectifier linear unit (CeRLU) for mapping the calculated CSI entropy into recurrent neural networks, which measures the temporal coherence of historically estimated CSI to facilitate the accurate estimation of current CSI. The CeLSTM learns nonlinear channel statistical correlation characteristics and conducts self-corrects from received signals by offline and online learning, respectively, to estimate CSI in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that CeLSTM improves the CSI estimation accuracy by 45% and 60% on average compared with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) and LSTM, respectively. Benefiting from CeRLU, the estimation time-consuming based on CeLSTM is 60% lower than LSTM and exhibits good robustness through MSE performance analysis under various time-varying channels.},

In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of an MU-MIMO network where TAM is formulated to minimize the number of active antennas in the BS while guaranteeing the per-user throughput requirements. To address the computational complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem, we propose an algorithm called neural antenna muting (NAM) with an asymmetric custom loss function. NAM is a classification neural network (NN) trained in a supervised manner. The classification error in this scheme leads to either sub-optimal energy consumption or lower quality of service (QoS) for the communication link. We control the classification error probability distribution by designing an asymmetric loss function such that the erroneous classification outputs are more likely to result in fulfilling the QoS requirements. Furthermore, we present three heuristic algorithms and compare them with the NAM. Using a 3GPP-compliant system-level simulator, we show that NAM achieves about 73% energy saving compared to the full antenna configuration in the BS while achieving around 95% QoS guarantee. Furthermore, NAM is around 1000 times and 24 times less computationally intensive than the greedy heuristic algorithm and the fixed column antenna muting algorithm, respectively.},

A caching hit ratio maximization problem is formulated by designing recommendation, caching and transcoding simultaneously. The problem is an integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem and is NP-hard. To solve it effectively, we decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., content recommendation, caching placement and transcoding decision subproblems. The optimal solution to the first subproblem is derived theoretically, the second is proven to be a monotone submodular maximization problem, which is solved by greedy algorithm, and the third is a knapsack problem and is solved by dynamic programming approach. Finally, a joint recommendation, caching and transcoding (JRCT) algorithm is established to solve these three subproblems iteratively. Extensive simulations are conducted on a real world viewing dataset. It is demonstrated that JRCT can achieve higher caching hit ratio and traffic offloading ratio than the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a robust beamforming algorithm for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) low earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications under uncertain channel conditions. Specifically, a risk-aware optimization problem is formulated to optimize the hybrid digital and analog precoding aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the LEO satellite while considering the required quality-of-service (QoS) by each ground user. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as a risk measure of the downlink data rate to capture the high dynamic and random channel variations due to satellite movement, achieving the required QoS under the worst-case scenario. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework is developed to solve the formulated stochastic problem over time slots. Considering the limited computation capabilities of the LEO satellite, the training process of the proposed learning algorithm is performed offline at a central terrestrial server. The trained models are then sent periodically to the LEO satellite through ground stations to provide online executions on the transmit precoding based on the current network state. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving the QoS requirements under uncertain wireless channel conditions.},

  abstract     = {As a typical demand of the next-generation wireless networks, numerous emerging applications impose stringent requirements on the timely and accurate sensing of the dynamical channel and the moving target. And radar with massive arrays could satisfy these requirements, imposing large power consumption and complexity. To this end, thanks to the energy-efficient and cost-effective characteristics, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for assisting environment sensing owing to its ability of manipulating the impinging signal. Inspired by this, we investigate a novel application of RIS for target tracking in high-mobility and three-dimensional scenario. Specifically, we consider a RIS-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a RIS is deployed at the base station (BS) side. Exploiting the proposed predictive phase design strategy and collected echoes, the RIS tries to estimate the motion parameters of the potential targets. In particular, to fulfill the goal of precise and timely target tracking, we adapt a particle filtering (PF) based and an extended Kalman filtering (EKF) based state estimation algorithms, where both the observations at RIS side and the inherent state evolution information are well exploited. Furthermore, numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive phase design strategy in various scenarios. The performance of EKF scheme is superior to the PF about 15% averagely with lower computational complexity.},

However, more accurate channel estimation requires more resources. Hence, we investigate the joint optimization of the channel estimator, transmit precoder and receiver in large-scale MIMO systems. In contrast to the classic signal processing philosophy, the joint optimization aims for solving two equations in the face of realistic channel estimation and data transmission imperfections. Closed-form solutions are derived for a pair of schemes. For the first one, the joint optimization consists of the three procedures of channel estimation, data estimation and channel refinement. In this method, the estimated data symbols are also harnessed as pilots, based on which the channel estimation performance is improved. As for the second scheme, since data estimation is our final goal and channel estimation is only an intermediate step, the channel estimation procedure is substituted into the data estimation regime without deriving an explicit solution for the estimated channel. Given our objective of optimizing the data estimation performance, the channel estimator and data transceiver are jointly optimized, and the intricate linkages between these two methods are discussed. Finally, several numerical results are provided for demonstrating the performance advantages over the traditional designs.},

Moreover, multi-dimensional service/resource exchange demanded by massive symbiotic devices (SDs) in the ecosystems exposes additional challenges for exchange decision-making. To deal with the above difficulties, in this article, we propose a b lockchain-empowered i ntelligent c o evolution for s ymbiotic d evices (BIO-SD). Specifically, to guarantee the trustworthiness of service/resource exchange and resist malicious attacks, a direct acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain architecture is applied to the BIO-SD scheme. Furthermore, a modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach is adopted to make service/resource exchange decisions under this trusted environment.

However, due to the intrinsically limited resources that UAVs can utilize, it is challenging to achieve performance improvement for dual purposes. Toward this end, in this paper, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) UAV-enabled ISAC system is investigated, and a joint trajectory planning and resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for target location estimation while guaranteeing the communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve in general, and we first decompose the original problem into three sub-problems and then propose the corresponding algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions efficiently. The extensive simulations demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the performance improvement on the localization with different communication requirements compared to conventional techniques.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the outage behavior of an uplink decode-and-forward (DF) based mixed underwater optical wireless-RF communication (UOW-RFC) system utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for underwater transmission. A water surface vehicle (WSV), acting as relay, forwards the data of the underwater devices (UDs) to a terrestrial access point (AP) by utilizing the quality of service (QoS) based successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes. In particular, we consider three different QoS-based SIC schemes at the WSV, namely (i) Basic QoS-based SIC (BQ-SIC), (ii) Advanced QoS-based SIC (AQ-SIC), and (iii) Enhanced QoS-based SIC (EQ-SIC), which are different from conventional channel state information (CSI)-based SIC. Moreover, we employ partial relaying over the RF hop, i.e., the relay forwards the data to AP even if it is able to decode the data of one UD only. Considering the mixture-Extended Generalized Gamma (mEGG) distribution with lab channel scenario and non-zero boresight pointing error model for underwater links and Nakagami- $m$ distribution for RF link, we obtain the expressions for outage probability under all the three QoS-based SIC schemes in terms of bivariate and multivariate Fox-H functions. It is shown through the numerical results that, in comparison with the BQ-SIC scheme, the AQ-SIC scheme provides significant improvement in the outage performance of low-QoS UD only, whereas the EQ-SIC scheme outperforms both BQ-SIC and AQ-SIC schemes for high-QoS and low-QoS UDs. The numerical results also reveal that employing EQ-SIC at WSV enables to overcome the error floor problem of UL-NOMA. Further, we perform the asymptotic outage analysis and derive analytical diversity order for all the QoS-based SIC schemes considered in this work. We also compare the proposed DF-based system with its AF counterpart to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. The impact of various other system and underwater channel parameters such as, threshold, bubble level, salinity, temperature gradient, and link lengths is shown on the outage performance of UDs. The derived results have also been compared with the benchmark scheme without partial relaying.},

Since self-backhauling at mmWave bands is considered a promising technology to enable high-throughput networks, we investigate how to embed ISAC functions into mmWave network by jointly considering high-speed data transmissions and high accuracy localization. To maximize the utilization of mmWave BSs for sensing and communication, we study the problem of optimal sensing task allocation taking into account target location, the requirements of different sensing tasks, user distribution, link scheduling, and data routing. With ISAC operations in mind, we analyze the time needed to complete each sensing task to facilitate problem formulation. To overcome the computational complexity in solution finding, we propose a sensing-oriented column generation (SOCG) scheme, which is shown to achieve near optimal performance via extensive performance evaluation. Furthermore, evaluation results demonstrate that the obtained sensing task allocation provides good throughput performance while ensuring the requirements of sensing tasks are satisfied.},

As failure in an actuator can directly affect the running attitude of the bogie, fault-tolerant control for such failures is particularly important. In this study, a fault-tolerant control method is proposed based on the classical active steering control structure, where each axle is equipped with two actuators. First, the optimal yaw angles of the wheelset under constraints are obtained in the control layer; then, the performance index reflecting the allocation and actual implementation effects is introduced in the allocation layer. Subsequently, the fault-tolerant control effect is analyzed for four typical fault cases: self-lock, back to zero, cutoff, and abnormal action. The results show that compared to the traditional geometric control method, the fault-tolerant control method not only maintains the steering control effect under fault cases but also ensures the running safety of the bogie after an actuator failure. Next, the weights of the cost functions in the allocation layer are analyzed; it is recommended that the weight for allocation effect should not be smaller than 0.1, as it can affect the redistribution transition process. Finally, it is proved that the controller has good parametric robustness. The results can be used as a reference for fault-tolerant control of active steering systems.},

The objective is to improve steering performance of DAHVs while negating the need for a conventional hydraulic steering method (HSM). A differential steering control framework that is combined with a composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control strategy and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique is proposed. Three main contributions are made in this paper: 1) A differential steering control method for DAHVs is proposed for the first time. It uses the yaw rate control of the front vehicle part to obtain a suitable direct yaw moment to guide the steering control of the rear vehicle part and achieve the vehicle steering process. This method can realize the collaborative control of a DAHV with two relatively independent vehicle parts. 2) The CNF control strategy is employed to design the nominal part of the differential steering controller to eliminates steady-state errors and guarantee transient steering performance of DAHV. 3) The ADRC technique is adopted to achieve disturbance estimation and compensation, so as to reduce the influence of disturbance on the differential steering process and improve the vehicle steering performance. The system&#39;s stability is proven by the Lyapunov approach. Moreover, a co-simulation model verified by field tests is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches.},

The design consists of top and bottom FSSs on either side of the Taconic TLY-5 substrate. PIN diodes mounted on the back FSS turn the polarizer transmissive and reflective in different states. For a linearly polarized wave incidence, the transmitted wave would be circularly polarized with a 3 dB Axial Ratio (AR) from 8.03–16.30 GHz (67.98%) and 30.05–31.70 GHz (5.34%). In reflection mode, this design performs linear-circular conversion in 9.38–10.49 GHz (11.17%) and 15.14–30.27 GHz (66.64%). On the other hand, the unitcell behaves as a reflective linear-cross converter with a minimum 90% Polarization Conversion Ratio over 11.43–13.43 GHz (16.09%) and 31.67–34 GHz (7.10%). Multiple surface plasmonic resonances are the reason behind the different conversions. The unitcell periodicity (0.150 λL × 0.123 λL ) is the compact and low-profile thickness of 0.043λ L . The proposed work&#39;s novelty lies in the miniaturized architecture of the linear-circular polarization converter, covering the lower frequency (X/Ku) in transmission mode and higher frequency (Ku/K) in the reflection mode, which made this polarizer a suitable candidate for vehicular satellite communication applications.},

  abstract     = {Maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) is a key concept to improve the ac-ac efficiency of the wireless power transfer (WPT) systems by controlling the equivalent load impedance with a dc-dc converter or an active rectifier. The on-off keying (OOK) modulation can reduce the switching losses of the converters to achieve MEPT but generates relatively large dc voltage ripples. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced on-off keying (EOOK) modulation method by adding a half-bridge mode based on OOK modulation for WPT systems. By combining the three operation modes, both the inverter and the active rectifier can operate in full-bridge-half-bridge mode or half-bridge-zero mode to adapt to different power levels and achieve MEPT simultaneously. Meanwhile, the ZVS condition and the low voltage ripple are achieved as well. The circuit model of the proposed method is analyzed to derive the equivalent load resistance, the output voltage gain, and the output power with respect to the modulation of EOOK. The reason for output voltage ripples and the power losses on both the transmitting and receiving sides are also revealed. An experimental prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The predictive energy management (PEM) of four-wheel drive (4WD) battery electric vehicles (BEVs) requires high accuracy in the driving information forecast of velocity and road gradient. In this article, a meta-learning-based driving information prediction (DIP) method is proposed aiming to improve the performances of real-time PEM of 4WD-BEVs with a dual-electric machine (EM) driving system in each wheel. The proposed meta-learning-based DIP method is demonstrated to have higher accuracy, better robustness and faster computation speed by testing on collected real-world driving cycles. Then, a novel PEM method is proposed based on the model predictive controller (MPC), the reference projection of which is generated by the proposed meta-learning predictor. Our PEM strategy applies dynamic programming (DP) to solve the optimal control problem. The practicability of the proposed PEM method is analyzed in regard to the model accuracy, robustness to disturbances, generalization ability and real-time applicability. The proposed PEM method takes both the power distribution between the front and rear axles and that between two motors in each wheel into consideration. The simulation results reveal that the state-of-charge (SOC) declination of the proposed PEM method is better than the benchmark by 2.66% to 3.64%.},

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called multi-timescale dual feature-based state estimation network (MFN) using extremely limited charging data to estimate three critical states simultaneously end-to-end: maximum capacity, the capacity at the beginning of charging, and the capacity at the end of charging. The core of the framework is the dual feature extraction module (DFM) and the multi-timescale information extraction module (MTM). First, DFM extracts independent and coupling features of external signals (voltage, current, temperature) in the time dimension, respectively, and then merges them. Based on this, MTM explores the health features of the external signals on different time scales and merges them. Finally, the three internal states are estimated using the mined depth features. Experimental results in the Oxford battery data show that the root mean square error (RMSE) for three internal states is less than 9.71 mAh, corresponding to 1.31% of the nominal capacity.},

In this field, the multi-obstacle issue is a challenging but critical topic that needs to be adequately investigated, especially for the autonomous heavy vehicle. An integrated path planning framework comprising a key reference target risk evaluator (KRE), a B-spline path optimizer (BPO) and a multidimensional constraint set (MCS) is proposed for a multi-axle distributed autonomous vehicle. In the KRE, the key reference target is recognized for risk classification, and the space to collision is constructed for lane changing feasibility judgement. Meanwhile, the probability-based vehicle ellipse is designed for influence range reflection. In the BPO, the path generation-optimization integration algorithm is designed based on B-spline parameterized method, by which the optimal path with smoothness and response is determined continuously with real-time planning objectives. To improve the comprehensive performance of the optimal path, an MCS considering the collision field, the planning corridor and ego vehicle dynamic is formulated, which guarantees the anti-collision ability and the spatial realizability, and enhances the vehicle dynamic properties involving anti-sideslip, rollover prevention, yaw stability and tire wear alleviation. Finally, the simulation and HIL test platform are established and the validation is conducted in different cases, which proves the effectiveness and real-time capability of the proposed framework.},

Additionally, the problem of singularity is skillfully addressed with the help of the piecewise function. To compensate for the influence of input constraints, the auxiliary signal with fixed-time convergence is devised. By incorporating the event-triggered control mechanism into the command filtered backstepping design process, an event-triggered distributed adaptive fixed-time formation control algorithm for multiple QUAVs is developed.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving, as an emerging technology, is developing rapidly. However, a number of obstacles appear to be holding back the widespread adoption of autonomous driving. Cybersecurity issues, which have a significant impact both technically and psychologically on people&#39;s willingness to use autonomous driving, are one of the most significant barriers. Attackers have adopted increasingly diverse threat methods, increasing cyber-attacks. Despite these threats, global standards have been developed for road vehicle safety and cybersecurity. These standards are intended to guide manufacturers of automotive systems. For instance, the ISO and SAE have jointly released the international standard ISO/SAE 21434 (Road Vehicles—Cybersecurity Engineering) for road vehicle cybersecurity. However, focusing on the development of onboard systems alone when examining the application of these standards is not sufficient. Currently, we lack a methodology to directly apply the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to automotive system engineering projects. In particular, the overall framework of cybersecurity design for intelligent connected vehicle systems needs to be developed. This paper proposes an overall cybersecurity assurance framework (ODFa ${}^{2}$ ) based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to assist system engineers in understanding security risks, evaluating the feasibility of attack implementation, and determining the trade-off methods for security countermeasures. We illustrate through a case study how this model-based framework may be applied to cybersecurity engineering in intelligent connected vehicles and mobility service platforms. Furthermore, the results of comparative experiments indicate that the proposed strategy optimization algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of time efficiency under certain conditions.},

  abstract     = {The collaborative path planning and scheduling can overcome the limitations of single vehicle intelligence to obtain a globally optimal decision strategy in cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoVs). The collaboration of vehicles necessitates the exchange of environmental and decision information, generating massive collaborative computing tasks with strict latency requirements. Leveraging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, computing tasks can be processed near the vehicles to reduce latency. However, traffic congestion and computational load imbalance seriously affect traffic efficiency and computational latency. In hybrid driving scenarios, it is challenging to fulfill the diverse service requirements of vehicles with different intelligence levels. Moreover, non-collaborative tend to result in traffic congestion due to vehicle aggregation effects, while centralized solutions lack flexibility and have high computational complexity. To address these concerns, a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) algorithm is proposed for collaborative path planning and scheduling in a blockchain-based collaboration framework. In this framework, we model the communication, traffic situation and task processing of the system and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize both travel time and computation latency. Last, we convert the scheduling problem for different types of vehicles into Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose Q-learning-based DMARL algorithm to achieve proactive load balancing of both road infrastructures and MEC nodes (MECNs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of load balance indexes of roads and MECNs, travel time, and computation latency.},

To facilitate a more productive CTP, we propose an efficient method by combing heuristic search and group priority optimization-based approach that strives to realize the efficient generation of safe trajectories. The proposed method essentially integrates two radical trajectory planners: i) heuristic search trajectory planning and ii) advanced sequential optimization method, and introduces a novel adaptive group priority based on the characteristics of mining site for easing the computational time of sequential optimization.

Since traditional motion planning methods largely rely on complex hand-crafted designs, recent research has shifted focus to simple and effective learning-based methods. However, most of the existing learning-based methods primarily employ end-to-end networks to directly generate trajectories or control commands, which may not satisfy vehicle kinematic constraints. These kinematically infeasible outputs cause autonomous driving vehicles deviating from the intended trajectories, significantly impacting both ride comfort and task completion. In this paper, we propose a new Feasible And Smooth Tree (FAST) to concentrate on the generation and utilization of trajectory tree. This trajectory tree structure possesses curvature continuity and kinematic feasibility, making it a cluster of feasible and smooth trajectories that can represent various intentions for traffic participants. Moreover, by employing the trajectory tree as the outputs for both motion planning and auxiliary trajectory prediction tasks, FAST effectively integrates the trajectory tree into a multi-task framework to improve its performance. We evaluate FAST in the closed-loop urban driving setting using the different scenarios provided by CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that FAST outperforms other learning-based methods while maintaining high efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The self-organization capabilities of massive aerial swarms pose challenges to conventional methods of grouping aerial targets. These traditional approaches struggle with issues such as stability, reliability, and the recognition of deep intentions. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architecture called Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Aerial Targets Grouping (UCL-ATG). Our approach utilizes random time periods within the scenario as training batches for contrastive learning. The UCL-ATG model consists of four key modules: feature extraction, time series generation, fine-tuning, and clustering. The feature extraction and time series generation modules form the network architecture of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). Positive and negative samples are obtained using different sampling methods. To effectively collaborate with the clustering module, we design a contrastive predictive loss function specifically tailored for clustering. This enables the extraction of low-dimensional representations that capture the high-dimensional temporal characteristics of aircraft. Furthermore, we introduce a real-time fine-tuner to enhance the model&#39;s transferability to specific tasks. The inclusion of the real-time fine-tuner greatly alleviates problems associated with evolving confrontation styles and unevenly distributed datasets, as confirmed by the performance on the validation set. Extensive comparative experimental results demonstrate our model&#39;s superior training outcomes and its ability to extract improved clustering features. In wargame applications, our model no longer relies solely on static position information of the aircraft. It exhibits outstanding capabilities in historical information memory, information synthesis, and even demonstrates aptitude in identifying friend or foe and making tactical inferences.},

  abstract     = {Directly using brain signals to drive vehicles is called brain-control driving, which has the potential to help people with disabilities to acquire driving ability. Developing driver models of the brain-control driving can help understand and simulate the driver behaviors, which contributes to the development of the brain-control driving. In this paper, to simulate the car-following behavior of the brain-control driving, we propose two brain-control car-following models, i.e., CF-BCB and CF-BCI models. The two models are built by integrating a car-following decision model with a brain-control behavior model and a brain-computer interface (BCI) performance model in the queuing network (QN) cognitive architecture, respectively. The manual- and brain-control experiments are conducted to collect the car-following data of the ideal and real brain-control driving, respectively. Simulations with the proposed models are performed to mimic the ideal and real brain-control driving of different subjects. We compare the performance of the car-following decision model and two decision models extended from the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the full velocity difference model (FVDM), respectively. The comparison results show that the car-following decision model performs better than the two decision models in simulating the ideal brain-control driving. Besides, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed models in simulating the car-following behaviors of the brain-control drivers by comparing the simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The problem of task allocation of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems is a hot issue in scientific research. Aiming at overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms in terms of load balancing and execution efficiency, an algorithm Improved Self-Organizing Mapping (ISOM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering the two factors of the UAV flight distance and the mission execution time, the load balance of the UAV is designed. The sum of the track lengths of multiple UAVs and the total time required by multiple UAVs to complete all the tasks in the task area are used to evaluate the quality of cooperative task assignment of multiple UAVs. Secondly, the learning rate and neighborhood function of nonlinear change are designed to ensure the stability and accelerate its convergence. With the increase of the number of iterations, the radius of the neighborhood gradually decreases, and the renewal range of the superior neighborhood is determined by the nonlinear function. Finally, in order to solve the problem of new tasks of UAV and UAV failure, the attention mechanism based on the ISOM algorithm is introduced. Different attention is allocated by the distance between the UAV and the mission points to ensure the missions can be fully executed. Compared with algorithms PSO-GA, Gurobi and ORTools, the time to complete the task is effectively reduced, respectively. At the same time, the algorithm is verified in a large task environment. When the number of tasks is 200 and the number of UAVs is 8, in the TSPLIB task set, the simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency and flexibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the development of vehicular technology, autonomous driving has experienced explosive growth, making it an important and popular research field. In autonomous driving scenarios, autonomous driving tasks are often neural network-based intelligent tasks with different levels of complexity. These intelligent tasks usually have different requirements for hardware resources such as computational performance, memory capacity and power consumption. Additionally, the evaluation becomes even more challenging due to the different system architectures and resource configurations of hardware devices from different manufacturers. It is crucial to accurately estimate the resource requirements of different intelligent tasks on different hardware platforms in advance.To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional resource modeling method based on deep learning techniques and constructs an evaluation model to predict the consumption of three resources: computing performance, memory usage and power consumption.Experiments demonstrate that for the performance, memory and power metrics, the evaluation model built using this method for predicting seven mainstream neural networks achieves average error rates of 6.78%, 8.86% and 7.89% respectively on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform, and the average error rates for the same metrics are 8.05%, 9.25% and 3.67% respectively on the Cambricon MLU220 platform.},

  abstract     = {Benefited from the development of intelligent transportation system and autonomous vehicle, the autonomous valet parking has been attracting attentions worldwide. Compared with short-range autonomous valet parking, long-range autonomous valet parking further alleviates users from parking during long-range traveling. Although autonomous vehicles can finish parking autonomously under long-range autonomous valet parking, they still need to estimate parking cost of each parking lot and decide which one to park. However, existing works on parking cost estimation do not consider the competition with uncertain parking demand, leading to inaccurate cost estimation. Besides, fixed parking prices intensify parking competition and cause local congestion at parking lot. Therefore, we propose a Long-Range Autonomous Valet Parking Considering Uncertain Demand and Parking Pricing. Based on the uncertain demand analysis, we predict the future occupancy of parking lot and adjust its price dynamically, so as to balance parking demand. Moreover, the accurate estimation of parking cost is achieved through mathematical analysis on uncertain demand, with vision that autonomous vehicles can select parking lot with lower parking cost. Simulation results show that compared with other schemes, our scheme can outperform on reducing parking cost and balancing parking demand.},

  abstract     = {Railways around the world are facing ever-increasing demands from booming passenger and freight transportation. Constructing new railways is not always possible due to the high cost and the lack of space. Virtual coupling (VC), which enables multiple trains to run cooperatively and closely on the same track, stands out as a major technological enabler for improving the existing railway network capacity and operational flexibility. This, however, relies on a feasible longitudinal spacing controller for each train such that the entire virtually coupled train convoy can function smoothly, safely, and efficiently. The design of such a spacing controller is intrinsically challenging as the train-to-train (T2T) communications, the primary enabling component for VC, may be interrupted by malicious cyber attacks. This paper addresses a resilient VC control problem for multiple automatic trains subject to intermittent T2T communications. First, an intermittent data transmission paradigm is presented to account for the effects of attack-incurred sporadic T2T communications. Then, a resilient distributed longitudinal spacing control method is developed to preserve the desired stability of the resultant train control system, while simultaneously guaranteeing attack resilience as well as driving safety and comfort requirements for the train convoy. It is shown that the proposed method is also effective in empowering a better trade-off analysis between traffic efficiency and safety than some traditional methods. Finally, numerical case studies using data from a realistic urban rail transit line substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

The latter consist of classical search patterns suggested by the international aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (IAMSAR) manual. The proposed scheme comprises a guidance and a control module. In the guidance module, a limited boundary-based guidance principle is developed with a position threshold rule to avoid continuous computation of heading reference signals. Associated with the guidance signal, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism is derived by designing an output-based dynamic rule without fixed parameters, which has the potential to reduce unnecessary communication resource usage between the controllers and the actuator systems when compared with existing techniques. A shifting function is introduced to ensure that the path following error is within a prescribed region. This will ensure proper balance between communication burden and tracking accuracy in the closed-loop system. Semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability of the proposed control system is guaranteed using Lyapunov theory. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposal algorithm are shown via simulations.},

Considering three different MIMO Radar topologies, the efficient target detection have been studied by using suitable Radar performance metrics like ambiguity function and field of view (FOV), besides antenna parameters like impedance matching and mutual coupling. An improved angular resolution has been obtained by judicial placement of antenna elements in the proposed interleaved MIMO array topology, which leads to a minimally redundant array configuration having more extensive virtual aperture of $1.4\lambda$ (here $\lambda$ is the free-space wavelength at 76 GHz), improved isolation and broad ambiguity free region in the azimuthal plane. The proposed interleaved MIMO array topology yielded a $12^{\circ }$ angular resolution in single layer configuration having total area of $30 \times \text{18}\,\text{mm}^{2}$ (35.42 $\lambda ^{2}$ ), which renders it as a simple cost-effective design that exhibit less spectral broadening in frequency domain and thus less sensitive to the environmental noise. To validate the proposed methodology, a scaled structure of the interleaved MIMO array operating at 24 GHz has been realized using full-wave solver CST-MWS. Furthermore, the interleaved MIMO array prototype at 24 GHz is fabricated, and reasonable match between simulated results (S-parameters and patterns) and experimental data is obtained.},

Redundant system design is the key to ensure the safety and reliability of driverless vehicles, so some driverless vehicles adopt standby-sparing system. The standby-sparing system is a kind of computer systems that solves the fault tolerance problem by using two processors: a primary processor and a spare processor. The primary processor is responsible for executing main tasks. The spare processor is responsible for executing backup tasks. The release time assignment for backup tasks, as a part of task scheduling, is an important technology in real-time standby-sparing systems. The selective scheduling for tasks with $(m,k)$ -constraint ( MKSS ) is the state-of-the-art scheduling method for real-time tasks in standby-sparing systems. However, this method is inefficient in release time assignment for backup tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient release time assignment method that can reduce the number of inspecting points and terminate the enumeration once there appears a special inspect point. Theoretical analysis results show that the new method can improve the execution efficiency of the release time assignment without sacrificing the energy-saving effect of MKSS . A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate the execution efficiency of the new method, and the results show that, compared with the MKSS method, the new method can reduce about 98.7% time overhead for assigning release time for tasks.},

This article investigates the issue of distributed fuzzy adaptive resilient control in prescribed performance for the ICVPS subject to multiple node attacks and disturbances. Firstly, a nonlinear state compensation estimator is developed to eliminate the influence of multiple node attacks on state information. Then, by using the designed exponential spacing policy and the hyperbolic arc-tangent asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), the distributed adaptive resilient control scheme is proposed to achieve string stability in prescribed asymmetric constraints performance and fast finite-time stability. The uncertain attack weights and fuzzy weights are compensated by a series of adaptive laws.

  abstract     = {Path-following control is a critical technology for autonomous vehicles. However, time-varying parameters, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated environments significantly challenge autonomous driving. We propose an iterative robust gain-scheduled control (RGSC) with a finite time horizon based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to address this issue. Firstly, a refined polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) model is designed to consider inevitable time-varying parameters. Then, using a set of inequalities and constraints derived from Lyapunov asymptotic stability and the minimization of the worst-case objective function, a novel iterative RGSC technique is proposed to address the over-conservatism. Further, an expanded 3D phase plane is applied to define envelope surfaces, elucidating the connection of stable vehicle operation boundaries. Lane change maneuver is performed in TruckMaker/ Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform. Compared with the infinite time horizon method, the tracking accuracy of our finite controller is significantly improved by 18.15%, 16.68%,14.32%, and 35.65% in cornering stiffness, mass, road conditions, and measurement noise, respectively. Simulation results reveal that our method maintains enhanced control accuracy, robustness, and less conservatism despite minor stability deterioration. An experimental test is carried out on an autonomous bus. The results indicate that our finite RGSC method demonstrates efficient computational characteristics and impressive tracking performance and holds the potential for seamless integration into autonomous vehicle systems. The suggested technique provides crucial insight into better trade-offs among robustness-oriented, less-conservatism-oriented, and stability-oriented control for practical application.},

Safe-aaS platform delivers safety-linked decisions to the customers/users, based on their requirement. Practically, the service regions of the SSPs are confined and may overlap with that of other SSPs. In the existing mechanisms, none of them have taken into account the overlapping service region of the SSPs. In Safe-aaS, the sensor andVOs deploy their sensor nodes over various types of geographical regions and vehicles. Further, the existence of the number of vehicles over any particular geographical region fluctuates with time. Due to the deviation in the position of the vehicles on road, the sensor nodes attached to them also become mobile. However, certainVOs serving the overlapping service regions may act selfishly. TheseVOs provide services to multiple SSPs with the same set of sensor nodes and earn more amount as rent. To provide equal opportunity to theVOs, the interactions among theVOs and SSPs is modeled as a cooperative bargaining game. Further, the utility of theVOs is computed at any time instant and formulated as an optimization function. Thereafter, the maximum utility value is estimated for an optimal value of cost per unit of provisioning the sensor nodes. Depending upon this optimal value, the vehicle owner is selected to provide sensor nodes on rent. After extensive simulation of the proposed pricing mechanism, Co-Safe, it is noted that the utility ofVOs increases and is economical compared to the existing benchmark pricing schemes, Fair Pricing, Dynamic Pricing, and RegPrice.},

This exemption from velocity prediction avoids expensive computational costs, making it possible to use a more affordable processor. To test the strategy, four random driving cycles representing two different vocational uses are selected. The results show that the proposed strategy only increases fuel consumption by 1.3% for unknown urban and long-haul delivery cycles compared to the optimal strategy. Additionally, a sensitivity study reveals the robustness of the method on inaccurate navigation signals. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and adaptive, making it suitable for existing truck applications without the need for additional hardware.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of vehicular technology, autonomous driving and connected car technologies have emerged, leading to a significant increase in the number of sensors and data traffic. To address this growing demand, automotive Ethernet, which offers higher bandwidth for data transmission, has been introduced. The traditional domain-based architecture commonly used in connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) is transitioning to a zone-based architecture, which organizes and connects networks based on the physical location of ECUs. In the zone-based architecture, multiple networks are integrated into a high-speed backbone. In this article, we propose an integrated Ethernet-based network for vehicles that leverages automotive Ethernet not only in the backbone but also in sub-networks with lower data rates. We introduce interrupts to the Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA) protocol in 10BASE-T1S automotive Ethernet, which can be applied in a bus topology, effectively replacing existing communication protocols. This modification enables low-latency transmission for critical packets. Our analysis indicates that the proposed PLCA-with-Interrupt scheme allows for the transmission of express packets with smaller and more predictable latency. Furthermore, we observe no performance degradation when the interrupt ratio remains below 25%.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can employ a large amount of spectrum, and can consequently offer large data rates, e.g., multi-Gigabits-per-second. These systems employ directional antennas to enable acceptable link distances. Directional receiver antennas hence rotate in azimuth to capture the strongest received signal in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) regions. In this paper, we present our measurement results for the 90 GHz band for three different scenarios: indoor, outdoor, and an unusual environment: an airport maintenance hangar. We address line-of-sight (LOS), NLOS, mixed, and LOS-to-NLOS transitions. We used a 500 MHz bandwidth chirp signal and estimate parameters for the close-in free space reference distance path loss model using both simulated (ray-tracing software) and measured data. Path loss exponents are 1.6 for outdoor and 1.8 for indoors, smaller than for free space. We also estimate channel delay dispersion, and statistical stationarity distance for some channel transitions. We observed rapid path loss changes in the LOS to NLOS transition regions, 13 dB for indoor and 17 dB for outdoor. Abrupt changes of the strongest-component angle of arrival, up to 60 degrees over a few cm were observed. We also quantify path loss and root-mean square delay spread (RMS DS) for LOS, NLOS and mixed environments in an airport maintenance hangar. This hangar contains various aircraft, and multiple metallic objects whose positions changed over the measurement time. The maximum path loss exponent was 3.14 for these mixed environments. The RMS DS was a maximum of 16.23 ns in the NLOS region. Rotating the receiver antenna to capture the maximum-power signal from a reflecting object decreased the RMS DS by approximately 4 ns (25%). We observed a small minimum stationarity distance, i.e., six wavelengths in NLOS and a large minimum stationarity distance, approximately six hundred wavelengths in LOS.},

However, there remains a gap in existing works regarding measurement-verified stationarity analysis of the air-to-ground (A2G) Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) channel which plays an important role in realistic UAV deployment. In this article, we first design a UAV MaMIMO communication platform for channel acquisition. We then use the testbed to measure uplink Channel State Information (CSI) between a rotary-wing drone and a 64-element MaMIMO base station (BS). For characterization, we focus on multidimensional channel stationarity which is a fundamental metric in communication systems. Afterward, we present measurement results and analyze the channel statistics based on power delay profiles (PDPs) considering space, time, and frequency domains. We propose the stationary angle (SA) as a supplementary metric of stationary distance (SD) in the time domain. We analyze the coherence bandwidth and RMS delay spread for frequency stationarity. Finally, spatial correlations between elements are analyzed to indicate the spatial stationarity of the array. The space-time-frequency channel stationary characterization will benefit the physical layer design of MaMIMO-UAV communications.},

  abstract     = {Mobile-to-mobile (M2M) propagation channels have gained significant attention over the last years with the development of advanced communication systems for all kind of mobile stations such as aircraft, drones, cars, and ships. However, most available channel models do not account for the environment where the stations are located, but are defined for either average or worst-case conditions, not being able to predict the channel behaviour in specific scenarios. This is especially true for the scattering components of the channel, which are generally either ignored or defined as a rough extrapolation of the scattering components observed in other scenarios. In this work, we propose a geometry-based channel modeling technique that can be applied to any M2M scenario and that can calculate the channel accurately based on the environment around the stations. We first use finite and infinite planes to model the environment. Then, we use the proposed channel modeling technique to obtain analytically the contributions of each plane to the delay-dependent and joint delay Doppler probability density functions of the channel, as well as its squared delay/Doppler-spread function. Our technique focuses mainly on the scattering components but it also addresses the line-of-sight and specular reflection components. We apply the proposed channel modeling technique to different aircraft-to-aircraft, drone-to-drone, car-to-car, and ship-to-ship scenarios where channel measurements are available. In all scenarios, the channel estimated using the proposed channel modeling technique matches the channel measurements very accurately. Specifically, we observe that the scattering components are recreated very faithfully, and that we can even estimate how the channel evolves over time as the stations move and are affected differently by the environment.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a promising technology in the 6G communication. A realistic channel model is a prerequisite for designing ISAC systems. Most existing channel models independently generate the communication and sensing channels under the same framework. However, due to the multiplexing of hardware resources and the same environment, signals enabled for communication and sensing may experience shared propagation scatterers. This practical sharing feature necessities the joint generation of communication and sensing channels for realistic modeling, where the shared clusters (contributed by the shared scatterers) should be reconstructed. In this paper, we first conduct communication and sensing channel measurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. The power-angular-delay profiles of multipath components are obtained, and the shared scatterers by communication and sensing channels are intuitively observed. Then, a stochastic ISAC channel model is proposed to capture the sharing feature, where shared and non-shared clusters by the two channels are defined and superimposed. To extract those clusters from measured ISAC channels, a KPowerMeans-based joint clustering algorithm is novelly introduced. Finally, stochastic channel characteristics are analyzed, and empirical simulations validate that the channel Sharing Degree (SD) increases with more shared clusters. The proposed model can realistically capture the sharing feature of ISAC channels and is able to evaluate and simulate the channel SD values, which is valuable for the design and deployment of ISAC systems.},

However, the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of vehicle arrivals cause that the MEC servers in busy areas are overloaded, which results in degraded computation performance and limited energy alleviation for ECVs. In this paper, we consider the task distribution among nearby MEC servers and propose a novel partial offloading strategy where multiple blocks of the tasks are cooperatively processed by MEC servers in the vehicles&#39; moving directions. After formulating the mathematical model to jointly optimize the computing latency and energy consumption of ECVs, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based task partial offloading strategy is proposed and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is adopted to make the offloading decision. Simulation results illustrate the significant alleviation of energy consumption and improvement of computation performance compared with conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Age of information (AoI) is a powerful metric to evaluate the freshness of information, where minimization of average statistics, such as the average AoI and average peak AoI, currently prevails in guiding freshness optimization for related applications. Although minimizing the statistics does improve the received information&#39;s freshness for status update systems in the sense of average, the time-varying fading characteristics of wireless channels often cause uncertain yet frequent age violations. The recently-proposed statistical AoI metric can better characterize more features of AoI dynamics, which evaluates the achievable minimum peak AoI under the certain constraint on age violation probability. In this paper, we study the statistical AoI minimization problem for status update systems over multi-state fading channels, which can effectively upper-bound the AoI violation probability but introduce the prohibitively-high computing complexity. To resolve this issue, we tackle the problem with a two-fold approach. For a small AoI exponent, the problem is approximated via a fractional programming problem. For a large AoI exponent, the problem is converted to a convex problem. Solving the two problems respectively, we derive the near-optimal sampling interval for diverse status update systems. Insightful observations are obtained on how sampling interval shall be tuned as a decreasing function of channel state information (CSI). Surprisingly, for the extremely stringent AoI requirement, the sampling interval converges to a constant regardless of CSI&#39;s variation. Numerical results verify effectiveness as well as superiority of our proposed scheme.},

Analytical expressions are derived for non-outage probability and throughput of the secondary network while accounting for successive interference cancellation (SIC) errors. A novel channel-aware ITL apportioning (CA-ITLA) scheme is proposed utilizing channel knowledge for intelligent apportioning of the ITL between all transmitting nodes. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared to benchmark schemes like random selection scheme (RSS) with CA-ITLA, static ITL apportioning (S-ITLA), RSS with S-ITLA, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). It is shown that exploiting channel state information (CSI) enables CA-ITLA to accomplish significant throughput gains. It is shown that even better throughputs may be achieved by indirectly exploiting primary channel knowledge through a CSI-dependent ITL. Useful upper bounds on performance are also derived with static and CSI-dependent ITL. Monte Carlo simulations validate the presented analysis.},

By comparing with the system aided by a single large RIS, it is better to allocate them reasonably on multiple RISs when the total number of the reflecting elements is large.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a deep learning-based power control method for maximizing the sum rate subject to rate requirements in the interference-limited device-to-device (D2D) communications. Based on the dynamic nature of D2D communications, we consider the environment where system parameters, such as the number of devices, rate requirements, and deployment area, unpredictably change over time. To deal with the low adaptability and scalability issues of the conventional deep learning-based approaches in dynamic environments, we develop an environment-adaptive power control method by leveraging graph neural network (GNN) architecture and meta-learning approach. In the developed method, we design the node feature and state update rule for GNN by taking into account the characteristics of power optimization problem and meta-train model by treating some past environments as meta-tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed method outperforms the conventional GNN-based power control methods in terms of the average sum-throughput achievement ratio and adaptation speed to test environments.},

Based on perfect channel state information (CSI), a low-complexity hybrid beamforming scheme that decouples the analog beamformer and the digital beamformer is proposed to maximize the sum-rate. The analog beamformer design is modeled as a phase alignment problem to harvest the array gain. Given the analog beamformer, the digital beamformer is designed by solving a weighted minimum mean squared error problem. Then based on imperfect CSI, an analog-only beamformer design scheme is proposed, where the design problem aims at maximizing the desired signal power on the current user and minimizing the power on the other users to mitigate the multiuser interference. The original problem is then transformed into a series of independent beam nulling subproblems, where an efficient iterative algorithm using the majorization–minimization framework is proposed to solve the subproblems. Simulation results show that, under perfect CSI, the proposed scheme achieves almost the same sum-rate performance as the existing schemes but with lower computational complexity; and under imperfect CSI, the proposed analog-only beamforming design scheme can effectively mitigate the multiuser interference.},

Then, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS coefficients, subject to the coupled amplitude and phase shift constraints. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the fractional programming theory. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) The coupled MF-RIS scheme is superior to the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) and single-functional RIS (SF-RIS) schemes under the same power budget; 2) The performance gap between the ideal MF-RIS and coupled MF-RIS decreases with the increase of the total power budget.},

  abstract     = {In this correspondence, we propose a twin-layer hierarchical differential index modulation scheme for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided transmitter architecture, termed as HD-RIS-IM. More specifically, the RIS array is partitioned into perfectly tiling sub-arrays. Each sub-array is mapped across multiple time slots, where each RIS element is activated only once at a particular time slot. These sub-arrays represented by sub-matrices are then used for constructing a block-based permutation matrix for data transmission. With the aid of this hierarchical structure, additional information can be conveyed by the specific order of the sub-arrays that are activated. Furthermore, extra bits are also embedded in the particular order of the RIS elements that are activated within each sub-array. By exploiting all the distinct permutations of the activated matrices, a differential modulation scheme is proposed for the RIS-aided transmitter, which maintains an $M$ -ary phase shift keying (MPSK) and facilitates CSI-free demodulation. Furthermore, at the receiver, we propose a low-complexity distributed maximum likelihood (ML) detector, which significantly reduces the detection complexity. Our simulation results demonstrate the performance benefits of the proposed HD-RIS-IM scheme.},

Coarse compensation partially restores the target&#39;s peak power distorted by ICI and estimates actual velocity of each scatterer without ambiguity. Consequently, fine compensation reconstructs the signal from each scatterer as ICI-free signal. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can restore the target&#39;s peak power to the level without Doppler shift, and the noise due to ICI effect can be reduced.

  abstract     = {Caching the high definition map (HDM) on the edge network can significantly alleviate energy consumption of the roadside sensors frequently conducting the operators of the traffic content updating and transmission, and such operators have also an important impact on the freshness of the received content at each vehicle. This paper aims to minimize the energy consumption of the roadside sensors and satisfy the requirement of vehicles for the HDM content freshness by jointly scheduling the edge content updating and the downlink transmission resource allocation of the Road Side Unit (RSU). To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, namely the prioritized double deep R-Learning Networking (PRD-DRN). Under this PRD-DRN algorithm, the content update and transmission resource allocation are modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We take full advantage of deep R-learning and prioritized experience sampling to obtain the optimal decision, which achieves the minimization of the long-term average cost related to the content freshness and energy consumption. Extensive simulation results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed PRD-DRN algorithm, and also to illustrate the advantage of our algorithm on improving the content freshness and energy consumption compared with the baseline policies.},

  abstract     = {5G networks have emerged as the only viable solution to accomplish a satisfying performance level for various types of services, where each of them has very challenging traffic requirements. One of those services are Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), which are characterized by the stringent demand to deliver packets within a very short time with high reliability. Besides being successfully transmitted, the data must be processed as well. To maximize the number of users the network can serve, the interplay of the different resources must be understood and adequate resource allocation schemes must be devised. In this paper, we consider the joint allocation of uplink and downlink Radio Access Network (RAN) and edge computing resources such that the traffic requirements of individual users are met and the network utility is maximized for different types of fairness. To this end, an optimization problem for the general case of $\bm {\alpha }$ -fairness is formulated and its properties are explored. For the special cases of no fairness, proportional fairness, minimum potential delay fairness, and max-min fairness, polynomial-time allocation approximation algorithms are proposed. Using data from real traces, it is shown that the performance deviation of these approaches from the continuous optimum (upper bound) rarely exceeds $\bm {2}$ %.},

Our considered SAGIN incorporates a cache node on the UAV to cope with the data rate fluctuation in the backhaul link (UAV to satellite), allowing temporary storage of collected data during low data rate periods. In this paper, we aim to minimize the completion time of data collection in SAGIN by optimizing the UAV trajectory, IoRT device association scheme, and data caching policy (whether to store data temporarily or not in the UAV). Since the formulated problem is challenging to solve by using traditional optimization methods due to the unknown number of decision variables and the changing environment, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to efficiently solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm requires less time to complete data collection compared to both the circular trajectory scheme and the no-cache node scheme under various setups. Moreover, our proposed algorithm can adapt to uneven data distribution by approaching closer to the IoRT nodes with large data sizes, and it can also mitigate the influence of backhaul link fluctuations with the aid of the cache node.},

In this article, we propose an environment-adaptive dynamic caching (EADC) strategy for VNDNs to cope with the changing environments. This strategy consists of three factors: vehicle characteristic attributes, motion centrality attributes, and transmission cost attributes, which are used jointly to determine the cache probability. The vehicle characteristic attributes can reflect not only the social attributes but also the content popularity, and helps cache the most popular and desired contents. The motion centrality attributes reflect the contacting capacity and the control capacity of vehicles, and this enables vehicles with the most important locations to cache valuable contents. The transmission cost attributes focus on multiple performance metrics such as transmission delay and cache redundancy, which are used to reflect the content acquisition difficulty and reduce the hard events of long-distance content acquisition. The greatest characteristics and advantages of EADC are the strong adaptability to the content demand changing, network topology changing, and channel quality changing. Extensive simulation results illustrate the advantages of EADC in terms of average delay, cache utilization, cache hit ratio, and average hop count.},

Considering the sensitivity of collected information and the impact of information disclosure, information privacy and security issues should be resolved properly so that the maximum potential of IoD can be realized in the increasingly complex cyber threat environment. Ideally, an authentication and key agreement protocol can be adopted to establish secure communications between drones and the ZSP in an insecure environment. Nevertheless, a large group of drones authenticating with the ZSP simultaneously will lead to a severe authentication signaling congestion, which inevitably degrades the quality of service (QoS) of IoD systems. To properly address the above-mentioned issues, a lightweight group authentication protocol, called liteGAP , is proposed in this paper. liteGAP can achieve the authenticated key establishment between a group of drones and the ZSP concurrently in the IoD environment using lightweight operations such as hash function, bitwise XOR, and physical unclonable function (PUF). We verify liteGAP using AVISPA (a tool for the automatic verification of security protocols) and conduct formal and informal security analysis, proving that liteGAP meets all pre-defined security requirements and withstand various potential cyber attacks. Moreover, we develop an experimental framework and conduct extensive experiments on liteGAP and two benchmark schemes (e.g., GASE and rampIoD). Experimental findings show that liteGAP outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational cost as well as communication overhead.},

To improve the MEC performance regarding system capacity, task service delay, and energy consumption, we design an adaptive joint resource allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which includes uplink, computing, and downlink resource allocation. Further, a multi-actor parallel twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MAPTD3) algorithm is devised to jointly and adaptively optimize these strategies during each time slot. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive joint resource allocation scheme improves system performance significantly while satisfying task delay and system resource constraints. In addition, the space complexity of the designed optimization algorithm is lower than that of conventional DRL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a key enabler of time-critical vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. Under MEC, a vehicle has the option to offload computationally intensive tasks to a nearby edge server or to a remote cloud server. Determining where to execute a task necessitates accurate estimation of the end-to-end (E2E) offloading delay. In this paper, we first conduct extensive measurements of the round-trip time (RTT) between a vehicular user and edge/cloud servers. Using these measurements, we present a latency-estimation framework for optimal task offloading. The propagation delay, measured by the RTT, is divided into two components: one that follows a trackable trend (baseline) and the other (residual) that is quasi-random. For the baseline component, we first cluster measured RTTs into several groups, depending on signal strength indicators. For each group, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) regression model. A statistical approach is provided for predicting the residual component, which combines the Epanechnikov Kernel and moving average functions. Predicted propagation delays are incorporated into virtual simulations to estimate the transmission, queuing, and processing delays, hence accounting for the E2E delay. Based on the estimated E2E delay, we design a task offloading scheme that minimizes the offloading latency while maintaining a low packet loss rate. Simulation results show that the proposed offloading strategy can reduce the E2E delay by approximately 60% compared to a random offloading scheme while keeping the packet loss rate below 3%.},

Being an extension of the IoT technology, the IoD may control and monitor the drones in a particular flight area. The emerging 5G mobile communication infrastructure can greatly help in transmitting the High-Definition (HD) data making the drones to communicate even faster. Nonetheless, these drones remain vulnerable to known security threats due to exchange of communication messages on public channel. In addition, the drones may also be exposed to physical capture and examination by the malicious adversaries. Thus, more concerted efforts are required to address the security challenges for drone communication in IoD-based ecosystem. We propose a novel PUF-based authentication protocol SPAKE-DC to protect not only the drone communication on public channel but also if the drone is physically intercepted with captured resources. The SPAKE-DC protocol supports anonymity, mutual authenticity, perfect forward secrecy, and is also immune from drone physical capture attack. The proposed scheme is duly evaluated and formally analyzed under Real-or-Random Oracle model. The performance results show that SPAKE-DC carry convincing findings in terms of security, computation and communication.

Traditional communication methods fall short of the 6G goals, paving the way for Semantic Communication (SemCom) systems that have applications in the metaverse, healthcare, economics, etc. In SemCom systems, only the relevant keywords from the data are extracted and used for transmission. In this article, we design an auto-encoder and auto-decoder that only transmit these keywords and, respectively, recover the data using the received keywords and the shared knowledge. This SemCom system is used in a setup in which the receiver allocates various categories of the same dataset collected from the transmitter, which differ in size and accuracy, to a number of users. This scenario is formulated using an optimization problem called the data allocation problem (DAP). We show that it is NP-complete and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. Using simulations, we show that the proposed methods for SemCom system design outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of average number of words per sentence for a given accuracy, and that the proposed greedy algorithm solution of the DAP performs significantly close to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) embraces the concepts of targeted data gathering and training, and it can reduce many of the systemic privacy costs and hazards associated with traditional machine learning frameworks. However, with the low latency requirements of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the convergence delay of FL dramatically influences the overall system performance. In order to solve this urgent and challenging problem, in this paper, a joint client scheduling and wireless resource allocation algorithm is proposed, named SCSBA, which considers system heterogeneity, client heterogeneity, and the fairness of client participation to reduce the latency resulting from the heterogeneous communication conditions and computation capabilities among clients with the non identically independently distributed (Non-IID) data distributions. Specifically, the Stackelberg leader-follower game is first formulated in which the server decides the price of the single quota of participating in the FL process every communication round and the clients decide whether to participate in FL. Then the equilibrium solution of the game is derived and proved. In addition, a bandwidth allocation algorithm based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) is designed to minimize the time delay of each communication round. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for reducing the time latency of FL processes with heterogeneous clients, i.e., FedAvg and FedOpt.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the mobile Internet and communications industry has been growing rapidly, with the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) serving as a representative example. The emergence of software function virtualization and network function virtualization has expanded the development of IoV beyond the limitations of the traditional network. However, the increasing number of incoming nodes and the explosion of service requests pose significant challenges for data collection, transmission, and fast processing. The scheduling of service functions is a crucial issue that constrains the quality of service. While existing studies on service function scheduling in IoV are scarce, those available extensively employ linear programming and heuristic algorithms with large solution spaces, limited to offline scheduling. In this article, we model the service function scheduling problem as a flexible shop floor scheduling problem. We integrate consideration of vehicle speed and signal strength based on the network characteristics in IoV, leverage reinforcement learning to learn high-quality scheduling rules, and employ graph neural networks to capture the complex relationship between operations and vehicle nodes, thereby realizing online scheduling. Experimental results effectively demonstrate the proposed scheduling algorithm&#39;s effectiveness and its good capability in future complex network situations.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, task offloading is a prospective approach to alleviate the computing burden of vehicles. Most works studied task offloading in centralized scenarios, where centralized infrastructures host the offloading and force vehicles into providing required private information. However, considering the high costs of infrastructure deployment, distributed scenarios without infrastructures are more practical. This paper focuses on a distributed VEC network, where a task vehicle (TaV) offloads tasks to surrounding vehicles (SuVs) with energy harvesting capabilities. In this context, SuVs are self-interested, and how to motivate self-interested vehicles to process offloaded tasks and provide the required information is challenging. To tackle these issues, an exploration and exploitation assisted contract-theoretic (EEACT) scheme is developed, where each SuV is recruited to participate in task offloading, and to accept the contract item designed for its type. The SuV type is related with the SuV&#39;s private information, and is partially monotonic. As a result, traditional simplification methods of incentive compatible (IC) and individual rational (IR) constraints in contract theory are not applicable. To address this problem, novel simplification methods are proposed and proved theoretically. Based on the contract design, the TaV determines the task offloading decisions by minimizing the processing cost of tasks, including the computation delay and the energy consumption. A low-complexity algorithm based on SuV types is proposed to obtain the approximately optimal offloading strategy. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes in terms of optimality.},

  abstract     = {Aerial acoustic communication in a peer-to-peer manner attracts much attention recently thanks to its ubiquitous device support. These benefits have led Google&#39;s nearby platform to adopt this communication paradigm to establish copresence between nearby devices. However, state-of-the-art research cannot reliably work under dynamic channels and long communication distance. In particular, current proposals have to trade-off between communication distance and transmission rate, when the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) is within a certain threshold. Meanwhile, the performance of existing works is vulnerable to channel dynamics such as the near-far problem, device diversity, and multipath effects. To this end, we propose HiRA, a reliable High thRoughput aerial Acoustic communication system. In HiRA, we design a loose orthogonality condition for chirp carriers, which allows us to overlap multiple loose orthogonal carriers in a single time slot or data symbol, thus notably boosting the transmission rate. To make it reliable, we design a range and Doppler aware beacon detection algorithm and rate adaptation mechanism. Evaluation results show that HiRA achieves $20\times$ improvements over existing methods in data rate: a maximum of 500 bps data rate can be achieved with a BER of 0.64% at 11.5 m. And it can reliably work under dynamic channels but still keep BER under a desired threshold.},

First, to improve the utilization of vehicular idle resources, a collaborative computation and storage resource allocation mechanism was designed using mobile social similarity. Next, with the optimization objective of minimizing the average task processing delay, we studied the combined resource allocation optimization problem and decoupled it into two sub-problems. For the service caching subproblem, we designed a stable matching algorithm by mobile social connections to dynamically update the cache resource allocation scheme for improving the task unloading efficiency. For the task offloading subproblem, a discrete cuckoo search algorithm based on differential evolution was designed to adaptively select the best task offloading scheme, which minimized the average task processing delay. Simulation results revealed that the ECORA strategy outperformed the resource allocation strategy based on particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm, and reduced the average task processing delay by at least 7.59%. Meanwhile, the ECORA strategy can achieve superior network load balancing.},

  abstract     = {Relaying increases the coverage area and reliability of wireless communications systems by mitigating the fading effect on the received signal. Most technical contributions in the context of these systems assume ideal hardware (ID) by neglecting the non-idealities of the transceivers, which include phase noise, in-phase/quadrature mismatch and high power amplifier nonlinearities. These non-idealities create distortion on the received signal by causing variations in the phase and attenuating the amplitude. The resulting deterioration of the performance of wireless communication systems is further magnified as the frequency of transmission increases. In this paper, we investigate the aggregate impact of hardware impairments (HI) on the general multi-hop relay system using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques over a general $\bf H$ -fading model. $\bf H$ -fading model includes free space optics, radio frequency, millimeter wave, Terahertz, and underwater fading models. Closed-form expressions of outage probability, bit error probability and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of $\bf H$ -functions. Following an asymptotic analysis at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), practical optimization problems have been formulated with the objective of finding the optimal level of HI subject to the limitation on the total HI level. The analytical solution has been derived for the Nakagami- $m$ fading channel which is a special case of $\bf H$ -fading for AF and DF relaying techniques. The overall instantaneous signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio has been demonstrated to reach a ceiling at high SNRs which has a reciprocal proportion to the HI level of all hops&#39; transceivers on the contrary to the ID.},

We derive the energy-spectral efficiency (ESE) for the large-scale CoMP-enhanced two-tier HCN. Our ESE modeling distinctively includes: 1) The ESE&#39;s dependence on the activation degree of cross-tier inter-BS cooperation is quantified, which can be flexibly harnessed for transforming the grave interference-limited situation of the tier-edge UEs into harmonious CoMP-support. 2) Both the BS densities in these two tiers and the large-scale user-behaviors (LSUBs) are explicitly integrated into our ESE modeling. Under this tractable ESE model, we first optimize the network&#39;s ESE by choosing a suitable cooperation activation degree based on a specific cellular scenario, whilst satisfying the UE&#39;s outage constraint. We continue by formulating the joint optimization problem of the cooperation activation degree and of the BS density for maximizing the ESE, while varying the LSUBs. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our ESE modeling and quantify the impact of network parameters on the achievable ESE. We demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization strategy has a significantly higher ESE than its optimization counterpart only considering the cooperation activation degree. Our solution may be expected to pave the way for improving the resource efficiency of large-scale dense HCNs.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networking system, more network factors need to be considered to ensure the safe operation of connected vehicles. A large volume of delay-sensitive and computationally demanding tasks necessitate offloading to UAVs or roadside units for processing. And the efficient allocation of various network resources of vehicles, UAVs, and roadside units under constrained conditions determines the efficiency of task offloading. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated its efficacy as an experienced approach for solving such problems. In this article, we delve into the utilization of deep reinforcement learning to design an efficient UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing task offloading strategy. Under the constraints of limited network bandwidth and limited UAV power, the trajectory and the task offloading strategy of the UAV are jointly optimized. The primary objective of our proposed strategy is to achieve a notable reduction in the system delay of the edge computing network. Given the dynamic variability of tasks arrival, we employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with the attention mechanism and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to effectively model the optimization problem as a Markov decision process. This approach can obtain the optimal policy through interactive learning from the UAV and the vehicle environment. The experiment results illustrate that this strategy outperforms other baseline strategies in terms of convergence speed, network delay, and task offloading ratio.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular edge computing (VEC), the deployment of road side units (RSUs) along roads enables vehicles to offload computation-intensive tasks for efficient data processing. However, VEC poses unique challenges, including resource constraints on vehicles and RSUs, high vehicle mobility, and the large-scale nature of the infrastructure. Existing solutions, whether centralized or distributed, often suffer from longer decision-making times or task response times, making them unsuitable for vehicular scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Fully Distributed Task Offloading (FDTO) decision-making scheme, which enables vehicles to iteratively adjust their offloading decisions based on resource utilization information obtained from neighboring RSUs. FDTO employs two different algorithms for decision adjustments: a greedy-based algorithm and a convex optimization-based algorithm. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the proposed algorithms to a global optimum through iterations. To evaluate the performance of FDTO, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer near-optimal performance with a short decision-making time, reducing the average task response time by 50%-65% compared to existing algorithms.},

However, the consensus time and communication overhead of blockchain increase significantly as the number of vehicles connected to the blockchain. To address this issue, vehicular fog computing has been introduced to improve efficiency. However, existing studies ignore several key factors such as the number of vehicles in the fog computing system, which can impact the consensus communication overhead. Meanwhile, there is no comprehensive study on the stability of vehicular fog composition. The vehicle movement will lead to dynamic changes in fog. If the composition of vehicular fog is unstable, the blockchain formed by this fog computing system will be unstable, which can affect the consensus efficiency. With the above considerations, we propose an efficient and stable identity authentication ( ESIA ) empowered by hierarchical blockchain and fog computing. By grouping vehicles efficiently, ESIA has low communication complexity and achieves high stability. Moreover, to enhance the consensus security of the hierarchical blockchain, the consensus process is from the bottom layer to the up layer (bottom-up), which we call B2UHChain . Through theoretical analysis and simulation verification, our scheme achieves the design goals of high efficiency and stability while significantly improving the IoV scalability to the power of 1.5 (^1.5) under similar security to a single-layer blockchain. In addition, ESIA has less communication and computation overhead, lower latency, and higher throughput than other baseline authentication schemes.},

To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first investigates the computation bits maximization problem for IRS-assisted MEC networks with PEs, where multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices can offload their computation tasks to access points with the aid of IRS. By exploiting the block coordinate descent method, we design a multi-block optimization algorithm to tackle the non-convex problem. In particular, the optimal IRS phase shift, time allocation, transmit power and local computing frequencies of IoT devices are derived in closed-form expressions. Moreover, we further study the joint impact of PEs and THIs on the total computation bits of considered systems, where same methods in the scenario with PEs are used to obtain the optimal IRS phase shift and local computing frequencies of IoT devices, while an approximation algorithm and the variable substitution method are used to acquire the optimal transmit power and time allocation strategy. Finally, numerical results validate that our proposed methods can significantly outperform benchmark methods in terms of total computation bits.},

  abstract     = {Wireless communication networks provide a critical infrastructure, particularly in emergency situations due to disruptive events such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. However, in these kinds of scenarios part of the network may no longer be operational and a traffic hotspot may emerge, which may result in coverage and/or capacity issues. Deploying self-steering drone-mounted base stations offers a potential method to quickly restore coverage and/or provide capacity relief in such situations, but appropriate positioning is crucial in order for a drone base station to be truly effective. Motivated by that challenge, we propose a data-driven algorithm to optimize the position of a drone base station in a scenario with a site failure and emergence of a traffic hotspot. We demonstrate that the use of a drone, when properly positioned, yields significant performance gains, and that our algorithm outperforms benchmark mechanisms in a wide range of scenarios. In addition, we show that our algorithm is able to find a near-optimal position for the drone in a reasonable amount of time, and even has the ability to track the optimal position in case of a moving hotspot.},

Besides, network-agnostic DASH cannot fully harness the potential of slice-enabled 5G and Beyond networks, which can promise minimum rate performance for the i) MEC-empowered cellular base station (BS) to user link, and ii) content delivery network (CDN) to MEC-empowered BS link. In this paper, we show that network-agnostic DASH is incompatible with MEC-empowered edge network caching and network slicing in next generation mobile data networks. Accordingly, we propose joint video bitrate selection and edge network caching when specific rate and cache size guarantees can be provided along the end-to-end content delivery path. By formulating the aforementioned problem as a dynamic program (DP), we present an exhaustive (brute-force) search algorithm to optimally solve it and derive an exact algorithm of polynomial time to avoid unnecessary recalculations of previously visited solution branches. Through extensive experimental results we assess the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it against other solutions, aiming to draw valuable insights for algorithmic design tailored to MEC-empowered slice-enabled mobile data networks.},

By offloading tasks to the edge servers or vehicles in the neighbourhood, vehicular edge computing (VEC) provides a cost-efficient solution to this problem. However, the channel state information and network structure in the vehicular network varies fast because of the inherent mobility of vehicle nodes, which brings an extra challenge to task offloading. To address this challenge, we formulate the task offloading in vehicular network as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose a novel road side unit (RSU)-assisted learning-based partial task offloading (RALPTO) algorithm. The algorithm enables vehicle nodes to learn the delay performance of the service provider while offloading tasks. Specifically, the RSU could assist the learning process by sharing the learning information among vehicle nodes, which improves the adaptability of the algorithm to the time-varying networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves lower delay and better learning performance compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

Multiple independent sources send update packets to a common destination node in a time-slotted manner under the limit of maximum retransmission rounds. Different multiple access schemes, i.e., time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), are exploited here over a block-fading multiple access channel (MAC). Constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems are formulated to describe the AoI minimization problems considering both transmission schemes. The Lagrangian method is used to convert CMDP problems to unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) problems, and corresponding algorithms are designed to derive the power allocation policies. Also, a suboptimal threshold-based policy is proposed. On the other hand, for the case of unknown environments, two online reinforcement learning approaches considering both multiple access schemes are proposed to achieve near-optimal age performance. Numerical simulations validate the improvement of the proposed policy in terms of weighted sum AoI compared to the fixed power transmission policy and illustrate that NOMA is more favorable in the case of larger packet sizes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge caching has been attracting significant attention, due to the potential of UAVs in delivering prompt content services to users. One of the key issues in UAV-assisted edge caching networks is the unpredictable user requests, which requires dynamic update of cache placement. Moreover, the timescale difference between cache placement strategy with long updating cycle and UAV trajectory planning strategy with short updating cycle makes them difficult to be optimized simultaneously. Against these backdrops, in this article, we consider a UAV-assisted edge caching network, where the UAVs act as aerial base stations (BSs), together with terrestrial BS to provide edge caching services for the mobile users. The user association, UAV cache placement and trajectory planning strategies are jointly optimized to maximize the throughput, while simultaneously satisfying the cache capacity and kinematics constraints of the UAVs. Specifically, we split the optimization problem into a cache placement subproblem in large timescale and a user association and trajectory planning subproblem in small timescale. A double deep Q-network (DDQN) method is adopted to solve the former subproblem, and an attention-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (ATMADDPG) algorithm is utilized to deal with the latter, in which the users and UAVs are regarded as heterogeneous agents to learn the accessing and flying policies for mutual benefits, respectively. Finally, a two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2TDRL) algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve these two subproblems. Through comparisons with the other state-of-art schemes, simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that a well-designed cache placement strategy can increase the throughput by 18.6%.},

The STAR-RIS is considered under energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) protocols to provide simultaneous full-space coverage to both users, but at the expense of inter-user interference (IUI). The paper aims to evaluate the impacts of various practical factors on the system performance, including IUI, quantization errors due to discrete phase shifters of the STAR-RIS, beam misalignment due to highly-directive antennas, and random fog. Thus, it derives accurate expressions for the ergodic capacity, outage probability, and symbol error rate. Numerical and simulation results reveal that the system performance is more severely impacted by beam misalignment and random fog than by other factors. It is also observed that the ES protocol outperforms the MS protocol in the downlink, but the situation is reversed in the uplink due to coupled phase shifts. Moreover, in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime, the system performance is restricted due to IUI signals.},

In addition, hybrid beamforming can greatly reduce the power consumption by limiting the number of radio frequency chains. To achieve higher energy efficiency (EE) of a wireless network, it is of practical interest to incorporate hybrid beamforming into CF-mMIMO systems to fully utilize their combined benefits. Moreover, user-centric scheme is considered so that idle access points (APs) can be turned into sleep mode for energy saving. In this paper, we formulate the EE maximization problem where user-AP association, hybrid beamformers and AP selection are jointly optimized with a realistic power consumption model. Due to the binary variables involved, the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Given this setup, we first exploit the strong coupling between binary variables and continuous beamformers, then a group sparse beamforming method is used to induce group-sparsity of beamformers, and finally the original problem is transformed into a more tractable one. To reduce complexity, we propose another low-complexity method to solve the original problem by using an alternate optimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {The clustered property among sparse weight vector is prevalent in applications such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. To address this, block structure has been utilized to capture the clustered information expressed by the continuity of nonzero elements in a sparse weight vector. However, many compressive sensing (CS)-based methods exploit inter-block sparsity while ignoring intra-block correlations. Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based methods with parameterized distribution provide a flexible approach for handling block structures, but most of them assume known block partitioning. In addition, off-grid problem and multi-measurement vector (MMV) scenario are also common and challenging issues in CS-based methods. In this work, we fully utilize the potential clustered structure in the sparse solution of DOA estimation and derive a structure-aware SBL framework (SASBL) in MMV scenarios. The structure-aware matrix characterizes the correlation within each block, and the weight vector can describe the inter-block sparsity. A new learning rule for the weight vector is derived based on the Majorization-Minimization algorithm. Furthermore, the off-grid parameter is incorporated into the SASBL framework to obtain higher DOA estimation resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SASBL outperforms subspace-based, typical SBL-based, off-grid SBL-based and gridless methods.},

  abstract     = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks have recently been regarded as a promising solution to provide ubiquitous user access and flexible content delivery. To meet the increasing demands of satellite services, multipath routing is leveraged to transmit each flow via multiple transmission paths concurrently. However, dynamically changed satellite topologies have brought challenges to multipath route planning and traffic splitting among different paths. Thus, in the paper, we propose a GNN-enabled Multipath Routing (GMR) scheme to maximize the network efficiency. Particularly, we firstly formulate the mutipath routing issue as a stochastic optimization problem under the bandwidth limitation and flow conservation constraint, and further present a Link Disjoint Multipath Routing (LDMR) scheme for the central route calculation, where available transmission paths and uneven traffic density are jointly considered to maximize the link utilization. Then, to balance the load distribution of different paths, a GNN-based MultiPath Traffic Engineering (GNN-MPTE) algorithm is designed for dynamic flow splitting based on estimated path quality. Finally, we implement the proposed GMR scheme and corresponding algorithms in Network Simulator NS-3 and make comparisons with other benchmarks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN-MPTE can be extended to arbitrary inclined/polar orbit constellations without repetitive training, and significantly prompt the transmission quality including average delay, throughput, and flow completion ratio.},

Deep learning (DL) based methods can compress the CSI at the UE and recover it at the BS, which reduces the feedback cost significantly. But the compressed CSI must be quantized into bit streams for transmission. In this paper, we propose an adaptor-assisted quantization strategy for bit-level DL-based CSI feedback. First, we design a network-aided adaptor and an advanced training scheme to adaptively improve the quantization and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, for easy practical employment, we introduce the expert knowledge of data distribution and propose a pluggable and cost-free adaptor scheme.

The average spectrum efficiency (ASE) and average BER (ABER) of the AM schemes are analyzed for theoretical performance evaluation. Closed-form SE and BER are developed to facilitate the designs of switching thresholds of the AM schemes. For the AM scheme with the instantaneous BER (IBER) constraint (referred to as AM-IBER), the lower switching threshold of each fading region is obtained by setting the corresponding IBER equal to the target BER. The resulting ABER of the AM-IBER is lower than the target BER by a large margin resulting in the loss of SE. Considering this reason, the AM schemes with the ABER constraint (referred to as AM-ABER) and the corresponding switching thresholds optimization are studied. The optimization problem for maximizing the SE under the ABER constraint is formulated. The Lagrange multiplier method is employed to solve the problem yielding a procedure to design the optimal thresholds, and the corresponding existence condition is developed. Due to a two-layer iteration in the optimal design procedure, a lower-complexity suboptimal threshold design is introduced, which requires only a single-layer iteration and has small performance loss. Simulation results show that the derived theoretical performance expressions for all the proposed schemes are all effective, and the system with the AM schemes can achieve high SE while meeting the target BER. Moreover, using the obtained optimal and suboptimal thresholds, the system with AM-ABER has a higher SE than that with the AM-IBER.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the multi-target tracking (MTT) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated in the presence of jammers, where UAVs in the swarm communicate with each other to exchange information of targets during tracking. The communication between UAVs suffers from severe interference, including inter-UAV interference and jamming, thus leading to a deteriorated quality of MTT. To mitigate the interference and achieve MTT, we formulate an interference minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV&#39;s sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, subject to the constraint of MTT, collision prevention, flying ability, and UAV energy consumption. Due to the multiple coupling of sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, the proposed optimization problem is NP-hard. To solve this challenging problem, it is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., target association, path plan, and power control. First, a cluster-evolutionary target association (CETA) algorithm is proposed, which involves dividing the UAV swarm into multiple sub-swarms and individually matching these sub-swarms to targets. Second, a jamming-sensitive and singular case tolerance (JSSCT)-artificial potential field (APF) algorithm is proposed to plan trajectory for tracking the targets. Third, we develop a jamming-aware mean field game (JA-MFG) power control scheme, where a novel cost function is established considering the total interference. Finally, to minimize the total interference, a dynamic collaboration approach is designed. Different from traditional alternative iteration algorithms, our proposed dynamic collaboration approach triggers the updates of the sub-swarm division and UAV trajectory, and periodically updates the transmission power. Simulation results validate that the proposed dynamic collaboration approach reduces average total interference, tracking steps, and target switching times by 28%, 33%, and 48%, respectively, comparing to existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Rapid beam alignment is required to support high-gain millimeter wave (mmW) communication links between a base station (BS) and mobile users (MU). The standard IEEE 802.11ad protocol enables beam alignment at the BS and MU through a lengthy beam training procedure accomplished through additional packet overhead. However, this results in reduced latency and throughput. Auxiliary radar functionality embedded within the communication protocol has been proposed in prior literature to enable rapid beam alignment of communication beams without the requirement of channel overheads. In this work, we propose a complete architectural framework of a joint radar-communication wireless transceiver wherein radar-based detection of MU is realized to enable subsequent narrow beam communication. We provide a software prototype implementation with transceiver design details, signal models and signal processing algorithms. The prototype is experimentally evaluated with realistic simulations in free space and Rician propagation conditions and demonstrated to accelerate the beam alignment by a factor of four while reducing the overall bit error rate (BER) resulting in significant improvement in throughput with respect to standard 802.11ad. Likewise, the radar performance is found to be comparable to commonly used mmW radars.},

NC detection using differential phase shift keying is the utilized detection technique in this system. It has the advantage that no channel state information (CSI) is required in the APs for signal reception, so it is beneficial with respect to coherent massive MIMO in stringent scenarios where channel state information has very low quality. Additionally, it outperforms the single-AP NC massive SIMO due to the increased number of antennas to average the received signal. The distribution of the received symbol of the NC multi-AP processing is analytically derived to show that several geographically distributed antennas result in a distribution with smaller variances. Several AP selection techniques to maximize the performance and minimize the complexity of the scheme are also proposed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the analysis and to show that the proposal outperforms both the coherent CF schemes in scenarios with stringent conditions and the single-AP NC massive SIMO.},

By applying the unified expressions, we analyze the BER performance in different IRS transmission schemes: intelligent transmission, where the phases of the fading channels are known at the IRS; transmission with imperfect phase shifts, where the phases are partially known and/or the IRS is able to apply discrete phase shifts; and blind transmission, where the phases are unknown at the IRS. The preciseness of the expressions is then verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Although an IRS with blind transmission achieves a higher BER, it can be a promising candidate for low-cost and low-data rate communications through an ambient IRS that does not require implementation complexity and channel estimation overhead.},

Both multilevel coding (MLC) and bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) based approaches are considered. For the transceiver implementation, a polar code construction method based on mutual information equivalence is first presented, followed by several well-designed index mapping lookup tables to ensure equal activation probabilities for each subcarrier.

Subsequently, the multi-stage collaborative receiver structure is described, along with a bit log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation method.

  abstract     = {The cell-free network is regarded as an enabling technology for alleviating inter-cell interference due to its user-centric network paradigm. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are used to assist cell-free networks in improving network capacity at a low cost. However, only half-space coverage can be achieved by RISs. With the unique capability of extending half-space coverage to full-space coverage, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) is emerged as an attractive technology. Motivated by this distinctive characteristic, multiple STAR-RISs deployed in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free systems to assist users in downlink transmission are investigated in this paper. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) via joint optimization of association indicators, active beamforming vectors at mmWave base stations (MBSs) as well as transmission and reflection beamforming vectors of STAR-RISs, while the limits of STAR-RIS-user association, each MBS maximum transmit power as well as passive coefficients of STAR-RISs ought to be satisfied. To handle the non-convex problem, we develop the Lagrangian dual transform (LDT)-quadratic transform (QT)-based algorithm. To be specific, the LDT and QT are utilized for reformulating the non-convex problem as a more solvable equivalent one, afterwards, the transformed problem is decomposed into five subproblems via the alternating optimization (AO) method. Particularly, the solutions of association indicators, active beamforming vectors, and passive beamforming vectors are obtained through the linear conic relaxation (LCR)-based association scheme, the rank-one relaxation approach as well as the penalty-based norm approximation algorithm, respectively. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can obtain better WSR performance over benchmarks. Some useful guidances are also provided for mmWave cell-free systems.},

In this article, a sensing-aided beam alignment scheme and corresponding resource allocation algorithm for the multi-user system is proposed. Specifically, the base station senses the angle of departure (AoD) of each user and performs beam alignment based on obtained AoDs in a time-divisional manner. Then, to reduce the effect of beam misalignment caused by sensing errors, a projected gradient descent algorithm based on Monte Carlo estimation is proposed to solve the non-convex and non-closed optimization problem for power allocation among users. Moreover, aiming to obtain the optimal trade-off between communication and sensing, a method for time interval allocation is developed. The proposed scheme can match the communication power allocated to each user with the estimation accuracy of its AoD, which can improve the achievable sum communication rate in the case of imperfect beam alignment.

  abstract     = {Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by 17.1% and 55.9% when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), with its capability of passively beamforming, has aroused a surge of interest in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the joint phase alignment and phase quantization on RIS discrete phase shift designs for RIS-assisted single-input single-output (SISO) system. Firstly, the phenomena of phase distribution in far and near fields of RIS are differentiated. Then, for the purpose of phase alignment, the phase distribution law and its underlying degree-of-freedom (DoF) are analyzed, serving as the guideline of phase quantization strategies. Subsequently, two phase quantization methods, i.e., dynamic threshold phase quantization (DTPQ) and equal interval phase quantization (EIPQ), are proposed to optimize RIS phase shift discretization so as to strengthen the beamforming. DTPQ evidences its capability of achieving the optimal discrete phase alignment with a linear complexity, whilst EIPQ is a simplified method yielding sub-optimal solution yet with a constant complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed methods provide substantial improvements on power gain, stability, and robustness over traditional quantization method. In addition, as a product of RIS beamforming, the path loss (PL) scaling law under discrete phase shifts for RIS channel is unveiled for the first time. The field trials conducted at 2.6GHz and 35 GHz validate the favourable performance of the proposed methods in practical communication environment. This work may provide reference for the beamforming design of RIS-assisted links, especially in the near field.},

However, in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, the link blockage caused by obstacles and the severe path loss greatly impair the freshness of information received by the user equipments (UEs). In this article, we focus on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted mmWave communications, where beamforming is performed at transceivers to provide directional beam gain and a RIS is deployed to combat link blockage. We aim to maximize the system sum rate while satisfying the information freshness requirements of UEs by jointly optimizing the beamforming at transceivers, the discrete RIS reflection coefficients, and the UE scheduling strategy. To facilitate a practical solution, we decompose the problem into two subproblems. For the first per-UE data rate maximization problem, we further decompose it into a beamforming optimization subproblem and a RIS reflection coefficient optimization subproblem. Considering the difficulty of channel estimation, we utilize the hierarchical search method for the former and the local search method for the latter, and then adopt the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to alternately solve them. For the second scheduling strategy design problem, a low-complexity heuristic scheduling algorithm is designed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the system sum rate while satisfying the information freshness requirements of all UEs.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive kernel-based least mean square algorithm called (KLMS) is proposed for antenna array beamforming. It can be implemented for constant or varying channel situations. The KLMS algorithm convergence is analyzed and the stability condition related to the step size value is obtained. The performance of the KLMS algorithm is evaluated in terms of mean square error (MSE), error vector magnitude (EVM), and beam pattern. The effects of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), number of interferences, the difference between the arriving angles of desired and interfering signals, and fading channel on the performance are investigated for an 8-element mutually coupled array antenna. The results are compared with those of the LMS, normalized LMS (NLMS), and constraint stability LMS (CSLMS) algorithms. It is shown that the KLMS algorithm outperforms the other algorithms significantly. We investigate two use-cases including hybrid beamforming and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in the 5G communication systems. Instead of maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE), the MSE is used to minimize the estimation error as a performance metric, where the problem is solved by iterative KLMS algorithm in lieu of alternating optimization. The SE of the proposed KLMS hybrid beamforming has superior performance in partially-connected (PC) structure systems and appropriate performance in fully-connected (FC) structure with low computational complexity. Moreover, the packet error rate (PER) and bit error rate (BER) performances of beamforming in V2V communications are evaluated for a link V2V communication with known locations of vehicles and phase errors stemming from Doppler shifts, position error, and beam unlock.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand of various applications in vehicular adhoc network (VANET) makes multicast routing as communication imperative. It is observed from the literature that the existing multicast routing techniques such as spanning trees, dynamic source routing, etc., do not have a predetermined source node due to VANET challenges such as high mobility, frequent disconnections, etc. Further, the creation and the maintenance of minimum cost spanning trees (source or core-based) are not efficient due to the frequent topology changes in VANET. In this paper, we proposed many-to-many multicast communication protocol, CDSPAN: A Collaborative Distributed SPANner backbone for multiple source multicast routing, is divided into three modules: (i) the multicast groups are created using clustering techniques, (ii) the subgraphs are formed using a geometric $t$ -spanner, and (iii) the shortest optimum path is identified using a distributed method. CDSPAN updates the route locally avoiding spanner maintenance overhead and increases scalability. CDSPAN is tested in simulation and in real time (VANET testbed) as well. From the simulation results, it is evident that the CDSPAN achieves significant performance improvement (in terms of average delay, reliability, and packet loss ratio) than the recent existing works such as adaptive distributed tree-based multicast routing protocol (DTMR) and delay efficient multicasting based on parked vehicles, fog computing, and software defined networking (SDN) in vehicular networks (DMPFS). From the real-time results, it is found that the CDSPAN outperforms DTMR in many to many multicast communication.},

In particular, we are interested in the HRIS that has the capability of reflecting and sensing the impinging signals. Our objective is to jointly design the pilot sequences transmitted by user equipments (UEs) and the amount of phase shifts applied by the HRIS for accurate channel estimation. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem in terms of the mean squared errors of UEs-to-RIS and RIS-to-base station (BS) channels, and approximate it by assuming that the BS has a perfect estimate of the UEs-to-RIS channel. As a result, a sufficient condition is derived for a feasible solution to be Pareto-optimal to the approximated problem, which simultaneously achieves the Cramér-Rao bounds. We propose two joint designs that satisfy the sufficient condition when the pilot length is at least as long as the product of the numbers of HRIS elements and UEs. The proposed design solutions are easy to implement and lead to computationally efficient channel estimations. The average performances of the proposed designs are analyzed under Rayleigh fading. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint designs outperform non-joint designs that use randomized phase shifts and conventional channel estimation methods for passive RISs.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the problem of information leakage when using the ISAC waveforms to sense the surroundings, thereby posing a risk for potential eavesdropping. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided beamforming design for physical-layer security enhancement in the ISAC system. Considering that an eavesdropper (EVE) possibly appears in a certain region and the wireless channel associated with the EVE is unknown, an approximate ergodic achievable secrecy rate (EASR) is derived mathematically. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the approximate EASR, while ensuring the minimum communication performance requirement for the legitimate user and the minimum sensing performance requirement for the target. To solve the non-convex problem, a novel optimization approach is developed to alternatively obtain the solutions of the transmit beamformer, the covariance matrix of the artificial noise (AN), the RIS phase-shift matrix, and the receive beamformer. Specifically, the first two are optimized by constructing a lower-bound surrogate function of the original objective. The RIS phase-shift matrix is optimized by designing a successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach. The receive beamformer is optimized by solving a Rayleigh-quotient subproblem. Finally, the overall optimization algorithm is designed and theoretically proved to be convergent. Simulation results validate the tightness of the approximate EASR, and show that our proposed design outperforms the existing benchmarks in terms of the security or sensing performance.},

The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is connected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul links. The HAPS, equipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to the users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each ground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas, but directly serves the users through the RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the network-wide throughput, subject to HAPS payload connectivity constraint, HAPS and BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine the user-association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via HAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach, where the user-association is determined using a combination of integer linear programming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming strategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach. The simulations illustrate the appreciable gain of our proposed algorithm, and highlight the prospects of augmenting the ground networks with beamforming-empowered HAPS for connecting the unconnected, and super-connecting the connected.},

The tractable results empower the asymptotic outage analyses, which are conducted not only to reveal helpful insights into understanding the impact of spatial correlation, but also enable optimal power allocation strategies to enhance the system performance under both transmission modes. Numerical results validate the tightness and effectiveness of the closed-form expressions.

Despite minimizing the majority of antenna ground, the proposed structure provides a high-gain, low back-radiation elevational-scanning multibeam that covers the entire azimuth plane and upward elevational-plane for ensuring reliable and simultaneous UAM communications with multiple targets in three-dimensional air-space. The structure is constructed from eight branches of spoof-surface-plasmon-polariton (SSPP)-based LWA. By generating even-mode SSPP propagation with dual-peak field intensity for exciting dual-fed circular patches, proposed LWA in each branch achieves a low back-radiation fan-beam toward antenna perpendicular direction while minimizing the ground area. 360° azimuth coverage with eight 12°–beamwidth segments is then achieved by simultaneously exciting the annular array of proposed SSPP-based LWA. The proposed structure is investigated numerically and experimentally, which exhibits 10-dB impedance bandwidth (BW) of 52.52–67.86 GHz (25.5%) and 52.33–68.7 GHz (27.1%), respectively. High-gain multibeam-scanning ability for covering 22–57° in elevation plane is achieved with maximum peak gain of 12 dBi at 61 GHz and θ = 27°. While exhibiting high-gain multibeam radiation with low back-radiation, proposed design still remains a large ground clearance of 85% non-copper area, which makes the geometry appropriate for fluent installation and effective surface mounting of electronic components.},

Its task is to minimize the vehicle&#39;s fuel consumption along a predicted driving mission by calculating the distribution of the driver&#39;s power request between the electrical and the combustive part of the powertrain, and by choosing the driving mode, which depends on the vehicle&#39;s clutch state. The inclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not trivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer program as a consequence. Using Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle and a simplified vehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical power request $P_\text{crit}$ exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode. Based on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine $P_\text{crit}$ during the operation of the vehicle. The learning algorithm is incorporated into a multi-level controller structure and the working principle of the resulting multi-level learning-based model predictive controller is analyzed in detail using three realistic driving missions. A comparison to the solution obtained by Dynamic Programming reveals that the proposed controller achieves close-to-optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Rail transit is a commonly used mode of transportation for daily commuting, but traditional Rail Transit Systems (RTS) typically face significant challenges such as high mobility and low latency. Furthermore, the RTS generates a substantial volume of real-time interactive data, posing difficulties in ensuring user privacy while maintaining practicality. To address these concerns, blockchain as a promising technology, has been leveraged to safeguard data transmission and access. However, public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may not be suitable for real-time interactive RTS scenarios due to their lack of flexibility and control. To overcome this, the notion of the Policy-Driven Blockchain (PDB) was introduced, which is a private blockchain with flexible policy control and management mechanisms. PDB can be quickly customized and deployed according to specific business requirements and rules, making it a valuable feature for RTS scenarios. However, their scheme relies on bilinear pairings, which incurs high computational overhead and does not support batch validation. In this article, we propose a Lightweight Policy-Driven Blockchain (LPDB) scheme to overcome these challenges, the core of which is the design of a Pairing-free Policy-Driven Signature (PFPDS) scheme better tailored to meet the specific requirements in RTS. In addition, considering the large number of communication messages in RTS, we analyze the advantages of batch verification of signatures. In conclusion, the security of our proposal is validated under the random oracle model, and we evaluate the computational expenses associated with the algorithms via simulations on a laptop. The implementation outcomes demonstrate the practicality and viability of our scheme.},

For millimeter-wave radar performance to meet the stringent requirements of forward-looking imaging, conventional processing of a single sensor by straightforward scaling of the radar parameters is often restricted. Here, this paper presents an effective and high accuracy settlement for forward-looking imaging acquisition in spatial distributed radar system. Firstly, we construct a joint angle-range complex signal model for multiple-input multiple-output scheme, and propose the joint Bayesian matching pursuit (jBMP) algorithm to employ sparse sensing-based estimation of unsynchronized nodes. Our primary goal is to find a global minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator involving Bernoulli-Gaussian variables, and to adopt the general linear fusion rule for the distributed Bayesian structure. The uniqueness of the solution lies in the fact that the associated support set obtained through greedy search is globally shared by all nodes. Finally, a series of simulation and real data obtained from the distributed radar systems is presented to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Fault detection is not only a useful approach to guarantee the safety of a vehicle platooning system but also an indispensable part of functional safety for future connected automated vehicle development. This article mainly concentrates on the network-based fault detection problem of a vehicle platoon with undirected topologies under a periodic event-triggered strategy (PETS). Firstly, we present a periodic event-triggered fault detection filter to generate a residual signal for this vehicle platoon subject to actuator faults and external disturbances, where PETS is employed to reduce bandwidth utilization and save communication resources. Secondly, by using the network-based fault detection filter, the vehicle platooning system, and a fault weighting system, a residual system is developed to formulate the design of the fault detection filter problem as an $H_{\infty }$ problem. Thirdly, based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the residual system fulfills asymptotic stability with $H_\infty$ performance, together with a threshold is also designed for each vehicle to judge whether the fault happens or not. Finally, numerical examples and field experiments are conducted to verify our findings.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) mainly rely on sensor data and are anticipated to transform the transportation sector. The abnormal sensor readings generated by malicious cyberattacks or defective vehicle sensors can result in deadly crashes. This paper proposes a Sensor Attack Detection and Classification (SADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment to examine the cybersecurity concern for AVs against sensor attacks. The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector&#39;s results. The PAC algorithm classifies malicious sensors by analyzing different strategies: instant, constant, bias, and gradual drift. The results show that the SADC framework has a 0.98% higher accuracy than the existing counterparts in detecting attacks and classifying them efficiently..},

It maintains a global view of functional units, allowing them to be updated, replaced, and reconnected so that road vehicles obtain or lose capabilities. While the ASOA lives up to expectations regarding reliability and real-time behavior, it lacks a security concept and, therefore, cannot be safely deployed in automotive systems. This work presents a security process to protect ASOA-based communication from compromise and prevent passenger harm. We propose annotating dataflows with security attributes in a web-based architecture design tool and introducing a central component responsible for converting the communication model into tokens securely distributed to ASOA services. They enable secure communication among components while preserving the desired loose coupling, a critical factor for cost-effective system maintainability. Moreover, we support shielded and technically constrained devices in a heterogeneous domain or zonal vehicle network. After formally verifying our token distribution protocol, we evaluate our security process in a self-driving vehicle and prove that it imposes only negligible overhead during operation.},

DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this article, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.},

First, a novel bandwidth occupancy-aware event-based communication mechanism is devised to schedule T2T information exchanges. Two salient features of the mechanism lie in the awareness of the real-time bandwidth occupancy and the inclusion of the historically transmitted train data in determining the communication events. In this way, the limited communication resource can be occupied in a more intelligent and flexible manner. Then, a bandwidth parameter-dependent co-design approach is proposed for each train to determine the desired cruise controller gains and event scheduler parameters. Furthermore, it is shown that under the designed cruise controllers, the follower trains can maintain the desired gap reference from their predecessors and keep the same speed profile with the leader train, while simultaneously realizing promising communication resource efficiency. Finally, several case studies are performed to validate the efficacy of the co-design approach.},

To avoid such traffic accidents, automatic height measurement system for height restriction bars is urgently required. To accurately measure the height, the location of the height restriction bar should be detected first. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no professional algorithm and relevant dataset for height restriction bar detection. Therefore, in this work, we elaborately collect a novel dataset for height restriction bars, named as HRB22, which comprises more than 8600 images covering various types of height restriction bars in different natural scenes. This dataset could serve as a catalyst for promoting many vision tasks, e.g., segmentation and height estimation, etc. As we know, the height restriction bar is usually thin and has long boundary. Therefore, a deformable module is proposed based on the modulated deformable convolution to facilitate the learning of these features. In order to satisfy the real-time detection requirement for driving, the proposed feature learning module is integrated into the backbone of YOLOv5s. A variety of experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and deformable module. In addition, the proposed method is tested on a common object detection dataset MS-COCO, which illustrates the generalization of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.},

While charging stations can replenish the battery, they are not as widely deployed as gas stations, causing the battery depletion of EVs. This paper presents a novel optimal charging strategy for EV long-range driving. The strategy offers EV drivers the optimal charging instructions for a given trip. A new finite-horizon Markov decision process (FH-MDP) problem is formulated to minimize the travel time of an EV while preventing its battery depletion, by optimally selecting the charging stations and charging times along the trip. By confirming the monotonicity and subadditivity of the FH-MDP, we prove the existence of a monotone deterministic Markovian policy for the optimal charging decision and reveal the optimal charging time is monotone regarding the remaining battery level and driven distance. We also reveal that the optimal charging time only changes when either of two thresholds regarding the remaining battery level or driving distance is met. By comparing its state with the thresholds, the EV can make optimal decisions with linear complexity. Simulations corroborate that our algorithm can save travel time by at least 12.6% under our simulation settings, compared to alternative methods.},

In the proposed approach, the raw GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations, inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and visual features are tightly fused in a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework. To fully explore the accuracy potential of high-precision GNSS carrier phase observations in real scenarios, a mixed model which combines ionosphere-free (IF) and time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) formulations is utilized to integrate both single- and dual-frequency carrier phase observations into the system. Both public dataset and real-world experiments covering different GNSS availability conditions are conducted to evaluate the navigation performance of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that our PPP/INS/Vision integration is able to stably achieve sub-meter level navigation in GNSS-hostile environments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a fuel cell system supervisory controller is developed for a fuel cell-based hybrid electric vehicle to safely control the interactions between powertrain components, maximize efficiency and minimize the degradation of the fuel cell. The proposed fuel cell supervisory controller includes three main elements: a state machine, an optimal setpoint generator and a power limit calculator. The state machine, as the top layer of the supervisory controller, is responsible for coordinating the various subsystems of the fuel cell, including the three subsystems, anode, cathode, thermal, and the dc/dc converter. The primary purpose of the state machine is to ensure global control over these subsystems as well as facilitate communication between the fuel cell system, diagnosis system, and Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). The state machine not only allows for the appropriate transitions between states but also governs the fuel cell system operation in all its different operating states such as Start-up, Shutdown and Run. The optimal setpoint generator is responsible for determining the operating conditions of the fuel cell system that maximizes the system&#39;s efficiency. It is designed by taking into account the comprehensive model of the fuel cell stack, considering manufacturing constraints, and incorporating the compressor map which then provides the optimal setpoints for all the subsystems&#39; local controllers. A power limit calculator is also developed to compute the stack available power and feeds this information to the energy management system in the VCU. This information is used by the VCU to split the requested power between the fuel cell and the battery. The experimentally validated stack model and the complex model of the subsystems based on the Inn-Balance project data are used in the simulation. Furthermore, the subsystems&#39; local controllers used in the MATLAB-Simulink were validated in a real vehicle test bench. The Common Artemis 130 km/h Driving Cycle (CADC) for automotive applications is used to verify the proposed fuel cell system supervisory controller in the MATLAB-Simulink environment. The simulation results showed that the proposed control structure functioned properly in the Run mode using this CADC-based load profile.},

This technique is critical to improve the performance of UAVs in environments without prior maps. Specifically, the framework high-level generates a stochastic policy through a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on maximum entropy, which generates a local target based on raw sensor information. Then the low-level motion planner tracks the local goal to generate a smooth trajectory to the final target. Compared with existing end-to-end navigation methods, the proposed navigation framework generates trajectories that are smoother, more energy-efficient and more dynamically feasible. The framework also overcomes the drawback that the mapping and planning methods tend to fall into local minima. Our experiments in a simulated environment with random obstacles demonstrate that RLoPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of navigation success rate and kinematically compliant trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging in unstructured scenarios such as mining sites. Existing studies mainly resort to a heuristic search-based planner to find a feasible trajectory. In the case of the narrow area, the heuristic function of the planner suffers from over-expansion problems, which may result in heavy computation burden and memory usage as well as potential failure. Therefore, a novel trajectory planning approach, namely learning and optimization-based trajectory planning (LOTP), is proposed, which is featured by a hierarchical structure consisting of two modules: (1) path searching, (2) speed profile generation. Firstly, a path searching method based on deep learning and Monte-Carlo tree search is proposed to generate a coarse path connecting starting and terminal points. Then, the path is smoothed using path optimization and provided to the speed-planning module as the reference. Next, a speed planning method based on quadratic optimization is developed, which allows to seek maximum driving comfort and energy saving. Last, extensive simulation experiments were conducted in the real environment of mining sites. The results verified that LOTP enhances the computational efficiency and success rate of path planning and helps generate an optimal speed profile. Furthermore, LOTP exhibits desirable potential for the practical application of autonomous driving at mining sites. Source implementation will be released as an open-source code.},

  abstract     = {It has been widely considered that autonomous aerial drone-delivery will play a key role in next-generation logistics. For enabling robust and reliable autonomous multi-drone aerial package delivery services, the proposed algorithm has to mainly consider two objectives, i.e., (i) the maximization of total number of delivered packages and (ii) the efficient energy utilization which is defined as the energy consumption facilitation for increasing the number of delivered packages while avoiding battery exhaustion. This can be formulated as a kind of scheduling optimization problems, after that, this is re-formulated as a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in order to convert integer programming-based formulation which is hard to solve in polynomial-time into MADRL-based discrete-time sequential decision making over multiple cooperative drones. For the solution approach of MADRL, a novel communication network (CommNet)-based algorithm is designed for multi-drone cooperation in order to optimally achieve our two objectives. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed CommNet-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements in terms of the maximization of total number of delivered packages as well as the efficient energy utilization.},

Firstly, an improved event-triggered mechanism is developed, which significantly reduces the communication and computation resources. Subsequently, an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy fixed-time fault-tolerant control scheme is presented by combining backstepping design. The presented control scheme not only mitigates control system chattering but also eliminates potential singularity issues that may arise during recursive design. It is rigorously demonstrated that the designed controller guarantees all states of the closed-loop attitude control system remain bounded and will converge to a small neighborhood adjacent to the origin in fixed time, regardless of the initial conditions, while excluding Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control methodology are shown through the comparative numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform is especially suited for joint sensing and communication applications and has raised attention for radar-driven applications as well. For radar applications, the signal bandwidth determines the achievable range resolution, however, a large signal bandwidth also entails a large sampling frequency that is costly in terms of energy consumption and chip area. Hence, methods for reducing the sampling frequency have become an interesting field of research. In this work, a novel method referred to as Doppler aliasing (DA) - OFDM (DA-OFDM) is proposed, which allows for reducing the sampling frequency, while still benefiting from the same range resolution the entire signal bandwidth offers. This is achieved by allowing for systematic aliasing of the originally orthogonal subcarriers due to undersampling in the receiver. However, by properly modulating the transmit signal, these subcarriers become separable in the receiver in the Doppler domain. This work contains the derivation of the DA-OFDM waveform, a detailed analysis, radar measurement results, the derivation of a suitable communication receiver signal processing scheme, and bit error ratio (BER) simulation results. The latter one will verify the suitability of DA-OFDM for joint sensing and communication applications compared to, e.g., stepped-carrier OFDM.},

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as an important application of vehicular technology, is an emerging research intention. While the decentralization and high efficiency are in line with the needs of IoV, the dependable information transmission asks for a new kind of cryptography urgently. Despite the fact that a slew of related researches are designed, schemes may be vulnerable to privacy leakage, identity tracing, high computation overheads and so on. Therefore, it is urgent to propose a more secure and efficient scheme against various attacks. In this paper, an efficient authenticated key agreement scheme, titled as STCLA, is designed for fog-based IoV, adopting certificateless cryptography. Specifically, STCLA is based on efficient elliptic curve cryptographic technology and adopts pseudonym identity for user anonymity. Then, it is proved secure under random oracle model and is confirmed using Scyther tool. Further, the performance assessment is incorporated at last. Compared with several related schemes, STCLA can satisfy both security and efficiency at the same time.},

  abstract     = {With an increasing number of interconnected vehicles, it has become easier for an attacker to gain remote access to in-vehicle buses like CAN and, hence, security measures become necessary. However, most existing attempts to secure CAN either modify the hardware, which leads to increased costs, or apply encryption/authentication, which negatively impacts the timing behavior on the bus. In particular, when using authentication, new data (i.e., an authentication tag) is added, resulting in larger payloads. As a consequence, multiple CAN frames need to be sent (instead of only one) for each message, introducing extra delays and potentially leading to deadline misses. To address this problem, we propose a safety/security co-design approach based on combining a technique we call periodically authenticated encryption (PAE) with plausibility checks. The main idea is to not authenticate each and every message transmitted on CAN, but only with a certain configurable frequency. This way, less authentication tags are sent, which reduces the overhead. Plausibility checks are then used to determine whether non-authenticated messages sent in between two authenticated ones have been altered by an attack, e.g., whether the transmitted values exceed a given range or do not match previous ones. We then illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach on two realistic case studies consisting of emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.},

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed two spatial consistency (SC) procedures – SC-A and SC-B – as part of its popular TR 38.901 model for 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz channels. In this paper, we perform a comparison of the two procedures with measurements to determine whether the procedures accurately fit our measurements. We use over 700 channel measurements collected with our high-resolution 28 GHz and 60 GHz directional channel sounders, across two indoor and three outdoor environments and for pedestrian and vehicular motion. We show that SC-A – a fully deterministic procedure – provides a much better approximation to the measured channel in all five environments than SC-B – a fully stochastic procedure. We also computed the correlation distance for both procedures – the distance over which they are valid – showing that SC-A&#39;s average correlation distance across all environments of 13.4 m is more than twice as long as SC-B&#39;s of 6.28 m, and that the channel is spatially consistent for significantly longer outdoors than indoors.},

Supporting many XR users per cell requires highly efficient radio solutions.

We propose an enhanced channel quality indicator (CQI) that allows controlling the number of failed CBGs per transport block (TB) to its near-optimal value, as compared to using legacy CQI schemes that correspond to 10% TB error rates. We present both an analytical analysis of the related problems and solutions, as well as an extensive dynamic system-level performance assessment, to document the performance benefits of our proposals. Our results show an increased XR system capacity of 17% to 33% as compared to what can be supported by current 5G systems with baseline CQI schemes.

In this contact we may exploit the sparsity of the THz channel, which substantially reduces the hardware complexity, since a single RF chain is capable of designing a near-optimal transmit beamformer in a single-carrier single-user THz system. We then reveal the spatial orthogonality experienced in the downlink of a single-carrier THz broadcast system supporting multiple users. The minimum throughput of the users is maximized by specifically designing the hybrid beamformer. Based on the above-mentioned angular orthogonality, we characterise the asymptotically optimal structure of the hybrid beamformer. Specifically, the asymptotically optimal analog beamformer is represented in closed-form, while its asymptotically optimal digital counterpart is formulated by solving a linear-programming problem. As a special example, the asymptotically optimal hybrid beamformer is also obtained in closed-form for a THz multicast system. Moreover, we obtain the closed-form asymptotically optimal hybrid beamformer of a multi-carrier multi-user system, when we maximize the minimum throughput among all the user. Our numerical results explicitly demonstrate the compelling benefits of our hybrid beamforming design.},

In this context, we study the performance of VANETs by deriving approximate outage probability and average achievable rate expressions using tools from stochastic geometry. We compare between the usage of networked tethered flying platforms (NTFPs) and traditional roadside units (RSUs). On the other hand, the rapid increase of smart devices in vehicles and the upcoming urban air mobility (UAM) vision will congest the spectrum and require increased data rates. Hence, we use non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve spectral efficiency and compare its performance to orthogonal access schemes. Furthermore, we utilize millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies for high data rates and implement a sectored beamforming model. We extensively study the system using three transmission schemes: direct, relay, and hybrid transmission. The results show that when acting as relays, NTFPs outperform RSUs for larger distances between the transmitting and the receiving vehicles, while RSUs outperform NTFPs for short distances. However, NTFPs are the best solution when acting as a source. Moreover, we find that, in most cases, direct transmission is preferred to achieve a high rate compared to other schemes. Finally, the results are summarized in two tables that provide insights into connecting VANETs by selecting the most suitable platform and type of communication for a given set of parameters, configurations, and requirements.},

Unlike P-HEVs, HEVs have a small battery capacity and need to charge the battery in advance, and in cold weather, engine coolant needs to be heated in advance. If the engine coolant temperature is not sufficiently high, the heating of cabin may be turned off during ZEZ driving. Therefore, We propose a power management control algorithm that satisfies the battery state of charge and engine coolant temperature requirements while maximizing energy efficiency. The proposed controller is divided into a planning part that generates optimal reference based on navigation information and model predictive controller part that calculates optimal control inputs to follow the reference. Based on optimal control, the proposed controller satisfies the requirements and shows superior performance in terms of fuel efficiency.},

As an alternative, a method to estimate the fuel consumption over a driving cycle with a closed-form expression is available in the literature, the Fully-Analytical Fuel Consumption Estimation (FACE), reducing the co-optimization to a uni-level problem. This approach was also expanded to Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEV) by introducing theory-based models for the fuel cell system and the electric components, since the latter were oversimplified in the first FACE implementation. However, the resulting expressions were difficult to handle, and the component operating constraints were ignored. This article addresses the problems identified in the first implementation of FACE for FCHEVs, using the 2020 Toyota Mirai as a reference architecture. Simplified models of the powertrain components are introduced, and the steps required for development of a single closed-form expression for the hydrogen consumption are explained. The models are fitted and validated with experimental data obtained with a real vehicle on a roller test bench. The results show that the final model adequately estimates the hydrogen consumption over 5 different homologation cycles in both cold and hot starting conditions, with an overall error RMS of less than four percent.},

  abstract     = {This article assesses the reliability of the linear losses-to-power scaling method of electric drive systems, composed of a permanent magnet synchronous machine and IGBT inverter. The scaling method, which is commonly used in research studies on system-level design, postulates that overall power losses scale linearly to the desired power rating. However, the validity of this assumption is questionable, and it may impact simulation outcomes. To address these issues, the study derives the conditions that must be met for the linear scaling method to be achieved based on the well-known geometric scaling laws of electric machines and information obtained from inverter datasheets. The analysis at component-level indicates that the linear scaling method is effective in predicting efficiency for upscaling cases, with a discrepancy of less than 1%. However, it is found that this method is not appropriate for downscaling scenarios. Despite these limitations, a sensitivity analysis is conducted at system-level to examine the effect of linear losses-to-power scaling on the energy consumption of an electric vehicle, considering power scaling factors of 0.67 and 1.33. The examination compares this effect to different geometric variations of scaled electric machines and different power ratings of inverters, using 12 different standardized driving cycles. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that the difference in terms of energy consumption is within a satisfactory range below 2% for the upscaling and downscaling cases. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method at system-level for fast assessment of energy consumption in the early development phases of electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Electric Road Systems (ERS) are effective charging infrastructures that allows electric vehicles to receive energy while driving. This energy is used both to propel the vehicle and to charge the battery. Sufficient deployment of ERS implies that charging opportunities become greatly increased, allowing for electric vehicles to have smaller batteries and easing some of the problems associated with static fast-charging such as queues and need for large available areas. In this paper a simulation model for a conductive electric road is introduced and experimentally validated on a conductive electric road demonstrator. Two main ERS deployment cases with corresponding traffic flows are simulated: urban and rural. The results show that the urban simulation case has an efficiency of 96.5% and the rural simulation case has an efficiency of 95.7%. For the urban simulation case the impact of traffic intensity and traffic congestion on the ratio of semiconductor losses and resistive losses is evaluated. This evaluation shows that for this type of ERS design semiconductor losses should be considered in future ERS deployments in urban environment where traffic congestion and queues occur. Finally, a system efficiency comparison between the urban and rural simulation cases and a conventional static charger shows that an ERS can provide equivalent or even greater system efficiency than that of a conventional static charger depending on ERS application, deployment and design.},

Since the introduction of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) in the late 90s, researchers in industry and academia have kept striving for continuously enhancing vehicle safety. However, despite significant efforts, the literature shows that a significant number of these endeavors have not advanced beyond theoretical formulations and software simulations. This article presents the testing journey of an individual-wheel-torque-based vehicle stability controller through the major milestones of its development cycle. First, the controller is formulated based on specific vehicle dynamics design requirements. Then, an offline co-simulation is put in place to validate the controller along relevant maneuvers, with the controller running on Matlab-Simulink concurrently with the software Amesim running a 15-dof vehicle model of Siemens&#39; SimRod battery electric vehicle. Next, a real-time co-simulation is achieved, running both the controller and the vehicle model on a real-time platform. Finally, an experimental hardware-in-the-loop setup is built, incorporating a dedicated Electronic Control Unit (ECU), and successfully tested.},

  abstract     = {The energy economy of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) plays a crucial role in determining their practicality, making the optimization of energy management strategies (EMS) essential. Predictive EMS (PEMS) based on future vehicle speed prediction offers great potential for enhancing EMS performance. However, current PEMS prediction models rely on historical speed data or static traffic information, overlooking the impact of real-time traffic conditions. In this article, we introduce a Transformer-based PEMS (TPEMS) that incorporates real-time predicted surrounding traffic information to improve FCEV operational economy. To better predict vehicle speed by accounting for the complex interactions between the controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles, we developed a Transformer network-based predictor, which considers the speed and relative distance of six vehicles surrounding the controlled vehicle, generating speed predictions for the next 10 s. We then employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method as a downstream optimizer, creating a fully data-driven PEMS. For training the TPEMS, we developed a dataset derived from the NGSIM dataset, consisting of numerous driving profile segments that include temporal-sequential characteristics of the controlled vehicle and surrounding traffic. Furthermore, we utilize the SUMO simulator to generate a traffic information-enabled driving profile for performance evaluation. Experimental results reveal our Transformer-based predictor outperforms existing predictors, i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNN), in processing traffic information and achieving improved predictions. The TPEMS enhances the economic efficiency of FCEVs by 4.6% relative to the current state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM)-based PEMS.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an online energy management strategy for mild hybrid electric vehicles is developed to minimize the fuel consumption while simultaneously preventing battery overheating. Since mild hybrids are typically equipped with a passively cooled battery pack, the energy management strategy design needs to keep the battery temperature below an upper limit, preventing accelerated aging and thermal runaway. To address this issue, the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) approach is extended to develop a real-time capable controller, termed thermal ECMS (Th-ECMS), that is sensitive to the thermal dynamics of the battery and that can enforce constraints on its temperature. The rationale for our formulation is based on Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle from optimal control theory. The online Th-ECMS is developed on the basis of the offline version of Th-ECMS, introduced in a previous work. Exploiting the a priori knowledge of the driving mission, the offline Th-ECMS calibrates the equivalence factors and obtains the optimal solution, which is compared with the globally optimal dynamic programming solution. This offline calibration method is run on a large number of driving missions and the collected data is used to train a feed-forward neural network that estimates optimal equivalence factors as functions of the battery state of charge, battery temperature, and distance yet to travel. The trained network is then used to populate two look-up tables mapping the equivalence factors, and implementable on the vehicle electronic control unit. Finally, the online Th-ECMS obtains the equivalence factors through the look-up tables in real-time. The online strategy was tested in four different driving missions, achieving a fuel economy remarkably similar to the optimal solution and successfully avoiding battery overheating.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle teleoperation holds potential applications as a fallback solution for autonomous vehicles, remote delivery services, hazardous operations, etc. However, network delays and limited situational awareness can compromise teleoperation performance and increase the cognitive workload of human operators. To address these issues, we previously introduced the novel successive reference pose tracking (SRPT) approach, which transmits successive reference poses to the vehicle instead of steering commands. This article compares the stability and performance of SRPT with Smith predictor-based approach for direct vehicle teleoperation in challenging scenarios. The Smith predictor approach is further categorized, one with Lookahead driver and second with Stanley driver. Simulations are conducted in a Simulink environment, considering variable network delays (250–350 ms) and different vehicle speeds (14–26 km/h), and include maneuvers such as tight corners, slalom, low-adhesion roads, and strong crosswinds. The results show that the SRPT approach significantly improves stability and reference tracking performance, with negligible effect of network delays on path tracking. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of SRPT in eliminating the detrimental effect of network delays in vehicle teleoperation.},

This framework integrates longitudinal speed planning with lateral lane change decision-making and aims to co-optimize the energy efficiency, driving safety, and travel efficiency. By leveraging traffic information and multi-objective reward functions, the twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) algorithm is employed to train the actor-critic (AC) network which generates both longitudinal and lateral control commands based on its estimation for lane preference score. The proposed strategy is tested in a complex urban scenario based on Simulation Urban Mobility (SUMO) which reflects real urban traffic conditions. Experimental results indicate that the longitudinal speed planning module of the proposed strategy can shorten the travel txime by up to 7.94% or reduce the electricity consumption by 18.15%, depending on the degree of importance placed on economy by the TD3 agent. By integrating the lateral lane decision module, the proposed strategy can further shorten the travel time by 5.7% and save 1.75% energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Even though heavy-duty battery electric trucks (BETs) have become commercially available, their range limitation still hinders widespread adoption. Drayage has been regarded as a suitable application for early BETs due to typically having limited daily mileage. However, drayage operation can vary widely and some form of range extension may still be needed for BETs operating in this application. In this paper, wireless charging at port terminals is proposed for this purpose. Potential wireless charging zones at port terminals are identified, and efficacy of wireless charging to extend BET range in drayage operation is verified by simulating the activity of 20 BETs from a drayage operator serving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, using a microscopic BET energy consumption model. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated for optimal wireless charging zone planning from the port authority&#39;s perspective, considering subsets of the identified zones, and charging power options to choose from, for different budget ranges. In this context, zone planning means determining which areas of the port terminals should be selected for installing wireless charging systems, and what level of charging power should be for each selected zone&#39;s system. For each budget range, the optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithm to determine an optimal zone plan that provides the maximum amount of energy through wireless charging per unit cost of installation. The results show that wireless charging can aid improving activity completion of the simulated fleet by 5%, and further optimizing the zone plan can achieve similar performance with lower cost.},

Integrated photovoltaic (PV) panels on LEVs have great potential because a higher portion of the energy demands can be covered by PV panels compared to heavier vehicles. Integrated PV panels on LEVs are constrained by the surface shape and available area, which results in panels facing different angles. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of such integrated PV panels based on simulations with meteorological data and measurements from a real prototype on an electric scooter. It is shown that the measured PV power correlates well with the simulated data. A number of design options such as the number of PV panels and the angle of the panels are evaluated through simulations and we compare seasonal and regional differences. Based on the assessment, we make design suggestions for cost-effective and energy-efficient integrated PV panels on LEVs. Results indicate that with the right design and favorable circumstances, the integrated PV panels can generate more energy over a day than is consumed by the LEV in one day.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies how the user charging practice affects battery degradation over time. To achieve this objective, a system oriented simplified aging model based on the literature is proposed. The differential calculation of the capacity loss is used for infinitesimal variations. The model inputs are the battery state of charge, the battery temperature and the cumulative number of full equivalent cycles. The output is the battery state of health. This model is identified and validated with experimental aging tests from the Renault Zoe 41 kWh battery manufacturer. The battery model (electro-thermal and aging) interconnects with the vehicle traction model complete the system model. The battery electro-thermal and traction models are also validated with measurements on the studied vehicle. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) formalism organizes in a unified way the interconnections of all the sub-system models. The impact of the charging interval and SoC on the battery aging is then studied. Five charging scenarios are studied by simulation while keeping the driving phases and the charging current the same. In these conditions, the average SoC is the main contributor for the battery aging. Compared to daily charge of the EV, a charge every 4 days extends the time to reach 80% of state of health by 36% due to lower average SoC. The daily driving distance is fixed for every studied scenario.},

  abstract     = {Recently, demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has increased significantly as people are becoming more conscious of the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions. The introduction of multi-motor systems in EVs has brought new challenges in terms of energy efficiency and performance. This paper presents a Multi-Ensemble Learning (MEL)-based approach to design an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a Dual Motor Electric Vehicle (DMEV) where MEL is a new powerful Machine Learning approach implemented using Python programming language. To make our study concrete, we studied a real DMEV that is modeled using Energetic Macroscopic Representation and whose control is simulated using Matlab/Simulink™. The designed EMS aims to distribute the instant torque between the two electric motors in an efficient manner, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption as much as possible. Contrary to existing EMSs, an important advantage of our designed EMS is that it determines the instant torque distribution in real-time (while the vehicle is running), without knowing in advance how physical parameters (such as the speed and traction force) will evolve during the current trip. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model with a significantly lower computational cost while achieving a high degree of accuracy in predicting and allocating torque, and a high degree of performance in terms of energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel approach in electric vehicle technology by combining dual-motor coupling with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using batteries and supercapacitors. This innovation enhances vehicle performance and prolongs battery life. An energy management strategy (EMS) based on Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP) is used to optimize power distribution within the HESS. To improve PMP performance, the proposal integrates driving pattern recognition (DPR) and co-state variable ( $\lambda $ ) control. DPR employs an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for real-time pattern recognition. The process involves creating a sample driving cycle, employing subtractive clustering to establish the original fuzzy inference system (FIS), and fine-tuning FIS parameters through neural network training. $\lambda $ values are updated based on recognition results to adapt control actions for various driving styles. Real-time simulations on Opal-RT reveal significant improvements compared to EMS without DPR. Battery current root mean square and standard deviation decrease by 11.4% and 29.4%, respectively, during the unknown in advance Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle. This adaptable DPR method offers versatility for various EMSs and clarifies the impact of disturbances like supercapacitor size, state of charge variations, and off-road conditions on HESS performance, aiding researchers in designing more efficient systems.},

The model is based on equivalent circuit and formed by behavioural equations to carefully model both conduction and switching losses. As a novelty, transistor power losses due to dynamic ON-state resistance is also included in the model. By comparison with experimental measurements and other available models of the similar type from the literature, it is shown that our model gives accurate results of the power losses and it helps to reduce the error by more than 70%. To accelerate simulation speed, power loss calculation and simulation time-step is decoupled. The power losses are represented in different levels and in the form of mathematical equations and look-up tables in MATLAB/Simulink. It is shown that our approach is able to reduce the simulation time by almost 18 times and maintain the same accuracy. The proposed GaN transistor loss model is finally implemented into a racing vehicle powertrain, where designers can obtain the power losses and temperature of the used power transistors in an easy and rapid way to optimise power electronics design.},

  abstract     = {California has set a goal for all drayage trucks operating in the state to be zero-emitting by 2035. In order to achieve this goal, drayage operators would need to transition 100% of their fleets to zero-emission vehicles such as battery electric trucks (BETs). This article presents an intelligently controlled charging model for BETs that minimizes charging costs while optimizing subsequent tour completion. To develop this model, real-world activity data from a drayage truck fleet operating in Southern California was combined with a two-stage clustering technique to identify trip and tour patterns. The energy consumption for each trip and tour was then simulated for BETs with a battery capacity of 565 kWh using a 150 kW charging power level. Home base charging load profiles were generated using the proposed charging model, subject to constraints of the energy needed to complete the next subsequent tour and Time-of-Use energy cost rates. A sensitivity analysis evaluated three scenarios: a passive scenario with a 5% state-of-charge (SOC) constraint after completing the subsequent tour, an average scenario with a 50% SOC constraint, and an aggressive scenario with an 80% SOC constraint. Results indicated that the 80% SOC constraint scenario achieved the lowest charging cost. However, it also yielded the lowest tour completion rate (51%). In contrast, the 5% SOC constraint scenario registered the highest tour completion rate. These results revealed that 96% of the tours could be successfully completed using the intelligently controlled charging model. The remaining tours were infeasible, indicating that the available time at the home base was inadequate for charging the necessary energy for the next tour. In terms of total costs, the scenario with a 5% SOC constraint resulted in an annual cost of approximately $40,000, whereas the 80% SOC scenario nearly doubled that amount.},

With the development of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, LEO satellites can be used to train a machine learning model collaboratively through DFL. However, due to the energy limitations of the satellites, DFL with satellites has higher requirements on the latency. In this article, we investigate how to minimize the convergence time of DFL with satellites by designing the number of satellites in each orbit and the number of orbits. In addition to considering the total energy cost and the distance constraints in satellite communication, we also consider guaranteeing the DFL performance in the problem of minimizing the convergence time. However, obtaining closed-form solutions to this problem is difficult since the target is non-convex and the performance is hard to evaluate directly. To address these issues, we derive an upper bound on the convergence time and transform it into a quasi-convex function first. Then, we derive the convergence bound of DFL with respect to the number of satellites and orbits. Based on these two bounds, we reformulate the problem and obtain the closed-form expressions of the optimal number of satellites and orbits. Simulation results confirm the impact of these numbers on the convergence time and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

However, owing to limited sensing-computation resource and data security risk, MUs may be unwilling to complete sensing tasks without sufficient incentive. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based contract incentive mechanism is proposed by jointly considering participation contribution and sensing-computation cost of MUs. Specifically, considering the heterogeneous sensing and computation abilities of MUs, we formulate a task-reward contract incentive mechanism to achieve the maximum utility of mobile crowdsourcing platform. Moreover, based on the individual rationality and incentive compatibility constraints, we design the optimal contract under the partial information asymmetry scenario. Furthermore, considering the network dynamics and privacy protection, we formulate the contract incentive problem as an Markov decision process. Due to the high-dimensional continuous action and state spaces, we develop the twin-delayed deep deterministic method to obtain the efficient sensing task and incentive reward policy under complete information asymmetry scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DRL-based contract incentive mechanism.},

To solve the non-convex optimization problem, a Markov decision process is formulated for the resource-limited wireless FL. Moreover, due to the high dimensional continuous action space, a multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (MASD3) method is employed to obtain the optimal DPDMRA strategies. The double actor networks and softmax operator are designed to alleviate the underestimation bias. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL method can obtain the global optimal policy without complete information in the dynamic environment.

Grant-free random access (GFRA) is considered a method to reduce latency, but its performance is limited by the preamble collision caused by orthogonal resource constraints in massive communication scenarios. Due to the signal spatial sparsity of cell-free massive MIMO systems, each user being served by neighbouring access points can reduce mutual interference between collided users. This paper proposes a density-based clustering GFRA collision resolution framework in cell-free mURLLC systems, and the clusters obtained by two-dimensional information of received signal energy and geographic location are used to blind detect users for reliable access.

However, a passive RIS (PRIS) requires a lot of reflecting elements in order to obtain considerable SCAs when attacked systems limit signal leakage to non-target receivers. This puts the PRIS at high risk of being tracked and monitored by enemies. To increase the flexibility of RIS deployment while maintaining a significant attack, this correspondence proposes active RIS (ARIS) to implement SCAs, which is exact opposite to the original intention of proposing ARIS to improve transmission quality. Specifically, with constraints on maximum reflecting amplitude and maximum amplification power, we derive a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) minimization problem. In order to achieve a fast attack, an algorithm with low complexity is proposed to resolve the non-convex problem.

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the rapid development of metamaterials and metasurfaces, the holographic multiple-input and multiple-output surface (HMIMOS) has been regarded as a promising solution for future wireless networks recently. By densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required transmission power under the constraint of all users&#39; quality-of-service (QoS). Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment (UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then, the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other baselines.},

Accordingly, closed-form expressions for the users&#39; outage probability (OP) and throughput are derived in exact, approximate, and asymptotic manners.

Numerical results confirm that: 1) our theoretical analyses exactly match the simulation results; 2) as for OP aspects, RSMA is not fully superior to NOMA in two-user cases, while for multi-users, it only outperforms NOMA in cases where imperfect successive interference cancellation process produces over 10% residual interference; and 3) as for throughput aspects, RSMA achieves the performance superiority over both two- and multi-users scenarios when compared to its counterparts.},

We investigate the mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the active transmit beamforming, the receive equalizer and the passive beamforming at each RIS. Different from prior works, for the sake of reducing both communication overhead and signal processing complexity, we assume that the two RISs utilize the common reflection pattern. Under this assumption, the coupling of the variables becomes tighter, thereby making the optimization problem more challenging to solve. To effectively address this issue, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Numerical results show that in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the double-RIS with common reflection pattern can achieve nearly the same performance as that with separate reflection pattern whereas the complexity is only half of the latter.

  abstract     = {Aiming to expand wireless coverage and connect the unconnected, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have recently been proposed as a promising paradigm to satisfy the high-rate and high-reliability requirements. SAGIN is comprised by satellite, aerial, and terrestrial communication devices. In this article, from the perspective of cooperative communications, we regard the SAGIN as a two-hop relay network with the space-air and air-ground cooperative links. Especially, the location distribution of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as known as the communication relay platforms in the SAGIN system, is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) in a three-dimensional (3D) spherical field. We evaluate the outage performance of SAGIN in the 3D Poisson field and approximate its outage probability in closed form. In addition, the parametric study for the approximation technique used to derive the closed-form expression is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed to verify our outage performance analysis.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable antennas that can dynamically change their operation state exhibit excellent adaptivity and flexibility over traditional antennas, and MIMO arrays that consist of multifunctional and reconfigurable antennas (MRAs) are foreseen as one promising solution towards future Holographic MIMO. Specifically, in pattern reconfigurable MIMO (PR-MIMO) communication systems, accurate acquisition of channel state information (CSI) of all the radiation modes is a challenging task, because using conventional pilot-based channel estimation techniques in PR-MIMO systems incurs overwhelming pilot overheads. In this letter, we leverage deep learning methods to design a PR neural network, which can use the estimated CSI for one radiation mode to infer CSIs for the other radiation modes. In order to reduce the pilot overheads, we propose a new channel estimation method specially for PR-MIMO systems, which divides the transmit antennas of PR-MIMO into groups and antennas in different groups employ different radiation modes. Compared with conventional full-connected real-valued deep neural networks (DNN), the PR neural network which uses complex-valued coefficients can work directly in the complex domain. Experiment results show that the proposed channel extrapolation method offers significant performance gains in terms of extrapolation accuracy over benchmark schemes.},

By jointly optimizing the power allocation coefficients at the access point, the transmit beamforming at the cell-center user and the reflection and transmission beamformings at the STAR-RIS, the total transmit power is minimized. Owing to the non-convexity caused by the coupling of active and passive beamformings, we first decouple it into two sub-problems. Then, the semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation are utilized to resolve them, respectively. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle them iteratively.

  abstract     = {Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication based on 3GPP standard is seen as a promising solution to rolling out communication services in areas without terrestrial base stations. However, due to the fast movement of satellites and large beam footprint size, the existing 5G timing advance (TA) estimation mechanism cannot be directly applied when global navigation satellite system is unavailable. In this article, an enhanced TA estimation approach is proposed for LEO satellite communication networks. Specifically, a user-side time-frequency pre-compensation method is introduced at first, which leverages frequency offset measurement on synchronization signal blocks broadcasted by satellites in initial cell search phase. For the random access phase, the upper bound of inter-preamble interference incurred by partial-period cross-correlation operations is derived for a preamble format advised by 3GPP, and it is shown that the interference level is closely related to the square of the number of such operations. Inspired by this result, a cyclic prefix free preamble format is further designed, which features extended guard time, differential power allocation and flexible preamble structure. Numerical results show that our proposal can reduce the missed detection rate of preamble within a beam. Particularly, the missed detection rates of preamble under 32, 48, and 64 users are lower than 1 $\%$ when SNR = −6 dB, which is a significant improvement compared to baselines. In addition, our proposal can limit the TA estimation error of the detected users to the time length of 25 time-domain sampling points when the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz and operation frequency is 27 GHz.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) has great potential to achieve low latency, high reliability, and low energy consumption. However, in collaborative MEC environments, user movement and task migration may cause task transmission and processing delays, resulting in elevated task response times. Therefore, system performance and user experience need to be ensured by rational task offloading and resource management. At the same time, the protection of user data privacy is becoming increasingly important as a challenge to be overcome. To address the problems of intense resource competition and privacy leakage in MEC, the fed erated learning for the T D3-based task o ffloading (FedTO) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has a dual objective of energy consumption and task response time while protecting user privacy. It employs a cryptographic local model update and aggregation mechanism and uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain an efficient task offloading decision. Based on the mobile trajectories of real devices, and the pre-deployment of base station locations, experimental results show that the FedTO algorithm ensures task data security. It also effectively reduces the total energy consumption and average task response time of the system, which further improves the system utility.},

Such tasks are often represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) consisting of several interdependent subtasks and directed edges. Processing of DAG tasks often needs pooling the computation resources of vehicles. However, the selfishness of vehicles prevents them from sharing their resources. To this end, we propose a Truthful Dynamic Reverse Auction (TDRA) mechanism to motivate vehicles to participate in service provisioning. To realize TDRA, we first propose an enumeration-based allocation strategy to optimally allocate subtasks among vehicles and obtain a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based pricing strategy that can ensure the economic properties of individual rationality and truthfulness. Then, to deal with the high computational complexity of obtaining the optimal solution, we develop a near-optimal Dynamic Bilateral Ranking (DBR) allocation strategy to allocate subtasks within polynomial time and design a critical value-based pricing strategy that can also guarantee the two above-mentioned economic properties. Through simulating real-world movement traces of vehicles, we demonstrate that DBR outperforms the existing benchmarks, and verify our theoretical analysis on the economic properties of our developed pricing strategy.},

Therefore, we construct a framework for air-ground collaborative offloading and content acquisition model first in edge VANETs environment, where users are able to select compute and cache content resources from different edge nodes for edge services. Secondly, we propose a dynamic orchestration algorithm for knowledge graphs of edge services based on multitemporal variable parametric knowledge relations which reduces the interference of redundant information. Then, a non-convex optimization problem is established by considering the system utility function weighted by multiple performance metrics under environmental constraints and different service policies, and the problem is transformed and analyzed by a theoretical perspective using block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation methods to obtain the theoretical solution. In terms of simulation, we propose a knowledge graph-aware air-ground collaborative offloading and content acquisition SAC algorithm in VANETs (VAKOCS) to obtain the simulation solution of the problem and validate the problem in both directions.

Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also emerged as a new paradigm with the goals of enhancing the average sum-rate as well as energy efficiency. By combining these attractive features, an energy-efficient RIS-mounted multiple UAVs (aerial RISs: ARISs) assisted downlink communication system is studied. Due to the obstruction, user equipments (UEs) can have a poor line of sight to communicate with the base station (BS). To solve this, multiple ARISs are implemented to assist the communication between the BS and UEs. Then, the joint optimization problem of deployment of ARIS, ARIS reflecting elements on/off states, phase shift, and power control of the multiple ARISs-assisted communication system is formulated. The problem is challenging to solve since it is mixed-integer, non-convex, and NP-hard. To overcome this, it is decomposed into three sub-problems. Afterward, successive convex approximation (SCA), actor-critic proximal policy optimization (AC-PPO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are employed to solve these sub-problems alternatingly. Finally, extensive simulation results have been generated to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.},

To maximize the long-term net profit of each fog access point (F-AP), we formulate the caching optimization problem and resort to a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To address the impact of file size inconsistency, a ‘pre-split’ mechanism with a dynamic upper limit is adopted to meet the constraint of storage capacity, and a ‘lazy’ updating mechanism is introduced into the training process. Finally, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) based distributed edge caching algorithm is proposed with content recommendation.

We propose a novel interference mitigation technique that jointly considers the satellite network with earth-fixed beamforming capability and the cellular network. The proposed Interference-aware radio resource group sharing mechanism combined with sub-optimal TN and NTN grouping algorithm optimizes the overall system capacity. It also ensures the signal quality over each link operates at an acceptable level. The mechanism demonstrates the feasibility of NTN-TN spectrum sharing and outperforms the baselines with 94% to 138% capacity utility, which is contributed by enhanced 72% TN available bandwidth and 45% to 133% NTN throughput.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of optimally using the relay capabilities of user equipment (UE) to augment the radio access network (RAN) in 5G deployments and beyond. This can be particularly useful in coverage constrained scenarios, such as those using millimeter waves, due to the difficulty radio signals penetrate some structures. This can lead to signal blockages and high penetration losses when providing outdoor-to-indoor coverage. To overcome these limitations, the use of relay UEs (RUEs) is seen as a possible solution to effectively extend the coverage of a cellular network. In this context, this article proposes a deep learning-based algorithm to optimize the decision regarding when RUEs should be activated and deactivated in accordance with the benefits they can provide for increasing the spectral efficiency and decreasing outage probability for the network users. The obtained results reveal a promising capability of the proposed solution to activate the most beneficial RUEs given the network conditions being experienced, leading to improvements of average spectral efficiency of 12.3% and reductions of outage probability of 89% with respect to the case without relays.},

  abstract     = {The 5G standard is aimed at supporting Quality of Service (QoS)-constrained traffic types, enabling new services to be reliably built into scenarios such as industrial automation and smart cities. The support comes via a strong emphasis on resource virtualization in the form of slices. Due to the strong QoS constraints of each slice, determining how to actually split the radio resources among different slices, while considering simultaneously the priority of slices, network efficiency, and each slice&#39;s target QoS, is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a radio resource scheduling scheme, designed on the basis of a strong theoretical analysis, to address the challenges. We formulate a Chance-constrained optimum resource allocation problem, which is then converted into a low complexity deterministic knapsack problem utilizing the concept of effective bandwidth. The performance analysis proves that our proposal is better in efficiency than the existing schemes, under different network conditions and QoS constraints. Results clearly show the effectiveness of our scheme in the considered 5G scenarios.},

Unlike traditional MCS systems, where sensing data are traded via a third-party sensing platform, we propose a distributed data trading framework and investigate the potential of consortium blockchain to ensure the privacy and security of data transactions in MCS systems. The interactions between selling mobile users (SMUs) and buying mobile users (BMUs) are modeled as a Stackelberg game. Then, the amount of sensing time to purchase from each SMU and the price per unit sensing time are determined according to two auto-executing smart contracts. Notably, SMUs are compensated according to not only the amount of sensing time but also their reputation so that SMUs are encouraged to contribute high-quality data. Furthermore, the distributed ledger technology guarantees that the reputations of SMUs are updated and recorded in an immutable and traceable manner. Experimental results confirm that the proposed mechanism achieves near-optimal social welfare without requiring SMUs to know the price and data quality of each other.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strong adaptability and high flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively studied and widely applied in both civil and military applications. Although UAVs can achieve significant cost reduction and performance enhancement in large-scale systems by taking full advantage of their cooperation and coordination, they result in a serious cooperative behaviour control problem. Especially in dynamic environments, the cooperative behaviour control problem which has to quickly produce a safe and effective behaviour decision for each UAV to achieve group missions, is NP-hard and difficult to settle. In this work, we design a global-and-local attention-based reinforcement learning algorithm for the cooperative behaviour control problem of UAVs. First, with the motion and coordination models, we analyze the collision avoidance, motion state update, and task execution constraints of multiple UAVs, and abstract the cooperative behaviour control problem as a multi-constraint decision-making one. Then, inspired from the human-learning process where more attention is devoted to the important parts of data, we design a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with a global-and-local attention mechanism to cooperatively control the behaviours of UAVs and achieve the coordination. Simulation experiments in a multi-agent particle environment provided by OpenAI are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Compared with baselines, our approach shows significant advantages in mean reward, training time, and coordination effect.},

  abstract     = {To cope with the increasing demands of computing tasks in vehicles, task offloading to computing nodes (vehicles and edge servers) in a vehicular edge computing (VEC) scenario has gained significant attention. However, the high dynamic of task arrival and variant wireless network conditions could severely impact the quality of computation offloading for latency-aware and high-reliability services. Consequently, only offloading tasks to a single computing node may fail to satisfy the reliability requirements due to potential transmission errors or constraints on delay. To mitigate the limitations of task offloading to only one single computing node in VEC, task replication, in which a task can be sent to multiple computing nodes simultaneously is utilized. Nevertheless, unrestricted task replication may exacerbate the depletion of network and computing resources in VEC when a burst of computing tasks is generated. To address the above challenges, we first formulate the problem of power allocation with task replication in NOMA-enabled VEC. Our purpose is to maximize task transmission reliability based on the Finite Block Length (FBL) theory while following the delay constraint. To achieve this goal, we formulate the problem of task replication and power allocation into a constrained stochastic optimization problem and apply the Lyapunov optimization framework to adjust task replication decisions and power allocation for each vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better service reliability than other alternative algorithms.},

In particular, we propose a heterogeneous federated multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on a heterogeneous actor-critic framework. All entities in the three-layer MEC system act as both the actor to interact with the environment and the critic to learn optimal policies. Since the training of each agent in the framework is independent, a novel federated updating method is further adopted to enable cooperation among entities and solve the problem of non-stationary environment. Extensive simulation results validate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of both the convergence and resulted AoI in the multi-UAV assisted MEC system.},

In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, that assume that all devices participating in the process are non-malicious in the beginning, we here tackle the problem from the opposite perspective. All devices are treated as malicious at first, and, by assuming that an upper-bound on the attack intensity is (imperfectly) known a priori, the worst-case scenario is studied, from which two novel estimators are derived. The first approach is based on convex relaxation and leads to a robust second-order cone programming (R-SOCP), while the other one assumes problem reformulation as a robust generalized trust region sub-problem (R-GTRS). Received signal strength (RSS) scenario is in the main focus, but an adaptation of the new approach to a general range-based setting is presented as well. The proposed min-max approach is validated though computer simulations, where it showed its worthiness by outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches and offering a more reliable (secure) solution to the problem. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a theoretical analysis on the detection performance is also included in the work.},

To address this issue, in this article, we explore the idea of multi-purpose UAVs, which act as aerial wireless communication data relays and means of aerial transportation simultaneously to deliver data and packages at the same time. While UAVs deliver the packages from warehouses to residential areas, we design their trajectories which enable them to collect data from multiple Internet of Things (IoT) clusters and forward the collected data to terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To select the serving nearby IoT clusters, UAVs rank them based on their priorities and distances. From the perspectives of data and package delivery, respectively, we propose two algorithms that design the optimal UAVs trajectory to maximize the transmitted data or minimize the round trip time. Specifically, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations of IoT clusters and TBSs. Given the nature of random locations, the proposed algorithm applies to general cases. Our numerical results show that multi-purpose UAVs are practical and have great potential to enhance the energy/time-efficiency of future networks.},

The security analysis demonstrates that SA-CLAS is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks, and SPPA can satisfy the necessary security requirements. The performance evaluation shows the efficiency and practicality of SA-CLAS and SPPA.

To this end, a UAV-aided information collection method based on joint optimization of node access and flight strategy is proposed. The cost function is minimized by optimizing the speed of UAV, the average flight time and the access selection of IoT nodes. And the cost function consists of UAV energy consumption and total mission time. In order to effectively solve the non-convex term in the original optimization problem, the convex relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is used to transform it into a mixed integer disciplined convex program (MIDCP), and an iterative algorithm is de-signed to solve this problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption and mission time of the UAV under the premise of ensuring the integrity of node information collection.},

Most of the existing methods focus on the trade-off between connectivity and the number of network edges. However, for a multi-UAVs communication network with high quality of service (QoS), more metrics of communication network need to be considered, such as the hops and the maximum number of links. In this article, we propose a multi-objective optimization method for dynamic communication network. Firstly, in order to accurately estimate the moved positions with random noise, Long and Short Term Memory network (LSTM) is used to predict succeeding positions of all UAVs. Secondly, Deep Q-network (DQN) with random action space is designed to adaptively adjust the communication network. In particular, it can be applied to large-scale communication networks. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method based on the trained LSTM and DQN. In this transfer learning, these two models which are well-trained in smaller communication network and combined with principal component analysis (PCA) can be directly used for communication network optimization of larger networks.

  abstract     = {Predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) is crucial for ride-hailing platforms and autonomous vehicle systems. Although deep neural network-based models have demonstrated high accuracy in ETA prediction, their loss functions often assume standard noise distribution, which fails to account for the noise distribution in real-world mobile crowdsensing travel orders. This study investigates the dynamic noise distribution in practical travel orders and identifies two key types of noise in ETA prediction: intrinsic noise at the start or end of the order and accumulated noise during travel. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Noise-aware Optimization (NAO) for ETA prediction that generates dynamic noise distributions from real-world datasets and optimizes the ETA model through maximum likelihood estimation accordingly. We provide two specific forms of NAO for ETA prediction with Gaussian and Laplace noise distributions, respectively, to facilitate practical applications. Additionally, we compare commonly used regression loss functions with NAO under a probability interpretation to illustrate the principle of NAO. Our experiments conducted on the DiDi platform in two large cities demonstrate the superior effectiveness of NAO over other loss functions.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networking has seen continued evolution over decades with the recently emerging paradigm of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communications beginning to pick up momentum for adoption on today&#39;s roadways. Initial iterations of C-V2X grew from the LTE Device-to-Device framework and targeted application use cases that required the exchange of small packets of information: where a vehicle is, what it is doing, etc. Many of the next generation of use cases require the transfer of sensory data from vehicles to the edge, e.g., tele-driving, cooperative perception, computation offloading, etc. This work evaluates whether today&#39;s commercially available vehicular networking solutions can support the higher data rates required to carry this sensory data from vehicles to a Roadside Unit using a C-V2X testbed based on C-V2X Mode 4, which operates autonomously in shared spectrum. It is experimentally shown that C-V2X is capable of carrying the most common form of vehicle sensor data, images, with a frame latency of approximately 50 ms; however, these transmissions are often unreliable due to C-V2X Mode 4’s lack of adaptation capability. To mitigate this, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem is proposed that can adapt the transmission parameters of image frames using readily available out of band information in order to achieve a 23.3% relative improvement in effective throughput. Extensions to this RL problem are developed that allow explicit control over a desired risk tolerance, such as the probability of transmitting an image but not receiving it. Using this extension, the developed RL solution learns an adaptive transmission policy that successfully delivers 87.1% of the image frames which are transmitted (a 33.6% absolute improvement) while still maintaining the throughput advantage. Ultimately this work finds that today&#39;s commercial vehicular networking solutions are capable of supporting applications that require sensor data sharing by using RL to overcome the limitations of C-V2X Mode 4.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has great potential to transform transportation systems by enhancing road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving user experience through onboard infotainment applications. Decentralized data sharing can improve security, privacy, reliability, and facilitate infotainment data sharing in IoVs. However, decentralized data sharing may not achieve the expected efficiency if there are IoV users who only want to consume the shared data but are not willing to contribute their own data to the community, resulting in incomplete information observed by other vehicles and infrastructure, which can introduce additional transmission latency. Therefore, in this article, by modeling the data sharing ecosystem as a data trading market, we propose a decentralized data-sharing incentive mechanism based on multi-intelligent reinforcement learning to learn the supply-demand balance in markets and minimize transmission latency. Our proposed mechanism takes into account the dynamic nature of IoV markets, which can experience frequent fluctuations in supply and demand. We propose a time-sensitive Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) mechanism coupled with Named Data Networking (NDN) to protect data in IoVs, which adds a layer of security to our proposed solution. Additionally, we design a decentralized market for efficient data sharing in IoVs, where continuous double auctions are adopted. The proposed mechanism based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can learn the supply-demand equilibrium in markets, thus improving the efficiency and sustainability of markets. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed learning-based incentive mechanism outperforms baselines by 10% in determining the equilibrium of supply and demand while reducing transmission latency by 20%.},

  abstract     = {To alleviate severe attenuation of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel, massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in which a large number of antennas are utilized in base station (BS) is a promising solution. However, due to a large number of antennas and limited coherence time of mmWave mobile channel, acquisition of a precise channel state information (CSI) requires a large channel estimation overhead, especially for frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In addition, due to limited saturation level of mmWave power amplifiers, a flexible pilot length adaptation is required for mmWave communication systems. Likewise, because of a large number of BS antennas, it is difficult to feed back all CSI with high accuracy in FDD massive MIMO systems. There exists a trade-off between feedback overhead and the accuracy of recovered CSI. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based joint optimization of closed-loop FDD massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous deep learning-based approach in which only beamforming (BF) from observation of CSI is composed with neural network, we formulate the entire process of generating BF matrix as a functional optimization problem. We compose a deep learning-based FDD massive MIMO system where the functional blocks including pilot length adaptation, CSI compression, and BF are replaced with neural networks. The neural networks are connected and trained as a single network toward a direction which maximizes network utility. During the training process, each functional block learns its best strategy to maximizes network utility. Through simulation, we confirm that each network learned strategies to maximize network utility by itself.},

While flexibility is provided, the deployment of the UAV swarms and the associated resource allocation become rather challenging due to the dynamic nature of UAVs and difficulty in obtaining global user information. In this article, we propose an adaptive and flexible joint UAV deployment and resource allocation (JUDRA) scheme by exploiting personalized federated deep reinforcement learning, called PFRL, with aim to maximize the long-term network throughput while enforcing user privacy and adapting to time-varying network states. To allow UAVs to make real-time decisions on resource allocation and position adjustment based on local observations while achieving a global optimal solution, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted in the federated learning framework in PFRL. Specifically, we use DRL to train a local model and a personalized model on UAVs, and employ a two-level parameter aggregation scheme on a leading UAV to form a global model. The personalized model can adapt to changing environments, while exploiting the generalization of global model to accelerate the learning convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed PFRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and convergence in comparison with some state-of-art solutions.},

However, the problem of sharing the results of node trust evaluation has been seriously neglected in existing studies. Given this situation, this paper proposes a distributed trust sharing mechanism based on Reservoir Computing. Considering the limited storage and computing capacity of vehicles, we set up the model as as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. Besides we novelly combined Echo state network and Reinforcement Learning to support vehicles to share trust information by predicting future driving directions. The current vehicle trust evaluation results are incorporated into a new parameter besides traffic accidents and traffic flow, which protects the security of vehicles to the greatest extent. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with those of Multilayer Perceptron-based DQN and LSTM-based DQN through simulation, which proves that the proposed algorithm can converge to a better solution and has a faster convergence speed, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.},

In this paper, we consider a relay-assisted airborne FSO system in which serial and parallel relaying are deployed together. We deploy relay selection in each hop and select the relay that provides the maximum instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To achieve this in practice, it is necessary to estimate the channel coefficient per hop and feed it back to the preceding transmitting/relaying node. Due to the semi-fixed hovering position of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this estimate will likely be outdated for the airborne channel. Therefore, the relay will likely be selected based on the outdated channel coefficient. In this paper, we first propose a model for outdated log-normal fading. Based on the outdated channel state information, we discuss how to optimally set the node transmit power by a proper selection of the pre-amplification factor to ensure signal reception above a targeted threshold at each hop. We finally present the end-to-end bit error rate (BER) performance of the airborne parallel multi-hop system under consideration.},

  abstract     = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a critical infrastructure for positioning, navigation, and timing. Recently, vigorous implementation of low earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites has provided a new opportunity for developing GNSS. However, most of the existing navigation modulations are only applicable for narrow bandwidths; hence, broadband navigation modulation with good compatibility and scalability is needed. This paper presents a new broadband multicarrier navigation modulation, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with binary offset carriers (OFDM-BOC), which uses orthogonal BOC signals as subcarriers. First, we derive the analytical expressions of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD) based on the proposed signal model. Then, we discuss the relationship between the OFDM-BOC parameters and their time-frequency properties. This modulation can update existing BOC-like signals without affecting the original receiver. In addition, OFDM-BOC has a similar transmitter and receiver scheme to traditional modulation, so the update process only needs minor changes for the original navigation equipment. Compared with some representative navigation modulations such as AltBOC, BOC(10,5), and OFDM, the analysis reflects that OFDM-BOC has a flatter PSD main lobe, lower PSD maximum value, and smaller false lock probability. Moreover, it is shown that OFDM-BOC also has better spectrum efficiency, tracking performance, and anti-interference. Due to the excellent compatibility and navigation performance, OFDM-BOC provides a broadband modulation scheme for the next generation of navigation signals.},

  abstract     = {In millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the surge in hardware cost and power consumption poses a huge challenge to green communication. Considering the high power consumption of the radio frequency (RF) module, we aim to design a high energy-efficient uplink multi-users (MU) communication system by applying variable-resolution analog to digital converters (ADC). Firstly, a closed-form expression for the spectrum efficiency (SE) in terms of the quantization resolution of ADC is derived under hybrid beamforming (HBF) and fully digital beamforming (FDBF) architectures, respectively. We find explicit energy efficiency (EE) expressions and investigate the main factors affecting EE under two kinds of architectures. For HBF, a novel finding is that adding the number of RF chains for a fixed number of transmit data streams can effectively mitigate the quantization distortion introduced by low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, an EE maximization problem involving joint optimization of ADC bit selection and power allocation between MU for the HBF system is formulated. Based on the concept of block coordinate ascent (BCA), we subdivide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem involves power allocation, which has been reformulated as a convex problem using an equivalent quadratic transformation. The second subproblem tackles ADC bit selection, for which we propose a low-complexity search scheme that achieves performance approaching that of an exhaustive search. The simulation results demonstrate the high accuracy of the derived closed-form expression, which supports the EE analysis. The proposed EE maximization scheme has a fast convergence rate and achieves higher EE compared to existing benchmark technologies.},

We account for correlated Rayleigh fading and multiple antennas per access point (AP), while the maximum ratio (MR) beamforming is applied for the design of the active beamforming in terms of instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Firstly, we rely on an aggregated channel estimation approach that reduces the overhead required for channel estimation while providing sufficient information for data processing. We obtain the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimate per AP, and design the passive beamforming (PB) of the surface based on the long-time statistical CSI. Next, we derive the received signal in the asymptotic regime of numbers of APs and surface elements. Then, we obtain a closed-form expression of the downlink achievable rate for arbitrary numbers of APs and STAR-RIS elements under statistical CSI. Finally, based on the derived expressions, the numerical results show the feasibility and the advantages of deploying a STAR-RIS into conventional CF mMIMO systems. In particular, we theoretically analyze the properties of STAR-RIS-assisted CF mMIMO systems and reveal explicit insights in terms of the impact of channel correlation, the number of surface elements, and the pilot contamination on the achievable rate.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications can fundamentally solve the problem of spectrum shortage in wireless communication systems, and many progresses have been made in standardization, which laid the foundation for the application of mm-wave in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. However, the HSR channel is fast time-varying and difficult to model. Also beamforming is essential to improve the directional gain of the antenna and offset the high path loss of mm-wave. But the high-speed movement of train makes the beam management extremely challenging, and the trade-off between achievable performance and beam training overhead is unavoidable. Reinforcement learning (RL) can offer new solutions to this problem, as it does not need a large number of training samples and other system information, and is capable of achieving high performance with low complexity. In this article, we propose an intelligent beam management scheme based on a deep RL algorithm called deep Q-network (DQN), and our main idea is to exploit the hidden patterns of mm-wave train-ground communication system to improve the downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while ensuring a certain communication stability and imposing a minimal training overhead. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed DQN-based scheme has better performance than the four baseline schemes, and it also offers great advantages in SNR stability and implementation complexity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a two-layer large scale fading precoding (LSFP) method is proposed in a downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. In the first LSFP layer, the access points are responsible for designing distributed precoding and power control coefficients for each user equipment (UE). While for the second LSFP layer, the central processing unit performs the proposed zero forcing LSFP (ZF-LSFP) for the copilot UEs in order to mitigate the interference caused by pilot contamination. To address power constraints and enhance the system&#39;s spectral efficiency (SE), we introduce the copilot power scaling factors. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the lower-bound achievable SE under distributed precoding schemes. These expressions are versatile and applicable to downlink SE irrespective of the availability of ZF-LSFP. Based on the derived closed-form results, we formulate a sum SE maximization problem with respect to copilot power scaling factors. Two approaches are designed to solve this problem, i.e. the weighted minimum mean square error (W-MMSE) based approach and the geometric programming (GP) based approach. While the W-MMSE-based approach is suitable for various systems, the GP-based approach is specifically tailored for systems with high signal-to-noise ratios, offering fast running speed. Finally, we validate all theoretical analyses and assess the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer LSFP method through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz) communication system with the sparse radio frequency chains antenna structure at the base station (BS). To overcome the beam split of the BS, different from the conventional single-layer true-time-delay (TTD) scheme, we propose a double-layer TTD scheme that can effectively reduce the number of large-range delay devices, which involve additional insertion loss and amplification circuitry. Next, we analyze the system performance under the proposed double-layer TTD scheme. To relieve the beam split of the RIS, we consider multiple distributed RISs to replace an ultra-large size RIS. Based on this, we formulate an achievable rate maximization problem for the distributed RISs-aided THz communications via jointly optimizing the hybrid analog/digital beamforming, time delays of the double-layer TTD network and reflection coefficients of RISs. Considering the practical hardware limitation, the finite-resolution phase shift, time delay and reflection phase are constrained. To solve the formulated problem, we first design an analog beamforming scheme including optimizing phase shift and time delay based on the RISs&#39; locations. Then, an alternatively optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the digital beamforming and reflection coefficients based on the minimum mean square error and coordinate update techniques. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

By introducing radar and communication performance metrics, optimized power allocation is achieved for different transmitters of the JRC system. The objective of the radar subsystem is to achieve a desired target localization accuracy quantified in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the location estimates, whereas the objective of the communication subsystem is to improve the classical Shannon capacity. First, we consider non-cooperative radar- and communication-centric operations, and the power allocations are respectively optimized for these cases. Next, we present two novel resource allocation strategies for the cooperative JRC system. In the first strategy, joint resource optimization for radar and communication subsystems is performed by exploiting the same waveform resources, resulting in high spectrum efficiency. The second approach provides enhanced flexibility by exploiting separate sets of waveforms that are respectively dedicated to the radar and communication subsystems, enabling the JRC system to independently change radar subsystem waveforms based only on the radar surveillance profile, without impacting the communication subsystem waveforms. Simulation results clearly demonstrate significant performance gain of the proposed cooperative JRC system over radar- or communication-centric power allocation schemes.},

  abstract     = {Radio environment map (REM) reconstruction based on large-scale channel measurements is a promising technology for future mobility services involving vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. REMs provide contextual information which can be exploited to reduce V2X communication latency and control signaling, for instance, through a fast access to channel state information. However, the accuracy of radio mapping techniques is limited by the availability of measurements, which require for collection significant signaling overhead. Moreover, mobility scenarios impose strict latency constraints that render fast channel acquisition a challenging problem. This paper presents a low-complexity deep-learning-based approach based on long-short term memory (LSTM) cells for REM reconstruction on roads, addressed as a data-filling problem. To improve model generalization, the network is trained on a virtually infinite dataset generated according to a 3GPP-compliant freeway scenario, considering different correlation properties and missing point configurations. The results show that the proposed approach provides a performance closer to the theoretical lower bound than the classical Ordinary Kriging spatial interpolation method, without increasing the complexity order. Experiments performed in realistic scenarios using a 3D city model confirm the generalization capability of the proposed solution.},

This paper studies a typical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scenario, in which multiple source nodes desire to deliver different types of messages to their respective destinations. Considering the case that accurate instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, properly selecting access channel, transmission power, and data rate at each source to optimize the links&#39; performance is an extremely involved mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem. We propose applying the distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique to solve the problem. Specifically, a distributed multi-agent parameterized deep Q-network (DMA-PDQN) algorithm is employed to explore optimal decision in the discrete-continuous hybrid action space. The idea of federated meta learning (FML) is also adopted to tackle the non-stationarity issue and improve the training efficiency of distributed agents. Using energy efficiency (EE) as the target transmission objective, through extensive simulation we show that our method can achieve excellent convergence and performance.},

We first introduce a refined double beam-based channel model to the positioning problem and extract the energy coupling matrix in the refined beam domain as location-related fingerprint. By taking advantage of refined spatial and frequency beams, the new fingerprint (i.e., energy coupling matrix) contains plentiful and stationary multi-path information, such as power, angle of arrival (AoA), and delay of arrival (DoA), which are favorable to positioning. We then propose a novel deep learning-based fingerprint positioning method to locate the 2-dimension (2D) position of UTs, utilizing the multi-cell fingerprint as the input. In particular, we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures in this paper. The first DNN consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron, refining the elementary features from the multi-cell fingerprints and dividing the UTs into their belonging categories. In the second DNN, a new network architecture, Transformer, is applied to the positioning problem. The Transformer is directly based solely on self-attention mechanisms to sequences of fingerprint patches, which can perform outstandingly on the 2D position coordinates regression. Simulation results show that the proposed positioning methods can outperform the existing methods in terms of positioning error.},

With the aim to strike a balance between optimality and complexity for RIS assisted multi-user systems, in this article, we formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem under a novel RIS segmentation structure, where the distributions and sizes of each segmentation can be adaptively adjusted. Since the formulated optimization problem considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements for the users is non-convex, we suggest a computationally-efficient approach to derive an optimal solution by exploiting fractional programming, successive convex approximation (SCA), greedy algorithm, and alternating optimization. Finally, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed optimization design enables RIS to configure by grouping elements into some sub-surfaces without significant performance degradation while with much lower computational complexity than conventional element-wise optimization RIS. Moreover, our proposed adjustable segmentation outperforms the fixed one employing the determined positions and equal number of reflecting elements in each sub-surface. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the optimization of segmentation is much more significant than the phase shift optimization, showing the superiority and practical significance of the sub-surface segmentation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled network has been regarded as a promising component of the sixth generation (6G) wireless network to provide flexible and on-demand services. In the UAV-enabled networks, due to the user mobility and the dynamic channel characteristics, it is difficult to obtain the accurate location information and channel state information (CSI), therefore causing the uplink transmissions to be easily constrained. In this paper, we propose a sensing-assisted beamforming and trajectory design for the uplink transmissions in the UAV-enabled networks, where the accurate location information and CSI are not available. In the proposed design, the UAV-mounted base station (BS) first obtains the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information of the uplink signals from mobile users, thus enabling the estimation of the location information and CSI. Then, based on the estimated location information and CSI, a hybrid receiving beamforming and trajectory optimization problem is formulated to maximize the weighted average throughput (WAT) of our considered network. To solve this NP-hard problem, we decompose it into two subproblems, namely, a hybrid receive beamforming optimization subproblem and a UAV trajectory optimization subproblem. Then, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR), manifold optimization, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approaches are developed to solve these two subproblems. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to obtain a suboptimal solution. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed design, showing how it can achieve the comparable performance as several benchmarks, especially when the estimated location information and CSI are less accurate.},

  abstract     = {In the traditional physical layer encryption methods, both the delay and errors brought by the keys generation and interaction and those from the channel estimation are too high to be employed for the uplink multiuser massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Differently, this paper constructs a lightweight encryption scheme with the modulation random chaotic encryption (MRCE) signals in the uplink massive MIMO systems where the keys are not required to be known, a priori, at the base station (BS). Their generation is off-line and does not employ the channel state information, and there is no immediate interaction. Specially, as a deep learning based solution for detecting the MRCE signals in the uplink massive MIMO systems, the convolutional-neural-network aided nonlinear detection (CAD) algorithms are proposed in this paper. The simulation results showed their effectiveness. The anti-eavesdrop ability of the MRCE signals is verified even against eavesdroppers equipped with multiple antennas at high average signal to noise ratio (SNR). As shown in the simulation results, when the BS does not previously know the keys, the proposed CAD algorithms have a much better bit error rate (BER) performance and higher secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) than the less efficient ones of their corresponding unassisted methods. The BER is closer to the theoretical lower bound of the optimum value obtained by the maximum likelihood method. They require lower average received SNR to converge to the theoretical maximum SSE given by the no error transmissions from the legitimate users to the BS. These performances also approach those of their corresponding unassisted algorithms without prior known keys. The proposed CAD algorithms have medium/strong robustness against the channel estimation error and medium/low polynomial computational complexity.},

Then, the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of base stations (BSs) are jointly optimized. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, this jointly optimized problem is usually difficult to solve. At present, the most commonly adopted method to deal with joint optimization problems is the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on an alternative optimization framework. However, as we all know, the BCD algorithm has some degree of performance loss due to the alternate optimization of variables. To overcome this challenging issue, a novel joint optimization framework based on Riemannian product manifolds (RPM) is proposed, in which the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of BSs can be simultaneously optimized rather than alternating ways. The simulation results and computational complexity analysis demonstrate that the joint optimization framework based on the RPM exhibits superior performance and lower complexity compared to the joint optimization algorithm based on the BCD.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to improve the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of Ultra-Reliability and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in interference-limited wireless networks. To obtain time diversity within the channel coherence time, we first put forward a random repetition scheme that randomizes the interference power. Then, we optimize the number of reserved slots and the number of repetitions for each packet to minimize the QoS violation probability, defined as the percentage of users that cannot achieve URLLC. We build a cascaded Random Edge Graph Neural Network (REGNN) to represent the repetition scheme and develop a model-free unsupervised learning method to train it. To obtain some analytical results, we derive approximations of the QoS violation probability using stochastic geometry in a Poisson bipolar network and apply a model-based Exhaustive Search (ES) method to find the optimal repetition scheme. Based on the analytical results, a model-assisted initialization is developed for the cascaded REGNN to improve the training efficiency. Simulation results show that the cascaded REGNN can achieve a lower QoS violation probability than the cascaded fully connected neural network, and generalizes well in wireless networks with different scales, network topologies, cell densities, and frequency reuse factors.},

The proposed antenna employs a surface waveguide-integrated partially reflective surface (PRS) with a positive reflection gradient. In the low-frequency band, a surface-wave antenna is designed to operate from 4.8 to 6.8 GHz, featuring linear polarization and quasi-broadside radiation. Such a configuration is well-suited for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication applications. Additionally, a circularly-polarized (CP) Fabry-Perot (F-P) antenna is developed for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication, operating in X / Ku band (11.5 ∼ 14.3 GHz, 21.7%). This F-P antenna integrates a partially polarization-conversion ground (PPCG) and a partially reflective surface (PRS). It is worth noting that the surface-wave and F-P antennas share the same structure for their surface waveguide and PRS, respectively. Furthermore, the radiation source of the F-P antenna is utilized as the reflector for the surface-wave antenna. The design, principle, results, and applications are presented and analyzed, and the final antenna performance is validated.},

However, motivated by the growing success of machine learning, current research focuses on replacing model-based data estimation methods by data-driven approaches, mainly neural networks (NNs). In this work, we particularly investigate the incorporation of existing model knowledge into data-driven approaches, which is expected to lead to complexity reduction and / or performance enhancement. We describe three different options, namely “model-inspired” pre-processing, choosing an NN architecture motivated by the properties of the underlying communication system, and inferring the layer structure of an NN with the help of model knowledge. Most of the current publications on NN-based data estimation deal with general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. In this work, we investigate NN-based data estimation for so-called unique word orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) systems. We highlight differences between UW-OFDM systems and general MIMO systems one has to be aware of when using NNs for data estimation, and we introduce measures for a successful utilization of NN-based data estimators in UW-OFDM systems. Further, we investigate the use of NNs for data estimation when channel coded data transmission is conducted, and we present adaptions to be made, such that NN-based data estimators provide satisfying performance for this case. We compare the presented NNs concerning achieved bit error ratio performance and computational complexity, we show the peculiar distributions of their data estimates, and we also point out their downsides compared to model-based equalizers.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently been in the spotlight as a key enabler for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication system. The essence of RIS-assisted wireless communications is to decide how to reconfigure RIS (or control reflection coefficients of unit cells) according to the given wireless environments. In particular, since an RIS is usually composed of multiple unit cells, and the amplitude and phase of a signal reflected by each unit cell are coupled, finding jointly optimal reflection coefficients regarding such aspects requires rich computational resources. In the past, most of the preceding studies builds their reflection coefficient models under less realistic assumptions to address such a challenge. To overcome, this study models a practical and tractable reflection coefficient and proposes a computation-efficient method of near-optimal reflection coefficient design of graphene-based RIS unit cells. The method basically leverages a greedy algorithm, thereby obtaining an near-optimal reflection coefficient without multiple computing iterations. To further gain practicality, we propose a quantized reflection coefficient designing method, and show that 1-bit quantization achieves significant performance, which is close to that without quantization. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing with several benchmark schemes that require rich computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Optimum power allocation is a key enabler for maximizing data rate in wireless networks. Recently, various deep neural network models have been introduced for predicting power allocation in device-to-device (D2D) networks. However, they require large training samples (i.e., network layouts). On the contrary in this paper, we aim to develop a learning model for power allocation with fewer training samples, which is vital in dynamic networks (e.g., vehicular networks) with the need for fast learning of power allocation. The proposed model transforms Euclidean-based network layouts and power allocation problems into Riemannian (i.e., non-Euclidean) manifolds, which is shown to require fewer learning parameters and hence shorter learning time. Such transformation is possible thanks to the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of spectral representation (i.e., Laplacian matrix) of network layouts. In particular, we propose a graph convolutional regression network (GCRN) for predicting power allocation over Riemannian manifolds in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GCRN model approaches the maximum network rate in large-scale networks, with only 300 training samples as opposed to 10,000 in Euclidean-based learning models.},

  abstract     = {Edge content caching has emerged as a promising solution against network latency by pre-caching popular contents at the edge of networks. However, the edge content caching and wireless resource allocation are intertwined with each other. The content downloading latency depends not only on the edge content caching strategy, but also highly on the wireless resource allocation strategy. To cope with them as a whole, this work aims at jointly optimizing the edge content caching and power allocation to minimize the content downloading latency. In doing so, a joint edge content caching and power allocation problem is formulated. But, this problem is NP-hard and difficult to be solved. Solving it with the traditional approaches will cause quite long computational delay, which cannot meet the real-time requirements of resource scheduling. To address this challenge, a novel deep learning (DL)-enabled joint edge content caching and power allocation framework is proposed. In particular, the formulated problem is firstly transformed into a classification problem in DL field. After that, the convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM) are utilized to capture the temporal-spatial features of content requests, and the fully-connected networks (FC) are introduced to explore the users&#39; location differences. Finally, the temporal-spatial features of content requests and the location differences are fused to make intelligent decisions for joint edge content caching and power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed joint edge content caching and power allocation strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines at about 2.3% in terms of the average content downloading latency while guaranteeing real-time resource scheduling.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present an in-depth analysis of whitening methods for mitigating the spatial correlation in a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) system. After presenting the input-output relation of MIMO-OTFS with receive spatial correlation, we analyze the error performance in terms of the union bound and derive an upper bound on the pairwise error probability (PEP). This upper bound is dominated by diversity and coding gains, as well as given SNRs. However, evaluating the PEP upper bound involves high computational complexity. This motivates us to adopt average receive SNR as a parameter for performance evaluation. Next, we investigate the whitening transformation (WT) method and show that the effect of spatial correlation cannot be completely removed, leading to a limited performance improvement. To tackle this problem, we develop an alternative whitening technique, viz. the receive whitening filter (WF) method for MIMO-OTFS. Additionally, we investigate the effect of mismatched spatial correlation coefficient and noise variance on the performance of the WF method. Through a general proof based on the expectation of the average SNR ratios between the mismatched and the standard cases, we analytically demonstrate the performance degradation of the mismatched case. The proof also reveals the increasing performance degradation w.r.t. the magnitude of the mismatch error. Notably, for practical mismatch error of $\boldsymbol{5-10{\%}}$ , the performance degradation of the WF method is found to be insignificant. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the analytical results in a practical LEO satcom channel model for various MIMO-OTFS systems.},

  abstract     = {Theincreasing number of smart vehicles is leading to an increasing scarcity of spectrum resources for the internet of vehicles (IoV), which has given rise to an urgent requirement for automatic modulation classification (AMC) in cognitive radio (CR) systems. Meanwhile, for the flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the AMC implemented based on UAVs is considered an effective method to achieve reliable communication between intelligent vehicles. However, for distributed UAV task implementation, real-time radio data needs to be transmitted between UAVs and a cloud server. This process requires maintaining a high-capacity, secure channel environment, which is difficult to accomplish. In this article, we propose a federated transfer learning framework to implement AMC in a distributed scenario, which avoids radio data transmission in each UAV. To reduce data dependence, the pre-trained deep learning (DL)-based model is sent to each UAV node and performs transfer learning, which brings more focused learning of the channel environment in which various UAVs are located. The simulation results show that federated transfer learning-based AMC offers better recognition accuracy than centralized approach. Compared to the centralized training methods, the federated transfer learning algorithm achieves an improvement of 1.04% to 12.05% in classification accuracy for each node with less training data. Besides, the effect of different fine-tuning layers on the accuracy is investigated, showing that fine-tuning three layers could achieve optimal accuracy. Additionally, different numbers of UAVs are employed to verify the impact on the results. The experimental results show that the number of UAVs can improve the results but to a limited extent. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed method by various measurements, such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Accordingly, compared with the baseline methods, the proposed scheme achieves an improvement of 1% to 14% over them.},

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is regarded as one of the key technologies satisfying the high data rate communication and highly accurate sensing for these intelligent applications in future mobile communication systems. With the explosive growth of wireless devices and services, the shortage of spectrum resources leads to the fragmentation of available frequency bands for ISAC systems, which degrades sensing performance. Facing the above challenges, this paper proposes a Carrier Aggregation (CA)-based ISAC signal aggregating high and low-frequency bands to improve the sensing performance, where the CA-based ISAC signal can use four different aggregated pilot structures for sensing. Then, an ISAC signal processing algorithm with Compressed Sensing (CS) is proposed and the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is used to solve the reconfiguration convex optimization problem. Finally, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) are derived for the CA-based ISAC signal. Simulation results show that CA efficiently improves the accuracy of range and velocity estimation.},

In this article, deep reinforcement learning algorithm is applied for providing frequency hopping strategies against jamming attacks in wideband communication systems. We first model the frequency hopping communication system in a dynamic jamming environment, where a two-dimensional pattern with a certain number of time slots and channels are formulated. In particular, a jammer using multi-channel blocking jamming is considered, where the some frequency bands are attacked via probabilistic jamming patterns. In this case, an intelligent frequency hopping strategy is desired, especially when perfect knowledge of the jamming patterns is not known at the transmitter and receiver sides. In order to tackle this issue, the interaction between the users and the jammer are modeled as a Markov decision process and a deep Q-learning algorithm is proposed to solve the frequency hopping decision making problem. Finally, the system performance is evaluated by simulations. Our simulation results have shown that in comparison to Q-learning assisted frequency hopping strategy, the proposed deep Q-learning assisted frequency hopping strategy is capable of attaining a better anti-jamming performance, especially for a large number of frequency bands and long transmission time.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the throughput maximization problem in cellular networks where a macro cell is overlaid with multiple small cells, and each small-cell base station (sBS) provides data links for wireless backhaul and energy links for energy harvesting (EH) nodes. The data links enable communication between sBSs, while the energy links facilitate radio-frequency-based energy harvesting by EH nodes. Efficient scheduling of these links is crucial for enhancing network throughput while fulfilling the energy requirements of the EH nodes. To tackle this challenge, a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and a minimizing power problem are formulated to derive a link schedule for both types of links with the minimum power consumption. However, obtaining the optimal schedule is challenging due to the complexity of the initial formulations. To address this, a practical problem decomposition method is proposed, along with a single-stage technique that simultaneously maximizes the number of scheduled data links and minimizes transmit power. The optimization process is further improved using benders decomposition (BD), complemented by the machine learning-aided multi-cut method for enhanced convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal link scheduling with reduced iterations. Numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the problem decomposition method, particularly when the EH nodes have an energy requirement of 0.1 Joules.},

The developed antenna element obtains a measured | S 11 |&lt;−10 dB impedance bandwidth of 49.4% (23.3–38.6 GHz) by loading two monopoles ahead of the open-end aperture of a single-layer substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) with an etched transverse slot, thus, covering multiple allocated mmWave bands of the fifth-generation (5G). Meanwhile, the loaded two monopole structures also introduce a broadside radiation aperture, which combines with the original end-fire radiation aperture forming a stable 45° tilted beam pattern within the frequency band. Prototype of a 1 × 4 phased array is fabricated and measured, and the beam scanning performance of the array is verified using a multi-channel beamformer, with a 3 dB beam scanning range exceeds 86° at 27 GHz. The proposed antenna boasts the characteristics of wideband, a stable tilted beam, and good beam scanning performance, rendering it a promising candidate for mmWave vehicular communications. Additionally, a hybrid 2D beam scanning is realized by combining a cylindrical Luneburg lens antenna with the 1 × 4 phased array to fully exploit the advantages of both techniques. Experimental validation has also been carried out to confirm the feasibility of the proposed hybrid 2D beam scanning scheme.},

This paper proposes a high-rate reflection STSK system based on a 3-D constellation and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). To implement reflection phase shifting, a set of reflection dispersion matrices (RDMs) are constructed without power limit. To improve bandwidth efficiency, an additional phase is introduced to the selected 3-D constellation point and carries up to three bits. An upper bound for bit error rate (BER) is derived under maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. It is shown that both diversity gain and coding gain rely on the construction of the RDMs for the system. Accordingly, a genetic algorithm is proposed for randomly generating an optimal family of the RDMs and the additional phase parameter. Simulation results show that the proposed system can improve both bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency, when compared with the traditional 3-D STSK and RIS-based SSK-assisted Alamouti space-time block coding systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a joint design of instantaneous channel estimation, beam tracking, and adaptive beamformer construction for a millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed. This design focuses on efficiency in terms of performance and computational complexity under the adverse effects of time variation and mobility of sources, the presence of multiuser and multipath components, or simply multi-clusters, and the near-far effect. The design is also suitable for hybrid beamforming and frequency-selective channels. In the proposed system, channel parameters are estimated in time-domain duplex (TDD) uplink mode using a per-cluster approach rather than a joint approach, which significantly reduces the complexity. Per-cluster estimation is possible thanks to the proposed interference-aware statistical beamforming method, namely reduced dimensional Generalized Eigenbeamformer (RD-GEB), which undertakes the computational load of interference mitigation and enables a simpler design for the remaining stages. In addition, the overall design is based on the separation of channel parameters as fast-time and slow-time , leaving only the instantaneous channel estimation and channel matched filtering as fast-time operations, which are handled inside cluster-specific reduced dimensional subspaces. Beam tracking and beamformer construction are held in slow-time rarely, which reduces the time-averaged complexity. Furthermore, beam tracking is performed by leveraging a batch of instantaneous channel estimates, which removes the need for an additional training process. The proposed low-complexity design is shown to outperform the conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications has been considered one of the key techniques for the future generations of wireless systems due to the large mmWave bandwidth available. In mmWave systems, channel state information (CSI) is critical for the design of the precoder and combiner for operations respectively at transmitter and receiver. In this article, we motivate to design the low-complexity and high-accuracy channel estimation methods for the mmWave systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling and hybrid transmitter/receiver beamforming. Specifically, a multi-layer sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) channel estimator is proposed to both improve the performance of channel estimation and reduce the complexity of signal processing, when compared with a range of related channel estimators, including the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-, approximate message passing (AMP)- and conventional SBL-assisted channel estimators. The proposed multi-layer SBL estimator is compared with these legacy channel estimators, when impacts from different perspectives are considered. Furthermore, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound of channel estimation is analyzed and evaluated. Our studies and simulation results show that the proposed multi-layer SBL estimator is capable of achieving better performance than the benchmark estimators considered. Specifically, when compared with the traditional SBL estimator, the proposed multi-layer SBL estimator is capable of achieving a lower mean-square error (MSE), while simultaneously, requiring only about 1/10 of the computational complexity of the traditional SBL estimator.},

  abstract     = {In distributed coherent aperture radar (DCAR), the fundamental problem in ensuring the full coherence of the radar system is how to realize the precise positioning of the subarray. The subarray positioning scheme is designed based on the multi-domain extended extreme learning machine (ELM)-direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for the mobile DCAR system. The multi-domain partition scheme improves the ELM model, making the algorithm effective and low-complex in the changing electromagnetic environment. Firstly, the array covariance matrix is constrained by L2 regularization to decrease the influence of different feature measurement scales on the model. An airspace extension ELM (AEELM) method, which reduces the original matrix by the spatial partition layer and the sequential process, is proposed. This method diminishes the size of the model&#39;s solving matrix and enhances the DOA estimation accuracy while increasing or refining the samples. Secondly, an extended ELM method based on partition projection (PPEELM) is proposed to unravel the problems of high dimensions, small samples, and complex electromagnetic environments in radar array features. The radar covariance matrix is analyzed by partitioned multi-space projection according to the changes in the scene&#39;s electromagnetic environment. The operation can ameliorate the model&#39;s ability to solve nonlinear problems in complex environments. Therefore, the fully coherent system&#39;s position estimation accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain are ameliorated. Numerical simulations show that AEELM can effectively augment the estimation accuracy and curtail the maximum matrix dimension of a single training. The PPEELM method can ensure the system coherence performance is more excellent than 95% when the subarray signal&#39;s SNR is greater than 0 dB in small scenarios.},

We assume that the UAV roughly samples from the actual radio environment of the airspace in advance, and calculates the outage probability of the sampled points. After that, the UAV reconstructs the actual outage knowledge map, and flies in the airspace to learn the optimal UAV trajectory planning policy based on the reconstructed map. The optimization objective is to minimize the flight energy cost of the UAV performing tasks. In this article, we propose a deep image prior based radio map reconstruction (DIPRMR) method to reconstruct the map, and then propose a deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization algorithm.

Using the two-dimensional Laplace transform and its inverse, the closed form expressions of the mean and variance of the signal power distribution are obtained. Then, the outage probability and average achievable rates of the uplink and downlink users are derived in closed form. Furthermore, the impact of the residual self-interference (SI) on FD communication performance is discussed. It is demonstrated that FD communication outperforms HD communication when the residual SI is below a threshold, and the threshold is derived in closed form. Simulation results are presented to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and show the negative impact of channel correlation on the system performance. Moreover, it is illustrated that the outage probability and the average achievable rate of the uplink user will converge to a constant when the residual SI is linearly dependent on the transmit power.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth enhancement of a dual-band dual-circularly polarized (DBDCP) antenna. It utilizes a novel polarization-independent partial reflective surface (PRS) unit cell, which consists of two same metallic patterns with a relative 90° rotation on both surfaces of a substrate. Each metallic pattern is composed of a C-shaped arc and a circular patch. The LP field from the feeder is transformed into two different circularly polarized (CP) field at two respective bands by the unit cell. Due to the asymmetric structure and separated topology of two C-shaped arcs, a slight resonant deviation appears in AR for different polarized waves. Moreover, both x - and y -polarized waves are produced simultaneously by using Fabry-Pérot cavity (FPC) structure when a y -polarized feeder is used. Thus, the AR bandwidths for both x -and y -polarized incident waves are close to each other and combined deliberately into wide AR bandwidth. To validate the design concept, a prototype of the proposed MIMO antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of less than 2 covers from 11.55 GHz to 14.8 GHz, and the LHCP pattern and RHCP pattern are realized in low band of 12–12.6 GHz (4.88%) and high band of 14.1–14.61 GHz (3.55%), respectively. The maximum gain is 13.5 dBi (13.1 dBi) at the low-band (high-band). Besides, the port isolation is better than 40 dB, and the ECC is less than −80 dB. With these performances, the proposed MIMO antenna can be employed for vehicular MIMO communications and sensing at Ku-band.},

The objective is to minimize the overall energy supply-demand imbalance cost. This problem covers two aspects: 1) association between passengers and eVTOLs, and 2) energy balance strategy determination through power grid energy scheduling for each prosumer. For the first aspect, a destination collision-aware Gale-Shapely matching game (DC-MG) approach is proposed, where the distance concern of passengers, the remaining energy of eVTOLs, and the destination collision are comprehensively considered. Subsequently, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAGC)-based multi-agent dueling double deep Q network (MA3DQN) with a multi-step bootstrapping (MSB) approach (CMA3DQN) is proposed, where the input (i.e., energy demand) depends on the output of the first aspect. Particularly, the HAGC approach is adopted to group all prosumers into several agents to reduce the input feature size of each agent. Then the MA3DQN with MSB approach is applied to achieve the best grid energy balance strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, the imbalance cost achieved by the proposed joint method is separately $128.71\times$ , $12.57\times$ , and $11.72\times$ less than the random energy scheduling approach, the independent multi-agent dueling DQN approach, and the approach of employing the double deep Q network per cluster.},

  abstract     = {The stable vehicular space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) requires high-gain multi-beam/beam-steering antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a compact high-gain wideband circularly-polarized (CP) beam-steering antenna with novel rotatable phase-gradient metasurface (PGM) transmitarrays for the SAGIN. It consists of a novel substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) array feed and three innovative metasurface transmitarrays (M 0 , M 1 , and M 2 ), capable of providing any compensation phases between 0° and 360°. The novel PGM unit cells have two identical CP U-slot patches that perform CP-to-CP conversions with high transmission efficiencies. In addition, a new and accurate beam-steering analytical formulations are proposed for fast predictions of scanning angles. Experimental results show that the proposed compact SIW array feed achieves an aperture efficiency of 58.8%, a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 10.8%, and a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of over 23%. The proposed entire beam-steering antenna achieves a peak gain of 27.56 dBic, which corresponds to an aperture efficiency of 48.5%, and an exceptionally wide 3-dB AR bandwidth within the scanning range. It is a strong candidate for future millimeter-wave communications in satellite and radar systems and vehicular communications.},

  abstract     = {Regenerative braking technology plays a crucial role in recovering braking energy and extending the range of electric vehicles. To maximize energy recovery and ensure braking stability across various road conditions, loads, and braking intentions, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is proposed. Firstly, the driver&#39;s braking intention is recognized using optimized modal features extracted from the brake pedal signal. Vehicle load estimation is then performed using a forgetting factor recursive least squares algorithm. Subsequently, an artificial bee colony optimization algorithm is employed to allocate optimal braking forces between the front and rear axles for different braking intentions and loads. Based on the obtained braking force distribution ratio, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is developed, considering braking stability and energy recovery safety. The proposed strategy is validated on the dSPACE hard-in-loop platform under various simulated conditions, including different road conditions, braking intentions, and loads. The results demonstrate that braking intention, vehicle load, and road conditions all impact the regenerative braking process of electric vehicles. Moreover, the proposed regenerative braking control strategy significantly enhances the energy recovery rate and effectively reduces braking distance.},

  abstract     = {Compared to friction clutches, dog clutches have the advantages of high efficiency, small size, low cost, and large transmission torque; therefore, they are selected for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with a single electric motor (EM) driving the rear axle. In the dog clutch coupling process, the meshing of the teeth produces an impact, and dynamic control of the clutch faces problems of backlash and flexible shaft control. For an advanced dynamic study and subsequent improved performance, a novel dynamic estimation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm includes an observer for estimating the clutch torque, two piecewise-affine (PWA) estimators for estimating the torsion angle and half-shaft torque, and a state machine for indicating the backlash position. To demonstrate its feasibility, the convergence rate and observation error are investigated. Based on the information obtained through dynamic estimation, a second-order receding horizon sliding control (RHSC) approach is proposed. In dog clutch coupling, the speed deviation and tracing torque set points, which correspond to different backlash positions, are the control targets. Based on the second-order sliding mode structure, an optimization algorithm is developed and its convergence is studied. The performance of the estimator and control method is verified through road tests. The results show that the estimator can correctly indicate the system state and that the control method can improve the performance of the powertrain.},

In this approach, a new indicator called the cyclic impulse degree (CID) is designed based on the coefficient of variation of the impulse peak moment within a specified time-shifted periodic window, which allows for a generalization of impulsiveness and pseudo-cyclic periodicity to quantify the characteristics of bearing fault impacts. First, the normalized S transform (NST) highlights the energy distribution of fault impacts in the time–frequency plane, from which the CID is constructed to distinguish the cyclic impulses from random transients. Secondly, the NST slice at the frequency associated with the maximum integrated CID is used as a spare representation of fault impact response. Finally, the CIS derived from the NST slice presents the fault characteristic frequencies clearly and accurately. The numerical simulation and data processing results of the ABB faults demonstrated that the CIS can identify the multiple faults of ABB, but also exhibits good performance in resisting random transient interference and discriminating noise-contaminated periodic impulses caused by the bearing localized defects.},

  abstract     = {Energy management strategy (EMS) is regarded as a crucial measure to further leverage the benefits of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, existing EMSs often fail to balance applicability and optimality. As a widely recognized instantaneous optimization strategy, equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is considered to be competitive to achieve the desired performance, provided that equivalent factor (EF) is properly tuned. To achieve this goal, a rolling convergent ECMS for energy management of PHEV is proposed in this article. Instead of seeking the instantaneous solution solely from two-dimensional scale like traditional ECMS, this article extends the analysis to three-dimensional global scale. And the analytic expression of the optimal EF initial interval is derived, which can be quantitatively described by the component specifications of PHEV and driving condition information. Subsequently, inheriting the obtained optimal EF initial interval, a rolling convergent method using tabu search is developed for more efficient optimization. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation and experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the fuel economy of PHEV by 3.7% and 5.2% over that using the traditional adaptive ECMS under two real-world driving cycles, respectively. And the validity of the optimal EF initial interval is corroborated under several typical driving cycles. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is performed on the test bench, demonstrating its superiority and practicality.},

  abstract     = {Military aircraft are an excellent example of custom-designed power grids, powering a mix of both steady and transient intermittent loads. The electrical power system (EPS) in military aircraft like F-35, consists of two sets of 270 V-HVDC buses powering these loads. During real-time operation, switching in of these intermittent loads will lead to unequal loading of HVDC buses, resulting in overloading/underloading of HVDC buses and higher conduction losses on the overloaded bus. For satisfactory performance, both the HVDC buses in the EPS are overdesigned. This anomaly arises because, in the current architecture, there is no provision for controlled power exchange between the two HVDC buses. This article proposes a novel Triple-Active Bridge (TAB) converter-based solution to address this concern without adding extra weight to the overall system. To achieve optimal performance and operational efficiency for bidirectional power flow in HVDC buses, a novel decoupled current control integrated with duty-cycle optimization is proposed. Simulation results validating the decoupled bidirectional power flow control are presented in detail. Compared to conventional control (phase-control alone), the proposed algorithm results in at least a 30% reduction in conduction losses. A 1 kW hardware prototype is developed, and experimental results showing bidirectional power flow and higher operating efficiency are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Recently, to produce a large steering torque or ensure fault-tolerant control (FTC), dual motorized actuators for a steering system in automobiles have been emerged. In particular, the commercial vehicle requires an electrical-powered multiple motor based steering system generating large steering torque, which can replace the existing hydraulic steering one. However, the control of such system become more complicate than controlling of a single actuator and must deal with the unavoidable non-synchronous nature of multiple motors. In line with the trends and issues, many automobile manufacturers are currently paying attention to the robust and efficient motion controls of a dual-motor driving steer-by-wire (DSBW). Therefore, we proposed a novel synchronous motion control system of DSBW using passive decomposition and sliding mode control (SMC) techniques guaranteeing the passivity and robustness of the overall synchronized motion. Furthermore, the performance of proposed control system is validated through HILS of an actual DSBW using a developed vehicle model and an optimal finite preview control (OFPC) scheme tracking a specific test scenario, Double Lane Change (DLC). It is found that the motor-to-motor synchronization error and tracking one for the target reference trajectory are less than 1 degree, which sufficiently meets the requirement of automobiles manufacture company and is comparable to other existing approaches. We also investigated the tracking performance of the control system based on the different steering characteristics of OFPCs generated by the several preview times. Moreover, we investigated the tolerance level of proposed technique (without any additional FTC) against a partial fault condition in one of the motors and compared it with other control schemes in terms of tracking performance. This work will be valuable asset for those who wish to design the robust synchronous motion control of DSBW and construct the corresponding HILS of system considering different steering characteristics.},

Constant power (CP) operation (e.g., discharge or charge) is more representative of actual battery loadings in electric vehicle (EV) applications (e.g., EV acceleration, gradient climbing and regenerative braking) than constant current or constant voltage operation. However, relevant research on CP-based SOP estimation for LIBs in EVs is still rare. In this article, a novel model switching-based iterative algorithm is proposed for multi-constraint SOP estimation under a CP operation scenario. Two state-space models with implicit representations are constructed to describe the indirect relationships between a given CP over a prediction window and the maximum look-ahead current/voltage at the end of this window. An unscented Kalman filter-based correction strategy is applied to determine the dominant limitation factor so as to pinpoint battery SOP in high fidelity. Moreover, a SOP testing approach is designed to calibrate reference SOPs in high precision for validations. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy with a mean absolute error of less than 0.26 W under both static and dynamic conditions.},

Firstly, a robust H-infinity fault estimator with a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is established to estimate the real-time fault signal considering the external disturbance and parameter perturbation (i.g. longitudinal and lateral vehicle speed). Then, a SMPC controller framework is developed to alleviate the effect of inevitable evaluated estimation error while the vehicle lateral safety and vehicle speed tracking can be ensured. Finally, the hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests are conducted to prove the feasibility of SMPC controller. The experiment results indicate that the proposed controller framework can effectively preserve vehicle stability and keep vehicle in a healthy state with faster response compared with the traditional fault-tolerant controller.},

However, the low accuracy of current GPS remains a significant obstacle to achieving lane-level positioning. Although existing Cooperative Positioning (CP) approaches have managed to improve vehicle positioning accuracy to some degree, there are still obstacles to be overcome in terms of enhancing the timeliness and security. In this paper, we introduce a novel Blockchain-based Cooperative Mechanism in a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) environment (BCM-CAV), aimed at enhancing the positioning error, timeliness, and safety of the CP. In the BCM-CAV framework, the model of trajectory positioning error is designed using multiple Traffic Signs (TS) as the reference points. This model uses a Dueling Neural Network (DNN) architecture to correct the positioning of CAVs. Furthermore, We devise a model for the average position trajectory error of multiple vehicles that aims to minimize positioning errors for common vehicles traveling within the same region and road segment. The BCM-CAV framework encompasses a blockchain subsystem and an IoV subsystem, thereby establishing a connection between common vehicles, CAVs, and Road Side Units (RSUs). We design different smart contracts that satisfy the BCM-CAV sharing mechanism to guarantee secure and efficient information exchange. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the BCM-CAV enhances the accuracy of vehicle positioning, the security of information exchange, timeliness, and reduces the computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) distance ranging system is a critical component of transportation automation, including the railroad industry. Although the mainline rail traffic is strictly regulated by sophisticated train control and dispatching systems, self-propelled rail vehicles, such as maintenance-of-way equipment and light rail vehicles, still rely on the safety discretion of human operators. To support both safety protection and autonomous operations for these vehicles, a fine-grained V2V ranging system is needed. This paper presents our design of a decentralized, high-resolution, short distance V2V ranging system based on ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio (IR) technology, implemented by commercial UWB sensors and customized algorithms. A field-testing case study has been conducted to validate the system performance on full-sized self-propelled rail vehicles. The test results quantified the concerned performance parameters of UWB technology for the chosen use case and proved both the operational concepts and the functional design in this study. Our methodology in algorithm design, field-testing, and analytical data metrics should provide implications for applying UWB to other evolving use cases of intelligent rail transportation. At the end of this paper, we evaluate the system capability using ROS simulation and conclude the lessons learned from the system design.},

  abstract     = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is an essential networking protocol that connects multiple electronic control units (ECUs) in a vehicle. However, CAN-based in-vehicle networks (IVNs) face security risks owing to the CAN mechanisms. An adversary can sabotage a vehicle by leveraging the security risks if they can access the CAN bus. Thus, recent actions and cybersecurity regulations (e.g., UNR 155) require carmakers to implement intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in their vehicles. The IDS should detect cyberattacks and provide additional information to analyze conducted attacks. Although many IDSs have been proposed, considerations regarding their feasibility and explainability remain lacking. This study proposes X-CANIDS, which is a novel IDS for CAN-based IVNs. X-CANIDS dissects the payloads in CAN messages into human-understandable signals using a CAN database. The signals improve the intrusion detection performance compared with the use of bit representations of raw payloads. These signals also enable an understanding of which signal or ECU is under attack. X-CANIDS can detect zero-day attacks because it does not require any labeled dataset in the training phase. We confirmed the feasibility of the proposed method through a benchmark test on an automotive-grade embedded device with a GPU. The results of this work will be valuable to carmakers and researchers considering the installation of in-vehicle IDSs for their vehicles.},

Specially, a novel intermediate estimator-assisted proportional-integral observer (PIO) is constructed to simultaneously estimate systems states, sensor and actuator faults. By utilizing the output of PIO, a disturbance observer is designed to reconstruct the external disturbances.

However, for plug-in hybrid vehicles, eco-driving control usually involves three problems, including speed planning, SOC planning, and energy management. Solving the above three problems requires considering not only the fuel economy but also the computational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy to improve driving comfort and fuel economy simultaneously for a PHEV. Specifically, three main contributions are presented to distinguish our efforts from the existing research. First, in the control framework, the traffic light information is utilized to calculate optimal driving speed by minimizing a multi-objective function. Then, the SOC planning problem is solved by convex optimization, while the fuel consumption is minimized by a predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Second, the speed trajectories and fuel consumptions in the other two traffic scenarios with different traffic light SPaT (Signal Phasing and Timing) are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the robustness with respect to prediction horizon length, initial co-state value, and gain coefficient value are analyzed and discussed.},

In the proposed strategy, the planning stage of the merging coordination is weakened while the control stage is strengthened. More specifically, the planning stage mainly forms a virtual platoon containing all vehicles inside the communication zone. In the control stage, the time-varying parameter uncertainties in the model are considered. A spatial-dependent controller with uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness and robustness is delicately designed for each vehicle in the virtual platoon to analytically calculate the control force in real time. The spatial-dependence means that the safety-related performances of the controller are directly and explicitly bonded with spatial locations such that the collision-avoidance safety is ensured at the most dangerous conflicting merging zone. Since spatial locations in the traffic environment are static, this spatial-dependence endows the proposed strategy more stability and reliability. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through the verification, ablation and comparison simulation cases.},

However, in high-speed mobile states, vehicles face an uncertain communication environment, making it difficult to meet the demand for multi-vehicle cooperative control. To address the existing research deficiencies, this paper investigates a UAV-assisted multi-vehicle cooperative platoon system. The paper aims to improve the communication success probability between vehicles and UAV nodes while mitigating the velocity perturbations generated by the platoon during travel. Specifically, we design a platoon controller based on a discrete double integral model and a joint optimization model for resource scheduling of air-ground communication. This model can flexibly adjust the communication resource allocation of each platooning vehicle within each timeslot according to the communication link. Due to the complex coupling between the variables of the objective function and the constraints of the optimization problem, we design an optimization iterative solution method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization method through simulation experiments compared to benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular crowdsensing is an efficient method of data collection in cities, benefiting from the powerful moving and sensing capabilities of intelligent vehicles. Modeling sensing capacities of vehicles and analyzing sensing effect based on sensor setup schemes are crucial in vehicular crowdsensing system. If we can infer the sensing strength of vehicles towards surrounding spatial points in advance, it would facilitate the determination of which vehicles to recruit for uploading sensing data, thereby achieving uniform and wide sensing coverage. However, the sensing strength of vehicles is not considered in the current research due to the diversity of sensors deployed on vehicles and the complexity of spatial relationships among vehicles in actual traffic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a predictive vehicle recruitment method based on spatial sensing strength analysis. First, a fine-grained method is proposed to analyze the sensing strength of vehicles with different sensor setup schemes at various points in space. We fuse the sensing results of multiple vehicles and design novel metrics to evaluate the overall sensing effect, which comprehensively consider sensing strength, uniformity, and coverage ratio. The proposed method innovatively combines the perceptual properties of actual sensors and the complex spatiotemporal relationships among vehicles. Then, to guarantee the timeliness of recruiting vehicles, we distinguish moving modes to predict vehicle movements and further obtain the spatial sensing strength of vehicles at a specific moment in the future. Furthermore, combined with the sensing and communicating capabilities of the roadside infrastructure, the vehicle recruitment problem is described as an optimization problem under multiple practical constraints. To address this problem, an online heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the predicted vehicles&#39; sensing strength. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations based on a real dataset to visualize vehicle sensing effect and verify the superiority of the proposed scheme.},

However, existing studies tend to investigate them separately or assume they were synchronous and instantaneous, failing to deeply interpret their interconnections in autonomous driving. To address it, this study explored driving decision and motion planning in an integrated manner, and proposed a double-layer reinforcement learning (RL) framework to couple and optimize these two modules. Specifically, on the upper layer of the framework, a trajectory-level reward function associated with safety, efficiency, comfort and decision execution was proposed, and a decision-making model was established based on value function-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Then, the reward function of the upper layer was taken as the objective function of the lower layer with relevant state constraints. The model predictive control (MPC) method was used to derive the optimal maneuver sequence guided by driving decisions, and the performance evaluation of motion planning was fed back to the decision-making for DRL parameter optimization. Accordingly, a closed-loop mechanism was developed consisting of forward decision-making output guidance and backward motion planning feedback optimization. Then, two-lane and three-lane interactive scenarios were set for framework training and testing. Last, comparative experiments were conducted using NGSIM dataset. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and the enhanced driving performance of the proposed framework in contrast to four benchmarks.},

However, it is challenging to provide simultaneously all intelligent applications for smart trains due to limited on-board computing resources.

Recent studies focused on single collaboration strategy (i.e., early, intermediate, or late collaboration). However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between accuracy and transmission data size. To overcome this limitation, a region-based hybrid collaborative perception architecture for connected autonomous vehicles is proposed in this study. Specifically, data is divided into two types according to the overlapping area between the detection ranges of vehicles. For the overlapping area, intermediate collaboration is applied by sharing and fusing the features from different vehicles. The fusion model comprises the proposed cross-agents attention and global context attention modules to adaptively highlight the critical features and capture the long-range dependency, thereby improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, an object detection head based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed to enhance the robustness to location noise. For the non-overlapping area, late collaboration is conducted by generating and sharing the local detection result with an economic bandwidth. Finally, the experiment with the OPV2V dataset is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. The results show that the proposed architecture achieved 83.6% AP, outperforming the state-of-art methods. Additionally, the experiments also prove that the network with GMM module is more robust to noise.},

  abstract     = {The increasing prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has generated a demand for reliable detection systems. The inappropriate use of drones presents potential security and privacy hazards, particularly concerning sensitive facilities. Consequently, a critical necessity revolves around the development of a proficient system with the capability to precisely identify UAVs and other flying objects even in challenging scenarios. Although advancements have been made in deep learning models, obstacles such as computational intricacies, precision limitations, and scalability issues persist. To overcome those obstacles, we proposed the concept of MultiFeatureNet (MFNet), a solution that enhances feature representation by capturing the most concentrated feature maps. Additionally, we present MultiFeatureNet-Feature Attention (MFNet-FA), a technique that adaptively weights different channels of the input feature maps. To meet the requirements of multi-scale detection, we presented the versions of MFNet and MFNet-FA, namely the small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The outcomes reveal notable performance enhancements. For optimal bird detection, MFNet-M (Ablation study 2) achieves an impressive precision of 99.8%, while for UAV detection, MFNet-L (Ablation study 2) achieves a precision score of 97.2%. Among the options, MFNet-FA-S (Ablation study 3) emerges as the most resource-efficient alternative, considering its small feature map size, computational demands (GFLOPs), and operational efficiency (in frame per second). This makes it particularly suitable for deployment on hardware with limited capabilities. Additionally, MFNet-FA-S (Ablation study 3) stands out for its swift real-time inference and multiple-object detection due to the incorporation of the FA module. The proposed MFNet-L with the focus module (Ablation study 2) demonstrates the most remarkable classification outcomes, boasting an average precision of 98.4%, average recall of 96.6%, average mean average precision (mAP) of 98.3%, and average intersection over union (IoU) of 72.8%.},

  abstract     = {Drones are a vital part of our daily lives because of their flexible flying nature and low operation and maintenance costs. Navigation is the most important aspect in the autonomous drone era. With that being said, recent studies have tackled the greatly challenging task of obtaining the most feasible and safest path. In this work, we focus on safe and reliable unmanned aerial vehicle navigation in densely populated city environments to efficiently follow the lane. We present herein a deep learning method through which a drone can autonomously navigate by following a lane in a dynamic urban environment. This drone perceives the environment by using two cameras facing front and down. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to capture the high-level feature representation through the attention and residual mechanism of the drone&#39;s raw visual inputs. The CNN concurrent pipelines used for three raw visual inputs can output high-level features and follow the concurrent feature fusion into the self-head attention mechanism that encapsulates both dynamic and static information to predict yaw and linear velocity. These predictions are modulated into the final control commands to obtain smooth and continuous inputs that are delivered to the drone. The experimental evaluation results show that the proposed method can learn the drone&#39;s navigation strategy for a lane following a guidance system. The high performance of the trained navigation policy is observed in the simulations with different scenarios. In conclusion, our proposed approach outperforms both existing and current state-of-the-art ImageNet models.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a captivating research paradigm to increase computing resources for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, the allocation of the best possible computing resources is challenging due to the enormous growth of services in vehicular networks, such as augmented reality, 3-D gaming, autonomous driving, etc., and their severe delay limitations, processing demands, and mobility of vehicles. Mainly, achieving strict task latency is a challenging problem while vehicles traverse through the roadside unit (RSU) regions. In this work, the vehicle&#39;s task processing latency and energy consumption are considered by deciding which tasks should be scheduled to either the local RSU or the neighbour RSUs along the vehicle&#39;s path. We study the mobility-aware task scheduling problem to jointly optimize the service latency of the tasks and energy consumption of the vehicles. Initially, we employ the Markov renewal process (MRP) to model the vehicle&#39;s mobility. Subsequently, we establish that our proposed objective function is a monotone submodular function and provide a greedy heuristic for the maximization of the submodular function with an approximation of ( $1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}$ ). Further, we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms to solve mobility-aware task scheduling problems for large-scale networks. We compare our proposed algorithm with existing mobility-aware scheduling approaches and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently for task scheduling problems.},

  abstract     = {To safely and successfully navigate complex and dense driving scenes, automated vehicles need to develop situational awareness, which requires understanding the current behavior and states of their surrounding traffic participants as well as reasoning about their future intent and motions. One considerable challenge is to estimate the distribution of future motions of surrounding agents considering the uncertainty in driving behavior. Most recent works model this uncertainty through multimodality and forecasting diverse modes of future motions. However, these methods may assign a high probability to several unlikely predictions with infeasible outcomes that are neither realistic nor scene-compliant. To address this issue, we propose conditioning future behavior of agents on grid-based plans modeled as a Markov decision process. We design a novel Context-Aware behavior Prediction system for Heterogeneous Agents (CAPHA) based on inverse reinforcement learning. More specifically, CAPHA works based on mapping the scene and kinematic features into rewards and learning a policy through a value iteration network which is further sampled and fed to stacked transformers and the behavior decoder to generate multiple plausible motions. We evaluate the performance of CAPHA on two large-scale motion forecasting datasets with heterogeneous agents, and the experiments show our model&#39;s high performance and efficiency. The results indicate that CAPHA outperforms several state-of-the-art models by generating diverse and scene-compliant motions.},

By analyzing the coupled waves of the reference array and the reflected wave introduced by the PRDL, two-layer PRDLs are designed step-by-step. Compared to the array with only one-layer PRDL, the array with two-layer PRDLs can not only suppress various types of couplings but also improve the radiation performance. These PRDLs, which both have high dielectric constants in the two-dimensional plane, are composed of non-uniform artificial unit cells that are capable of reducing the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) of the antennas while reducing the mutual coupling effectively. Simulated and measured results show that the isolation between antennas can be improved from 12 dB to more than 21 dB in the 1.71–2.2 GHz band, while the reflection coefficient remains below −15 dB. Compared with the reference array with no decoupling measures, the radiation pattern of the proposed array remains stable and the realized gain is increased. The proposed method is quite suitable for decoupling large-scale rectangular 5G MIMO arrays.},

This last feature could permit new ways of installation with respect to the standards adopted today by car manufacturer (behind bumpers or in car body). Instead of seeing the radar as an external device to be installed on the car it could be part of the initial project and included into the design process of a plug-in part. In this article the integrated design and prototyping of 77 GHz automotive radar into a modern car rear lamp is presented. The radar Printed Circuit Board (PCB) has been designed to fit into the lamp without affecting the external look; the optimization of the material thickness of the radar cover and temperature tests have been performed on the system. The embedded radar processing has been implemented on a monolithic chip to perform target tracking and the main processing steps are reported. The results obtained from tests in controlled environment and on the road in traffic scenarios show that including the radar into the design of a lamp from the beginning is a feasible solution. This approach brings some advantages such as: improved placing and connections, undisturbed view, better protection from disturbances and accidents and provides more customized solutions for the car makers.},

Considering the fading effects of obstacles over longer transmission distances, in this article, we equip reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to reflect the uplink signals from the ground vehicle transmitter (VT) to high altitude platform (HAP). The HAP then acts as a relay to forward the signals to satellites through hybrid free space optics (FSO) links. This article focuses on optimizing the system ergodic sum rate in SAGINs. To address the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems, an asymmetric long short-term memory (LSTM)-deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, called AL-DDPG, is proposed. The AL-DDPG algorithm leverages hidden states in partially observable Markov states using a memory inference method to address the training convergence problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the AL-DDPG algorithm, with a 16% improvement in the system sum rate compared to the traditional optimization algorithm. Besides, we provide insights into the impacts of various factors on system performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in Internet technology and IoT devices have facilitated researchers to foster a wide range of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that improve the quality of automated transportation by addressing real-time safety and traffic management issues. The participating ITS agents, such as smart cars and roadside equipment, are required to communicate urgently through an open (unsecured) wireless channel in an unattended setting. To address the security issues, several vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication and access control protocols have been proposed in recent times. However, fast-moving vehicles need to set up frequent authentication with different roadside units, which induces high computation and communication overheads. Consequently, it becomes a bottleneck for the resource-limited vehicle onboard unit devices. As the blockchain supports decentralized storage with data integrity and transparency, in this article, we design a secure and lightweight Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-enabled blockchain-based access control protocol with a handover authentication facility (we call it BACHP-IoV, in short). The handover authentication mechanism exploits no computation-costly cryptographic primitives. Once the transactions or messages have been securely gathered by a roadside unit (RSU), $RSU_{j}$ , residing in a group of vehicles $Vh_{i}$ , will form a partial block, which is later forwarded to a cloud server node in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers blockchain network for converting it into a full block. Next, the full blocks are mined using a voting-based consensus algorithm. In addition, the in-charge trusted authority $\mathcal {TA}$ uploads information about the registered vehicles, such as randomized masked passwords and random secrets, to the blockchain. Thus, an $RSU_{j}$ can check the authenticity of a particular vehicle as well. We prove the security strength of the proposed BACHP-IoV by using the well-known Real-or-Random (ROR)-based random oracle model, the ProVerif 2.03 simulation tool, and informal security analysis. We have implemented the proposed BACHP-IoV through network simulator 3 (NS-3) and blockchain, and the simulation results demonstrate that BACHP-IoV is practical in a real-life scenario. A detailed comparative analysis also shows that BACHP-IoV provides significantly better security and efficiency than the existing competing schemes.},

Therefore, the transmission and computation of the task can be executed almost simultaneously. Moreover, to minimize the average latency, we first prove the optimization of corresponding tasks is quasi-convex, then provide an optimal solution to determine the blocklength and the size of subtasks.

Motivated by its robustness and scalability, it is promising to employ RSMA in integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN), where a satellite serves satellite users (SUs) broadly with a multibeam multicast transmission while terrestrial base station (BS) serves cellular users (CUs) with a unicast transmission, operating in the same frequency band. To avoid the data exchange between satellite/cellular networks via backhaul, we assume a coordinated ISTN relying on imperfect channel state information. We put forth a coordinated RSMA framework tailored to the coordinated ISTN by applying inter-network rate-splitting (RS) with a super-common message on top of intra-network RS with common/private messages. With the unified RS design for inter- and intra-networks, we jointly optimize the precoding and power allocation of the private/common/super-common messages to achieve max-min fairness among all SUs and CUs through successive convex approximation. By doing so, the power of the super-common message can be adjusted according to interference levels of the satellite towards CUs, thereby potentially mitigating inter-network interference. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our approach to cope with various interference and propagation conditions.},

  abstract     = {In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), it is difficult to guarantee uniform wireless connectivity satisfying quality of service (QoS) on users&#39; minimum rates because of intensive and capricious inter-cell interference. Therefore, user association (UA) and resource allocation (RA) should be carefully designed at all interfering base stations (BSs) to enhance the achievable QoS on users&#39; minimum rates. However, existing UA frameworks mainly focus on improving sum-rate and proportional fairness, which often results in frequent failure to guarantee minimum rate QoS. In addition, most of them require global channel state information (CSI) or time-consuming iterative optimization. Hence, existing UA approaches cannot be applied under practical conditions such as fast time-varying channels and highly limited information exchange among the BSs. To cope with these practical conditions, we propose a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based joint UA and RA scheme to maximize the minimum rate, i.e., max-min fairness (MMF), with highly limited information exchange among the BSs. The proposed DRL algorithm optimizes UA at each BS in a distributed manner to maximize an MMF objective function with only local CSI and without any iterative process. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes and CSI-exchange-based schemes under various scenarios with fast time-varying channels and highly limited information exchange among the BSs.},

However, due to the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of spectrum data, spectrum prediction has always been a challenging problem. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a multi-band spectrum prediction method based on attention graph convolutional recurrent neural networks (A-GCRNN), which applies temporal correlation and frequency band correlation to spectrum prediction tasks. This method represents the spectrum data of multiple bands as a graph, with each band corresponding to a node in the graph, and utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the correlations between different bands. Then, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is employed to capture temporal correlations for each band, thereby fusing the acquired feature information to predict the future spectrum of each frequency band. In addition, an attention network is used to weight the output hidden states and further enhance the model&#39;s convergence rate. We conduct experiments on a real-world spectrum dataset and compare our method with other spectrum prediction methods. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance in multi-band spectrum prediction tasks.},

Specifically, by optimizing the power control and spectrum allocation, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to characterize the tradeoff among two critical performance metrics: a) total power consumption minimization (primary); b) sum rate maximization (secondary). Due to the intractability of this non-convex problem, we first adopt the primal decomposition method to decompose the formulated problem. Next, we theoretically derive the explicit expression of optimal power control policies. Then, we transform the spectrum allocation problem as a bipartite graph maximum matching problem, which can be tackled by the Hungarian algorithm. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed resource management algorithm achieves a desirable balance among two performance metrics.},

However, the introduction of multiple radio-frequency (RF) chains at the MIMO transmitter becomes a bottleneck due to high implementation cost. To address this challenge, we propose a novel phase-shifter-aided spatial multiplexing (PSSM) scheme, which utilizes phase shifters for multi-stream transmissions with reduced RF chains. Furthermore, the multiplexing-diversity tradeoff is studied through theoretical analysis for such system to illustrate its advantage, meanwhile the performance bound in terms of bit-error rate (BER) is quantified. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PSSM scheme over its conventional counterparts in terms of BER, especially under high transmission rate requirements.},

Considering Rician fading channels and a bounded noise uncertainty model, the detection performance at the legitimate receiver and warden is thoroughly analyzed. Then, the optimal design of the transmit power and IRS reflection matrix is proposed for maximizing the detection performance at the legitimate transceiver subject to a covertness constraint (i.e., the detection accuracy at the warden is less than a specific tolerable level). Our design is solely based on the line-of-sight (LoS) channel components and thus partially eliminates the need for acquiring the IRS&#39;s instantaneous channels, which takes a step towards the practical deployment of IRS. Our examination shows that IRS can still improve the covert detection performance even when only the LoS channel components are known and the improvement increases as the LoS components become more dominant.},

However, it is still an open problem for efficient joint channel estimation and OTFS symbol detection based on superimposed pilot-data placement schemes. In this work, an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) based joint channel estimation and detection algorithm with the aid of mean-field (MF) message passing is proposed. In particular, soft information corresponding to the effective channel matrix and data symbols are fed OAMP-based symbol detector and channel estimator via MF, respectively. Thanks to the MF message passing rules, enhanced error performance is brought by iterative information exchange between the OTFS detector and the channel estimator. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed iterative algorithm can efficiently detect the data symbols without the use of guard space.},

For the user association subproblem, we propose a gradually approaching upper bound (GAUB) algorithm to construct a moderate and efficient association.

  abstract     = {Compressed wideband spectrum sensing has attracted much interest in recent years, which enables flexible spectrum sharing to improve the efficiency of scarce frequency resource. Despite the great potential for sub-Nyquist-rate sampling, existing high-accurate compression sensing (CS) methods unfortunately incur the extremely high computational complexity, e.g., in recovering the sparse signal or estimating the a priori information on sparsity. This creates a serious challenge in deploying real-time wideband sensing in the resource constraint platforms. In this work, we develop a fast compressed spectrum sensing method, which achieves accurate performance but also greatly reduces the computational complexity. Our new method jointly exploits the low-rank and sparse properties of a sub-Nyquist measurement matrix. We first design a low-complexity sparsity estimator, by approximating a large covariance matrix with multiple small matrices. To recover the sparse spectrum, we then formulate one low-dimensional non-convex optimization problem via random orthogonal projection, which makes the CS method more computationally efficient. As demonstrated on real datasets, our method reduces the computational complexity of wideband spectrum sensing by $\sim\! 10\times$ ; moreover, it achieves highly accurate results without compromising the reconstruction/sensing performance. Thus, it has great promise for real-time sub-Nyquist sensing on low-complexity platforms.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and intelligent vehicular networks has led to the widespread deployment of massive long-range (LoRa) nodes. These nodes play a crucial role in facilitating the sharing of critical information towards various vehicles. However, a significant challenge that persists is the secure authentication of LoRa. Recently, radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) emerges as a robust potential solution, offering both rapid and scalable identification capabilities. By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, the inherent hardware-level, unique, and resilient features of RFF can be thoroughly explored. Given the inherent non-identical (heterogeneity) of LoRa networks and the non-stationary characteristics of chirp signals, conventional approaches prove inadequate in effectively capturing the RFF features. To surmount these challenges, a novel scheme termed as “deep federated learning network (DFLNet)” is proposed. DFLNet facilitates distributed RFF learning while ensuring privacy preservation within diverse LoRa networks. Addressing the heterogeneity of datasets, we incorporate an adaptive optimizer that contributes to the efficient convergence improvement. The DFLNet adaptively manages computational demands and privacy concerns through the utilization of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, thus enabling distributed learning. Empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of DFLNet, attaining an impressive identification accuracy of up to approximately 96.7% utilizing merely around 5000 samples per client, while concurrently ensuring a robust privacy preservation.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the age of information (AoI) minimization design in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is adopted in the uplink (UL) phase. We formulate an AoI minimization problem to optimize the transmit/receive beamformers, phase shift vector, information-user (IU) selection, UL/downlink (DL) time allocation and decoding order subject to the power budget constraint of the base station, the unit-modulus constraints of the reflecting elements and the energy harvesting (EH) constraints of the energy users. The considered problem is decomposed into three subproblems, and then solved by a proposed alternating optimization-based algorithm. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate the impacts on AoI by adopting RIS and NOMA as well as the system parameters. Besides, the trade-off between information freshness and the EH is revealed through the impact of EH requirement on the IU selection and UL/DL time allocation.},

In calculating the soft estimates that are fed back to the iterative soft cancellation, existing full extrinsic information based method subtracts the entire a priori information from the a posteriori probability (APP) outputs from the decoder. In the proposed element-wise extrinsic information method, only the a priori information w.r.t the specific path (a single-element from the observation) in OTFS system is subtracted from the decoder&#39;s APP outputs. We show that the proposed approach outperforms existing a posteriori probability and full extrinsic information based iterative detection by 2 dB and 1 dB, respectively. Further, we apply extrinsic information transfer chart curve-fitting technique to optimize the code profile of the propose scheme. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs within 0.5 dB of the capacity limit of OTFS.},

One of the most important use cases of AI in wireless communications is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, due to the superior AI capability of learning the best possible decision-making in complex transceiver structures. In this study, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) receiver structure for spatial media-based modulation (SMBM)-MIMO systems, which detects the symbols in an end-to-end manner. Instead of a conventional two-stage approach, which handles channel estimation and symbol detection separately, the proposed DNN receiver recovers the transmitted symbols directly, utilizing an offline training process. It is demonstrated that while the proposed DNN receiver structure and conventional maximum likelihood (ML) receiver utilizing linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation, perform similarly for a single receive antenna case, DNN is superior for multiple receive antenna cases. We conclude that using DNNs in SMBM with multi-antenna receivers can provide higher performance and thus permits higher data transmission rates in addition to the reduced receiver complexity due to the removing channel estimation process.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-high-resolution target sensing has emerged as a key enabler for various cutting-edge applications, which can be realized by utilizing the millimeter wave/terahertz frequencies. However, the extremely high operating frequency inevitably leads to significant Doppler shift effects, especially for high-mobility applications, causing the degradation of sensing performance with high false alarm rate. To this end, this article proposes a parameter design methodology of the well-known constant amplitude zero auto correlation (CAZAC) sequences, which aims at enhancing their resilience to Doppler shifts. Specifically, we suppress the sidelobes incurred by Doppler shifts for the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) improvement within the range of interest (RoI) of the radar range profile. 1 The Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence, as a representative member in the CAZAC family, is firstly considered. The impacts of its root index on range sidelobes are investigated based on number theory. For an arbitrary-length ZC sequence, a feasible range of the root index is derived to satisfy the requirement of PSLR within the scope of RoI. Furthermore, these design guidelines are extended to a general form of CAZAC sequences, where a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is developed for PSLR improvement. Simulation results demonstrate that under severe Doppler shifts, our proposed methodology could enhance the sensing performance by lowering the false alarm rate while maintaining the same detection rate, compared with its classical counterpart.},

We develop a preprocessing method to improve noise-robustness by zero-padding useless signals and use a Siamese Networks-based few-shot training scheme for RFF recognition. The method is evaluated on a real-world ADS-B dataset, showing that signal preprocessing increases aircraft recognition accuracy by approximately 20% compared to using raw signals directly in small sample cases.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-assisted Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) has proven to be capable of offering great spectral efficiency at low power. In contrast, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has proven to be capable of improving coverage. Consequently, efforts have been made to integrate those technologies. However, thorough model development and analysis are necessary to benefit from such coexistence. In this study, we analyze the performance of a Power Domain (PD)-NOMA-enabled base station acting as a source in a multiple-user IRS-assisted AmBC system. The main approach we take is to use PD-NOMA to send a signal from the base station to the IRS that has both modulated (with a primary message) and unmodulated carrier components. In addition to relaying the primary message, the IRS will then send its (secondary) message to user devices utilizing the unmodulated carrier and Binary Phase-shift Keying (BPSK). Then, using a Band Pass Filter (BPF) and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), the user devices decode their respective messages from the received signals. To obtain further understanding, we derived novel closed-form expressions for the Outage Probabilities (OPs) and also provided asymptotic assessments of the OPs. Our results show that raising the IRS element count enhances the OPs. Additionally, devices&#39; outage performance is impaired due to the imperfections in SIC. Furthermore, we found that a device&#39;s OP rises as the power allocation factor increases. Lastly, we found that the NOMA-based IRS-assisted system outperforms OMA-based systems in terms of outages.},

However, the harsh requirement of perfect alignment of the transceiver beams introduces great challenges to OAM-IM wireless communications. Therefore, we first propose an angle of arrival (AoA)-based robust detector for the misaligned OAM-IM system, which explicitly estimates the AoA of the OAM beam and then utilizes the estimate to detect the transmitted symbols. To further reduce the system overhead and complexity, we propose another deep learning (DL)-based robust detector, which implicitly estimates the AoA and directly recovers the transmitted information bits. By using the dataset collected through simulation, the first step is to train the DL-based robust detector offline to minimize the mean-squared error, and the second step is to use the trained model for real-time OAM-IM signal detection online. Numerical simulations validate that the both proposed robust detectors can address the channel distortion in OAM channels with beam misalignment and achieve superior bit error rate (BER) performance at high spectral efficiency. Moreover, the proposed DL-based robust detector is less complicated on runtime than the traditional OAM-IM detector.},

We analyze and derive closed-form expressions for secrecy metrics for both cases with the availability of global and partial channel state information (CSI), respectively. Specifically, we jointly design beamforming at the source and destination to enhance the secrecy performance to the greatest extent possible. With joint optimization of the power allocation ratio, between the source and destination, and the secrecy outage probability constraint, we can further obtain the maximum secrecy rate and secrecy throughput. This study determines that the optimal hybrid beamforming matrix for the jamming signal is a rank-1 matrix. Simulation results illustrate that our designed secrecy transmission scheme with FD jamming receiver outperforms conventional half-duplex (HD) methods even when residual self-interference (SI) is considered. As a result of adequately designing the beamforming of the jamming signal, the secrecy of FD mmWave system is no longer constrained by SI in the multi-antenna case.

  abstract     = {This article studies the UAV trajectory planning (UtraP) problem in a UAV-enabled data collection (DC) system where a UAV executes a DC mission in a geographical area with multiple ground monitoring areas and multiple ground base stations (GBSs). The problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the UAV&#39;s mission completion time by jointly optimizing GBS and UAV association variables, the UAV&#39;s flying speeds, and the UAV&#39;s path, taking into account the time constraint of data, the energy consumption constraint of the UAV, and the mitigation of interference on ground users. To solve the formulated problem, we decompose the problem into three sub-problems: GBS and UAV association optimization, UAV speed optimization and UAV path optimization. Three successive convex approximation based algorithms are proposed to solve the sub-problems. In addition, a block coordinate descent based trajectory optimization algorithm (BCD-TO) is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BCD-TO algorithm outperforms a benchmark algorithm in terms of the mission completion time.},

In this case, some organizations may try to obtain the global model without contributing their local training power, lowering the social welfare. In this article, we model the interactions among organizations in cross-silo FL as a public goods game and theoretically prove that there exists a social dilemma where the maximum social welfare is not achieved in Nash equilibrium. To overcome this dilemma, we employ the Multi-player Multi-action Zero-Determinant (MMZD) strategy to maximize the social welfare. With the help of the MMZD, an individual organization can unilaterally control the social welfare without extra cost. Since the MMZD strategy can be adopted by all organizations, we further study the case of multiple organizations jointly adopting the MMZD strategy to form an MMZD Alliance (MMZDA). We prove that the MMZDA strategy can strengthen the control of the maximum social welfare. Experimental results validate that the MMZD strategy is effective in obtaining the maximum social welfare and the MMZDA can achieve a larger maximum value.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of multiple signals is pivotal in sensor array signal processing. A popular multi-signal DoA estimation method is the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which enables high-performance super-resolution DoA recovery while being highly applicable in practice. MUSIC is a model-based algorithm, relying on an accurate mathematical description of the relationship between the signals and the measurements and assumptions on the signals themselves (non-coherent, narrowband sources). As such, it is sensitive to model imperfections. In this work, we propose to overcome these limitations of MUSIC by augmenting the algorithm with specifically designed neural architectures. Our proposed deep augmented MUSIC (DA-MUSIC) algorithm is thus a hybrid model-based/data-driven DoA estimator, which leverages data to improve performance and robustness while preserving the interpretable flow of the classic method. DA-MUSIC is shown to learn to overcome limitations of the purely model-based method, such as its inability to successfully localize coherent sources as well as estimate the number of coherent signal sources present. We further demonstrate the superior resolution of the DA-MUSIC algorithm in synthetic narrowband and broadband scenarios as well as with real-world data of DoA estimation from seismic signals.},

  abstract     = {Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have adopted pure ALOHA systems as medium access control (MAC) protocol. Since pure ALOHA works asynchronously, it can reduce the cost of the system and devices and make the devices small by eliminating the time-synchronization hardware. However, its maximum throughput is limited only up to 0.183 (packets/sec). To overcome such a low throughput limit, this work proposes a novel asynchronous random access (RA) system that can yield the maximum throughput as good as slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA). In the proposed system, the users transmit their packets as in pure ALOHA but trigger their feedback timer upon (re)transmission. When a collision occurs, the feedback timers enable the users who have transmitted the first and last packets in the collision to retransmit one after another right after the collision. Under some conditions, one or two users can retransmit successfully right after the collision, which improves the throughput significantly. This work analyzes the saturation throughput of the proposed system and proposes an optimal online backoff algorithm to maximize the throughput of the unsaturated traffic system.},

With the advent of promising concepts such as the Internet of Space Things (IoST), the potential for applying edge computing in space has become particularly appealing. In particular, in-orbit computing services are provided employing edge servers placed on satellites, which can inherently offer storage and computation capacity. However, an open problem is to find out onboard which satellite edge servers should be placed and how distributed edge computing services could be offered. In this respect, this article proposes satellite-terrestrial integrated edge computing networks (STECN), aiming at minimizing the average response latency and average energy consumption by jointly selecting the optimal deployment of servers and services. First, we propose a general network framework for the STECN. Then, we develop a heuristic algorithm based on K-medoids clustering and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to solve the optimization problem. Specifically, we achieve the optimal placement of edge servers by exploiting the K-medoids clustering method. In terms of service deployment, the conducted performance analysis shows that the proposed solutions can approach the Pareto Front using the NSGA-II technique. Finally, the proposed heuristic algorithm is compared with two benchmark algorithms by means of simulations, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work considering server placement and service deployment in STECN.},

  abstract     = {In remote areas, natural disasters owing to extreme weather or other causes can easily spread regionally. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as pioneers for exploration and sensing in post-disaster scenarios due to their characteristics of flexible deployment and low cost. Considering the network disconnection caused by the long distances between the sensing area, UAVs, and the ground station (GS), this article aims to maximize the spatial exploration ratio (SER) while minimizing energy consumption with connectivity maintenance. To ensure that the UAV swarm successfully transmits as much post-disaster data as possible back, we develop a worst-case soft actor critic (WCSAC) based deployment algorithm with role management for UAVs. First, we formulate the three-dimensional (3D) UAV deployment problem as a real-time single-step Markov decision process (CMDP), together with role management that includes role assignment and role switching for each UAV. Next, to avoid unlimited energy consumption for complete coverage of remote mission areas, we separate the reward and cost functions and translate the energy consumption minimization to the residual energy constraints with a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Finally, visualizations and numerical results prove that the proposed WCSAC-cntRM can strike a better trade-off among the valid SER, energy consumption, and network connectivity than other benchmarks, especially when the emergency mission is dynamically triggered in the corner area.},

Nevertheless, the unique demand for background knowledge matching makes it challenging to achieve efficient wireless resource management for multiple users in SemCom-enabled networks (SC-Nets). To this end, this article investigates SemCom from a networking perspective, where two fundamental problems of user association (UA) and bandwidth allocation (BA) are systematically addressed in the SC-Net. First, considering varying knowledge matching states between mobile users and associated base stations, we identify two general SC-Net scenarios, namely perfect knowledge matching-based SC-Net and imperfect knowledge matching-based SC-Net. Afterward, for each SC-Net scenario, we describe its distinctive semantic channel model from the semantic information theory perspective, whereby a concept of bit-rate-to-message-rate transformation is developed along with a new semantics-level metric, namely system throughput in message (STM), to measure the overall network performance. In this way, we then formulate a joint STM-maximization problem of UA and BA for each SC-Net scenario, followed by a corresponding optimal solution proposed. Numerical results in both scenarios demonstrate significant superiority and reliability of our solutions in the STM performance compared with two benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of communication-based train control (CBTC) system within urban rail transport has improved the efficiency of safe train operations. At the same time, the CBTC system enhances the reliability of the train system and lowers latency of the data transmission. Nevertheless, there are still certain critical issues that need to be considered in the CBTC: 1) limited coverage and high maintenance costs of wayside equipment; 2) multiple ground devices configuration and complex system architecture; and 3) insufficient computing capacity of the train leads to heavy latency and energy consumption. To cope with the above problems, in this article, the multi-hop ad hoc network coexisting with train-to-train communication and train-to-wayside communication is applied to simplify the networking architecture, together with the employment of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to provide massive computing and communication resources for trains. Meantime, a new CBTC framework is developed for computing offloading and resource allocation via multi-hop ad hoc network and MEC. Offloading decisions, offloading ratio, computing and communication resource allocation are integrated to minimize latency and energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem that is transformed into a solvable convex problem, and the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers-based (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that our proposed method has remarkable advantages over other schemes.},

  abstract     = {5G NR V2X has been designed to support advanced connected and automated driving V2X services. These services are characterized by variable traffic patterns that can generate packet collisions in decentralized systems where vehicles autonomously select their radio resources like 5G NR V2X mode 2. 5G NR V2X introduces a re-evaluation mechanism at the MAC layer to detect and avoid possible packet collisions before a vehicle transmits in selected resources. Most of the studies conducted to date on 5G NR V2X do not consider the re-evaluation mechanism despite being a mandatory MAC feature. This article advances the state of the art with an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the operation and performance of re-evaluation in 5G NR V2X mode 2 under different traffic patterns and mode 2 configurations. The study shows that re-evaluation is effective in avoiding collisions with periodic traffic but its effectiveness decreases with aperiodic traffic and of variable size. The study also shows that re-evaluation is effective in avoiding collisions generated by the retransmission of packets. However, its overall impact on the performance of 5G NR V2X mode 2 is small, while it can have a relevant implementation cost due to the frequent re-evaluation checks and resource reselections. This raises questions on the current design of the re-evaluation mechanism that is a mandatory feature in 5G NR V2X mode 2.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting mobile crowdsensing to conduct data collection and analysis has become an emerging trend in IoT computing models. However, in practice, mobile users in crowdsensing networks are unwilling to participate in perceptual tasks without effective stimulation due to limited resources and strategic selfishness. To tackle the problem, a new incentive mechanism is proposed by adopting game theory in this article. Specifically, the mobile users&#39; preference is considered comprehensively and their energy is changed dynamically through the scheme. Furthermore, the users&#39; preference and energy changes are exploited as equation factors between subsequent users and the platform. To motivate users, we introduce the concept of virtual currency and set a price function that rewards users for participating in sensing tasks in the form of virtual currency. To fit into practical scenarios, we map task interactions to a Rubinstein-Starr bargaining game between a user and sensing platforms based on a fully informative turn-based bargaining model. Through multiple rounds of games between users and crowdsensing platforms, we prove that there is a unique Nash Equilibrium point in the sub-game process of both parties. The analysis based on these models lays a theoretical foundation on the incentive process of mobile crowdsensing. The soundness of modeling and the accuracy of analysis are verified through extensive simulation, which also guides the design of more sophisticated incentive schemes.},

  abstract     = {The Sixth Generation Heterogeneous Network (6G HetNet) is a global interconnected system that serves a myriad variety of applications and services across multiple domains such as satellite, air, ground, and underwater networks. It provides a platform for the development of novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, particularly for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which encompasses all devices involved in intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications. However, this evolution towards a unified and huge cellular infrastructure creates new security challenges that require an intelligent attack detection framework to safeguard the network against cyber-security threats. This article proposes a hierarchical attack detection framework for 6G-enabled IoV. This framework relies on the processing capacities of edge nodes to satisfy the main 6G Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as trustworthiness, latency, connectivity, data rate and energy consumption. Federated Learning (FL) and non-cooperative gaming are used to train attack models and improve the detection process over time. The cooperative detection process based on FL is executed by security entities, IoV devices, edge servers and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to improve the detection accuracy over time. To harden the security of the proposed attack detection framework, a robust Stackelberg security game is developed to identify malicious IoV devices and edge servers, and select suitable IoV devices and edge servers to participate in the training and attack detection processes. The identification and selection process mainly relies on computing a reputation score based on the activities of these IoV devices and edge servers. As compared to current security monitoring and detection solutions, our framework balances detection accuracy and reduced network overhead, specifically as the system scales up, i.e., when the malicious traffic is high. In addition, it mitigates threats from both external and internal adversaries.},

However, the holes in the difference coarray of coprime arrays cause estimation performance loss. In this article, we present a multi-layer holes filling strategy for coprime arrays to fill the holes, thus enhancing the uniform difference coarray. Specifically, we first construct a coprime array with multiple duplicated subarrays (CAMDS) and classify the holes in the difference coarray into multiple layers. Then we present a multi-layer filled coprime array (MLFCA) by introducing extra subarrays to fill the holes in different layers, which resultantly achieves significantly increased uniform DOFs (uDOFs). We then derive the optimal MLFCA in the scale of difference coarray and develop an optimized structure to extend the difference coarray. Finally, the proposed coprime arrays enjoy a hole-free difference coarray and achieve a larger uniform difference coarray than previous coprime arrays. Simulation results have verified the merits of the proposed coprime arrays through the subspace-based estimator.},

  abstract     = {With the increase of spacecrafts, data relay satellite network (DRSN) plays an essential role in the space task transmission and processing through broad coverage and efficient information distribution of data relay satellites. However, the growing demand of space tasks and the limited number of satellite antenna lead to the conflicts between high-priority unpredictable tasks and common tasks with timely processing requirements, which further result in the decreasing scheduling efficiency of space tasks. In this paper, a dynamic scheduling scheme with task laxity (DSTL) is proposed to solve scheduling conflicts and enhance scheduling efficiency. Firstly, a task model in visible time window is analyzed according to the processing time limit of tasks and the intermittent connection nature of satellites under a constructed DRSN model. After that, the task laxity is defined by the deadline and execution time of tasks to judge the urgency of tasks, and the optimization problem is formulated to maximize the number of tasks and prioritize high priority tasks by calculating task laxity. Then, the DSTL scheme is designed via four stages, which are task preprocessing, task-resource matching, task-conflict assessment, task-resource updating. In DSTL, a task sorting method with task laxity is raised to arrange the priority of tasks; an urgent task scheduling algorithm (UTS) is put forward to prioritize unpredictable tasks; a task-conflict resolution algorithm (TCR) is brought up to assess conflicting tasks and reschedule them. Following that, an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm combined with deadline-aware scheduling (ALNS-DAS) is presented to obtain the optimal scheduling scheme, which has the maximum number of completed tasks. The simulation results show that the DSTL can maximize the guarantee ratio of completed tasks and ensure timely processing with the increase of tasks demand.},

  abstract     = {Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) are essential for a wide range of military and civil applications as they significantly reduce mission duration and improve coverage compared to using a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Nevertheless, the dynamic and mobile nature of FANETs, coupled with fluctuating data traffic patterns, pose significant challenges for adaptive routing and efficient packet delivery. At present, most of the existing routing protocols for FANETs are designed based on mobility or topology information without taking into account data traffic and the associated joint decision-making approach. This narrow focus can result in poor network performance, characterized by longer delivery delay and lower delivery ratio. Thus, this paper proposes the Joint Prediction and Entropy weight-based (JPE) routing protocol by considering both current and future network conditions. The protocol uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict and obtain the mobility, buffer available size, and Link Expiration Time (LET) of each Neighbouring UAV (NU) in order to avoid high-mobility, high-traffic, and weak-link UAVs and establish an appropriate path. The routing decision problem is then formulated as an optimization problem and solved using the proposed Entropy Weight-based Multi-Metric (EWMM) approach. The integrated prediction and decision process considers both current and future multi-metric factors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM-based Joint Prediction (JP) model and show that the JPE protocol outperforms the PAP and SPA protocols, improving Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and delay performance by 30.13% and 31.24% respectively.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm to realize sensing and communication for ground vehicles (GVs) has been envisioned as a promising technology in harsh environments. Previous research in vehicular networks has ignored or assumed perfect elimination of Doppler, resulting in unstable or impractical dynamic system models. However, Doppler is essential for multidimensional sensing, especially for velocity estimation, but it may lead to loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in communication. In this case, to achieve satisfying sensing and communication performance simultaneously, we propose a sensing-communication co-design scheme for UAV swarm-assisted vehicular networks in perspective of Doppler. We first establish the mathematical models for the effect of Doppler on communication and sensing respectively. Then we analyze the influence of UAVs link selection on GV sensing-communication performance. Based on this framework, we aim to minimize the GVs&#39; maximum Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing estimates with an SNR loss constraint to make a sensing-communication performance trade-off. Finally, an efficient differential evolution (DE)-based algorithm is developed to find a sub-optimal solution for this complicated non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the validity and superiority of our co-design scheme. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our scheme can not only improve the sensing accuracy by more than 30% while ensuring communication, but also outperform over 20% in communication without sacrificing sensing capacity.},

  abstract     = {Air-ground Integrated Mobility (AIM) can effectively alleviate the current urban traffic pressure by expanding transportation resources in the near-ground field. However, the following problems in AIM need to be addressed urgently: 1) The high mobility of Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAVs) in low-altitude airspace leads to a sharp increase in risk factors; 2) Due to the limited communication distance, antenna direction angle, and frequent handover caused by high-speed movement, the communication quality in the air is unreliable; 3) AIM incorporates vehicles on the ground and PAVs in the air leading to the high variability of user requirements. Confronted with the personalized resource requirements of high-speed mobile PAVs in airspace with unreliable communication quality, traditional resource allocation strategies struggle to guarantee service quality. Therefore, we propose a safety-oriented personalized resource allocation strategy in AIM, which jointly considers the user requirements and resource distribution. Specifically, we first build a three-dimensional (3D) safety distance model by analyzing the motion process of PAVs with the help of a kinematics model. Then, according to the location, speed, and environmental information of the PAVs, the communication and computing resources required by each PAV under the premise of maintaining the optimal safety distance are obtained through the transmission model. Furthermore, the 3D safety distance and resources are jointly optimized, and an on-demand resource allocation algorithm enabled by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is constructed to provide the resource allocation strategy based on the personalized requirements of the users.},

We consider a more realistic power consumption model and interference model, in order to better satisfy the QoS requirements and mitigate the performance degradation caused by strong interference. Then, we construct an EE maximization problem with QoS constraints. In order to solve this non-convex combined integer fractional programming problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems: resource block (RB) allocation and power allocation problems. Algorithms based on continuous convex approximation and difference of convex programming are proposed to solve the sub-problems, respectively. Then we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution to the original problem and analyze the convergence and complexity of the algorithm.

Specifically, the joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term energy consumption with the consideration of the average queuing latency guarantees. To provide a stable and fast solution, Lyapunov optimization method is first leveraged to transform the formulated stochastic problem into a series of short-term deterministic optimization subproblems. Afterwards, both the optimization-based solution and the learning-based solution are presented to fully illustrate the performance advantages of Internet-of-Intelligence applied to vehicle networks. The former can output the global optimal solution by iteration, while the latter aims at accelerating the distributed optimization decision-making through building a fast deep reinforcement learning framework based on shared knowledge among vehicles. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed scheme in stability, energy consumption, and latency, and it also verifies the convergence speed and training accuracy of the proposed fast deep reinforcement learning framework.},

In this article, we construct a metadata and image features co-aware VFL model for smart healthcare, from which users can obtain convenient and timely online auxiliary diagnostic services. Furthermore, we propose a metadata and image features co-aware semi-supervised VFL scheme with attention mechanism, which aims to jointly train the VFL models by utilizing both metadata and image data from the entire sample space. Specifically, a generative-adversarial method is designed to train the generator to estimate the missing features, so as to expand the training set and improve the accuracy of model. Moreover, using semi-supervised clustering to forecast pseudo labels for the missing part of the active party, we further boost the performance of the VFL model by increasing the proportion of labeled samples. Meanwhile, inspired by the attention mechanism, we establish an entirely novel VFL training mode that emphasizes the underlying effect of metadata features on image features, which makes metadata features highlight crucial areas in the image features to improve the training effect. Finally, the experimental results confirm that our proposed scheme achieves higher accuracy compared with other related works in the VFL scenario.},

In edge computing, task offloading from edge device to edge server is becoming a promising technique that substantially enhances the quality of service for edge devices. Nevertheless, appropriate edge server selection for task offloading remains a challenge if multiple edge servers are selectable nearby. In this article, we propose a parameter estimation-aided edge server selection scheme for task offloading (PEESS) with multiple potential edge servers. The proposed scheme jointly leverages Baum-Welch algorithm and forward algorithm of hidden Markov model. That is, PEESS leverages Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the parameters of potential edge servers based on their time-sequential incoming task records. Subsequently, the forward algorithm is utilized for the probability calculation of the observations based on the estimated parameters. Eventually, the probability calculation results are sorted in descending order, and the edge device selects the target edge server based on the sequence of sending requests to the available edge servers from optimal to suboptimal. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PEESS outperforms other conventional and state-of-the-art edge server selection schemes in terms of time consumption and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-dense low earth orbit (LEO) network has been envisioned as a promising solution to improve communication coverage and reliability. In this article, we investigate the resource scheduling for the downlink multigroup multicast cooperative transmissions in an ultra-dense LEO network, where multiple LEO satellites serve as aerial base stations to cooperatively offer high-capacity multicast service for ground users (GUs) within the coverage. To obtain the system max-min fair (MMF) capacity, we formulate a weighted MMF downlink beamforming and subchannel assignment problem. As the formulated problem is NP-hard and non-convex, we adopt a many-to-many matching model to solve the subchannel assignment, and apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) coupled with Gaussian randomization and cochannel power control to obtain the downlink beamforming during the matching process. Furthermore, the matching algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a two-side exchange stable matching within finite iteration steps. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed resource scheduling scheme for cooperative multicast transmissions.},

In this work, we propose a novel methodology that optimizes communication, computation, and caching configurations in a vehicular Multi-access edge computing (MEC) system to minimize the average latency of the tasks from the vehicles and maximize the number of tasks finished within the latency requirements. The communication model characterizes bandwidth and power allocation of uplink and downlink transmission in the vehicular MEC system. Our caching model includes variables for each edge server in determining the trade-off between flexibility and hit rate. Finally, the computation model characterizes computation resource allocation. Our method for solving the optimization problem consists of two main steps. First, the deep Q-learning algorithm deals with the optimal assignment of tasks to the edge servers. Then, a greedy approach is applied to the communication, computation, and caching subproblems to decide the bandwidth and power, CPU, and caching strategy, respectively. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms several baselines in minimizing latency and maximizing the number of tasks finished within latency requirements, and verify the benefit of including different resource allocation variables in our optimization.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative edge computing has emerged as a novel paradigm that allows edge servers (ESs) to share data and computing resources, effectively mitigating network congestion in traditional multi-access edge computing (MEC) scenarios. However, existing research in collaborative edge computing often limits offloading to only one hop, which may lead to suboptimal computing resource sharing due to challenges such as poor channel conditions or high computing workload at ESs located just one hop away. To address this limitation and enable more efficient computing resource utilization, we propose a multi-hop MEC approach that leverages omnipresent vehicles in urban areas to create a data transportation network for task delivery. Here, we propose a general multi-hop task offloading framework for vehicle-assisted collaborative edge computing where tasks from users can be offloaded to powerful ESs via potentially multi-hop transmissions. Under the proposed framework, we formulate an aggregated service throughput maximization problem by designing the task routing path subject to end-to-end latency requirements, spectrum, and computing resources. To efficiently address the curse of dimensionality problem due to vehicular mobility and channel variability, we develop a deep reinforcement learning, i.e., multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient, based multi-hop task routing approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Passive position determination of the radiating source is widely applied in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Compared with traditional two-step methods, the direct position determination (DPD) methods estimate the position in a single step and exhibit conspicuous performance superiority at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Unfortunately, the computational load for the exhaustive maximum likelihood (ML) DPD search is unacceptable for real-time processing. Although the conventional gradient-based iterative DPD method has lower computational complexity, it easily converges to the local maxima. In this article, for a stationary source, we aim to tackle the problem of DPD using Doppler frequency shifts in a computationally attractive way. The waveform of the transmitted signal is a priori knowledge, and the transmitted frequency offset exists as the nuisance parameter. Based on the expectation maximization (EM) concept, we propose an approximately globally-optimal iterative ML DPD algorithm. The proposed method regards the source-receiver vector as the unobserved latent variable, and then by exploiting the Laplace approximation technique and polar coordinate system, the original multi-dimensional grid search is transformed into multiple one-dimensional estimations for polar angle. To guarantee global optimality for the estimation of transmitted frequency offsets, a method different from its counterpart in the iterative cycle is utilized when the local maxima are achieved. Moreover, by correctly simplifying the estimation cost function in the expectation step, both the search of the polar angle and the design of the iteration parameter is avoided, which contributes to prominent computational savings. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed modified EM-based DPD estimator (MEM-DPD) has high probability of converging to the global maximum. Meanwhile, the estimation performance is very close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with minor iterations.},

Notably, people use UAVs to capture videos and upload them to Youtube. Accordingly, using distributed UAVs in the city to collect real-time data represents a key enabling approach for smart city, e.g., air pollution and traffic monitoring. To achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a UAV-based crowdsensing system that allows UAVs to dynamically join and contribute to data collection. We make three contributions. First, due to UAVs&#39; highspeed spatial mobilities, diverse sensing capabilities, and limited energy reserves, it is key to stimulate UAVs to cooperatively perform sensing tasks. To address this issue, we develop a game-theory-based distributed UAV incentive scheme, named BASIC. Second, to make BASIC work fully distributed and scalable, we first develop a mathematical model to characterize the interdependent operations of task requesters and collaboratively data sensing. We then devise a centralized auction mechanism with truthful bidding for UAVs. A heuristic algorithm is then devised to select the winning UAVs for sensing tasks and determine the proper payments to winners. Last, we perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of proposed scheme and show that BASIC can provide effective incentive as compared to the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Compared with terrestrial communication, satellite communication has played a crucial role in 6G communication as a result of wide-area coverage characteristics. Among them, beamforming scheduling and information security are critical research issues to improve system transmission performance. However, in geostationary earth orbit (GEO)-based satellite communication systems, owing to the wide-area coverage, ground users are susceptible to inter-beam interference caused by multibeam antennas at the satellite, and the information received by terrestrial users may be eavesdropped by air or terrestrial eavesdroppers. To this end, in this article, we propose a new robust security transmission strategy by combining beamforming and artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, based on the actual satellite communication network scenario, the uncertain channel models are formulated as bounded uncertainty sets by considering the impact of imperfect channel state information of both legitimate and wiretap channels. Then, we build a bounded-constrained beamforming optimization to maximize the sum rate of legitimate users, while guaranteeing the constraints of total transmit power on the satellite and the minimum security rate of each legitimate user. Since the original problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable, we jointly exploit the successive convex approximation, Taylor series expansion, S-Procedure, and the semi-definite relaxation approach, with which the original problem can be transformed into a tractable one with a series of linear matrix inequality constraints. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal beamforming and AN vectors. Finally, simulation results show that, compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better security and robustness.},

However, under imperfect SIC, the average sum-rate (ASR), outage performance, and $\epsilon -$ outage capacity of PD-NOMA diminish drastically. This work introduces a new PD-NOMA system called multidimensional signal space NOMA (MD-NOMA) to mitigate this sudden decrease in performance. Employing multidimensional signal space significantly reduces the number of SICs, leading to less stringent constraints on the power allocation, reducing the detection delay, and decoding complexity. The analytical expressions of ASR, outage-probability (OP), $\epsilon -$ outage capacity, and diversity order of MD-NOMA, Quadrature-NOMA (Q-NOMA), and PD-NOMA are evaluated under Nakagami- $m$ fading channel with the help of order statistics for a generalized- $K$ user scenario. It is noticed from the analysis that MD-NOMA, with a higher number of signal spaces, significantly outperforms all other systems under imperfect SIC and exhibits comparable performance with them under perfect SIC. Furthermore, the analytical expression for bit error rate (BER) and average-BER (ABER) is determined for MD-NOMA. It is noticed that MD-NOMA can withstand higher modulation order ( $M$ ), whereas the performance of all other systems degrades drastically as $M$ increases.

Traditional methods for RSS prediction are based on ray tracing or stochastic radio propagation models. However, the former requires detailed environmental information that may not be practically available, while the latter cannot use the environmental data to its full potential and is not accurate enough. To address these issues, we design a practical RSS prediction system utilizing the trajectory information of users and satellite maps around base stations without sharing raw data. Specifically, we propose a map-based deep neural network (DNN) for the RSS prediction, empowered by the deep vision transformer (DeepVIT). Furthermore, to avoid sharing raw data, a novel split learning (SL) framework is developed. It splits the map-based DNN into two parts, which are deployed on the server and the user sides, respectively. The proposed models are evaluated by eight real-world data sets provided by an Australian Telecom operator, including 307,500 data samples. Simulation results show that in terms of prediction accuracy, the proposed map-based DNN significantly outperforms the 3GPP Urban Macro model and the long short-term memory method in centralized scenarios, while its SL variant outperforms the sequential SL and federated learning (FL) approaches in distributed scenarios. In addition, the communication overhead and the on-device computational burden of the proposed SL model are much lower than that of the FL approach.},

Although previous studies have presented the performance gain by utilizing the UAV&#39;s mobility and communication, they concentrate on the UAV trajectory for homogeneous devices with the same requirements of data size and latency constraints. The UAV trajectory for groups with heterogeneous devices can affect the UAV&#39;s service capabilities. Additionally, the technique of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been deemed as a promising technique in future communication networks since it can improve the spectral efficiency and support more device connections. The UAV can integrate with NOMA to further enhance the situation. In this article, we consider a NOMA-based UAV system, where a UAV provides services to ground devices in different groups. We aim to maximize the total throughput under the constraints of data rate, sum transmit power, and atomicity of devices&#39; tasks. To tackle this problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of transmit power based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Then, we formulate a group-based auction algorithm to decide the service order of UAV to device groups, where a latency estimation algorithm is constructed to design the auction bidding. Additionally, an adaptive device admission algorithm is put forward to settle the device scheduling problem within one group.

At the modeling stage, the element-pulse phase coding matrix (EPPCM) is employed at the transmit side, introducing extra coding degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) for the discrimination of the true target and mainbeam jammers. By utilizing the extra coding DOFs, nonadaptive and adaptive suppression method for mainbeam jammers are developed. Firstly, in order to suppress the jammers non-adaptively, the EPPCM is designed based on the coding steering vector orthogonalization (CSVO) method, which requires the identical angle of the true and false targets. Then, the adaptive suppression method is proposed for the general cases, where the angle deviation between the true and false targets occurs. To this end, the unitary EPPCM is designed to achieve the coding DOFs at the transmit side. Moreover, we take the towed radar active decoy (TRAD) jammer as an example and the sample selection scheme for the estimation of jammer-plus-noise covariance matrix is proposed. At the analysis stage, experimental and numerical results in terms of output signal-to-jammer-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised methods for suppressing mainbeam deceptive jammers.},

  abstract     = {The threat posed by drones has significantly increased in recent years, necessitating the development of robust anti-UAV systems capable of detecting and preventing malicious UAVs. However, the anti-UAV system requires accurate UAV location detection capabilities to counteract UAVs robustly. For example, when employing jamming technology as a countermeasure, the anti-UAV system can enhance its defence performance by concentrating the jamming signal towards the detected UAV location, a technique known as a directional jamming signal. However, obtaining accurate UAV location information is challenging due to the small size, high velocity, and maneuverability of UAVs, which pose difficulties in detecting and tracking UAVs. Inaccurate UAV location data can significantly impair the defence performance of anti-UAV systems. In the jamming system, it causes the misalignment between the directional jamming signal and the malicious UAV and jamming failure. Therefore, addressing the problem of inaccurate location information is crucial for the anti-UAV system to achieve robust jamming performance. This article investigates the impact of UAV detection errors in an anti-UAV system that employs radar for detection and jamming technology as a countermeasure. We design the UAV detection algorithm to analyze the influence of UAV location detection errors. Furthermore, a beam control scheme is proposed for the jamming system to mitigate the effects of detection errors in the anti-UAV system. The proposed scheme utilizes a wide beam width when location information is inaccurate to avoid beam misalignment. In contrast, a narrow beamwidth is employed when the location information is precise to enhance jamming power efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method ensures stable jamming performance even when faced with inaccurate UAV location information.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (UDHNs) have been widely regarded as a long-term and reliable solution for enhancing system performance and reducing cost efficiency. To guarantee these gains in UDHNs, some problems need to be properly tackled, which include more capital/operational expenditures, more complicated, severe and average interferences, and more energy consumption caused by network densification. To this end, in this article, the BS (base station) on/off operation is introduced into the design of user association mechanisms in UDHNs with a general multi-slope channel model. Specifically, we jointly perform the BS (on/off) operation and user association to maximize the sum of weighted downlink long-term rates. Such rates are closely related to users&#39; signal strengths and the load levels of associated BSs. Considering the finally formulated problem is in a mixed-integer and fractional form, we first need to convert it into a parameterized polynomial one. Then, we design a three-layer iterative algorithm to find the solution to a transformed problem, where the first layer tries to find the introduced Lagrangian multipliers and parameters using a Newton-like method, the second layer optimizes the user association and on/off indices alternately, and the third layer optimizes these indices separately. Simulation results show that the designed algorithm can achieve better user association performance than other existing ones.},

Cloud-based VSLAM is a promising solution for meeting the computational demands of learning-based methods in mobile robot applications. However, existing cloud-based VSLAM systems face high transmission demands. To address this issue, we propose a cloud-based VSLAM system, offloading the heavy cost of reconstructing challenging images to the cloud using the learning-based method and leaving the light realtime tracking in the edge using the model-based method. By combining the cloud-edge transmission and a multiple submap VSLAM framework, we introduce a rumination-inspired mechanism for asynchronous and distributed submap building. The submap-based framework and proposed down-sampling method help reduce transmission frequency and data volume. We present experimental results that demonstrate the robustness and precision of our cloud-based multiple submap VSLAM system. We also evaluate the runtime performance of communication and computation on a real robot platform, which suggests that the multiple submap VSLAM framework can effectively release computation load while satisfying both robustness and realtime requirements.},

Existing deep learning based traffic prediction methods have huge data requirements and limited accuracy, it is difficult to be used in emerging cellular networks, e.g., 6G. Hence, this article proposes a multi-feature prediction network (MFPNet) based on signaling information to overcome the existing problems. Firstly, after exploiting the correlation between traffic and signaling data (i.e., Evolved Radio Access Bearer, Radio Resource Control, etc.). MFPNet is presented for a single base station (BS). Moreover, multi-input convolutional neural network is introduced into MFPNet for feature extraction of signaling information, and a short-term memory network is used for learning temporal correlations. Secondly, MFPNet is extended for multiple BSs using both transfer learning and federated learning to achieve accurate traffic prediction using only data from a few base stations. The former uses the fine-tune method for knowledge transfer between BSs, and the latter uses the double-headed federated prediction model to increase the accuracy of traffic prediction. Finally, the proposed method is validated with real-world traffic data obtained from Shenzhen. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed models over other benchmark schemes in terms of accuracy and data requirements.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a multi-jammer-assisted covert communication scenario, where a transmitter communicates with a receiver without being detected by a warden under the assistance of multiple friendly jammers. The transmission rate maximization problem subjecting to the covertness constraint by jointly optimizing the jammer selection strategy and power control of the transmitter is studied under the following three channel models: 1) Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel; 2) Block fading channel without channel state information (CSI) acquisition cost; 3) Block fading channel with CSI acquisition cost. Under the AWGN channel, considering achievable schemes of the transmitter, relative entropy is adopted to lower bound the detection error probability at the warden. We decouple the joint optimization problem into two sub-problems and prove that selecting one jammer with the maximum ratio of the jamming power at the warden to that at the receiver is optimal with proper transmit power control in an interference-limited environment. Motivated by this key analytical conclusion, we then study the second channel model&#39;s optimal single jammer selection strategy. Considering the worst case that the warden employs the optimal detector, we analytically show that the optimal selection criterion in this channel model is choosing the jammer with the maximum ratio of the average jamming power at the warden to the instantaneous jamming power at the receiver. Given this selection criterion, we then study the problem of how many jammers should be explored when the acquisition cost of jammers&#39; CSI cannot be ignored. We formulate the optimization problem as an optimal stopping problem and propose two optimal strategies for two cases that whether the previously explored jammers are allowed to select. The numerical results evaluate the theoretical results and show the superiority of the proposed jammer selection strategies. Furthermore, we also present the impact of some key parameters on the covert rate, such as the covertness constraint, the number of jammers, and the CSI acquisition time of one jammer, which provide more valuable insights.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate a friendly jamming and mutual interference mitigation problem, where a friendly jammer equipped with a directional antenna is deployed to exert adversarial interference to the hostile user in a confrontational scenario. However, the side lobe of the signal of friendly jammer may cause unintended interference to ally users. Power control and jammer position are jointly designed to significantly impede the hostile users&#39; radio communication at the cost of self-inflicted performance loss. The friendly jammer-to-hostile users channel is assumed to be a flat Rayleigh fading channel, while the friendly jammer-to-ally users channel gain is of finite states governed by the probability mass function (PMF). Cost-efficiency is defined to characterize the trade-off between the expected sum-capacity of the ally users, the outage-capacity loss of the hostile users, and the friendly jammer risk costs. We formulate the cost-efficiency maximization problem under ally users&#39; transmission rate constraints. The block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are applied to effectively solve the problem by optimizing: 1) coordination of the internal interference among the ally users; 2) the friendly jammer jamming power; and 3) the jammer position. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is illustrated. The impacts of power/risk costs and rate threshold of ally users on the utility have been demonstrated. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme rapidly converges to a near-optimal solution and outperforms uniform power allocation or fixed jamming position policies.},

  abstract     = {Metaverse enables users to experience a virtual space that resembles the real world. In the Metaverse, virtual service providers (VSPs) maintain digital twins (DTs) of real-world entities to offer innovative services such as virtual conferences and tourism. However, to provide a realistic experience, VSPs need to collect up-to-date and relevant data, which is latency-sensitive and resource-intensive, from edge devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that leverages extraction and trading of scene graphs to reduce communication costs and motivate data transfer for Metaverse services. In the framework, we propose a semantic communication system where data for building DTs is encoded as semantic information, such as scene graphs. VSPs can use these graphs to build or update their DTs. To facilitate data trading between VSPs and edge nodes, we introduce a combinatorial auction-based incentive mechanism where we model the valuation of semantic data based on relatedness, freshness, and semantic values. We measure the relatedness based on the similarity between targeted objects of VSPs and the objects present in the real-world data. We use the age of information (AoI) to quantify data freshness and evaluate the semantic value using the information richness of the scene graphs. Simulation results show that our system can maintain the model&#39;s mean recall performance using only 12.5% of features during transmission. Our mechanism increases the average update frequency effectively. The theoretical analysis proves that the proposed mechanism guarantees the desired properties of individual rationality and incentive compatibility.},

In this article, we propose an analytical framework for three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous aerial-terrestrial networks, where the TBSs are equipped with large antenna elements, and ABSs provide seamless connectivity from air to ground user equipment (GUE). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive exact analytical expressions for association probability, coverage probability, area spectral efficiency (ASE), and average ergodic rate (AER) while considering the maximum biased received power association scheme, path loss with line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link and Nakagami-m fading for aerial communications. The derived expressions are validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and a close match is observed between the analytical and simulated results. Simulation results demonstrate that the use of multi-antennas TBSs in conjunction with the ABSs leads to better network performance. However, the overall performance depends upon the density of the aerial and terrestrial network nodes, ABSs altitudes, and the number of antennas per TBS. Furthermore, it is observed that the dense deployment of ABSs leads to higher aerial interference. However, deploying a higher number of TBS antennas while optimally selecting other network parameters results in improved network performance.},

  abstract     = {Joint communication and positioning will be a critical driver in future wireless networks for emerging application areas. Supporting mobility, Ad-hoc networks can freely and dynamically self-organize an arbitrary and temporary network topology without any pre-existing infrastructure. Combined with millimeter-wave (mmWave), Ad-hoc networks can construct communication links with less time and higher directivity due to directional antennas and building blockage. The wide spectrum of mmWave could provide a high-oriented channel for positioning, which is significant for multi-user conditions. In this article, we concentrate on high-efficiency algorithms to allocate spectrum and power to different services and achieve a performance tradeoff between the communication and positioning process. Besides, the severe interference between users would degrade the actual system performance. To address these challenges, this article proposes an optimal clustering algorithm based on the mmWave Line of Sight (LoS) probability to form two different sub-nets for communication and positioning services, respectively. Then, the available spectrum resources are divided into two parts for the above sub-nets under the Filtered-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (F-OFDM) technique, which could design sub-bands independently. Finally, we proposed an optimal algorithm to allocate sub-bands and power to improve the performance of the communication sub-net while guaranteeing the positioning performance in the corresponding sub-net. Numeric simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm could achieve better performance both in the communication and position process.},

To evaluate the effects of the parameters on system performance, the asymptotic analysis and the power scaling laws are further provided. Finally, an optimization scheme is proposed to maximize the SE of the considered system. The numerical results verify the accuracy of theoretical analysis and show that the interference and noise can be effectively eliminated by deploying large-scale antennas and applying proper power scaling law. We also demonstrate that the proposed system can obtain better SE by adjusting the height of the UAV. Moreover, the system performance is related to the ADCs/DACs quantization bits, where the SE saturation values increase by increasing number of quantization bits, while the EE first increases and then decreases. Finally, the SE/EE trade-off at low precision ADCs/DACs can be achieved by choosing the appropriate number of quantization bits, and the trade-off region grows as Rician factor increases.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) is a popular, greedy approach for common support recovery of a row-sparse matrix. However, compared to the noiseless scenario, the performance analysis of noisy SOMP is still nascent, especially in the scenario of unbounded noise. In this article, we present a new study based on the mutual incoherence property (MIP) for performance analysis of noisy SOMP when the measurement matrix and sparse signal are deterministic. Specifically, when noise is bounded, we provide the condition on which the exact support recovery is guaranteed in terms of the MIP. When noise is unbounded, we instead derive a bound on the successful recovery probability (SRP) that depends on the specific distribution of the $\ell _{2}$ -norm of the noise matrix. Then we focus on the typical case when noise is random Gaussian, and show that the lower bound of SRP follows Tracy-Widom law distribution. The analysis reveals the number of measurements, noise level, the number of sparse vectors, and the value of mutual coherence that are required to guarantee a predefined recovery performance. Theoretically, we show that the mutual coherence of the measurement matrix must decrease proportionally to the noise standard deviation, and the number of sparse vectors needs to grow proportionally to the noise variance. Finally, we extensively validate the derived analysis through numerical simulations.},

Particularly, we present a novel pairwise error probability (PEP) expression with arbitrary $L$ users, which applies to most channels (e.g., Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami- $m$ , and Weibull distributions). Closed-form and asymptotic PEP expressions are derived to characterize each user&#39;s performance in different scenarios. Following that, the PEP is used to evaluate the union bound on the bit error rate of NOMA users. Furthermore, the asymptotic PEP expression is employed to quantify the diversity order of each user. The analysis is supported by numerical and Monte Carlo simulation results. We show that each NOMA user&#39;s effective diversity order equals its order precisely. We further show that ipCSI has a significant influence on PEP performance in the presence of RHI, particularly for weak users, but has almost no effect in an ideal RF environment with the vehicles sitting motionless. In a mobile environment, however, the impact of ipCSI on PEP performance for all users is almost ignored no matter whether RHI exists or not. Additionally, regardless of whether ipCSI or pCSI is used, RHI has a clear influence on PEP performance.},

  abstract     = {In satellite communications, the power amplifier (PA) plays a vital role in enhancing the transmission performance of signals. However, the non-linearity of PAs often distorts the transmitted signals, degrading communication performance. Digital pre-distortion (DPD) is one of the most effective linearization technologies to address the abovementioned issue and improve PA performance. Neural networks (NNs) outperform traditional models in PA behavioral modeling and linearization due to their strong nonlinear fitting capability, but the lack of learning data distributions limits the performance. Hence, this article proposes a novel behavioral and linearization model for PA, utilizing the residual generative adversarial network (Res-GAN). The proposed model can extract deep features of the PA with enhanced accuracy, thereby improving PA linearization performance. Simulation results show that the proposed Res-GAN behavioral model achieves the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of −55.737 dB. Additionally, the Res-GAN DPD outperforms traditional DPD models by a reduction in the NMSE of about 2 dB and the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of about 2-4 dBc.},

  abstract     = {A compact planar printed wideband filtering quasi-Yagi antenna without any extra external filtering circuit for vehicular communication is proposed in this article. It consists of a microstrip-to-slotline transition (MST), a coplanar stripline (CPS), driven elements and parasitic elements which act as directors and filtering elements simultaneously. The MST can inherently introduce four radiation nulls on the lower and upper stopband, and by adding a pair of exponential curved branch elements symmetrically, two radiation nulls are generated on the upper stopband. Moreover, four parasitic elements are placed around the director to enhance the end-fire radiation and the rejection levels of three radiation nulls on the upper stopband. Therefore, a wideband filtering quasi-Yagi antenna with a good endfire characteristics with the measured bandwidth of 4.46 to 11.31 GHz (∼86.9%), a peak gain of 8.3 dBi, and the out-of-band suppression larger than 14 dB is achieved, without any additional external filtering circuits. When a pair of L-shaped parasitic elements are symmetrically placed on the top layer, a notch with −20.5 dBi measured gain rejection in the working frequency band can be introduced, which guarantees good interference suppression ability. The measured results show good agreement with the simulation. The proposed antennas are good candidates for in-vehicle Wi-Fi 6E, in-vehicle satellite communication, mobile-service, V2V communication applications.},

To improve the BER performance of index bits, a novel neural network (NN)-aided IM-DCSK detection scheme, referred to as NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme, is proposed in this article. The proposed scheme can be applied to various IM-DCSK systems, such as carrier index DCSK, pulse position modulation DCSK, and code index modulation DCSK systems. The NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme uses a two-layer long short-term memory unit and multiple fully connected layers to extract the features and the correlation of IM-DCSK signals. By estimating the index bits from the configured NN framework, the scheme can make correct correlation to retrieve modulated bits. Therefore, the NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme that benefits from the advantage of both the NN and traditional energy detection can improve transmission reliability. The complexity of the NN-IM-DCSK system is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme can achieve better BER performance than the traditional detection scheme, such as the energy detection scheme, in IM-DCSK systems over multipath Rayleigh fading channels.},

We show that, when the received powers of the users are sufficiently different, the proposed clustering-based approach achieves an SER performance on a par with that of the conventional maximum-likelihood detector (MLD) with full channel state information (CSI). We study the tradeoff between the accuracy of the proposed approach and the blocklength, as the accuracy of the utilized clustering algorithm depends on the number of symbols available at the receiver. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed approach and derive a theoretical bound on its SER performance. Our simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and verify that the calculated theoretical bound can predict the SER performance of the proposed approach well. We further explore the application of the proposed approach to a practical grant-free NOMA scenario, and show that its performance is very close to that of the optimal MLD with full CSI, which usually requires long pilot sequences.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a promising technology for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks to provide massive connectivity. In this article, we propose IoT user selection methods and beamforming designs in a multi-IRS aided IoT network. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the base station (BS) beamforming, IRS reflection coefficients and user selection to maximize the weighted sum rate of selected users, which is a mixed integer non-linear (MINLP) problem. To solve this MINLP problem, we design a novel algorithm by absorbing user selection implicitly into BS beamforming design, and applying a fractional programming (FP) to alternate between BS beamforming design using a Lagrangian-based subgradient method and IRS coefficients optimization using a complex circle manifold (CCM) method. However, this algorithm has high complexity, thus we further propose two low complexity and non-alternating algorithms, one using a channel correlation based metric for user selection, and the other using zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming at the BS. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve significant performance gain over benchmark schemes, and the low complexity algorithms achieve a performance comparable with the joint optimization algorithm at a fraction of the run time. These algorithms demonstrate that multiple IRSs help improve the network sum rate, IRSs with more elements tend to select IoT users more close by, and the best locations for IRS placement are near IoT device clusters.},

In doing so, co-channel interference manifests between cells when reusing frequency spectrum across spot beams. To permit forecasting of such multi-beam satellite communication system performance, this work characterizes desired and interference signal powers under the Shadowed Rician (SR) sky-to-ground channel model, along with SNR, INR, SIR, and SINR. Specifically, we present a framework for analyzing system performance by capitalizing on the fact that the desired and interfering signals travel along almost the same path in such multi-beam satellite systems. We then introduce a minor approximation on the fading order of SR channels that significantly simplifies the probability distribution function and cumulative distribution function of these quantities and facilitates performance analyses of LEO satellite systems. We conclude this article with an evaluation of multi-beam LEO satellite communication in SR channels of varying intensity with shadowing parameters fitted from existing measurements. Our numerical results highlight the effect satellite elevation angle has on SNR, INR, and SINR, which brings attention to the variability in system state and potential performance as a satellite traverses across the sky along its orbit.},

These sub-optimal techniques typically express the probabilities of the detected bits using LLRs that often have values that are not consistent with their true reliability, either expressing too much confidence or not enough confidence in the value of the corresponding bits, leading to performance degradation. To circumvent this problem, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained for detecting and correcting both over-confident and under-confident LLRs. We demonstrate that the complexity of employing the DL-aided technique is relatively low compared to the popular reduced-complexity receiver detector techniques since it only depends on a small number of real-valued inputs. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applicable to a wild variety of iterative receivers as demonstrated in the context of an iterative detection and decoding aided MIMO system, which uses a low-complexity Smart Ordering and Candidate Adding (SOCA) scheme for MIMO detection and Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for channel coding. We adopt Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for quantifying the Mutual Information (MI) and show that our DL method significantly improves the BLock Error Rate (BLER). Explicitly, we demonstrate that about 0.9 dB gain can be achieved at a BLER of $10^{-3}$ by employing the proposed DL-aided LLR correction method, at the modest cost of increasing the complexity by 16% compared to a benchmarker dispensing with LLR correction.},

However, the huge number of antennas renders the users more likely to locate in the near-field (instead of the far-field) region of the XL-array with spherical wavefront propagation. This inevitably incurs prohibitively high beam training overhead since it requires a two-dimensional (2D) beam search over both the angular and distance domains. To address this issue, we propose in this article an efficient two-stage hierarchical beam training method for near-field communications. Specifically, in the first stage, we employ the central sub-array of the XL-array to search for a coarse user direction in the angular domain with conventional far-field hierarchical codebook. Then, in the second stage, given the coarse user direction, we progressively search for the fine-grained user direction-and-distance in the polar domain with a dedicatedly designed codebook. Numerical results show that our proposed two-stage hierarchical beam training method can achieve over 99% training overhead reduction as compared to the 2D exhaustive search, yet achieving comparable rate performance.},

  abstract     = {The use of Terahertz (THz) technology in sixth-generation (6G) networks will bring high-speed and capacity data services. But limitations like molecular absorption, rain attenuation, and limited coverage range cause communication losses. To overcome these losses and improve coverage in rural areas, a high number of base stations are required. Hence, an aerial communication platform, which uses line-of-sight (LoS) communication to avoid losses, is needed. To address this, we study the deployment and optimization of multi-access edge computing (MEC)-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for sub-THz communication in remote areas. To this end, we solve an optimization problem to minimize energy consumption and delay for MEC-UAV and mobile users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. As the problem is an MINLP, we decompose the main problem into two subproblems. Due to its convex nature, we solve the first subproblem with a standard optimization solver, i.e., CVXPY. To solve the second subproblem, we design a resources-based multi-agent proximal policy optimization (RMAPPO) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an attention mechanism. The considered attention mechanism is utilized for encoding a diverse number of observations. This is designed by the network coordinator to provide a differentiated fit reward to each agent in the network.

  abstract     = {Blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles (BloVs) provides a reliable collaboration environment for traffic entities and promotes road safety and traffic efficiency through real-time sharings between vehicles and infrastructure. However, a bottleneck is likely to emerge as the Internet of Vehicles scales up. In this paper, we propose a novel Graphical Consensus-based Sharding (GCS) framework, which is underpinned by four important strategies: 1) A graphical consensus is adopted as its intra-shard consensus, where the consensus group is set up according to its maximal connected subgraph, and the leader is elected by its reliability weight. The consensus group is refreshed intermittently by alternating the leader role. 2) Within GCS, the intra-shard data are stored in the local chain, while a block-based directed acyclic graph, rather than a chained structure, is employed as the main chain. The local chain is used to respond to requests within each shard, and the main chain supports the cross-shard sharings. GCS will parallelly optimize the throughput of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles. 3) GCS further introduces the shard backup and the node scheduling to handle shard failure and overheating by using new backup strategies and a temporal-spatial graph convolutional network prediction model, respectively. 4) An off-chain transmission algorithm is presented for secure sharing between the infrastructure and the vehicles. Simulation results show that the number of Transactions Per Second is 1.69 times higher than that of the non-sharding blockchain, and the pending time is dramatically reduced compared to the mainstreaming sharding approach, which is 1.02 s.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various other vehicular navigation schemes heavily depend on the accurate position, velocity, and timing (PVT) information offered by global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Meanwhile, GNSS security is challenged by spoofing attacks that aim to deceive users by inducing false PVT solutions. Therefore, detecting these attacks on time is vital for vehicular navigation security. Spoofing attacks involve transmitting counterfeit signals from spoofers instead of authentic satellites, making it difficult to coordinate spatial information accurately. To this end, the Doppler shift, revealing spatial features between transmitters and receivers, is regarded as an effective metric for spoofing detection. Especially for vehicles, due to their motion relative to the spoofer, Doppler bias is appended to the raw measurement, providing an observable spoofing signature. Conventional approaches tend to directly monitor the Doppler bias but require complex requirements like static initialization, random motion, and multiple receivers. Moreover, the commonly utilized single-antenna assumption renders them ineffective against multi-antenna spoofing attacks. This paper proposes a new approach that indirectly exploits the Doppler bias by examining its adverse impact on velocity consistency. The introduced direct velocity determination (DVD) method calculates velocity directly from the Doppler measurements, which is then utilized for consistency-checking alongside the velocity obtained from the conventional pseudorange-aided approach. We thoroughly investigate the impact of Doppler bias on velocities and analyze their consistency across different scenarios. Field tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing previous Doppler-based methods and the widely used receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method.},

  abstract     = {The development of a vehicle equipped with a step-ratio automatic transmission (AT) requires manual calibration to enhance the shift quality. This involves labor-intensive iterations in a prototype vehicle to balance shift time, smoothness, and energy for every realizable gear combination. An improved shift control method is desired to deliver optimized shift quality with reduced calibration needs. This article proposes a hierarchical optimal control strategy for AT upshift aimed at optimizing shift time, comfort, and thermal loss during the inertia phase with minimal calibration effort for faster product development. The strategy consists of a static model-based predictive controller coupled with an optimal control allocation algorithm. The superimposed variable-gain feedback controller commands the AT input torque required to complete the inertia phase in the specified time. The optimal control allocation algorithm coordinates two clutches and the engine by solving a constrained quadratic programming problem to deliver the desired input torque, and minimize AT output torque tracking error and clutch power loss for shift comfort and thermal efficiency, respectively. The modulation of the off-going clutch allows fast, yet comfortable shifts as compared to the conventional shift control. The online performance of the control strategy is verified by realistic shift simulations and compared to the optimal profiles established through off-line control parameter optimization. The ease of shift calibration is demonstrated by setting different targets for shift time and output torque profile. The control robustness is verified against clutch torque and engine torque delivery errors.},

  abstract     = {A vehicular antenna with diverse radiation patterns is proposed for both the dedicated short range communications (DSRC) and the fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (MMW) communications. The proposed antenna mainly comprised a 2 × 2 MMW subarray, an 8-element DSRC subarray and a corresponding 5-port feeding network. The radiating patches of the MMW subarray are excited by two pairs of coaxial-to-substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) transition (CST) feeding networks that are comprised of two 3-dB couplers, two 90 $^{\circ }$ -phase shifters, and four power dividers (PDs), which provide in-phase and differential-phase output signals to achieve single-beam and conical-beam radiation patterns. On the other hand, the 8 monopoles of the DSRC subarray arranged around the aforementioned MMW radiator are excited by a coaxial-to-SIW-to-coaxial transition (CSCT) feeding network that includes a 1-to-4 SIW PD and four 1-to-2 microstrip PDs to form an omni-directional radiation and achieve a large frequency ratio (LFR). Measured results indicate that wide bandwidths of 15.44% (24.14-28.18 GHz), 16.09% (24.29-28.54 GHz), 15.01% (23.85-27.72 GHz), and 14.29% (24.05-27.75 GHz) with corresponding high peak gains of 10.97 $\pm$ 1.03 dBi, 11.71 $\pm$ 1.32 dBi, 10.84 $\pm$ 1.00 dBi, and 11.29 $\pm$ 1.28 dBi are obtained by the four MMW subarray ports, while a bandwidth of 11.40% (5.46-6.12 GHz) with an azimuth-plane gain of 0.64 dBi and a peak gain of 4.29 $\pm$ 0.19 dBi for the DSRC subarray port are also obtained.

  abstract     = {Aircraft is an important means of travel and the most convenient and fast vehicle in long-distance transportation. The aircraft engine is one of the most critical parts of an aircraft, and its reliability and safety are extremely important. In this article, we consider that the operating conditions of aero-engines are complex and changeable, and a multi-resolution long short-term memory (MR-LSTM) model is proposed. The model can effectively predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of an aero-engine, which is a priority issue within the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework - and thus it can support maintenance decisions. Sequences with multiple temporal resolutions are generated by a reconstruction of the decomposed wavelets. A two-layer LSTM model is then designed: 1) the first layer LSTM is used to learn attention at different time resolutions as well as to generate an integrated historical representation; 2) the second layer LSTM is used to learn the long and short-term time dependencies in the integrated historical representation. Experimental evaluations using the C-MAPSS datasets (FD002 and FD004) and the N-CMAPSS dataset showed that compared to other state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods, the FD002 sub-dataset showed a 12.1% reduction in RMSE and a 3.8% reduction in Score; the FD004 sub-dataset showed a 21.8% reduction in RMSE and a decreased by 62.1%; the RMSE of the N-CMAPSS dataset decreased by at most 25.8%.},

A typical feature of agricultural machines is that their internal combustion engine is speed controlled, tracking the reference requested by the driver. In view of avoiding any modification on this original control loop, an add-on EMS strategy is proposed. In particular, we employ a multi-objective Model Predictive Control (MPC), taking into account the fuel consumption minimization and the speed tracking requirement, including the engine speed controller in the predictive model.

This article presents a new method of modifying the isotropic kernel function with an automatic relevance determination (ARD) that brings about highly relevant input features to enhance the estimation precision and robustness. A well-equipped electric wheel-based system in a controlled testing environment is utilized to assess the proposed technique&#39;s effectiveness.

In this method, the potential distribution of insulation fasteners under different insulation damage conditions was studied for unilateral power supply. Results show that voltage drop of insulation fasteners can serve as the detection parameter of insulation degradation location. Combined with the distributed monitoring requirements of rail insulation degradation, a high-resolution two-end cemented FBG sensor was proposed with optimized structure. The effects of cementation layer and fiber grating (FBG) pasting process on strain transfer and sensitivity of fiber grating voltage sensors were investigated. Finally, an experimental system for the insulation degradation location of rail transit system based on FBG voltage sensor was built for performance verification. Different insulation degradation positions were set to analyze the voltage drop distribution of insulation fasteners. Experimental results indicate that the voltage drop distribution of the insulation fasteners is obviously affected by the location of insulation degradation, and accurate determination of these locations can be achieved by identifying abrupt changes in the central wavelength variation distribution.},

This article proposes a simultaneous matching, localization, and detection (SMLAD) method from a semantic LiDAR map for intelligent vehicles, which integrates the separated steps of map matching, vehicle localization, and semantic detection into maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) inference problem in the particle filter framework. Firstly, semantic objects, such as cubes, poles, walls, and ground, are extracted from the query point cloud by LiDAR segmentation method. Then semantic likelihood models (SLMs) are generated from the extracted semantic objects with kernel density estimation (KDE). Finally, the likelihood between the map and the query point cloud is calculated from SLMs that contributes to weight assignment in the particle filter framework. And the proposed point-to-likelihood association allows simultaneous map matching, localization, and detection afterwards. The proposed SMLAD method has been validated with both the public KITTI dataset and the real tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SMLAD method can achieve up to 10-cm localization accuracy on both test datasets, and the detection results can be derived simultaneously by mapping accurate semantic objects from the map into the query point cloud.},

To efficiently solve this problem, a novel universal obstacle avoidance framework based on the guidance layer is proposed for under-actuated AUVs to follow arbitrary referenced path. Based on this, a real-time avoidance line-of-sight guidance law is designed to avoid multi-static or slow time-varying obstacles that appear on the desired route and are pretreated by the oriented bounding box method. The strategy of single-obstacle avoidance, multi-obstacle avoidance, and vertical-obstacle avoidance is designed according to the geometrical features of unknown obstacles. Following the command of guidance law, kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed based on integral terminal sliding mode control to enhance robustness under environmental disturbances and parameter perturbation whether in path following or obstacle avoidance missions. Finally, Lyapunov theory proves stability of control system while numerical simulations demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Driver Fingerprinting (DF), reflecting unique driving characteristics, has received extensive attention for its prominent applications in various domains such as driver identification in automobile sharing paradigms, driver-based insurance, and vehicle anti-theft. Previous research has primarily concentrated on utilizing data from sober states to establish DF models while rarely considering driving fatigue, a common and risky driving state. This study proposes a scheme to analyze the effects of fatigue on DF identification and emphasizes the necessity of incorporating fatigue in DF models. Firstly, we conducted simulated driving experiments to collect the drivers’ behavior data, facial videos, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Secondly, we calculated DF indicators using a double-layer sliding time window and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to extract the DF features. Finally, we divided the full sample set into three subsets: a sober sample subset, a fatigue sample subset, and a double state sample subset containing both sober and fatigue data. We used each sample subset to train DF models based on principal component analysis and long short-term memory. We then utilized all three sample subsets to evaluate the DF models trained by each subset. Combined with the correlation between the indicators and KSS, we analyzed the influence of fatigue on DF identification. The results indicated that the identification accuracies of DF models built solely on sober data significantly decreased when applied to fatigue data. The average accuracy of the 7-driver groups showed the most substantial reduction of 54.59%. Conversely, DF models considering fatigue demonstrated a notable increase in the identification accuracy of drivers, and the maximum increase of 25.47% was from the 7-driver groups. Additionally, we discussed the effects of time windows and the number of drivers on DF identification accuracy and an application framework for driver identification systems based on DF integrating driving fatigue detection.},

In this context, inconsistencies in the initial state and system uncertainties due to unstructured terrain in harsh environments pose a substantial obstacle to the take-off stability. Therefore, this article proposes a stability augmentation control scheme, which aims to achieve stable vertical take-off performance of the amphibious vehicle through accurate estimation of large initial state and effective compensation for uncertainties. Accordingly, an enhanced state predictor with a feedback regulator is designed to improve the accuracy of state estimation and the convergence rate of estimation error. Based on precise state estimation, the $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ adaptation law and the control law are applied for the online estimation and fast compensation of time-varying uncertainties during take-off transience. It is proved theoretically that the proposed stability augmentation control scheme guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, comparative take-off experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness. The results show that the enhanced state predictor reduces the state estimation error by 80.31%. The stability augmentation controller realizes successful and stable take-off maneuver on uneven terrain with inclines of up to 20°, and improves the vertical take-off performance compared with other methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approaches for Traffic Light Control (TLC), effectively coordinating agents in diverse traffic environments remains a challenge. Studies in MADRL for TLC often focus on repeatedly constructing the same intersection models with sparse experience. However, real road networks comprise Multi-Type of Intersections (MTIs) rather than being limited to intersections with four directions. In the scenario with MTIs, each type of intersection exhibits a distinctive topology structure and phase set, leading to disparities in the spaces of state and action. This article introduces Adaptive Multi-agent Deep Mixed Reinforcement Learning (AMDMRL) for addressing tasks with multiple types of intersections in TLC. AMDMRL adopts a two-level hierarchy, where high-level proxies guide low-level agents in decision-making and updating. All proxies are updated by value decomposition to obtain the globally optimal policy. Moreover, the AMDMRL approach incorporates a mixed cooperative mechanism to enhance cooperation among agents, which adopts a mixed encoder to aggregate the information from correlated agents. We conduct comparative experiments involving four traditional and four DRL-based approaches, utilizing three training and four testing datasets. The results indicate that the AMDMRL approach achieves average reductions of 41% than traditional approaches, and 16% compared to DRL-based approaches in traveling time on three training datasets. During testing, the AMDMRL approach exhibits a 37% improvement in reward compared to the MADRL-based approaches.},

This article investigates the two-dimensional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem in the scenario using a practical RIS. After formulating the system model with the mutual coupling effect and the reflection phase/amplitude errors of the RIS, a novel DNN-DANM method is proposed for the DOA estimation by combining the deep neural network (DNN) and the decoupling atomic norm minimization (DANM). The DNN step reconstructs the received signal from the one with RIS impairments, and the DANM step exploits the signal sparsity in the two-dimensional spatial domain. Additionally, a semi-definite programming (SDP) method with low computational complexity is proposed to solve the atomic minimization problem. Finally, both simulation and prototype are carried out to show estimation performance, and the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in the two-dimensional DOA estimation with low complexity in the scenario with practical RIS.},

  abstract     = {Due to the flexibility of drones, it is promising to use them in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations for intelligently searching for lost humans over large areas. However, the limited computing resources of drones pose challenges when deploying deep neural network models. To address this problem, we design a lightweight human recognition model for drones, combining the Ghost Module and the Mobilenetv3 Block. The Ghost Module generates more feature maps with fewer parameters, and the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention module in the Mobilenetv3 Block greatly improves recognition accuracy. Furthermore, recognizing that relying solely on the human recognition model offers limited assistance in SAR operations, we propose a collaborative recognition mode between the drone and the rescue command center (RCC). In this collaborative recognition mode, we design an offloading model for deployment on the drone. The offloading model learns from the middle layer perception features of the lightweight recognition model and selectively offloads the vision taken by the drone to the RCC. The recognition results provided by the RCC are used to update the parameters of the offloading model. We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm, a dual-buffer-based proximal policy optimization algorithm (DBPPO), to train the offloading model with the goal of maximizing accuracy and recall while minimizing the offloading ratio. Specifically, we incorporate an additional data buffer for training the Actor network in the PPO algorithm in a supervised manner, with supervised training interspersed throughout the PPO training process. Eventually, experiments comparing different methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the lightweight recognition model and the collaborative recognition mode in SAR operations.},

Moreover, the modeling uncertainty caused by linearization, unmodeled dynamics, and exogenous disturbance degrades the estimation performance. To cope with the state-estimation problem with modeling uncertainty, a novel scheme is established.

UAV swarms possess superior real-time surveillance capabilities in detecting time-sensitive targets with speed and security, surpassing alternative techniques such as satellites and ground-based sensors. However, the area surveillance problem in adversarial scenarios using UAV swarms necessitates careful consideration of factors such as swarm positioning, flight attitudes, antenna directionality, the threat posed by adversary detection systems (ADSs), and swarm network topology. To address this challenge, we propose the Integrated Low Detection Probability (ILDP) deployment method for UAV swarms, which incorporates the Danger Avoidance Distributed Motion control algorithm (DADM) for swarm collaboration and the Low Detection Probability Topology Control algorithm (LDPTC) for swarm networking. The DADM algorithm facilitates swarm cooperation in achieving area coverage and evading ADSs by leveraging neighboring, environmental, and threat information in adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, the LDPTC algorithm establishes a topology optimization model that comprehensively considers swarm distribution and the impact of directional antenna sidelobes to reduce transmitting energy leakage on the ground. Our strategy significantly decreases the detection probability of UAV swarms by ADSs, ensuring the operational effectiveness of UAV swarms in dynamic adversarial scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed ILDP method, demonstrating considerably lower detection probabilities compared to other approaches in static and dynamic adversary environments across various swarm scales. Moreover, our method excels in real-time surveillance capabilities with lower computational complexity, freeing up computing resources for UAVs to fulfill additional tasks.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have been reliable and economical technological solutions to perform undersea monitoring tasks in comparison to manned vehicles. However, in many situations, UUV is unable to fulfill complex undersea research tasks since target objects appear distorted due to light absorption and scattering. Besides, ocean surveying undergoes severe power requirements compared to terrestrial systems because of battery-driven low-storage vehicles like Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). Therefore, limited power supply, motion resistance of water medium, and distorted target object appearance can delay the mission and reduce the efficiency of UUV in their underwater operations. Considering the resource-constrained undersea monitoring setup, we propose an intelligent two-stage framework for expeditious monitoring of underwater scenes. First, an effective deep neural network is employed for underwater object/region of interest (ROI) detection. Then the detected ROI is restored using an efficient restoration method, thereby improving the visual quality of the degraded images and aiding the navigating and monitoring tasks of UUVs. Our method has been objectively and subjectively assessed using 9 evaluation metrics and our key results reveal mAP of 94.35% and an Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation (UCIQE) score of 3.09, surpassing state-of-the-art methods for object detection. Furthermore, the execution time of 0.550 secs is required for object detection and dehazing, making this proposal suitable for UUVs to perform automatic undersea object detection and dehazing within operational running requirements.},

To benchmark the performance of the DRL controller, a baseline controller representing the human driver, a trajectory optimization algorithm and the wait-and-see deterministic optimal solution are presented. With a minimal onboard computational requirement and a comparable travel time, the DRL controller reduces the fuel consumption by more than 17% compared against the baseline controller by modulating the vehicle velocity over the route and performing energy-efficient approach and departure at signalized intersections, over-performing the more computationally demanding trajectory optimization method.},

In particular, a double-encryption with the signature (DoES) scheme is proposed for session key exchange between EV and charging station which provides data authenticity and integrity. To enable low-latency authentication between EV and power transmitter (PT) in DWPT systems, a sign-encrypt-message (SEM) authentication code scheme is designed leveraging symmetric keys for dynamic charging, which ensures privacy and resistance to tampering attacks. The artificial noise-based physical layer security (AN-based PLS) scheme is also proposed at the physical layer to degrade the wiretapped signal quality of multiple eavesdroppers operating in non-colluding and colluding cases. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and intercept probability (IP) of the considered system with the non-colluding case are derived to show that the proposed AN-based PLS scheme provides lower SOP and IP than the conventional ones without AN. The distance between eavesdroppers and the PT also affects the system SOP and IP in both non-colluding and colluding cases. Moreover, the EV using the DoES scheme takes 52 ms for obtaining session keys from the charging station while it only spends 8.23 ms with the SEM scheme to authenticate with PT for the charging process.},

  abstract     = {Matching high definition (HD) map and real-time sensor data, which is crucial for map-based intelligent vehicle localization, usually requires robust and distinct road features extracted from both ends. However, road features extacted from sensor data (e.g., image, LiDAR) are susceptible to various conditions, such as lighting, weather conditions, dynamic objects, etc. Moreover, although lane lines can provide continuous lateral constraints on a vehicle&#39;s position, it is still challenging to get sufficient longitudinal ones due to the limited road markings. In this article, we employed the longitudinal distance provided by road-pulse, which is the vibration pattern while the vehicle passes lateral road elements (LREs) such as speed bumps, expansion joints, etc., to enhance the localization accuracy. Such road-pulse vibration patterns can be detected accurately with the proposed Sliding Window Gaussian Model (SWGM) from the acceleration data collected using a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU). Detection of road-pulse allows accurate and robust matching of LREs within the HD map to provide accurate longitudinal distances. Then the longitudinal and the lateral distance(s) derived from IMU and off-the-shelf around view monitoring (AVM) are mapped into global constraints with the support of the HD map. Finally, these constraints, together with the measurement from the consumer-level inertial navigation system (INS), are fused within a framework of Kalman Filter based on the Markov model (KF-MM) to achieve accurate vehicle localization. The proposed method has been verified on two routes with a total length of 3.7 km. Experimental results demonstrate that road-pulse can significantly enhance the localization results with good robustness to different scenarios. After fusing with road-pulses, the overall localization error can achieve an average decimeter accuracy on both test routes.},

  abstract     = {A new method for joint ranging and Phase Offset (PO) estimation of multiple drones/aircrafts is proposed in this paper. The proposed method employs the superimposed uncoordinated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) packets broadcasted by drones/aircrafts for joint range and PO estimation. It jointly estimates range and PO prior to ADS-B packet decoding; thus, it can improve air safety when packet decoding is infeasible due to packet collision. Moreover, it enables coherent detection of ADS-B packets, which can result in more reliable multiple target tracking in aviation systems using cooperative sensors for detect and avoid (DAA). By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) statistical distance measure, we show that the received complex baseband signal coming from $K$ uncoordinated drones/aircrafts corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at a single antenna receiver can be approximated by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian Mixture (GM) with $2^{K}$ mixture components in the two-dimensional (2D) plane. While direct joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of range and PO from the derived GM Probability Density Function (PDF) leads to an intractable maximization, our proposed method employs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the modes of the 2D Gaussian mixture followed by a reordering estimation technique through combinatorial optimization to estimate range and PO. An extension to a multiple antenna receiver is also investigated in this article. While the proposed estimator can estimate the range of multiple drones/aircrafts with a single receive antenna, a larger number of drones/aircrafts can be supported with higher accuracy by the use of multiple antennas at the receiver. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is supported by simulation results. We show that the proposed estimator can jointly estimate the range of multiple drones/aircrafts accurately.},

  abstract     = {Actuator fault will lead to the damage of vehicle driving ability. How to analyze the residual driving ability of the vehicle and use the residual driving ability to carry out targeted fault tolerance control (FTC) is the difficulty of FTC for automatic driving vehicles. In this article, an active FTC strategy for actuator fault of four wheels independent drive vehicles and a reference target reshaped scheme (RTRS) are proposed. The method consists of two parts. The first part calculates the limit of the vehicle&#39;s resultant longitudinal force, lateral force and yaw moment through the analysis of the friction limit between the tire and the ground and the vehicle&#39;s driving demand, which is called the driving capability feasible region (DCFR). Considering the impact of actuator fault on the tire force, the second analysis obtains the vehicle&#39;s residual driving limit, which is called the fault tolerant feasible region (FTFR). The upper Model Predictive Control (MPC) motion controller based on the FTFR and the lower allocation controller are designed to realize the FTC algorithm of the vehicle. The second part focuses on the fault scenes that can not be solved by a fault-tolerant controller alone. By weakening the driving task, priority is given to ensuring that the vehicle driving meets the driving capacity limit. The specific way is based on the optimization dynamic solution method, which comprehensively considers the FTC and the original reference target and uses the future output matrix equation of the upper MPC motion controller to design the optimization target to solve the feasible vehicle driving state, so as to achieve the RTRS. Carsim Simulink joint simulation is used to conduct FTC simulation of vehicle stability system actuator faults. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FTC method and the RTRS to solve the problem of vehicle stability system actuator fault.},

Integration with the onboard motion sensors can bridge the positioning solution for a short duration but cannot sustain adequate positioning performance during extended GNSS outages. The proposed research overcomes the limitations of current positioning technologies for land vehicles by integrating a GNSS receiver, onboard motion sensors, and an electronic scanning radar (ESR) used in present land vehicles for adaptive cruise control. A new ESR-based static object detection method is developed using newly designed criteria to estimate the forward velocity. We also propose a radar odometry method to obtain the vehicle position based on the radar scans. Integration with onboard motion sensors based on Extended Kalman filtering (EKF) is designed and realized to achieve accurate positioning in degraded vision and challenging GNSS environments. The proposed multi-sensor positioning solution is examined using several road test trajectories in challenging urban environments in Toronto. It shows RMS error as low as 3 m over more than 90% of the traveled distance.},

This study proposes a driving potential field model to improve the autonomy, safety, and comfort of CAVs during overtaking. The method builds an improved gravitational and repulsive potential field by considering the relative velocity and relative acceleration of the CAV and the leading vehicle. The influence distances of the forces are also specified to make the magnitude of the forces more specific. Road boundary potential fields are also established to regulate the driving area of the CAV. The overtaking path planning algorithm is tested by co-simulation of MATLAB/Simulink, CarSim, and PreScan based on four existing overtaking scenarios in the Chongqing Inner Ring Expressway. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the curvature of the overtaking path by 62.69%, 83.86%, 85.07%, and 91.18%, respectively, compared to the traditional artificial potential field method. The lateral acceleration is also significantly reduced by 36.33%, 62.97%, 45.77%, and 53.38%, respectively, in different overtaking scenarios. The lateral acceleration is less than 0.13 m/s 2 in all cases. Overall, the proposed algorithm is effective in improving overtaking path planning in terms of safety, efficiency, and comfort.},

Due to the high mobility in the vehicular environment and to ensure a higher data rate to establish a reliable V2X communication link, an efficient beam alignment is needed to point the optimal direction between the moving vehicle and the mmWave base station. To deal with this issue, we propose in this paper a new beam alignment method to select the optimal beam angle of Departure (AoD) from the mmWave base station, used further to transmit data toward the moving vehicle directly. The novelty of our proposal concerns the suggestion of an original hybrid beam alignment approach, combining a 128-filters-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 4-layers based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). The selected angle is performed automatically for each vehicle position with the lowest error probability and the highest received signal power. The performance of our proposed CNN-BiLSTM model was evaluated using popular regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results show that our model achieved values of at least 0.0107, 0.0765, and 0.103 for MSE, MAE, and RMSE, respectively, outperforming other machine learning algorithms such as KNN regressor, SVR, BiLSTM, and CNN-LSTM.},

In MARL, how to effectively decompose a global feedback into the relative contributions of individual agents belongs to one of the most fundamental problems. However, the environment volatility due to vehicle movement and wireless disturbance could significantly shape time-varying topological relationships among agents, thus making the Value Decomposition (VD) challenging. Therefore, in order to cope with this annoying volatility, it becomes imperative to design a dynamic VD framework. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel Stochastic Value Mixing (SVMIX) methodology by taking account of dynamic topological features during VD and incorporating the corresponding components into a multi-agent actor-critic architecture. In particular, Stochastic Graph Neural Network (SGNN) is leveraged to effectively capture underlying dynamics in topological features and improve the flexibility of VD against the environment volatility. Finally, the superiority of SVMIX is verified through extensive simulations.},

Next, the end-to-end meta-driving model with high generalization ability is built through the parallel rollouts of multiple tasks and simplified meta-training procedure. Then, a two-stage constrained adaptation strategy is designed to quickly transfer the meta model to new tasks while maintaining good performance, where the meta-training data are reused through the context-based propensity estimation to constrain the optimization objective of new tasks. Extensive experiments are performed in CARLA simulator with various urban scenarios, and the results validate the superiority of our proposed models in both learning efficiencyand generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The existing underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) has the advantage of high rate and low loss in close range, compared to acoustic and radio frequency (RF) signals with limited bandwidth or huge attenuation. Based on the UOWC framework, this work further introduces and investigates the deployment and dynamic effects of the reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) equipped unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) over a vertical single-input multiple-output (SIMO) UOWC system. The proposed RIS-assisted vertical UOWC system is modeled and verified to solve the problems of beam steering, link obstruction, signal enhancement, and pointing errors. We established, for the first time, the impulse response models by Monte-Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) to study the RIS-assisted vertical underwater channel characteristics, which are further compared under specular reflection and beam steering scenarios. Then, the dynamic analyses of the structural parameters of the RIS-equipped UUV and UOWC system model, including vertical transmission distance, transmitter tilt angle, and RIS position on the link impulse response are analyzed. The MCRT simulation results are fitted with a gamma-gamma function that introduces a temporal splitting parameter to obtain a closed-form expression for the impulse response of the linear/reflective composite link of the RIS-assisted UOWC system. The response temporal dispersion, 3-dB bandwidth, and bit error rate (BER) performances are analyzed. The results show that the composite link of the RIS-assisted UOWC system can improve the 3-dB bandwidth by more than 0.5 times compared with the single linear propagation link, reduce the response temporal dispersion and improve the system BER performance.

  abstract     = {In this article, a 3D geometry-based millimeter-wave channel model is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted high-speed train communications. Remarkably, the RIS is attached to surface of train window to guarantee the channel between RIS and receiver is quasi-static, and radiation pattern of RIS element and penetration loss caused by train carriage are taken into account. Furthermore, two RIS phase optimization cases are presented and compared, and a heuristic vector method is applied to further describe RIS phase optimization algorithms for LoS and NLoS scenarios. Based on the proposed model, channel statistical characteristics, namely, spread function and space-time correlation function are derived and analyzed, and impacts of RIS phase optimization cases and channel parameters on channel statistical properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that effective RIS phase optimization schemes increase amplitude of channel impulse response and mitigate small-scale fading caused by high-speed movement and multipath effect, and the phase optimization case that phase of sum of SBR and MBR components to align with the phase of BS-Rx link can achieve higher received power. Moreover, RIS phase optimization cases enhance correlation coefficients in space and time domains by adjusting phase in real time. It is found that correlation functions of RIS phase aligned with LoS components are more stable than case that phase of SBR plused MBR components aligned with phase of BS-Rx link for arbitrary carrier frequencies, angle spread, time instant, number of RIS elements, and moving speed. These observations can be used to provide a foundation for designing and developing RIS-assisted high-speed train communication systems.},

In this work, we conduct measurements taking into account different realistic inter-vehicle distances and ambient noise levels at different times of the day in order to model and verify the dynamic V2V-VLC channel. We also derive the average channel capacity bounds by considering the impact of traffic at different times of the day, atmospheric turbulence and fog. Considering both peak and average optical power levels constraints, we derive the upper and lower bounds by using sphere packing and constraint relaxation methods, as well as truncated-exponential and truncated Gaussian distributions, respectively. The results show that the constraint relaxation method provides an improved estimation for the upper bound, whereas the truncated exponential distribution tightens the lower bound with a minimum gap of 0.4 b/s/Hz during rush hour and in a clear weather condition. We also show that the average capacity bounds of V2V-VLC are less affected by atmospheric turbulence and fog, and that the capacity during rush hours is higher by 0.7 b/s/Hz than during late hours.},

To achieve very low overhead in random access, we consider dynamic slotted ALOHA without observation where each active node adopts time-dependent but observation-independent transmission probabilities. Built on the theory of blind Markov decision processes, we develop an analytical framework of such dynamic access with a simplified version of information states, which leads to optimal time-dependent transmission probabilities. Further, based on this framework, we derive simple closed-form expressions for optimal time-dependent transmission probabilities and maximum long-run system throughput, which makes our scheme also enjoy very low complexity. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other random access schemes without observation over a wide range of network configurations.},

The objective is to maximize the minimum downlink rate by jointly optimizing the user pairing, decoding order, passive beamforming, power and time allocation. A novel two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled problem. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed framework outperforms the conventional reflecting-only-RIS-based and the OMA-based frameworks; 2) the beamforming design and power allocation dominate the achieved performance; 3) increasing the number of passive elements and shortening the distance between BS and STAR-RIS are two effective ways to further improve the performance.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC)-enabled integrated space-air-ground networks have drawn much attention recently, as they can provide communication and computing services to wireless devices in areas that lack terrestrial base stations (TBSs). They could make it possible for battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to offload their computation tasks to MEC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted aerial networks and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and thus reduce their energy consumption and allow them to complete the execution of tasks on time. However, due to the limited computation capacity of the MEC servers at UAVs and satellites, an efficient offloading decision and computation resource allocation scheme is essential. Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of minimizing the latency experienced by the wireless devices in the MEC-enabled integrated space-air-ground network by optimizing the offloading decision while assuring the energy constraints of both devices and UAVs. The problem is proved to be a non-convex problem, and the block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method is proposed as a solution. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the BSUM algorithm in solving the proposed problem.},

This paper aims to mitigate the negative impact of channel aging due to the movement of user equipment in CF massive MIMO systems by utilizing rate-splitting (RS) technology. Taking into account the outdated channel state information, we obtain the achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-assisted CF massive MIMO system, where the private messages can directly adopt conventional maximum ratio, local minimum mean square error (MMSE), and centralized MMSE precoding schemes. Moreover, we propose a bisection-based precoding scheme that maximizes the minimum SE of common messages, which outperforms the superposition-based and random precoding schemes and exhibits strong robustness in complex mobile scenarios. Furthermore, we derive a novel closed-form sum SE expression for the considered system. The results demonstrate that RS technology can mitigate interference in mobile CF massive MIMO systems, improving overall system performance.},

In conventional massive MIMO, the channel is often modeled by the far-field planar-wavefront with rich sparsity in the angular domain that facilitates the design of low-complexity channel estimation. However, this sparsity is not conspicuous in XL-MIMO systems due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront. To address the inherent performance loss of the angular-domain channel estimation schemes, we first propose the polar-domain multiple residual dense network (P-MRDN) for XL-MIMO systems based on the polar-domain sparsity of the near-field channel by improving the existing MRDN scheme. Furthermore, a polar-domain multi-scale residual dense network (P-MSRDN) is designed to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Finally, simulation results reveal the superior performance of the proposed schemes compared with existing benchmark schemes and the minimal influence of the channel sparsity on the proposed schemes.},

Our analysis explicitly reveals that a higher covert rate can be achieved when Willie does not know Alice&#39;s location and the performance gap decreases as the BPP radius increases. In addition, the conducted analysis also shows that the achievable covert rate increases with the number of antenna elements at Alice and the BPP radius for Willie, which is supported by the characterized best detection performance at Willie. Furthermore, we clearly show that a certain covert rate is still achievable from Alice to the receiver Bob even when Bob is further away from Alice relative to Willie&#39;s potential location, which shows one obvious benefit of using RFDA in covert communications.},

As the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable, and there is no noiseless relay in the diamond network, messages received from both relays must act as side information for each other and must be decoded jointly. We propose a joint decoder to decode two Luby transform (LT) codes received from both relays corresponding to the same original message.

  abstract     = {Wideband Terahertz (THz) beamforming is a promising technology in the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications. The combination of ultra-wide bandwidth and ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) results in severe beam squint issues, leading to sharp decrease in the spectral efficiency. Replacing the phase shifters by a large amount of true-time-delays (TTDs) could eliminate the beam squint effect, but leads to unbearable power consumption. It becomes an enormous challenge to mitigate the beam squint effect while maintaining high energy efficiency simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel dynamic group-connected hybrid beamforming architecture with TTD (DGC-TTD) to tackle the above issue. Furthermore, a switch-aided delay-phase beamforming (SDPB) algorithm is proposed for the DGC-TTD architecture, which consists of a delay-phase design (DPD) procedure and a random switch selection (RSS) procedure to achieve the optimal tradeoffs between the spectral efficiency and the power consumption. The simulation results demonstrate that the DGC-TTD architecture with the proposed algorithm provides the near-optimal spectral efficiency and the maximal energy efficiency comparing with existing benchmark results.},

However, to accurately localize a user placed in the area of influence of an RIS, the RIS location needs to be known a priori and its phase profile is required to be optimized for localization. In this article, we study the problem of the joint localization of a hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user, considering that the former is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency (RF) chain enabling simultaneous tunable reflections and sensing via power splitting. Focusing on the downlink of a multi-antenna base station, we present a multi-stage approach for the estimation of the HRIS position and orientation as well as the user position. Our simulation results, including comparisons with the Cramér-Rao lower bounds, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed localization approach, while showcasing that there exists an optimal HRIS power splitting ratio for the desired multi-parameter estimation problem.},

Owing to the reduced frame duration of MFTN signaling, our proposed DMFTN scheme is capable of mitigating detrimental Doppler effects compared to the traditional differentially encoded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing scheme.},

Two issues, however, exist in conventional TMA DM, which are high power loss and generation of mirror harmonic frequency signals that may compromise wireless security. In this article, we propose to construct DM transmitters using a high efficiency TMA. By carefully designing the time sequences of the selected phase shifters, the DM symbols modulated upon multicarrier can be synthesized with suppressed mirror harmonic frequencies. It is shown that the proposed TMA DM transmitters here enjoy feeding network efficiency of 100%, and the transmit DM symbols can be synthesized at a pre-selected frequency only, significantly enhancing security performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated via bit error rate (BER) simulations. Meanwhile, The TMA DM can also be used as a potential technique for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).},

  abstract     = {Level crossing rate (LCR) is a well-known statistical tool that is related to the duration of a random stationary fading process on average . In doing so, LCR cannot capture the behavior of extremely rare random events. Nonetheless, the latter events play a key role in the performance of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication systems rather than their average (expectation) counterparts. In this article, for the first time, we extend the notion of LCR to address this issue and sufficiently characterize the statistical behavior of extreme maxima or minima. This new indicator, entitled as extreme LCR (ELCR), is analytically introduced and evaluated by resorting to the extreme value theory and risk assessment. Capitalizing on ELCR, some key performance metrics emerge, i.e., the maximum outage duration, minimum effective duration, maximum packet error rate, and maximum transmission delay. They are all derived in simple closed-form expressions. The theoretical results are cross-compared and verified via extensive simulations whereas some useful engineering insights are manifested.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm to improve vehicular services through offloading complex computation tasks to the edge servers. However, the high mobility of vehicles requires frequent service migration among edge servers to guarantee uninterrupted services when vehicles traverse multiple cells. This brings great challenges. In this article, we design a dependency-aware backhaul-free migration scheme to enable service migration without relying on backhaul with constraints on task dependencies. Specifically, the vehicle proactively fetches the migrated results based on task dependencies from the original server and migrates the results to its dynamically connected servers along the traveling path. Considering the incurred intermittent communication and computation due to vehicle mobility, a joint offloading and migration optimization problem for determining the time to offload tasks and fetch results is formulated with a time-varying Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the total energy consumption. Time-varying transition probability functions are derived to characterize the dynamics during intermittent offloading and fetching. Based on the MDP framework, an efficient online value iteration algorithm is developed by exploiting temporal correlation to estimate the time-varying value functions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve superior energy-saving performance compared to the baseline online schemes.},

  abstract     = {Neighbor discovery (ND) is a key step in wireless ad hoc network, which directly affects the efficiency of wireless networking. Improving the speed of ND has always been the goal of ND algorithms. The classical ND algorithms lose packets due to the collision of multiple packets, which greatly affects the speed of the ND algorithms. Traditional methods detect packet collision and implement retransmission when encountering packet loss. However, they does not solve the packet collision problem and the performance improvement of ND algorithms is limited. In this paper, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology is introduced into the ND algorithms to unpack multiple collision packets by distinguishing multiple packets in the power domain. Besides, the multi-packet reception (MPR) is further applied to reduce the probability of packet collision by distinguishing multiple received packets, thus further improving the speed of ND algorithms. Six ND algorithms, namely completely random algorithm (CRA), CRA based on SIC (CRA-SIC), CRA based on SIC and MPR (CRA-SIC-MPR), scan-based algorithm (SBA), SBA based on SIC (SBA-SIC), and SBA based on SIC and MPR (SBA-SIC-MPR), are theoretically analyzed and verified by simulation. The simulation results show that SIC and MPR reduce the ND time of SBA by 69.02% and CRA by 66.03% averagely.},

However, the service coverage is limited by the static servers. Therefore, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility are deployed as aerial base stations (BS) to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge. In this article, we introduce a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme to assign the UAV deployment for a multi-UAV MEC system, which incorporates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology into a two-layer training framework. The continuous action, including the UAV trajectory and bit allocation of offloading, is first optimized in the lower layer, while the upper one concentrates on the discrete action space for the user allocation. In particular, we develop a constraint reward function that considers the communication quality in the lower layer to accomplish efficient communication. The well-trained neural network is embedded in the upper layer to provide rapid feedback for the upper environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the baseline methods in terms of the user energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In dense millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple access networks, there are a large number of wireless access links and wireless backhaul links. The mmWave bandwidth is shared among two types of links. So a time-division mode is appropriate for such a scenario to determine a reasonable backhaul/access transmission duration, which is critical to network performance. Meanwhile, minimizing energy consumption is also an important design objective. However, the existence of long backhaul links is an obstacle. The introduction of relay mode can overcome it, but it also leads to more complex mutual interference relationships. On the other hand, each individual (e.g., smart wireless device) wants to obtain the highest access data rate, but it may prevent the entire network from achieving the highest energy efficiency. To cope with these challenges, we propose the new mutual interference characterization method and model the joint access and relay-assisted backhaul resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game. The Stackelberg Nash equilibrium is guaranteed by the rational design of utility function, and the corresponding solution is solved by a backward induction method. Simulation results show that, our scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of network sum rate and network energy efficiency, and also it achieves a better balance between the access data rate and backhaul data rate for each access point.},

To solve this problem, a novel resource allocation (RA) algorithm with partial offloading for uplink multiuser MEC-based V2X networks is proposed. The optimization objective is to minimize the weighted sum of delays and energy consumption subject to the constraints on the delay requirements of tasks, communication distance, and the computation capability of roadside units. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To this end, an alternating optimization approach is designed to convert the original problem into three subproblems. A tabu search-based matching algorithm (TSM) is designed to solve the offloading object-selection subproblem. Then, a graph coloring algorithm is used to achieve channel allocation. Moreover, the computation RA subproblem is transformed into a convex optimization problem through variable substitution, and the suboptimal offloading ratios and computation RA coefficients are obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower total cost than the full offloading algorithm and the shortest distance matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the development of novel information technologies and transportation systems, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have become an important means to improve drivers&#39; experience and reduce road accidents. There are still some challenges regarding vehicle privacy information security and information transmission efficiency in VANETs. To address these challenges, edge nodes are utilized to verify signatures in some existing work, which can reduce the computational overhead of the trusted authority (TA) and improve the efficiency of authentication schemes. Although authentication efficiency has been improved, these schemes also bring potential security risks. Edge nodes located in outdoor environments are vulnerable to attacks, which may result in problems with verification. The TA may verify security parameters twice, such as identities or signatures, resulting in a redundant authentication problem. An authentication scheme assisted by edge nodes is proposed in this article as a solution to this problem. Road-side units (RSUs) serve as edge nodes to verify messages from vehicles and generate lists of valid and invalid messages via a batch detection algorithm, to assist the TA in checking authentication results. Furthermore, the TA can get a correct and valid message list only by a batch check of RSUs results. The proposed scheme also provides an efficient solution to the problem of authentication. In addition, by delegating most authentication tasks to RSUs, the overall efficiency of the scheme is improved. For example, when 100 messages are generated, the batch authentication overhead and transmission overhead of the proposed scheme are approximately 98% and 61% of the ECC-based scheme proposed in the literature. The security analysis and experimental analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements of VANETs and has a smaller computational overhead and communication cost than previous work.},

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the information dissemination mechanism of CNDA. However, a CNDA is vulnerable to interference, which affects information dissemination and rescuing. To solve this problem, this article established a multi-layer information dissemination model of CNDA (MMND) which models the CNDA from the perspective of degree distribution of nodes. The information dissemination process and equilibrium state in CNDA is analyzed by an improved dynamic dissemination method. Then, the effects of the node density, node communication range and other parameters on the equilibrium state are clearly formulated. In addition, an interference optimization algorithm for MMND is proposed, which uses the convex optimization method to minimize the network deployment cost. With this algorithm, the optimal node density and communication range are obtained to alleviate the network interference. Simulation results show that the proportion of each state node in equilibrium state are 0.28, 0.38 and 0.34, respectively, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis. And it proves that the MMND can describe information dissemination process of the CNDA. When the dissemination thresholds are 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, the optimal node density and communication range gradually decreases with the interference coefficient, and the deployment cost also gradually decreases, indicating that the interference of the CNDA has a significant impact on the information dissemination.},

However, the annotation of private data by vehicular users is very difficult since the high costs and professional needs, and one solution is that roadside infrastructures could provide label mapping to the data according to the geographical coordinates. In this scenario where vehicles and roadside infrastructures hold the data and labels, respectively, traditional FL is not applicable since it needs each participant to have both data and labels. In this article, we propose a federated split learning (FSL) paradigm that split the deep model into two submodels which are trained separately in the vehicles and the roadside infrastructures. The vehicles and the roadside infrastructures exchange the intermediate data (i.e., smashed data and cut layer gradients) in training local submodels and upload the local gradients to the global server for aggregation into the global model. Specifically, we first adopt three types of privacy attacks to demonstrate that attackers could recover the private data and labels according to the shared intermediate data and uploaded local gradients. We then propose a differential privacy (DP)-based defense mechanism to defend the privacy attacks by perturbing the intermediate data. Furthermore, we design a contract-based incentive mechanism that encourages vehicles and roadside infrastructures to enhance training performance by adjusting their privacy strategies. The simulation results illustrated that the proposed defense mechanism can remarkably emasculate the performance of attacks and the proposed incentive mechanism is efficient in the FSL paradigm for vehicular networks.},

UAVs purchase energy resources from an energy service provider (ESP) and collect data for a virtual service provider (VSP) to perform synchronization between physical objects and digital twins (DTs). The key issue is to motivate both ESP and UAVs to participate in the energy trading market. To doing so, we design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing desired economic properties, i.e. individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). In particular, we first consider a single energy unit market, where a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme is developed to construct neural networks from the analytical results of Myerson auction. The proposed DL-based auction is guaranteed to fulfill the optimal auction. We then consider a general scenario in which ESP has multiple energy units available to UAVs. A novel DL-based auction with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is proposed to jointly optimize the energy unit allocation and payment rules. We provide numerical results to demonstrate the performance improvement of the DL-based auction schemes compared to the classical auctions in terms of revenue, IC and IR. In particular, for the single energy unit market, the proposed DL-based auction scheme significantly improves the revenue compared with the classical auction and more interestingly, is able to avoid prevent UAVs from submitting their false values.},

  abstract     = {Wireless-powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) makes it feasible to facilitate ubiquitous computation for resource-limited wireless device (WDs) in the self-sustainable manner. However, the channels for wireless power transfer (WPT) and task offloading are hostile due to the severe signal attenuation. The conventional WP-MEC systems generally suffer from a dilemma caused by the trade-off between WPT and task offloading since they are usually implemented during different phases. To tackle these issues, we propose to reconfigure the propagation environment by deploying intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and enable simultaneous WPT and task reception at the hybrid access point (HAP) by adopting the full duplex (FD) technique. Two types of IRS beamforming designs, i.e., dynamic and static IRS bemforming, are considered to strike a balance between the performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We aim to maximize the computational rate of the IRS-assisted FD WP-MEC system with finite edge computing capability. An efficient alternating optimization (AO) method is proposed to tackle the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Specifically, the transmit power of the HAP and the IRS beamforming are optimized by the penalty method and successive convex approximation (SCA) method, respectively. The non-convexity of the sub-problem with respect to the system time allocation, the local computing frequencies and transmit power of the WDs is tackled by the variable substitution method. Numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the benefits of exploiting IRS and FD techniques.},

An intelligent task offloading methodology is designed to optimize the resource allocation scheme in the vehicular network which is based on the state of criticality of the network and the priority and size of tasks. We then develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework using the Markov game for optimizing the task offloading decision strategy.

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) are envisioned to provide seamless coverage and enhanced flexibility compared with traditional terrestrial mobile networks, which has attracted much attention from both industry and academia. However, orchestrating heterogeneous resources in such a large-scale and dynamic network is challenging, especially encountering diverse services with multi-dimensional requirements. In this paper, we first propose a software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)-based reconfigurable SAGIN architecture for constructing service function chains (SFCs). Based on that, we investigate the SFC orchestration and wireless resource management where the virtual link rate adaption between each virtual network function (VNF) is introduced to improve the network resource utilization. Considering the limited physical resource and the heterogeneity in SAGINs, we jointly formulate the VNF embedding, virtual link rate adaption, and wireless resource allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to maximize the network profit. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we first transform the problem into a continuous optimization problem by successive convex approximation. By introducing an additional penalty into the objective function, an iterative alternation algorithm is proposed to find a near-optimal solution of the transformed problem. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks in average network revenue, successfully serving probability, and resource consumption.},

Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables computation and energy constrained IoT devices to offload tasks on powerful servers deployed at the edge of networks. Despite considerable advancements and merits, infrastructures in MEC systems are still lack of robustness. In order to better guarantee the response performance and effectively improve the dependability of the MEC-enabled wireless system, we propose a VM-PM repair strategy with PM preventive maintenance. By introducing Markovian arrival process (MAP) to capture bursty traffic, we model the local computing and edge computing as a MAP/M/1 queue and a MAP/M/ $\bm N$ queue, respectively. Then, by using matrix-geometric solution, we obtain several key performance indexes, including task response latency, throughput, energy consumption level, and computation resource availability. Next, we carry out system experiments to explore the change trends of the system performance. Finally, we jointly optimize the key performance indexes by formulating a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problem. In addition, we develop a sine cosine based task scheduling and server maintenance (SC-TSSM) algorithm to obtain the optimal offload rate and preventive maintenance threshold.},

These contents are required to be fully delivered to the requester CVs within stringent deadlines that the existing radio access technology (RAT) solutions may fail to ensure. Motivated by the above consideration, this article exploits content caching in vehicular edge networks (VENs) with a software-defined user-centric virtual cell (VC) based RAT solution for delivering the requested contents from a proximity edge server. Moreover, to capture the heterogeneous demands of the CVs, we introduce a preference-popularity tradeoff in their content request model. To that end, we formulate a joint optimization problem for content placement, CV scheduling, VC configuration, VC-CV association and radio resource allocation to minimize long-term content delivery delay. However, the joint problem is highly complex and cannot be solved efficiently in polynomial time. As such, we decompose the original problem into a cache placement problem and a content delivery delay minimization problem given the cache placement policy. We use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a learning solution for the first sub-problem. Furthermore, we transform the delay minimization problem into a priority-based weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem, which is solved leveraging maximum bipartite matching (MWBM) and a simple linear search algorithm. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing baselines in terms of cache hit ratio (CHR), deadline violation and content delivery delay.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the multi-task allocation design for vehicular fog computing (VFC) systems, where multiple vehicles offload multiple tasks simultaneously to enhance performance. The data, often originating from multiple sources, must be transmitted at a high data rate in parallel. For catering the thriving demands for transmitting thriving data generated by vehicles, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas are mounted on all the vehicles. However, with an ordinary communcation strategy, the data rate in MIMO-empowered VFC systems may decrease due to the interference generated from MIMO antennas. On the other hand, more antennas may lead to higher energy consumption, which is antagonistic to vehicles powered by limited electricity. To address all these challenges, we aim to offload multiple tasks simultaneously with higher data rates and lower power consumption in MIMO-empowered VFC, while taking into account the mobility of vehicles and communication interference. This design is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to solve. Therefore, a Fountain system is proposed, which is a novel multi-task allocation strategy adopting deep learning and convex optimization, that transforms the multi-task allocation optimization problem into a convex solvable one for achieving an effective sub-optimal solution. For the purpose to utilize Fountain in the real world, the effectiveness of Fountain is evaluated based on real-world vehicle trajectories. Compared with other schemes, simulation results illustrate that our proposed Fountain improves the average transmission data rate by up to 163% and reduces the average power consumption by up to 40%.},

With the objective of improving the freshness of the information received at the GC while ensuring the sensing quality, we develop a MUlti-view SensIng and Communication (MUSIC) framework and jointly optimize the parameters in the framework including the target visiting sequence, the number of sensing, UAV trajectory, service time and transmit power. To solve the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a two-stage approach. Specifically, we first determine the target visiting sequence by considering a specific case, i.e., UAV senses each target only once, through the quadratic penalty (QP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Based on the obtained visiting sequence, we minimize the average peak age-of-information (PAoI) of all targets by jointly optimizing the variables contained in the MUSIC framework via the SCA and exhaustion methods.

First, we consider known environment (i.e., known system statistics) and develop a near-optimal deterministic transmission policy and a low-complexity dynamic transmission (LC-DT) policy. The former policy is derived by casting the main problem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem, which is then solved using the Lagrangian relaxation, relative value iteration algorithm, and bisection. The LC-DT policy is developed via the drift-plus-penalty (DPP) method by transforming the main problem into a sequence of per-slot problems. Finally, we consider unknown environment and devise a learning-based transmission policy by relaxing the CMDP problem into an MDP problem using the DPP method and then adopting the deep Q-learning algorithm.

We analyze the system performance by deriving the closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and ergodic rate of users over the line-of-sight (LoS) Rician fading channels for the aerial IRS links and non-LoS Rayleigh fading for the terrestrial direct links. We further pursue asymptotic analysis for both OP and ergodic rate to reveal useful insights on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slope and achievable diversity order. Also, we evaluate the system throughput under the delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes.

To cope with these challenges, a new structure is designed in this article to facilitate the implementation of FL for IoV. First, we apply the gradient compression and mini-batch federated stochastic gradient descent to reduce the local gradient transmission and computation. Then, with theoretical analysis of the convergence rate and the learning latency, the learning performance can be improved by maximizing the convergence rate under a constrained latency. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize compression ratio, batch size, and spectrum allocation. To solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is developed by problem decomposition. From the results, compression ratio and batch size should be adjusted according to the channel state information and computing power of the road side units to boost the learning efficiency at the cost of slight degradation on the learning accuracy. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is finally demonstrated through extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexing has the potential to achieve high spectrum-efficiency communications at the same time and frequency by using orthogonal mode resource. However, the vortex wave hollow divergence characteristic results in the requirement of the large-scale receive antenna, which makes users hardly receive the OAM signal by size-limited equipment. To promote the OAM application in the next 6G communications, this article proposes the cooperative OAM wireless (COW) communication scheme, which can select the cooperative users (CUs) to form the aligned antennas by size-limited user equipment. First, we derive the feasible radial radius and selective waist radius to choose the CUs in the same circle with the origin at the base station. Then, based on the locations of CUs, the waist radius is adjusted to form the receive antennas and ensure the maximum intensity for the CUs. Finally, the cooperative formation probability is derived in the closed-form solution, which can depict the feasibility of the proposed COW communication scheme. Furthermore, OAM beam steering is used to expand the feasible CU region, thus achieving higher cooperative formation probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived cooperative formation probability in mathematical analysis is very close to the statistical probability of cooperative formation, and the proposed COW communication scheme can obtain higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional scheme due to the effective reception of the OAM signal.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication adopts narrow beams to combat severe propagation loss, resulting in unbearable training duration and overhead. To address this problem, this article proposes a beam training scheme based on a multimodal fusion network. We investigate the feature fusion process of mmWave channel power leakage (CPL) and sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI) to provide richer feature information. Compared with the uni-modal counterparts (mmWave only or sub-6 GHz only), the complementarity and interactivity between different modalities make the proposed network more accurate and robust. Specifically, we propose a multimodal fusion network based on the instantaneous signal received by the mmWave wide beam and sub-6 GHz CSI to estimate the optimal narrow beam. In addition, the additional mmWave narrow beam decided by the predicted probabilities is employed to calibrate beam direction further. Moreover, two optimization strategies are presented based on the proposed multimodal fusion network. Firstly, to improve the robustness to noise in wide beam training, the long and short memory (LSTM) network is employed to track the motion direction of the user and calibrate the mmWave beam. And the wide beam for training is selected according to the previous prediction probability to reduce the training overhead. Secondly, since beam training focuses on partially specific information, to focus on its related features, we introduce the self-attention mechanism to improve the global consistency of the network. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme can achieve significantly more accurate results with less overhead than traditional and existing deep learning-based methods.},

In this article, we propose an extended hybrid carrier (EHC) system to ensure the reliability of wireless communication. The proposed scheme extends the framework of the HC system and provides robust bit error rate performance over the doubly-selective channels, which is considered a potential waveform for high-mobility scenarios. As an improved hybrid carrier system, the proposed scheme constructs the extended weighted fractional Fourier transform through multi-component extension and designs an orthogonal power layered multiplexing model. Additionally, the generic block modulation framework is adopted, offering design flexibility and compatibility. Besides, we discuss the low-complexity implementation and detection of the proposed scheme and derive the input-output relationship. The performance of the EHC system is analyzed under different conditions, and the simulations are given to demonstrate its feasibility and superiority. Retaining the advantages of the HC framework, the proposed scheme optimizes the energy distribution of the signals and achieves a more uniform residual interference distribution, resulting in superior interference suppression. The research results indicate that, compared with the existing HC schemes, the proposed EHC scheme shows significant improvement in the combined performance and meets the requirements of next-generation communications better.},

Artificial noise (AN)-aided transmission by the BS is proposed for improving the achievable secrecy rate. As the first step, we construct a system model in the absence of HWIs. For this case, we present optimal solutions for the signal and AN powers, the beamforming design at the BS, and the phase shifts of the RIS elements. Then closed-form expressions are derived for the cumulative distribution functions of the signal-to-noise-ratios experienced at the legitimate and eavesdropping nodes. Finally, a compact solution is presented for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) performance. At the next step, we extend our designs and analysis by considering the HWIs of the radio-frequency (RF) modules of the BS, MU and Eve. Our results highlight the detrimental impact of HWIs on the achievable ESR.

When the channel matrix is ill-conditioned, existing sub-optimal and optimal detectors exhibit poor performances. In our early work, we have proposed a learning to learn iterative search algorithm (LISA), in which the MIMO detection problem is modeled as a decision problem over tree. The performance of LISA is close to the maximum likelihood detector (MLD) in some scenarios, but degenerates when the MIMO channel is with large condition number. In this paper, we propose to remedy this problem by incorporating a precoding scheme at the transmitter side to reduce the condition number of the channel matrix. Furthermore, we improve LISA by adding a parallel signal recovery module which is named I-LISA. Extensive experimental results show that incorporating the precoding scheme improves not only the performance of LISA, but also existing signal detectors including MLD. Extensive experimental results show that I-LISA with the proposed precoding scheme achieves better performance than MLD for QPSK and 16QAM, and for 64QAM at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.},

  abstract     = {The increasing availability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has provided an emerging way for extensive surveillance and monitoring in civilian and military with the advantages of high flexibility, mobility, and bird&#39;s-eye features. To mitigate the limitations of on-board energy and computation capacity, UAVs usually offload intensive computation tasks (e.g., image/video processing) to base-station-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) facilities. However, base stations are not always available in rural areas. To this end, we propose to offload computation-intensive tasks to Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), which have fixed routes (i.e., highways and roads). However, the UAV-UGV wireless communication may disclose the offloading information to potential eavesdroppers. Besides, such UGVs have sufficient computation slots but may run out of the target area after a period of traveling. In this article, the tasks cached on UAVs are modeled as a stochastic queue, and a secure communication strategy to offload the cached tasks from UAVs to UGVs is proposed. We try to maximize the average utility of such a UAV-UGV collaboration with respect to latency, power, velocity, anti-collision, and distance. To solve this non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, a fast converging and computationally efficient iterative algorithm is investigated utilizing the block coordinate descent method and the successive convex approximation technique. Experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme, significantly improving the average utility of the system.},

Although the recent use of reinforcement learning (RL) could improve the anti-jamming performance, a dynamic selection of working frequency in RL-based FH schemes makes them less attractive due to significant overhead for achieving the frequency synchronization between legitimate transmitter and receiver. In order to get a balance between anti-jamming performance and synchronization overhead, this article proposes a novel RL-based FH approach with block-shifted patterns, where the FH pattern between legitimate transmitter and receiver slowly changes in a block-wise manner and the pattern under a block window is shifted with an offset determined by an RL algorithm. In this way, the synchronization overhead could be well alleviated. Then, we derive some theoretical results for the effect of block size on the anti-jamming performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can reach the analytic bound on throughput of the proposed FH scheme. By properly selecting a block size, the proposed FH scheme could achieve the target balance between anti-jamming performance and synchronization overhead.},

In addition, the original Manhattan model is generalized to include advanced features: corner diffraction, presence of potential blockages in streets, and users positioned at crossroads. As a second approach, deterministic ray tracing (RT) is utilized to compute the same metrics. The two methods are shown to provide close results on the condition that the model parameters are coherently selected.

  abstract     = {The recent development of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology offers new opportunities to meet high-throughput and low-latency communication as well as high-resolution localization requirements in vehicular networks. However, considering the limited transmit power of the road site units (RSUs) and the relatively small radar cross section (RCS) of vehicles with random reflection coefficients, the power of echo signals may be too weak to be utilized for effective target detection and tracking. Moreover, high-frequency signals usually suffer from large fading loss when penetrating vehicles, which seriously degrades the communication service quality of users inside vehicles. To handle this issue, we propose a novel sensing-assisted communication scheme by employing an intelligent omni-surface (IOS) on the surface of vehicles to enhance both sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance. To this end, we first propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, including the joint S&amp;C stage and the communication-only stage, to fulfil more efficient communication performance improvements benefited from sensing. The achievable communication rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the IOS phase shifts, and the duration of the joint S&amp;C stage. However, solving this ISAC optimization problem is highly non-trivial since inaccurate estimation and measurement information renders the achievable rate lack of closed-form expression. To handle this issue, we first derive a closed-form expression of the approximate achievable rate under uncertain location information, and then unveil a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the joint S&amp;C stage to offer useful insights for practical system design. Moreover, two typical scenarios including interference-limited and noise-limited cases are analyzed to provide a performance bound and a low-complexity algorithm for the considered systems. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-assisted communication scheme in achieving a higher achievable rate with lower transmit power requirements.},

Considering unreliable backhaul links between the access point and the transmitters, we analyze secrecy performance in two scenarios: when backhaul activity knowledge is available (KA) and when backhaul activity knowledge is unavailable (KU). Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are derived. Our analytical results show that in the backhaul KA scenario, the asymptotic limit of the SOP and the slope of the ESR are affected only by the number of transmitters and the backhaul reliability factor, and not by other system parameters. In contrast, only the backhaul reliability factor affects these two performances in the backhaul KU scenario. These performances are independent of the number of eavesdroppers in both backhaul KA and KU scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that acquiring knowledge of the activity of backhaul links yields better secrecy performance as compared to acquiring knowledge of the channel state information of the eavesdroppers. We also show that the secrecy diversity order of both selection schemes under perfectly reliable (wired) backhaul links is identical.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are considered as typical application scenarios in the beyond 5th generation (B5G) and the 6th generation (6G) networks. The conventional on-ground base station (BS) has heavy traffic burden for seamless coverage and user equipments (UEs) suffer severe interference. To address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) architecture assisted by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, multiple UAVs serve as flying remote radio heads (RRHs), collaborating with the macro base station (MBS), while the baseband units (BBUs) in the cloud handle processing and computing tasks. Firstly, we explore the optimal sector division scheme for the MBS and the corresponding UAV deployment scheme, considering factors like the UAV working efficiency and the overhead of interference management (IM). Despite leveraging UAVs to enhance services and offload traffic from the MBS, the proposed network inevitably encounters various categories of interference, i.e., backhaul interference, co-channel interference and multi-tier interference. To mitigate these issues, the cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) technique is employed for solving the backhaul interference. In addition, effective spatial multiplexing measures, namely sector division and beamforming are adopted by the MBS and UAV respectively to suppress the co-channel interference. We further design SIC-STIA-IS scheme, incorporating successive interference cancellation (SIC), space-time interference alignment (STIA) and interference steering (IS) scheme, to manage the cross-tier interference (CTI), intra-tier interference (ITI) and inter-cell interference (ICI), respectively. The in-depth simulation and numerical results verify that by adopting SIC-STIA-IS scheme, the proposed UAV-assisted H-CRAN architecture has superb performance in the spectral efficiency (SE).},

  abstract     = {Due to the development of communication technology and the rise of user network demand, a reasonable resource allocation for wireless networks is the key to guaranteeing regular operation and improving system performance. Various frequency bands exist in the natural network environment, and heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) has become a hot topic for current research. Meanwhile, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has become a key technology for developing next-generation wireless networks. By modifying the phase of the incident signal arriving at the RIS surface, RIS can improve the signal quality at the receiver and reduce co-channel interference. In this article, we develop a RIS-assisted HCN model for a multi-base station (BS) multi-frequency network, which includes 4G, 5G, millimeter wave (mmWave), and terahertz networks, and considers the case of multiple network coverage users, which is more in line with the realistic network characteristics and the concept of 6G networks. We propose the optimization objective of maximizing the system sum rate, which is decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., the user resource allocation and the phase shift optimization problem of RIS components. Due to the NP-hard and coupling relationship, we use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize the local solutions of the coalition game and the local discrete phase search algorithm to obtain the global solution. In contrast, most previous studies have used the coalition game algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem alone. Simulation results show that the algorithm performs better than the rest of the algorithms, effectively improves the system sum rate, and achieves performance close to the optimal solution of the traversal algorithm with low complexity.},

For such, the RIS is segmented into two zones, namely, an EP zone and a BD zone, where the EP zone is used to enhance the received primary signal at D while the BD zone is utilized to backscatter RIS&#39;s signal to D. The coexistence outage probability (COP) is first developed, which is shown to be dominated by the minimum number of reflectors in the two zones for sufficiently high transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, the sum ergodic capacity (EC) can only be improved by increasing the transmit power and the number of reflectors in the EP zone at high transmit SNR. Finally, two algorithms are designed to minimize the number of reflectors in the two zones while achieving acceptable COP or sum EC.},

In this paper, three variants of OTFS transmission, i.e., frequency-domain pilot-aided (FD-PA) OTFS, time-domain pilot-aided (TD-PA) OTFS, and time-domain training sequence (TD-TS) OTFS, are proposed. They enable one-dimensional channel estimation and corresponding equalization to be applied in either frequency or time domain. The relationships among different channel representations for fast fading channels are first formulated with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse DFT matrices. The transmission frame construction and associated channel estimation methods are then presented in detail for FD-PA-OTFS, TD-PA-OTFS, and TD-TS-OTFS respectively. The theoretical mean-square-error (MSE) for each of the proposed channel estimation methods is also derived. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the MSE analyses and demonstrate that the proposed FD-PA-OTFS is the most effective transmission technique for high-mobility wireless communications in terms of diversity performance, signaling overhead, and power efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a RIS-enabled joint backscattering and communication (JBAC) system, where the backscatter communication coexists with the primary communication and occupies no extra spectrum. Specifically, the RIS modifies its reflecting pattern to act as a passive BD and reflect its own information back to the base station (BS) in the backscatter communication, while helping the primary communication from the BS to the users simultaneously. We further present an iterative active beamforming and reflecting pattern design to maximize the user average transmission rate of the primary communication and the goodput of the backscatter communication by solving the formulated multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Numerical results fully uncover the impacts of the number of reflecting elements and the reflecting patterns on the system performance, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is an interesting proposal for supporting massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future mobile networks. In this use case, mobile networks connect to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which may have low computational processing capacities, and thus, they are exposed to different security threats. In this regard, physical-layer security (PLS) arises as an alternative technique to protect information. This work proposes a new scheme based on the design of unknown codebooks to an external eavesdropper aiming at guaranteeing PLS in the uplink of SCMA systems over generalized $\kappa$ - $\mu$ fading channels. Considering that the SCMA codebook design can be realized from the rotation of base quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations using the signal-space-diversity (SSD) technique, a novel upper-bound expression to calculate the average bit error probability (ABEP) of multidimensional SSD systems is derived. Then, a metric to select the best rotation matrices is determined. With this, a set of optimal and suboptimal rotation matrices can be acquired. A strategy to obtain secret keys in the SCMA system is presented by considering imperfect channel estimation. The secret keys are used to select matrices for rotating the base QAM constellations used in the codebooks generation. Finally, an uncoded and turbo-encoded SCMA system is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that our proposal ensures a near-optimal SCMA performance while the eavesdropper cannot decode the information.},

To deal with anonymous authentication and message integrity during communication, many protocols have been designed. One important approach is using Ring Signature to obtain superior security and better efficiency. However, most of the previous Ring Signature-Based authentication protocols could not support the Trusted Authority (TA) to revoke the vehicle user&#39;s identity whenever it wanted. In this article, we solve this problem and realize Conditional Privacy-Preservation Authentication successfully. As part of our work, we propose the first Lattice-based Revocable Ring Signature scheme, and prove its security under the random oracle model, which could be of independent interest. It is quantum-resistant, highly efficient, and suitable for scenarios where the TA needs to be accountable. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that we adopted a similar structure with the NIST signature standard CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which will increase the richness of the algorithm and standardization.},

Due to the limited sensing accuracy and sensing range of single base station (BS), multi-BS cooperative sensing can be applied to realize high-accurate, long-range and continuous sensing, exploiting the specific advantages of large-scale networked mobile communication system. This article proposes a cooperative sensing method suitable to mobile communication systems, which applies symbol-level sensing information fusion to estimate the location and velocity of target. With the demodulation symbols obtained from the echo signals of multiple BSs, the phase features contained in the demodulation symbols are used in the fusion procedure, which realizes cooperative sensing with the synchronization level of mobile communication system. Compared with the signal-level fusion in the area of distributed aperture coherence-synthetic radars, the requirement of synchronization is much lower. When signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is −5 dB, it is evaluated that symbol-level multi-BS cooperative sensing effectively improves the accuracy of distance and velocity estimation of target. Compared with single-BS sensing, the accuracy of distance and velocity estimation is improved by 40% and 72%, respectively. Compared with data-level multi-BS cooperative sensing based on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, the accuracy of location and velocity estimation is improved by 12% and 63%, respectively.

First, some fundamental conclusions are presented for deriving the optimal structures of matrix variables from complex matrix derivatives. Then, some restrictions are imposed on complex matrix derivatives for ensuring that the resultant first order equations in the KKT conditions exploit symmetric properties. Accordingly, a specific family of symmetric matrix equations is proposed and their properties are unveiled. Using these symmetric matrix equations, the optimal structures of matrix variables are directly available, and thereby the original optimization problems can be significantly simplified. In addition, we take into account the positive semidefinite constraints imposed on matrix variables. In order to accommodate the positive semidefinitness of matrix variables, we introduce a matrix transformation technique by leveraging the symmetric matrix equations, which can dramatically simplify the KKT conditions based analysis albeit at the expense of destroying convexity. Moreover, this matrix transformation technique is valuable in practice, since it offers a more efficient means of computing the optimal solution based on the optimal structures derived directly from the KKT conditions.},

However, it is usually difficult to obtain an ideal copy of the non-cooperative interference since its statistical characteristics are unknown. A novel adaptive antenna array based non-cooperative co-channel interference cancellation system for ultrashort wave (USW) radios is proposed in this article. By adopting the auxiliary antenna array, the designed system realizes blind interference extraction from the received mixed signal based on the constrained maximum variance criterion. Then, the extracted interference is assigned as the reference signal to realize interference cancellation of the received signal in the reference antenna channel. Meanwhile, the non-ideality characteristics including nonlinearity and IQ imbalance in the receiver chain are taken into account. A widely linear least mean square (WLLMS) model based on Volterra series is introduced in the cancellation process. As a blind method, no extra reference signal and specified array structure are required in this proposed system. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which implies comparatively strong practicality in non-cooperative co-channel interference cancellation for USW radios in engineering.},

The state-of-the-art approaches inform civilian vehicles about EmVs only when they are in a close proximity (up to 300 m). However, in some situations (e.g., in congested areas), this may not be enough for the civilian vehicles to safely and timely maneuver out of the lane of an EmV. Our approach is, to the best of our knowledge, a unique way to significantly extend this awareness by creating an orchestrated 5G-based MEC deployment of BSA application service on optimally selected edges, thereby stretching over multiple edge domains and even countries. While consuming the real-time location, speed, and heading of an EmV, such application service affords the drivers with sufficient time to create a clear corridor, allowing the EmV to pass through unhindered in a safe manner thereby increasing the mission success. The detailed design and the performance analysis of the BSA application service that has been created following modern cloud-native principles based on Docker and Kubernetes, is presented in terms of the impact of emergency scale on the MEC system resources and service response time. Moreover, we also introduce a metric called panic indicator, which depicts how the proposed BSA service can potentially help in enabling drivers to calmly maneuver out of the path of an EmV, thereby increasing road safety.},

  abstract     = {Covert communication in delay-sensitive application scenarios in the presence of an eavesdropper has drawn substantial attention in the context of data sensing and transmission. However, most of the existing works only focus on guaranteeing communication covertness, and information freshness by characterizing a recently new metric, termed as age of information (AoI), while they ignore the age of channel variation (AoC), which is the time duration that channel state information (CSI) is near-static, and important for reliable covert communication in dynamic environments. Depending on the packet length or dynamic environment, channel variation may occur faster than optimal AoI, and the power allocated to the users is not reliable to ensure covert communication. In this article, we propose a novel reliable covert communication scheme with the aim of minimizing AoI in the time-varying channels. We address two main challenges in time-varying networks: 1) transmitting users&#39; packets with the requested desirable size; 2) guaranteeing reliable the negligible Eve&#39;s probability detection. In the simulation results, we show the performance and percentage of reliability of covert communication with the aim of minimizing AoI subject to a new constraint that guarantees the Eve&#39;s negligible detection probability compared to the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of drone-assisted collaborative learning is considered. In this scenario, swarm of intelligent wireless devices train a shared neural network (NN) model with the help of a drone. Using its sensors, each device records samples from its environment to gather a local dataset for training. The training data is severely heterogeneous as various devices have different amount of data and sensor noise level. The intelligent devices iteratively train the NN on their local datasets and exchange the model parameters with the drone for aggregation. For this system, the convergence rate of collaborative learning is derived while considering data heterogeneity, sensor noise levels, and communication errors, then, the drone trajectory that maximizes the final accuracy of the trained NN is obtained. The proposed trajectory optimization approach is aware of both the devices data characteristics (i.e., local dataset size and noise level) and their wireless channel conditions, and significantly improves the convergence rate and final accuracy in comparison with baselines that only consider data characteristics or channel conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed approach achieves an average 3.85% and 3.54% improvement in the final accuracy of the trained NN on benchmark datasets for image recognition and semantic segmentation tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in training, leading to an average 24% and 87% saving in the drone&#39;s hovering time, communication overhead, and battery usage, respectively for these tasks.},

The proposed framework generalizes the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) enabled solution to the typical transmit beamforming problems presented in the form of quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) in the literature. It is proved that the optimization problems subsumed under the framework always admit a rank-one optimal solution when they are feasible and their optimal solutions are not trivial. This finding indicates that the relaxation is tight as the optimal solution of the original beamforming QCQP can be straightforwardly obtained from that of the SDR counterpart without any loss of optimality. Four representative examples of transmit beamforming, i.e., transmit beamforming with perfect channel state information (CSI), transmit beamforming with imperfect CSI, chance-constraint approach for imperfect CSI, and reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) aided beamforming, are shown to demonstrate how the proposed optimization framework can be realized in deriving the SDR counterparts for different beamforming designs.},

Different from traditional in-time communications, we investigate how many packets can be received $\delta$ -on-time, meaning that the packet is received around an expected slot with a deviation no larger than $\delta$ slots. In this framework, we first derive the on-time reception rate of the random transmission scheme when no packet-controlling is used. Our analytical and simulation results show that the on-time reception rate of random transmissions decreases (to zero) with the sequence length. To improve the on-time reception rate, we further propose to schedule the packets by delaying, dropping, or repeating the transmissions. Specifically, we model the packet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then obtain the optimal scheduling policy using an efficient iterative algorithm. By using the optimal packet scheduling, the on-time reception rate converges to a much larger constant, thus ensuring better on-timeliness. Moreover, we show that the on-time reception rate increases if the target reception interval and/or the deviation tolerance $\delta$ is increased, or the randomness of the fading channel is reduced. By optimally scheduling the packets and choosing these parameters, therefore, wireless channels will be more suitable for the latency-sensitive applications.},

Due to the coupling of these optimization variables, all the three optimization problems are non-convex. To address these non-convex problems, we first reformulate them by the fractional transformation and Lagrangian dual transformation, and then utilize the alternating optimization (AO) framework to optimize the variables alternately. Moreover, some advanced techniques are utilized to solve the resulted AO sub-problems, e.g., the penalty-based method to solve the rank-one constraint and the Riemannian conjugate gradient to design phase shift matrix.

It dynamically allocates network resources such as bandwidth and time slots to each RAN slice, meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of each slice on a common underlying 5G infrastructure. This RAN slicing problem normally has a large number of resource combinations with a practical number of RAN slices. However, most Q -learning based Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms cannot successfully converge with the size of the action space. To address this issue, we introduce the architecture of Action Factorization (AF) with a soft-max layer, which aids exploration by decomposing a large action space into multiple independent sub-action spaces. In addition, RAN slicing problem is facing a performance issue for highly mobile users. To improve the performance of this problem, we use current channel information and future channel information predicted by long short-term memory (LSTM). We then propose a DRL architecture combined with AF and LSTM for bandwidth allocation in RAN slicing. Furthermore, we point out that the QoS requirements used as a performance metric in existing studies are inconsistent with the QoE achievement from the user&#39;s point of view. Therefore, we introduce new metrics, data rate indicators (DRI), to compensate the discrepancy. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that our proposed solution efficiently allocates bandwidth to each slice for a reasonable number of slices by maximizing the sum of rewards from QoE achievement for each user under high mobility.},

Assuming that the satellite network and aerial network share the same spectrum, and only the imperfect channel state information is available, we formulate a total transmit power minimization problem subject to the outage probability constraints for users, the per-antenna transmit power budgets of satellite and aerial platform, and unit-modulus requirement for IRS. To tackle this mathematically intractable problem, we propose an alternation-based robust transmission algorithm, combining the central limit theorem, successive convex approximation and penalty function, to optimize the beamformers of satellite and aerial platform, phase shifts and power allocation. Furthermore, we propose a generalized zero-forcing based low-complexity robust transmission algorithm, integrating the second-order Taylor expansion and Bernstein-type inequality, to obtain a satisfactory performance while reducing the computational load.

We will also apply our model to a power allocation problem and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum of the QoE of users while guaranteeing the minimum data rate for each user. We show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the conventional objective model in terms of average MOS and outage probability. Furthermore, users are more satisfied with the QoE maximization problem compared to the conventional rate maximization problem. Also, due to the limited power available to meet the needs of all users, we will introduce a joint power allocation and admission control problem. In our proposed approach, BSs monitor the outage probability and MOS of the overall system for each connection request to determine the service&#39;s perceived quality level and then decide whether or not to accept a new connection.

However, a novel framework of lane-change trajectory planning and control based on the dynamic characteristics of distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEVs) is proposed in this paper to increase the possibility of safe driving in complex traffic conditions. First, a dilatational stability region determined by limits of stable yaw rate and saturated slip angles of each tire is employed to reveal dynamic instantaneous characteristics. On the basis of dilatational stability regions, the expanded envelopes by additional direct yaw moment can be identified by the expressions of irregular hexagons. Then, a series of unconstrained lane-change trajectory clusters can be generated to minimize longitudinal and lateral jerk, which is used to divide the global feasible region determined by the dilatational stability region and three-dimensional collision-free tunnel. Then, the technique for order preference for similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) is utilized to achieve optimization of trajectory candidates from the global feasible region. The tracking controller aims at following the optimal lane-change trajectory, which is designed by the expanded stability boundaries of DDEV. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed planner and controller under high-speed, full-road and multi-vehicle traffic conditions.},

To address this issue, a hierarchical multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) decoupling controller is proposed in this study. Based on the hierarchical control configuration, the coupled vehicle roll and planar dynamics are resolved in the high-level control, and a control allocation is utilized for tracking control in the low-level control. The decoupled internal dynamics and nominal stability are then analyzed and proved. Moreover, by using the vehicle yaw rate and load transfer ratio, a control trigger with dynamic weighting is designed to guarantee the feasibility of the MIMO decoupling control and smooth control efforts. Through the co-simulation between CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller are verified.},

  abstract     = {As a unique reflux path for trains, the ‘train-rail’ mobile grounding system has the double functions – the traction power feedback and the transmission of train&#39;s communication signal. With the constant increment of operational velocity and traction power for high-speed railway, the coupling relationship existing in the ‘train-rail’ mobile coupling grounding system becomes complicated, when the train&#39;s wheels roll over the insulated joint. It may result in the frequent occurrence of rolling arc and the ablation of rail ends and insulated joints, which might lead to the series connection of the rail circuit or even trigger the misjudgment of operational control system. As the impedances existing in the grounding system vary transiently when the relative distance between the train and the fixed terrestrial grounding installations changes, the dynamic coupling mechanism between the transiently-varying topology of reflux path and the distribution of reflux at each grounding wheel tends to be analyzed. Depending on the built ‘catenary-train-rail’ dynamic coupling grounding reflux model, the correlation between the ‘train-rail’ mobile grounding reflux and the evolutionary process of rolling arc is explored. In order to reduce the risk of ‘wheel-rail’ arcing phenomenon, a novel method of automatically controlling insulated joint is proposed herein, as its feasibility is verified via the comparison with the original type of the insulated joint.},

  abstract     = {A single-layer dual-band shared-aperture antenna for vehicular communications is proposed in this article, which adopts a coplanar millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) band antenna embedded in a microwave band antenna. In the microwave Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) band (5.905–5.925 GHz), an annular-ring patch antenna based on the TM 12 mode is designed. A pair of slots are etched out on the radiating patch to reshape the current distribution of the TM 12 mode, making it more codirectionally distributed. The sidelobe level can be completely suppressed from −5.2 dB, thus achieving better broadside radiation characteristics. In the 5G mm-Wave n257 band (26.5–29.5 GHz), a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) slotted cavity backed antenna based on TE 440 mode is designed, which achieves high gain and low sidelobe performance. Experimental results show that the impedance bandwidth of the microwave band is 3.7% (5.74–5.96 GHz), and that of the mm-Wave band is 10.9% (26.66–29.72 GHz). The mutual performances of the two antennas are hardly affected, and the measured isolation of both ports is greater than 45 dB. The measured gain reaches 10.8 dBi and 13.7 dBi, respectively, while maintaining sidelobe levels below −14.8 dB. At the same time, the antenna profile is only 0.015 λ 0 ( λ 0 is the wavelength in free space at low frequency). Therefore, a microwave and mm-Wave dual-band shared-aperture antenna with a compact structure and independently controllable performance is realized, which provides a promising candidate for different vehicular communication application scenarios.},

Pressure estimation algorithms based on hydraulic models have been widely used in dynamics control, while stability and convergence are not well guaranteed. To mitigate the hydraulic model error, the Kalman Filter is adopted to fuse the hydraulic model and the additional signal from the vehicle. However, the change of inputs will lead to the change of pressure circuit dynamics which makes the Kalman Filter not well suited for all pressure estimation conditions. This article presents two kinds of hydraulic models depending on the valve dynamics, and an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter is presented to integrate different hydraulic models to suit various control inputs. The filter developed in this article is verified in typical driving conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed filter presents better pressure estimation compared to Kalman Filter based on a single model.},

This article studies the tracking-oriented TVF control problem of UAVSs under jointly-connected directed switching topologies (JCDST). To begin with, a distributed formation controller with one intermediate variable for estimating each UAV&#39;s state is devised based upon dynamic output feedback control approach. Then, the tracking-oriented TVF formation control issue is converted into an issue about the asymptotic stability control of a fast time averaging system via an appropriate variable conversion. Furthermore, the sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of the fast time averaging system, and the computing approach of the unknown control matrices are acquired and proved through a special kind of similar matrix transformation and Hurwitz stability criterion.

  abstract     = {Routing for autonomous vehicles with global traffic information and sufficient direct cooperation among vehicles has been widely studied to relieve traffic congestion in recent years. However, the assembly rate of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) equipment in practical traffic systems is currently and could be at a low level in near future. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles can only access localized traffic information, and direct cooperation among them cannot always be guaranteed. Thus, how to optimize the routing choices in such scenarios is worthy of particular attention. In this article, we propose a self-organized routing strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Under the condition of limited traffic information, the proposed self-organized mechanism well organizes localized traffic conditions through vehicle-level routing decisions, which are able to achieve network-wide benefits gains. In the specified DRL, we propose a novel reward mechanism to harmonize indirect interactions among vehicles by jointly learning individual and overall efficiency, even if each vehicle is modified to make individual decisions independently, rather than only focusing on individual interests as in the greedy strategy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organized strategy is promising to resolve the routing problem from the perspective of individual decision-making with limited traffic information.},

  abstract     = {Target tracking plays a vital role in both civil and military fields. Traditional radar point (maneuvering) target tracking methods always require a prior kinematic model to match the target motion. In fact, it is hard to satisfy this requirement in practice, especially when sudden maneuvering happens for non-cooperative target tracking, which leads to an undesirable tracking peak error. Motivated by this, a new data-driven maneuvering target tracking method aided with partial models is proposed in this article to suppress this peak error. Here, since the historical target tracks include as many kinds of sudden maneuvers as possible, a data-driven learning-based network is trained to obtain high-precision state estimate when the target makes unpredictable maneuvers. Meanwhile, when the target has weak or no sudden maneuver, state estimate with satisfying accuracy is still obtained via prior kinematic models, where the Kalman filtering gain and model parameters are learned through the designed network to further promote its adaptivity. In particular, the kinematic modeling-based estimation also maintains the tracking robustness in the absence of representative training data. In addition, a discriminant network of evolution models is constructed to decide the dominant model (i.e. data-driven evolution model or one of the kinematic models) online based on radar measurements in the sliding window, which actually outputs the weights to make the final estimate as a weighted combination of the data-driven learning-based estimate and the kinematic modeling-based estimate. The proposed method is discussed in detail from the perspectives of tracking precision comparison, timeliness analysis, and noise analysis. The results show that the algorithm can ensure the timeliness of calculation and has a certain robustness under different noises. And most importantly, it has higher tracking precision when target maneuver happens suddenly.},

A theoretical derivation is carried out to determine the optimal strategy parameters setting, and used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over different scenarios, taking into account the road traffic intensity, the EHD battery capacity, the transmit power and the data rate. Results show that regular traffic patterns, as those created by vehicles platooning, can increase the obtained throughput by more than 30% with respect to irregular ones with the same average intensity. Black out probability is also derived for the former scenario. The resulting tradeoff between higher average throughput and lower black out probability shows that the proposed approach can be adopted for different applications by properly tuning the strategy parameters.},

Therefore, mining fine-grained discriminative features is an important way to improve performance. Although previous studies have achieved some successes, the standard model still has some drawbacks. First, global features are ignored when extracting discriminative features. Second, the potential interactions between different regions are not sufficiently considered. To address this challenge, we propose an attention multibranch loss convolutional neural network (AMLNet) in a weakly supervised manner to learn features from different regions and explore the interactions between them. Specifically, a pretrained model is used to initially extract rich vehicle feature information, and attention is enhanced using a multifeature fusion global cross-channel loss network (MGCL) and cross-channel pooling enhanced attention feature network (CCPA) to mine discriminative features while enhancing global feature representation. We conduct comparative experiments on two public datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition performance than other advanced algorithms. Thus, the proposed method is more effective when applied to fine-grained vehicle recognition tasks.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) introduces challenges regarding computation-intensive and time-sensitive related services for data processing and communication. Limited resource availability increases the processing latency and may cause application interruption due to the mobility of vehicles. To address the real-time requirements of users and tasks, mobile edge computing (MEC), in which data are processed at the network edge, has been proposed to collaborate with the cloud to provide better performance. However, the offloading strategies proposed previously have some shortcomings in addressing issues such as task dependency and resource competition. In this article, we propose a novel offloading strategy for MEC, Com-DDPG, in which multiagent reinforcement learning is used to enhance the offloading performance. Within the IoV transmission radius, multiple agents work together to learn the changes in the environment, such as the number of mobile devices and the queue of tasks, and take appropriate action in the form of a strategy for offloading to an edge server. First, we discuss models of task dependency, task priority, and resource consumption from the perspective of server clusters and multiple dependencies among tasks. In the proposed method, the communication behavior among multiple agents is formulated; then, the policy determined through reinforcement learning is executed as an offloading strategy to obtain the corresponding results. Second, to enhance the communication of information among multiple agents, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed as an internal state predictor to provide a more complete environmental state, and a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to learn and enhance the features obtained from the agents&#39; communication. Finally, experiments carried out based on the Alibaba Cluster Dataset are presented. The results show that our method is superior to baseline methods in terms of energy consumption, load status and latency.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are gaining popularity in heavy-duty transportation applications because of their high efficiency, lack of local emissions, and short refueling time. Moreover, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), which plans the longitudinal movements of heavy-duty vehicles, is also a potential solution to increase fuel efficiency, safety, and road capacity. In order to integrate the aforementioned two technologies, in this research, a homogeneous heavy-duty modular fuel cell vehicle (MFCV) platoon is hierarchically created using a decentralized optimization technique called the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM). The higher-level controllers coordinate platoon members’ movements by accounting for aerodynamic effects, balancing string stability, and ensuring comfortable driving. Furthermore, power allocation is accomplished by lower-level controllers, minimizing total costs, which include hydrogen and degradation expenses. According to the simulation&#39;s findings, integrating the suggested power allocation approach with the proposed CACC method can reduce the overall cost by up to 7.5%. The calculation time of the presented technique can be reduced by an average of 60.17% and 68.27% compared to centralized and distributed methods, respectively. In addition, both the cybersecurity and delay analyses of the recommended decentralized architecture are also examined. The results indicate that the modularity of the proposed strategy leads to highly favorable consequences.},

The problem of adjusting automated vehicles driving style is a difficult one. To address the above issues, this article focuses on the spatio-temporal motion planning problem of automated vehicles in multi-vehicle conflict scenarios. A risk-field based motion planning method is proposed. By predicting the state of the vehicles in the traffic scenario, the risk field matrix is built for motion planning. The idea of path-velocity separation planning is adopted to divide the motion planning into two layers as path planning and trajectory planning. In path planning, static risk matrices serve as constraints. Considering the driving safety and comfort, the path cost function is designed to evaluate the candidate path group, obtained by longitudinal sampling and lateral sampling, to determine the target path. The dynamic risk matrices are used to construct the spatio-temporal graph corresponding to the target path, based on which dynamic planning and quadratic planning are introduced to solve the trajectory planning problem. Simulations were built to prove the practicability of the method. Results show that by adjusting risk threshold can change the aggressiveness of autonomous vehicles driving style.},

  abstract     = {One essential issue in skeleton-based driver action recognition is that incomplete skeletons collected from real scenes would degrade model performance. However, existing models often ignore the missing joint preprocessing and tend to be over-parameterized. In this work, we propose 1) a padding strategy SmoothNode and 2) a skeleton-based Multi-Scale Excitation Graph Convolution Network (MSE-GCN). Firstly, SmoothNode, as a part of preprocessing, fills both missing frames and nodes in a smooth style and repairs the incomplete skeletons to a relatively complete state. Secondly, inspired by the efficient modeling ability of EfficientGCN in dynamic skeletons, the MSE-GCN model is designed to reason multi-scale spatial-temporal features through two improvements, i.e., Spatial Graph Convolution layer based on the Independent Self-connecting formulation mode (SGC-IS) and Multi-Scale Wrapper Fused Spatial-Temporal Excitation layer (MSW-FSTE). SGC-IS optimizes the normalized adjacency matrix formulation mode and strengthens connections between each pair of nodes, while MSW-FSTE excites temporal patterns with the global spatiotemporal features in a hierarchical residual-like style and learns multi-scale features in the temporal domain. By coupling these proposals, we develop SMOMS, a driver behavior recognition framework. Extensive experiments on three released datasets, i.e., Drive&amp;Act, 3MDAD, and EBDD, demonstrate that the proposed SMOMS framework outperforms other methods.},

However, even though great efforts have been devoted to modeling the spatiotemporal correlations, such issue remains challenging in the following two loci, i) capturing dynamic spatial correlations and ii) efficiently and holistically modeling temporal trends. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph convolution based Autoencoder with Latent Gaussian processes (AGALG). Specifically, a graph fusion module is proposed to fuse learnable graphs for modeling static spatial correlations and data-driven graphs for dynamic spatial correlations. The fused graphs are fed into an adaptive graph convolutional autoencoder whose encoder represents both historical and future data in a latent space where they are holistically modeled by Gaussian processes generated by a latent Gaussian generator. We apply a Gaussian processes regressor to make estimations of latent representations of future data, and the decoder of autoencoder finally generates predictions. Experimental results on several widely used benchmark datasets validate that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Safe and stable operation of metro requires accurate kinematic measurement and positioning of the train. Traditional metro navigation and positioning methods are realized with the help of odometer or beacons such as RFID and WIFI, which means external information is necessary. However, accurate, reliable and fast metro applications call for an innovative method that can obtain high-precision, continuous metro attitude and track without being interfered by the outside world. Compared with other navigation technology, inertial navigation system (INS) is the sole navigation system that can realize independent navigation. However, INS generally has large noise and drift accumulated with time, especially MEMS inertial measurement unit (MIMU) with low cost and small volume. In this article, we proposed a novel method of autonomous positioning suitable for metro applications only using MIMU. The selection of zero-velocity-detection variables and the determination of criterion value are realized according to the motion characteristics of train. Then, the selection of variables is proved scientific according to the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). When zero-velocity state is detected, the horizontal attitude of zero-velocity interval is corrected through coarse alignment method. In addition, a dead reckoning method based on kinematic constraint of train is adopted. In order to verify the advantages of the proposed method, tests of attitude and positioning precision are performed. The field experiment results show that our method could achieve high-precision attitude keeping with less computation. The test results are presented in terms of detection versus false-alarm rate. It can be seen from our results that the new detector outperformed the traditional detectors. Furthermore, the relative positioning error is less than 11.6%.},

  abstract     = {The onset of network coded cooperation (NCC) and its applications in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenarios have allowed vehicular networks to relish both reliability and throughput which are the key factors in an on-road scenario. However, a typical NCC based network uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) based data transmission aided by a relay employing a fixed relaying scheme. This puts a concern on the system&#39;s quality-of-service (QoS). We thus propose a dual threshold-based hybrid (DTH) relaying scheme where the relay vehicle dynamically decides the relaying scheme or asks for a re-transmission to improve the QoS. The decision to select a relaying scheme is based on the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, an acknowledgement frame structure is proposed to convey the crucial information to the destinations which are required during data extraction. A variable beacon interval is also proposed where the relay vehicle dynamically changes the beacon transmission time based on the number of re-transmissions which helps new users to join the system. Metrics like outage probability, achievable rate and throughput have been considered as the QoS metrics to compare the performance of the proposed model with respect to other existing works. Extensive simulations in MATLAB show that the proposed scheme experiences a better outage performance than amplify-and-forward (AF) whereas a worse performance when compared with decode-and-forward (DF). However, the better performance in the case of DF comes with a trade-off in terms of throughput when compared to the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising way to achieve human-like autonomous driving (HAD) in complex and dynamic traffic, but faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, partial observability, and sim2real transfer. In light of this, a comprehensive solution for RL-driven HAD is established. First, an efficient training scheme called Deep Recurrent Q-learning from demonstration algorithm (DRQfD) is proposed for lane-changing decision-making to address the low sample efficiency in RL and the poor generalization capability in Imitation Learning (IL). The inherent LSTM structure potentially learns to predict future states of surrounding vehicles, helping to address the partially observable problem in autonomous driving (AD). Second, to reduce the sim2real gap, a twin high-fidelity simulator is built based on ROS-Gazebo for simulating LiDAR sensing, model training, and evaluations. Domain randomization is used to improve the robustness and generalization ability, making it easier for the model to be transferred to real-world scenarios. In addition, for the multi-objective optimization and imbalanced data issues in this scenario, a hierarchical decision-making framework is proposed to decompose the complex decision-making problem into several subtasks, making the driving policies easier to converge. To avoid the excessive dependence of the decision-making module on the output of perception module in modular systems, we train each modularized skill in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, we compare our method with a vanilla RL method to show improvement in learning efficiency. Comparisons between RL-based model and IL baseline in terms of safety, travel efficiency, and human-likeness are also given. To further validate the generalization ability of our model, we test the model on real traffic dataset. Finally, we implement the RL model on physical cars to demonstrate the performance of sim2real transfer.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Drones (IoD) offers several advantages, such as enabling ground communications in areas with connectivity limitations due to physical obstacles. However, IoD also introduces new security vulnerabilities. For instance, an attacker could launch a drone capture attack to obtain confidential credentials and inject counterfeit information into the IoD network, jeopardizing its smooth operation. In such scenarios, authentication plays a crucial role in ensuring security. Unfortunately, the existing authentication frameworks are insufficient to protect against attacks in the IoD environment. In this article, we propose a secure and anonymous authentication framework called SAAF-IoD for the IoD. SAAF-IoD utilizes a chaotic map in combination with symmetric encryption and hash functions. It allows external users of the IoD network to establish a session key (SK) with the deployed drone by performing mutual authentication with the Ground-Station Server (GS). The proposed SAAF-IoD framework provides resistance against privileged insider attacks and GS bypass attacks. We validate the resilience of SAAF-IoD against various security attacks through both formal and informal analyses. Furthermore, we compare the efficiency of the proposed framework with a benchmark scheme in terms of communication and computational costs. Our results demonstrate that SAAF-IoD requires fewer resources than the relevant schemes while offering enhanced security features.},

  abstract     = {Lateral stability control is an essential part of vehicle active safety system. However, the vehicle steering time delay affects the control performance, it may lead to overshoot, oscillation and divergence of the steering response, and even deterioration in stability. Especially, the steering time delay of buses is longer than the small passenger cars due to heavier load and longer wheelbase. This article proposes a novel interleaved predictive control (IPC) framework considering the effects of steering hysteresis to improve the lateral stability of buses. First, a controller intervention criterion is established using the phase plane, and a back propagation neural network (BPNN) with multi-factor coupling is trained to output the stability boundary parameters of the phase plane. Second, a state observer based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed to estimate the sideslip angle, and the online autoregressive integrated moving average model (OARIMA) is used to predict the yaw rate and sideslip angle online. Third, an active front steering (AFS) control system based on the Smith predictor and sliding mode controller (Smith-SMC) is designed to address the time delay of the steering actuator in vehicle stability control. Moreover, MIT adaptive law is used to correct the Smith prediction model in real time. Finally, the proposed framework is validated by numerical simulations using MATLAB/Simulink and TruckSim software. The results show that the proposed framework can accurately predict the short-term trends of the yaw rate and sideslip angle, then the controller intervenes before the vehicle exceeds the stability boundary and reduces the vehicle instability time. The Smith-SMC achieves good lateral stability control with steering delay.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in intelligence technologies have led to an explosion in the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Unfortunately, these autonomous vehicles face an increasing risk of vulnerability due to various attacks. Vehicle intrusion detection mechanisms are widely employed to mitigate the threats. Although some works have addressed this issue, few works consider situations that the attack detection may be fooled via simultaneous attacking multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a novel intrusion detection system integrated Space Dimension Model and Time Dimension Model based on sensor data fusion for countering both independent attack and confederate attack in automated vehicles. In Space Dimension Model, the correlations of multivariate in-vehicle sensor data among multiple sensors are utilized as the input of our optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Especially, we construct vehicle state matrices to characterize the underlying correlation of data between each sensor and other sensors, and then input them into our network for classification. To describe the abrupt deviation caused by anomalous multivariate sensor data itself, we design Time Dimension Model to capture the sensor behaviors of vehicle state vectors at adjacent time by utilizing the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicular dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated anomaly detection mechanisms by a comparative analysis with two detection models that consider only Space Dimension and Time Dimension respectively. The method can outperform the related work under different scenarios 1) with the gain of up to 3.01% in accuracy and 3.04% in F1 score; 2) with ability of defending against confederate attack effectively.},

  abstract     = {Nowcasting the vehicular delay at intersections of road networks not only optimizes the signal timing at the intersections, but also alleviates traffic congestion effectively. Existing research work on the vehicular delay nowcasting involves two issues: low effectiveness on low-ping frequency trajectory data, and low efficiency for the nowcasting task. Inspired by recent works on hypergraphs which explore the high-order relationship of trajectory points, we propose an incremental hypergraph learning framework for nowcasting the control delay of vehicles from low-ping frequency trajectories. The framework characterizes the relationship among trajectory points using multi-kernel learning of multiple attributes of trajectory points. Then, it predicts the unknown trajectory points by incrementally constructing hypergraphs of both observed and unknown points and examining the total similarities of hyperedges associated with all the points. Finally, it evaluates the control delay of each trajectory precisely and efficiently based on the timestamp difference of critical points.

First, the vibration signals are preprocessed using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for stationary preprocessing. Then a multi-domain feature extraction method is developed, which is verified as a more effective feature extraction tool than single-domain feature extraction methods. An ensemble feature selection strategy is proposed for feature selection, superior to single feature selection method. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for diagnosis and analysis.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the joint platoon partition, power control and spectrum allocation for platoon communication in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with uncertain channel parameters. A distributionally robust (DR) optimization problem is formulated to maximize the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) capacity whilst guaranteeing the reliability of intra-platoon communication. For solving the DR problem, a statistical-based approach is developed to learn the distributional ambiguity set from historical uncertain channels. Then, based on it, a data-driven equivalent transformation approach is proposed to transform the probabilistic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) reliability requirement into a deterministic semidefinite expression. Considering that the resource allocation is built on the platoon partition result, the formulated problem is decomposed into a resource allocation problem and a platoon partition problem. Then, a low-complexity two-stage wireless resource allocation strategy is proposed for V2X networks, which contains power control and spectrum matching. After that, the platoon partition is transformed into a specific Markov chain design problem. An exploration-consolidation learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal platoon partition according to the designed Markov transition rate. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is superior to other existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the safety and reliability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become a critical issue as they continue to advance. Analyzing anomalous events using event-based explanations is an effective approach to identifying key anomalous behaviors and mitigating potential risks. However, this task is challenging because anomalous events in flight data lack time-step labels in real-world UAV flight scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a dual attention-based multi-instance learning (DA-DI-MIL) for pinpointing anomaly instances and automatically explaining anomalous events. Our MIL-based framework, from a weakly supervised learning perspective, treats a segment of flight data as a ‘bag&#39; with an available label, and its time steps as ’instances&#39; without labels. The dual attention mechanism in DA-DI-MIL combines a temporal pseudo-label, predicted by temporal attention, and sensor variable importance obtained from delta feature attention to better pinpoint anomalies from instance-level labels. We use these labels in our proposed MIL-based framework to establish the relationships between anomalous events and anomalous behaviors. We conducted extensive experiments on real UAV flight data with engine failures to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. DA-DI-MIL achieves near 90% in evaluation metrics with less than 5 time steps&#39; delay of anomalous event detection and around 85% in temporal anomaly detection. Additionally, we present an illustration of both global and local interpretations in the time domain and feature space, providing comprehensive insights into anomalous events. Our proposed method has efficiently and automatically explained anomalous events in UAV flight data, contributing to high-level aviation safety and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Expectation propagation (EP) has recently been considered with iterative detection and decoding (IDD) to enhance the bit error rate (BER) performance for coded massive Multiple-input Multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. However, current state-of-the-art (SOA) EP-based IDD schemes like double-EP (DEP) are still far from realization due to unaffordable latency brought by their serial structure and large computational complexity. To relieve this issue, in this article, an efficient EP-based parallel IDD method is proposed for coded M-MIMO. First, by investigating the factor graph (FG)-based message passing in EP-based IDD, a double non-resetting framework named EP-dNRe is proposed to improve the IDD efficiency. Based on this framework, a novel parallel EP-based IDD scheme named EP-based parallel detection and decoding (PDD-EP) is further proposed. After proper initialization, the parallel loops of PDD-EP can execute the EP detection and decoding modules simultaneously, which brings latency reduction and improved performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results and complexity analysis are presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed PDD-EP. Particularly, both DEP with double non-resetting (DEP-dNRe) and PDD-EP can greatly reduce the required number of iterations to reach the same performance as the SOA DEP. Furthermore, the proposed PDD-EP can attain the same BER as DEP-dNRe with about 33.1% less complexity, and outperforms DEP-dNRe up to 0.2 dB by similar complexity in various LDPC-coded M-MIMO systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a triangular modulation based variable frequency modulation technique for a single-phase single-stage isolated bidirectional DC to AC dual active bridge has been proposed. The proposed modulation technique requires a single carrier and can be realized using two different methods. Distinctively in method 1, 50% gating signal is provided to the AC side bridge and one leg of the DC side bridge without any phase shift. However, there exists a center-to-center (C2C) phase shift between the gating signal of two legs of DC side bridge where one leg of DC side bridge is operating at 50% duty cycle and another operating at sinusoidally modified variable frequency pulse width modulation (PWM). In method 2, no C2C phase shift exists between the gating signal of the two legs of the DC side bridge. In this case phase shift exists between bridges operating at 50% duty cycle. Presented techniques offer true zero current switching (ZCS) for the AC side bridges over the wide envelope of the line frequency, zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn ON and ZCS turn OFF for the DC side switches, near unity power factor, bidirectional power flow with improved efficiency of 96.19%. DSP based digital realization of both methods is elaborated in detail and out of the two methods, the implementation of method 1 is presented in this article. The concept is validated through simulation results and experimentation on a 500 W prototype using TMS320F28335 for vehicle-to-home (V2H) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) applications.},

The coordination of Internet of electric vehicles is crucial for improving the quality of public services in smart cities, such as vehicle-to-grid regulation and edge computing service. However, existing studies have unilaterally considered the application of one of these two services, which neglects the potential benefits of their combined optimization. In this article, we propose an urban Internet of electric vehicle parking system for vehicle-to-grid scheduling. Specifically, we solve the problems of Internet of electric vehicles allocation and scheduling with joint vehicle-to-grid regulation service and edge computing service. First of all, we formulate the joint problem as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. Then, through the alternating direction method of multipliers method, we decouple the main problem into sub-problems for Internet of electric vehicles. Then, we devise a distributed algorithm to solve each sub-problem. The simulation results show that our proposed model is effective in Internet of electric vehicles&#39; allocation and vehicle-to-grid scheduling for the joint regulation and edge computing service. Furthermore, the power fluctuations of the city power grid can be well flattened by providing the vehicle-to-grid regulation service through effective communication network protocols.},

The conventional pure pursuit method was modified to give the look-ahead distance as the control input, and the optimization problem was formulated as model predictive control to optimize the look-ahead distance. The proposed method optimized the look-ahead distance by reducing it only when the vehicle was about to deviate excessively from the path and maximizing it elsewhere to improve cutting corner problems and ensure smooth path tracking performance.

To achieve dual-band responses with compact size, three dual-mode resonators are investigated, which feature broad band and controllable frequency ratio to fully cover WIFI bands. For miniaturization, filtering responses are realized by designing multi-path couplings between resonators and the feedline. Without increasing antenna size and extra filtering circuits, seven controllable radiation nulls are realized beside pass-bands. Therefore, the proposed filtenna possesses dual-band and broadband Quasi-elliptical filtering responses with compact size and high selectivity. Moreover, the in-band radiation performance is almost unchanged. To analyze and guide the antenna design, the working mechanisms are presented. For demonstration, the proposed dual-band filtering antenna is implemented with Laser Direct Structuring (LDS). The overall size of the proposed dual-band filtenna is 0.16*0.09*0.04 ${\bm{\lambda }}_0^3$ operating with the fractional bandwidth of 10.2% and 13.6%, respectively. The in-band radiation efficiency is of −1.5 dB and −1 dB, respectively.

Although Monte Carlo approximations can be set as close to the optimal solution as expected, these methods usually incur a high computational cost and are inefficient in dealing with high-dimensional problems. Therefore, a novel Posterior Laplace Approximated Filter (PLAF) algorithm intended for direct emitter tracking is proposed in this article to achieve a comparable estimation performance close to the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound but at a low level of computational complexity. The PLAF method relies on the Laplace approximation technique to approximate the marginal posterior as a Gaussian distribution, the mean and covariance matrix of which are explicitly calculated. Furthermore, an improved approach to unconstrained optimization is developed based on a feature space search technique. The proposed optimization method is capable to jump out of the neighborhood of the local optimum to find a better one. The PLAF algorithm performs well in computationally efficiency because it belongs to a deterministic approximation domain. Besides, it can maintain a superior performance, even in the context of a low signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results are obtained to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A geometry-based channel model including the arbitrary trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the power radiation patterns of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) reflecting elements and transmit antenna elements, mutual coupling among IRS row and column reflecting elements, and IRS coverage area is proposed in this article. In the line-of-sight (LoS) dominated communication scenarios, only part of the signal power can be reflected by IRS, and the performance gain of the UAV-enabled systems can be enhanced by using the reflected signal power. The mutual coupling among IRS reflecting elements, which limits the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems, is also investigated in the proposed model. Due to the limitation of coverage area of IRS, the IRS is not always effective in the process of UAV movement, and the activated conditions of IRS are also derived. In order to fully consider the influence of UAV&#39;s trajectory, we investigate the time-varying parameters including azimuth angles, elevation angles, and suboptimal reflection phases of IRS when it is activated. In the proposed model, we also investigate the influence of the mutual coupling among IRS reflecting elements on spatial-temporal correlation and ergodic channel capacity. Numerical results reveal that the mutual coupling of IRS reflecting elements reduces the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems. Also, it can be observed that IRS coverage area affects the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems, and when both UAV and receiver (Rx) are in IRS coverage area, the performance gain can be enhanced.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is an underlying key technology to realize future intelligent transportation systems. Both millimeter wave (MMW) communication and visible light communication (VLC) are strong candidates to address V2V connectivity. Most of the earlier literature focuses on an individual technology. In an effort to better highlight the differences and relative advantages of these two competing technologies, we provide a comprehensive one-to-one comparison between vehicular VLC and MMW channels in this article. For this purpose, we utilize ray tracing simulations which enable the consideration of three-dimensional modeling of the propagation environment and allow the study of various system parameters and road conditions in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. Under the same settings, we present the received signal strengths for both systems and investigate the channel characteristics for communication between two vehicles in the same lane as well as in different lanes with a lateral shift. We also analyze the impact of low, medium, and high density of neighbor vehicles as well as partial and complete blockage.},
