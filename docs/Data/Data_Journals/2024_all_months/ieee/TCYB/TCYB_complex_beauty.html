  abstract     = {This article proposes a two-stage image segmentation method based on the MS model, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of images with complex structure and background. In the first stage, in order to obtain the smooth approximate solution of the image by minimizing the energy functional, an anisotropic regularization term formed by the combination of the gradient operator and an adaptive weighted matrix is introduced. Different weights in both horizontal and vertical directions can be provided by the adaptive weighting matrix according to the gradient information, so that the curve diffuses along the directions of local feature tangents of the objects. In addition, information irrelevant to the image target can be filtered out by the adaptive weighting matrix, thus reducing the interference of complex background. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is employed to solve the convex optimization problem in the first stage. In the second stage, the smoothed image obtained in the first stage is segmented by the deep learning method. By comparing with some traditional methods and deep learning methods, the results demonstrate that not only has good perceptual quality been achieved by this segmentation method, but also superior evaluation metrics have been obtained.},

Then, an algorithm is designed to identify the additional measurements that would render an unobservable BN observable using the conditions. Next, to determine the minimum added measurements, a necessary and sufficient condition and an algorithm based on a constructed matrix are presented.

  abstract     = {The multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Motivated by several significant real-world applications, this work investigates a novel variant of MCKP called the chance-constrained MCKP (CCMCKP), where item weights are random variables. In particular, we focus on the practical scenario of CCMCKP, in which the probability distributions of random weights are unknown and only sample data is available. We first present the problem formulation of CCMCKP and then establish the two benchmark sets. The first set contains synthetic instances, while the second set is designed to simulate a real-world application scenario of a telecommunication company. To solve CCMCKP, we propose a data-driven adaptive local search (DDALS) algorithm. Compared to existing stochastic optimization and distributionally robust optimization methods, the main novelty of DDALS lies in its data-driven solution evaluation approach, which does not make any assumptions about the underlying distributions and is highly effective even when faced with a high intensity of the chance constraint and a limited amount of sample data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DDALS over the baselines on both the benchmarks. Finally, DDALS can serve as the baseline for future research, and the benchmark sets are open-sourced to further promote research on this challenging problem.},

However, its performance is hindered when dealing with high-dimensional data due to challenges related to redundant information and sensitivity to the similarity matrix design. To address these limitations, this article proposes an implicit fuzzy k-means (FKMs) model that enhances graph-based fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional data. Instead of explicitly designing a similarity matrix, our approach leverages the fuzzy partition result obtained from the implicit FKMs model to generate an effective similarity matrix. We employ a projection-based technique to handle redundant information, eliminating the need for specific feature extraction methods. By formulating the fuzzy clustering model solely based on the similarity matrix derived from the membership matrix, we mitigate issues, such as dependence on initial values and random fluctuations in clustering results. This innovative approach significantly improves the competitiveness of graph-enhanced fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional data. We present an efficient iterative optimization algorithm for our model and demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and experimental comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Cascading failures pose a significant security threat to networked systems, with recent global incidents underscoring their destructive potential. The security threat of cascading failures has always existed, but the evolution of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) has introduced novel dimensions to cascading failures, intensifying their threats owing to the intricate fusion of cyber and physical domains. Addressing these threats requires a nuanced understanding achieved through failure modeling and vulnerability analysis. By analyzing the historical failures in different CPSs, the cascading failure in CPSs is comprehensively defined as a complicated propagation process in coupled cyber and physical systems, initialized by natural accidents or human interference, which exhibits a progressive evolution within the networked structure and ultimately results in unexpected large-scale systemic failures. Subsequently, this study advances the development of instructions for modeling cascading failures and conducting vulnerability analyses within CPSs. The examination also delves into the core challenges inherent in these methodologies. Moreover, a comprehensive survey and classification of extant research methodologies and solutions are undertaken, accompanied by a concise evaluation of their advancements and limitations. To validate the performance of these methodologies, numerical experiments are conducted to ascertain their distinct features. In conclusion, this article advocates for future research initiatives, particularly emphasizing the exploration of uncertainty analysis, defense strategies, and verification platforms. By addressing these areas, the resilience of CPSs against cascading failures can be significantly enhanced.},

Although some studies have explored the use of the Metaverse in this industry for data visualization, energy process modeling, and training, a comprehensive review of existing technologies and applications is lacking. This article addresses this gap by examining the potential of the Metaverse for the energy industry, using the Oil&amp;Gas sector as a case study. We identify the essential technologies needed to create a realistic and immersive Metaverse experience and review the current literature on its industrial applications in the energy sector. Distinguishing our work from others, we present four practical case studies developed from our own experience in the Oil&amp;Gas sector.

The interaction topology among the agents is undirected and jointly connected. Due to the heterogenous system orders and switching topology among the agents, the classical distributed adaptive backstepping-based control technique cannot be applied to solve the problem considered in this article. To solve this issue, a novel distributed reference system is first proposed for each agent, by using only relative outputs of the neighboring agents. Subsequently, a fully distributed reference system-based adaptive leaderless output consensus control scheme is designed via output-feedback control. A remarkable merit of the proposed control scheme lies in that precisely known nonlinear dynamics, system states, distributed parameter estimates, and the states of virtual reference system are no longer needed to be shared with neighbors. This implies that the communication burden can be effectively alleviated, and even the communication network can be replaced by some perception sensors. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

A whole body dynamic model for an integrated mobile platform and on-board arms is revealed, which takes into account the interaction forces with the cart. Then, the explicit force/position control of the mobile manipulator is performed. It enables the robot to interact dynamically with the environment while providing motion, i.e., the manipulators provide both output force control and motion control for pushing a cart. To cope with the highly nonlinear system dynamics and parameter variation of a SEA-driven mobile manipulator, this work proposes an adaptive robust controller based on a novel integral barrier Lyapunov function for cart pushing tasks by considering model uncertainty. The proposed controller enables the mobile manipulator to complete cart pushing tasks by regulating the position and output force of the mobile base and arms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach in cart pushing tasks.},

Therefore, a distributed adaptive observer is introduced to learn the leader’s dynamic model and estimate its state for each agent.

Furthermore, a data-based policy gradient algorithm is proposed to approximate the solution of the GAREs online and the utilization of agents’ accurate knowledge is avoided. To improve the efficiency of data utilization, an offline dataset and the experience replay scheme are used.

  abstract     = {Histopathological tissue classification is a fundamental task in computational pathology. Deep learning (DL)-based models have achieved superior performance but centralized training suffers from the privacy leakage problem. Federated learning (FL) can safeguard privacy by keeping training samples locally, while existing FL-based frameworks require a large number of well-annotated training samples and numerous rounds of communication which hinder their viability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this article, we propose a lightweight and universal FL framework, named federated deep-broad learning (FedDBL), to achieve superior classification performance with limited training samples and only one-round communication. By simply integrating a pretrained DL feature extractor, a fast and lightweight broad learning inference system with a classical federated aggregation approach, FedDBL can dramatically reduce data dependency and improve communication efficiency. Five-fold cross-validation demonstrates that FedDBL greatly outperforms the competitors with only one-round communication and limited training samples, while it even achieves comparable performance with the ones under multiple-round communications. Furthermore, due to the lightweight design and one-round communication, FedDBL reduces the communication burden from 4.6 GB to only 138.4 KB per client using the ResNet-50 backbone at 50-round training. Extensive experiments also show the scalability of FedDBL on model generalization to the unseen dataset, various client numbers, model personalization and other image modalities. Since no data or deep model sharing across different clients, the privacy issue is well-solved and the model security is guaranteed with no model inversion attack risk.

The control strategy is delineated as follows. First, the state observer is designed to address the issue of unmeasured states, thereby facilitating the generation of an error dynamics system for subsequent analysis. Second, within the backstepping design framework, a neural network-based tracking controller is devised using dynamic surface control technique and variable separation approaches, ensuring system performance despite the presence of unmeasured states. Finally, stability analysis is conducted to guarantee that all the system signals remain bounded. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the validity and practicality of the framework.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the leader-following secure output consensus (LFSOC) problem of the heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) under the hybrid cyber-attacks. A novel hybrid cyber-attack model consisting of aperiodic additive deception (AAD) attacks and aperiodic denial of service (ADoS) attacks is proposed for characterizing cyber-attacks in a real network, where the aperiodicity is reflected in the fact that the duration of each cyber-attack can be different. First, a compensator is introduced for each agent to estimate the leader’s state. Second, two sampling mechanisms consisting of a multirate sampling (MRS) mechanism and a periodic sampling mechanism are employed for heterogeneous MASs. The MRS mechanism is used to obtain real-time sampled data on the different physical variables of each agent. The periodic sampling mechanism is applied to sample the agents’ compensators and the sampled data are broadcast to their neighbors immediately through a network. By selecting an appropriate sampling period (i.e., a communication period of the compensators), the robustness of heterogeneous MASs against hybrid cyber-attacks can be enhanced. Then, the appropriate communication period is selected for the compensators in different network environments by taking into consideration the cyber-attack parameters. Under these two sampling mechanisms, a sync controller is developed to achieve the LFSOC of heterogeneous MASs. Finally, an example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In particular, the feasible action set of each agent is not only subject to local set and inequality constraints but also coupled through an equality constraint with other agents. This constraint structure is more general and covers most of the constraints in the GNE seeking literature. To accomplish the concerned GNE seeking objective, we propose a novel hierarchical GNE seeking approach in this article to decouple the distributed GNE seeking algorithm design into two layers. First, we construct a distributed primary-dual GNE estimator to generate virtual reference signals that converge to the GNE. Then, with the output of the estimator as the reference signal, we develop an adaptive tracking controller to solve the resultant tracking problems under output constraints. To overcome the negative effects of the disturbances, novel compensating terms associated with smooth functions and positive integrable time-varying functions are incorporated in the controller design, which thereby realizes the exact GNE seeking in the presence of nonvanishing mismatched disturbances. At last, an example is given to support the theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral target detection aims to locate targets of interest in the scene, and deep learning-based detection methods have achieved the best results. However, black box network architectures are usually designed to directly learn the mapping between the original image and the discriminative features in a single data-driven manner, a choice that lacks sufficient interpretability. On the contrary, this article proposes a novel deep spatial-spectral joint-sparse prior encoding network (JSPEN), which reasonably embeds the domain knowledge of hyperspectral target detection into the neural network, and has explicit interpretability. In JSPEN, the sparse encoded prior information with spatial-spectral constraints is learned end-to-end from hyperspectral images (HSIs). Specifically, an adaptive joint spatial-spectral sparse model (AS2JSM) is developed to mine the spatial-spectral correlation of HSIs and improves the accuracy of data representation. An optimization algorithm is designed for iteratively solving AS2JSM, and JSPEN is proposed to simulate the iterative optimization process in the algorithm. Each basic module of JSPEN one-to-one corresponds to the operation in the optimization algorithm so that each intermediate result in the network has a clear explanation, which is convenient for intuitive analysis of the operation of the network. With end-to-end training, JSPEN can automatically capture the general sparse properties of HSIs and faithfully characterize the features of background and target. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Jiahuiqu/JSPEN .},

For MPC with PCs, the existing methods, such as direct multiple shooting, cannot guarantee feasibility of PCs because the PCs are enforced at finitely many time points only. Therefore, this article presents a novel MPC framework that is capable of not only achieving stability control but also guaranteeing feasibility of PCs during the rolling optimization stages of MPC. Under the above MPC framework, an algorithm is first proposed by applying the semi-infinite programming technique to the rolling optimization of MPC. However, it takes heavy computational time to achieve guaranteed feasibility of PCs. Therefore, to guarantee feasibility of PCs meanwhile effectively reducing the computation burden of the closed-loop system, an event-triggered sampling mechanism is constructed in the above path-constrained MPC algorithm. Moreover, sufficient conditions are given for asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated via a cart–damper–spring system.},

Following this, a distributed predefined-time extended state observer (ESO) and a local predefined-time ESO are developed to reconstruct the unknown states/lumped disturbance of the transformed leader system and follower systems, respectively. Based on the estimated states and utilizing a bounded regulation function, two nonsingular and nonconservative predefined-time control laws are formulated to achieve consensus tracking. The proposed method showcases the following advantages: 1) the actual convergence time rather than the upper bound of the convergence time (UBCT) of the tracking errors can be explicitly specified a priori regardless of the initial conditions in a bounded region, optimizing control energy usage and 2) the system overshoot could be effectively reduced by selecting appropriate parameters for the regulation function.

First, a tracking signal vector that effectively reduces system swing magnitudes is constructed to improve the transient performance and guarantee smooth operation of the system. Second, an adaptive law is designed to estimate and compensate for the overall effects of the friction, the external disturbances, and certain nonlinearities.

The first step involves integrating the composite learning method into the NN to address the dynamic uncertainties that inevitably arise in manipulators. A composite adaptive updating law of NN weights is formulated, requiring adherence solely to the relaxed interval excitation (IE) conditions. In addition, for the output error, instead of knowing the initial conditions, this article integrates the error transfer function and asymmetric barrier function to achieve the specific performance for position error in both steady and transient states. Furthermore, the fixed-time control methodology and Lyapunov stability criterion are synergistically employed in order to guarantee the convergence of all signals in the manipulators to a compact neighborhood around the origin within a fixed-time. Finally, numerical simulation and experiments with the Baxter robot results both determine the capability of the NN composite learning technique and fixed-time control strategy.},

As a useful mathematical model, probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) have been widely applied in GRNs. This article addresses the optimal reconstruction problem of PBNs based on several priori Boolean functions and sampled data. When all candidate Boolean functions are known in advance, the optimal reconstruction problem is reformulated into an optimization problem. This problem can be well solved by a recurrent neural network approach which decreases the computational cost. When parts of candidate Boolean functions are known in advance, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the reconstruction of PBNs. In this case, two types of reconstruction problems are further proposed: one is aimed at minimizing the number of reconstructed Boolean functions, and the other one is aimed at maximizing the selection probability of the main dynamics under noises. At last, examples in GRNs are elaborated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the main results.},

However, achieving accurate 3-D path following of helical millirobots under fluid flow conditions remains challenging due to the presence of the lumped disturbances, encompassing complex fluid dynamics and input frequency saturation. This study proposes a robust 3-D path following control framework that combines a disturbance observer for perturbation estimation with an adaptive finite-time sliding mode controller for autonomous navigation along the reference trajectories. First, a magnetic helical millirobot’s kinematic model based on the 3-D hand position approach is established. Subsequently, a robust smooth differentiator is implemented as an observer to estimate disturbances within a finite time. We then investigate an adaptive finite-time sliding mode controller incorporating an auxiliary system to mitigate the estimated disturbance and achieve precise 3-D path tracking while respecting the input constraints. The adaptive mechanism of this controller ensures fast convergence of the system while alleviating the chattering effects. Finally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system based on the Lyapunov functions. Utilizing a robotically-actuated magnetic manipulation system, experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in terms of the control accuracy and convergence time.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, graph-based clustering presents outstanding performance and has been widely investigated. It segments the data similarity graph into multiple subgraphs as final clusters. Many methods integrate graph learning and segmentation into a unified optimization problem to explore the graph structure. However, existing research 1) attempts to derive the final clusters from the learned graph directly, which relies on a highly tight internal distribution within each cluster, and is too strict for the real-world data; 2) generally constructs a holistic full sample graph, which means the outliers are involved in graph learning explicitly, and may corrupt the graph quality. To overcome the above limitations, a new clustering model called robust subcluster search and mergence (RSSM) is established in this article. Inspired by the positive-incentive noise (Pi-Noise), RSSM assumes that the outliers are useful for learning the data structure. Considering a few samples with large errors as outliers, RSSM finds the subcentroids by searching an imbalanced residue distribution. In this way, the subcentroids pull the normal samples together and push the outliers far away. Compared with the traditional clusters, the subclusters indicated by the subcentroids are more explicit, where the normal samples are tightly connected. After that, a subcluster similarity graph is constructed to guide the mergence of subclusters. To sum up, RSSM performs the search and mergence of subclusters simultaneously with the help of outliers, and generates a graph that is more suitable for clustering. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the rationality and superiority of RSSM.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of the resilient cruise control in heterogeneous vehicle platoons against f-local Byzantine attacks (BAs). Agents under BAs become traitors of the swarm, who try to mislead its neighbors while adopting wrong inputs. Thus, BAs are extremely challenging to be suppressed. This study introduces a novel hierarchical protocol characterized by a virtual twin layer (TL), motivated by the rationale of digital twin. This protocol separates the defense scheme against f-local BAs into two parts: one defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs) via the TL and another scheme against Byzantine node attacks (BNAs) via the cyber-physical layer (CPL). The TL employs a trusted-edge strategy, enhancing the network resilience by incorporating a minimal fraction of the key edges. It is rigorously proven that a TL topology meeting strong $(2f+1)$ -robustness is sufficient for achieving distributed resilient estimation against BEAs. On the CPL, a series of decentralized chattering-free controllers is proposed, guaranteeing the resilient cruise tracking of heterogeneous platoons against exponentially unbounded BNAs. Besides, these controllers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded convergence. The theoretical results’ effectiveness and practicality are validated through a numerical simulation example and an unmanned ground vehicle experiment involving heterogeneous platoons against f-local BAs.},

  abstract     = {Bipartite spectral graph partitioning (BSGP) method as a co-clustering method, has been widely used in document clustering, which simultaneously clusters documents and words by making full use of the duality between documents and words.

However, the generated graph is unstructured and fixed. It heavily relies on the quality of the graph construction. Moreover, the two-stage process may deviate from directly solving the primal problem. In order to tackle these defects, a novel bipartite graph partitioning method is proposed to learn a bipartite graph with exactly c connected components (c is the number of clusters), which can obtain clustering results directly. Furthermore, it is experimentally and theoretically proved that the solution of the proposed model is the discrete solution of the primal BSGP problem for a special situation.

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer (KT) is crucial for optimizing tasks in evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO). However, most existing KT methods can only achieve superficial KT but lack the ability to deeply mine the similarities or relationships among different tasks. This limitation may result in negative transfer, thereby degrading the KT performance. As the KT efficiency strongly depends on the similarities of tasks, this article proposes a neural network (NN)-based KT (NNKT) method to analyze the similarities of tasks and obtain the transfer models for information prediction between different tasks for high-quality KT. First, NNKT collects and pairs the solutions of multiple tasks and trains the NNs to obtain the transfer models between tasks. Second, the obtained NNs transfer knowledge by predicting new promising solutions. Meanwhile, a simple adaptive strategy is developed to find the suitable population size to satisfy various search requirements during the evolution process. Comparison of the experimental results between the proposed NN-based multitask optimization (NNMTO) algorithm and some state-of-the-art multitask algorithms on the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC) 2017 and IEEE CEC2022 benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the NNMTO. Moreover, NNKT can be seamlessly applied to other EMTO algorithms to further enhance their performances. Finally, the NNMTO is applied to a real-world multitask rover navigation application problem to further demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Collaboratively optimizing operational parameters through leveraging accumulated production experience is an innovative approach to reducing energy consumption in aluminum electrolysis cells (AECs). Due to the dynamic heterogeneity of various AECs, an explicit evolutionary multitasking (EMT) framework capable of incorporating different optimizers, has the potential to tackle this challenge effectively. However, there is a notable gap in theoretical research on multitasking collaborative evolutionary algorithms specifically applied to AECs. Meanwhile, existing explicit EMT algorithms often overlook the intertask correlation of feature information extracted in isolation from individual tasks. These issues significantly limit the development of synergistic effects in multitasking optimization for addressing parameter design in AECs. To address these limitations, this work proposes an explicit evolutionary framework with multitasking feature fusion (EMFF). This framework thoroughly considers the potential connections among feature information from different tasks. It achieves effective knowledge transfer by the design of a unique multitasking feature fusion mechanism, which enhances the information value of source tasks for target tasks. Furthermore, a transfer individual derivation (TID) strategy is introduced to ensure the rapid evolution of critical knowledge. Finally, comprehensive components and designed process are presented. Experimental results demonstrate EMFF’s exceptional performance in various benchmark tests and real-world AEC parameter optimization cases.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited computing and processing ability of modular robot manipulator (MRM) components, such as sensors and controllers, event-triggered mechanisms are considered a crucial communication paradigm shift in resource constrained applications. Dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developing into a new technology by reason of its higher resource utilization efficiency and more flexible system design requirements than traditional event-triggered. Therefore, an optimal control scheme of multiplayer nonzero-sum game based on dynamic event-triggered is developed for MRM systems with uncertain disturbances. First, dynamic model of the MRM is established according to joint torque feedback technique and model uncertainty is estimated by data-driven-based neural network identifier. In the framework of differential game, the tracking control problem of MRM system is transformed into the optimal control problem for multiplayer nonzero-sum game with the control input of each joint module as the player. Then, the static event-triggered control problem of MRM system is studied based on adaptive dynamic programming algorithm. On this basis, the internal dynamic variable describing the previous state of the system is introduced, and the characteristics of dynamic trigger rule and its relationship with static rule are revealed theoretically. By designing an exponential attenuation signal, the minimum sampling interval of the system is always positive, so that Zeno behavior is excluded. Lyapunov theory proves that the system is asymptotically stable and the experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the event-triggered model predictive control (MPC) problem for a class of networked nonlinear uncertain systems subject to time-varying disturbances. Different from the traditional MPC, the proposed periodic event-triggered MPC (PETMPC) method does not generate new control sequence unless a predesigned periodic event-triggering mechanism (PETM) is violated. First, a generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is developed to estimate the unknown state and disturbance information by using the sampled-data output of controlled system. Then, the disturbance predictions for future finite steps are obtained based on forward Euler method. After that, with the help of prediction model, the optimal control sequence, including the future finite step predicted control inputs, is generated and dexterously exploited during the interevent interval by storing it in a buffer installed between the control sequence generator and actuator, thereby leading to the further reduction of signal transmission number and the frequency of control sequence computations. Through a rigorous stability analysis, it can be proved that the closed-loop hybrid control system is globally bounded stable under the nominal PETMPC law. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to substantiate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed PETMPC method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a trajectory tracking control strategy is proposed for robot manipulators via a fully actuated system (FAS) approach, which has shown its simplicity and flexibility for most of the nonlinear controller design. However, the motion control for robot manipulators is more complicated since unknown dynamical model, external disturbances, friction forces, and various physical constraints are required to be considered. Therefore, the FAS approach cannot be straightforwardly applied. To address these challenges, the dynamic model of robot manipulators is established via model identification methods. Furthermore, based on the identified model, an FAS composite control strategy with simple structure is designed, which is achieved by integrating a high-order disturbance observer (HODO) in the inner loop, with an FAS trajectory tracking controller in the outer loop. Specifically, the HODO is utilized for handling the uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Moreover, the controller gains are optimized using a gradient-based optimal parameter tuning method (OPTM). By imposing joint angle constraints, joint angular velocity constraints, and input torque limits into the formulation, the OPTM also ensures the satisfaction of these physical constraints. Numerical simulations and experiments are provided to validate the performance of the proposed controller.},

Unlike the existing high-order command-filtered backstepping or extended dynamic surface control that needs to tune a large number of parameters, this proposed high-order HGO-based backstepping (HOHGOB) scheme can improve the derivative approximation performance by only tuning a single parameter, i.e., the observer gain. A further advantage of the proposed HOHGOB scheme, in addition to its simplicity and ease of implementation, is that the estimation error of the derivatives shrinks to zero as the observer gain grows to infinity. We have also rigorously established that the states of the closed-loop system achieve uniform ultimate boundedness under the designed high-order backstepping controller. Additionally, the output tracking error can be made arbitrarily small by the designer. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is numerically validated through a benchmark application to a single-link robot arm.},

  abstract     = {We recently introduced a novel category of fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) termed stochastic FDESs (SFDESs), wherein multiple fuzzy automata occur randomly with different probabilities. We also developed two techniques for identifying event transition matrices in single-event SFDES employing the max-product fuzzy inference. One of them, named the equation-systems-based technique, focuses on the single-event SFDES identification, where the fuzzy automaton of each FDES has only one event. Expanding on our research, this article delves into multievent SFDES identification, allowing each FDES to encompass a sequence of events. This is a new research direction that has not been mentioned in the literature before. Upon activation of an FDES, all its events occur sequentially. Our mathematical proof first establishes the associativity of the max-product inference operation, leading to the introduction of a pivotal and novel concept called an equivalent overall event transition matrix for a consecutive event sequence. This concept establishes a theoretical framework for utilizing the equation-systems-based technique in a novel three-step method for identifying multievent SFDESs. The technique is employed in the first two steps to: 1) determine the number of fuzzy automata in an SFDES and 2) calculate their occurrence frequencies. In the third step, multievent transition matrices of the SFDES are learned by using the stochastic-gradient-descent-based algorithms that we previously developed for multievent FDESs, provided the numbers of consecutive events for each fuzzy automaton within the SFDES are known. Theoretical analysis reveals, for the first time, the interconnections between the event transition matrices learned by the algorithms, the equivalent overall event transition matrices derived from these matrices, and the target event transition matrices. To illustrate our findings, we present an informative example.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic environments pose great challenges for expensive optimization problems, as the objective functions of these problems change over time and thus require remarkable computational resources to track the optimal solutions. Although data-driven evolutionary optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO) approaches have shown promise in solving expensive optimization problems in static environments, the attempts to develop such approaches in dynamic environments remain rarely explored. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning-based optimization framework for solving the expensive dynamic optimization problems. This framework is flexible, allowing any off-the-shelf continuously differentiable surrogate model to be used in a plug-in manner, either in data-driven evolutionary optimization or BO approaches. In particular, the framework consists of two unique components: 1) the meta-learning component, in which a gradient-based meta-learning approach is adopted to learn experience (effective model parameters) across different dynamics along the optimization process and 2) the adaptation component, where the learned experience (model parameters) is used as the initial parameters for fast adaptation in the dynamic environment based on few shot samples. By doing so, the optimization process is able to quickly initiate the search in a new environment within a strictly restricted computational budget. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm framework compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on common benchmark test problems under different dynamic characteristics.},

Subsequently, a novel active defense method consisting of two types of state observers, an adaptive topology switching mechanism, and switching controllers is proposed, which can ensure the leader-follower bound consensus even if DoS attacks hinder the interaction between agents. Within such a defense framework, the switching mechanism, driven by the predefined performance index and designed monitoring function, can automatically search for a healthy communication graph among backup topologies. Concurrently, the observer-based switching control strategy will be modified to match the corresponding topology, in which the universal observer and controller parameters in different topologies are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. It should be highlighted that the developed defense scheme not only removes the limitations of existing results on the duration and frequency of DoS attacks but also ensures the same upper bound of consensus error before and after DoS attacks.

A neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear terms. By fusing the NNs and Butterworth low-pass filter technique, the issues arising from the nonaffine nonlinear fault are addressed. To save the communication resources, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism based on an enhanced switching threshold is suggested. Additionally, a novel concept called the preassigned finite-time performance function (PFTPF) is defined to improve the transient and steady-state performances as well as providing faster response. The key feature of the proposed adaptive BLF-based control based on the bound estimation method is the introduction of a smooth function with decreasing variable which not only ensures that all the signals remain bounded and the synchronization errors are restricted within the PFTPF but also guarantees that the tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero.

Taking into account this stochastic sampling interval, this article focuses on addressing the leader-following sampled-data consensus problem for linear multiagent systems (MASs) with successive packet losses. First, the relationship of the equivalent sampling interval between two successive update instants is established, taking into account the double randomness introduced by both SPLs and stochastic sampling. Then, the equivalent discrete-time MAS is obtained, and the overall leader-following consensus problem is formulated as a stochastic stability problem of the equivalent system by incorporating the sampled-data consensus protocol and properties of the Laplacian matrix. Based on the equivalent the discrete-time system, a consensus criterion is derived under a directed graph by using the Lyapunov theory and leveraging a vectorization technique. By the introduction of a matrix reconstruction approach, the mathematical expectation of a product of three matrices, including the system matrix and its transpose, can be determined. Then, the consensus protocol gain is designed. Finally, an example is provided to validate our theoretical results.},

We consider networks whose behaviors are represented via linear dynamical systems. The problem of interest is then finding the smallest number of entries/parameters in the system matrices, corresponding to the smallest number of edges of the networks, that need to be perturbed to achieve controllability. Such a value is called the zero-norm distance to controllability (ZNDC). We show genericity exists in this problem, so that other matrix norms (such as the 2-norm or the Frobenius norm) adopted in this notion are nonsense. For ZNDC, we show it is NP-hard to compute, even when only the state matrices can be perturbed. We then provide some nontrivial lower and upper bounds for it. For its computation, we provide two heuristic algorithms. The first one is by transforming the ZNDC into a problem of structural controllability of linearly parameterized systems, and then greedily selecting the candidate links according to a suitable objective function. The second one is based on the weighted $l_{1}$ -norm relaxation and the convex-concave procedure, which is tailored for ZNDC when additional structural constraints are involved in the perturbed parameters. Finally, we examine the performance of our proposed algorithms on several typical uncontrollable networks arising in multiagent systems.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the distributed state estimation problem for linear systems in networks with cooperative interactions and antagonistic interactions, where the cooperative interactions and the antagonistic interactions are characterized by the positive weights and the negative weights, respectively. Due to the coexistence of the cooperative interactions and the antagonistic interactions, the existing methods based on the non-negatively weighted graph become not applicable. First, a partition method of the nodes and a decomposition form of the system matrices are introduced. Then a new form of distributed observers is proposed in the network with cooperative interactions and antagonistic interactions. Necessary and sufficient conditions, which guarantee the existence of proposed distributed observers, are presented. In particular, when the communication network is cooperative, the proposed method is suitable for two cases, that is, the nodes in each independent strongly connected component are jointly detectable, or each node is jointly detectable with its neighbors. Finally, three examples are simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the global regulation problem for a class of feedforward nonlinear systems. Notably, the systems under consideration allow unknown input-output-dependent nonlinear growth rates, which has not been considered in existing works. A novel logic-based switching (LBS) gain approach is proposed to counteract the system uncertainties and nonlinearities. The key idea of the proposed approach is that whenever the Lyapunov function does not decrease as desired, the switching mechanism is activated so that a new gain is adopted. Furthermore, a tanh-type speed-regulation function is embedded into the switching mechanism for the first time to improve the convergence speed and transient performance. Then, a switching adaptive output feedback (SAOF) controller, which is of concise form and low complexity, is proposed based on the developed switching mechanism. It is shown that the objective of global regulation is achieved with faster convergence speed and better transient performance under the proposed controller. Moreover, it is also shown that the proposed control approach can be extended with the enhanced switching mechanism to deal with feedforward nonlinear systems with external disturbances. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach in comparison with the existing approaches.},

The simple neuron network is built to emulate connection of separate neurons and transmission of information from FHN neuron to HR neuron. The equilibrium point about this FHN-HR model is analyzed. Under the influence of varied parameters, dynamical characteristics for the model are explored with various analysis methods, including phase diagram, time series, bifurcation diagram, and Lyapunov exponent spectrum (LEs). The spectral entropy (SE) complexity and sequence randomness of the model are studied. In addition to observing chaotic and periodic attractors, multiple types of attractor coexistence and particular state transition phenomena are also found in the coupled FHN-HR model. Furthermore, geometric control is used for modulating the amplitude and offset of attractor and neuron firing signals, involving amplitude control and offset control.

Conventional approaches, which focus on local substructures on the graph, offer simplicity but often fall short in encapsulating comprehensive structural information of the graph. This deficiency leads to suboptimal generalization performance. To address this, we proposed the GraKerformer model, a variant of the standard Transformer architecture, to mitigate the shortfall in structural information representation and enhance the performance in UGRL. By leveraging the shortest-path graph kernel (SPGK) to weight attention scores and combining graph neural networks, the GraKerformer effectively encodes the nuanced structural information of graphs. We conducted evaluations on the benchmark datasets for graph classification to validate the superior performance of our approach.},

Herein, the hidden semi-Markov process with time-varying emission probability is introduced to establish the relation between the system modes and the controller modes, in which the interval segmentation method is presented to deal with this time-varying probability. Compared with some published results, this method can make full use of the transition rate information, which may lead to the reduction of conservatism in the proposed asynchronous control design. At the same time, the limited bandwidth problem in the communication channel is addressed by introducing the bilateral quantization strategy, and the new sufficient conditions are derived on the stochastic stability of the nonlinear jump system with/without incomplete transition and sojourn-time information.

To address these issues, this work proposes a safe transfer RL (TRL) framework. The TRL algorithm leverages knowledge from pretrained source tasks to accelerate learning in a new, related target task, significantly reducing both learning time and computational resources required for optimizing control policies. To ensure safety during knowledge transfer and training, data collection and optimization of the control policy are performed within a control invariant set (CIS) throughout the learning process. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the errors between the approximate and optimal control policies by accounting for the differences between source and target tasks. Finally, the proposed TRL method is applied to the case studies of chemical processes to demonstrate its effectiveness in solving the optimal control problem with improved computational efficiency and guaranteed safety.},

Different from the existing sparse recovery methods which are applicable to nonstealthy sparse attacks, a novel encoding scheme, where a set of subdecoding matrices is designed specifically for each 1-D attack-stealthy subspace, is developed so that the parameters of the stealthy attack can be identified via a subspace projection technique. A necessary and sufficient condition of determining the targeted subspace by using n parallel attack identification filters is established for this encoding scheme.

A coding-decoding transmission mechanism under constrained bit rates is introduced to characterize the digital transmission process. To achieve synchronization of the network nodes with the unforced target node, a pinning controller is specifically devised based on the information from partially selected nodes. Through the application of the stochastic analysis method, a sufficient condition is derived for ensuring the mean-square boundedness of the synchronization error system. In addition, an optimization algorithm is introduced to address bit rate allocation and the design of desired controller gains.

Both a digital-twin predictive control strategy and a digital-twin control predictor are proposed to compensate for time delays and communication delays actively. With the strategy and predictor, the digital-twin controller of a time-delay nonlinear system can be designed to achieve the desired performance based on the nonlinear system without time delays, which vastly simplifies the controller design procedure. A digital model is constructed using data to deal with unknown nonlinear dynamics. The three different closed-loop digital-twin predictive control systems are analyzed to derive a unified stability criterion.

  abstract     = {Industrial multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical view of the industrial field for people to understand the state of machines. However, due to data collection difficulty and privacy concerns, available data for building industrial intelligence and industrial large models is far from sufficient. Therefore, industrial time series data generation is of great importance. Existing research usually applies generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate MTS. However, GANs suffer from the unstable training process due to the joint training of the generator and discriminator. This article proposes a temporal-augmented conditional adaptive diffusion model, termed Diff-MTS, for MTS generation. It aims to better handle the complex temporal dependencies and dynamics of MTS data. Specifically, a conditional adaptive maximum-mean discrepancy (Ada-MMD) method has been proposed for the controlled generation of MTS, which does not require a classifier to control the generation. It improves the condition consistency of the diffusion model. Moreover, a temporal decomposition reconstruction UNet (TDR-UNet) is established to capture complex temporal patterns and further improve the quality of the synthetic time series. Comprehensive experiments on the C-MAPSS and FEMTO datasets demonstrate that the proposed Diff-MTS performs substantially better in terms of diversity, fidelity, and utility compared with the GAN-based methods. These results show that Diff-MTS facilitates the generation of industrial data, contributing to intelligent maintenance and the construction of industrial large models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) systems has been nothing short of remarkable. As these systems continue to evolve, they are being utilized in increasingly complex and unstructured environments, such as autonomous driving, aerial robotics, and natural language processing. As a consequence, programming their behaviors manually or defining their behavior through the reward functions [as done in reinforcement learning (RL)] has become exceedingly difficult. This is because such environments require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, making it challenging to specify an optimal set of rules or reward signals that can account for all the possible situations. In such environments, learning from an expert’s behavior through imitation is often more appealing. This is where imitation learning (IL) comes into play - a process where desired behavior is learned by imitating an expert’s behavior, which is provided through demonstrations.This article aims to provide an introduction to IL and an overview of its underlying assumptions and approaches. It also offers a detailed description of recent advances and emerging areas of research in the field. Additionally, this article discusses how researchers have addressed common challenges associated with IL and provides potential directions for future research. Overall, the goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive guide to the growing field of IL in robotics and AI.},

Since the leader and its high-order derivatives are unknown under jointly connected switching networks, a novel distributed ET reference generator equipped with an ET mechanism is constructed to estimate them. Meanwhile, the continuous information transmission among agents is avoided and the network channel utilization is optimized. Subsequently, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate unknown dynamics, and a fuzzy adaptive ET consensus control algorithm only using intermittent communication is designed by backstepping control methodology. It is demonstrated that all the closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), with the tracking errors converging to a small neighborhood around zero. Finally, we apply the developed fuzzy adaptive ET consensus control algorithm to unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET consensus control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {There are many applications where an autonomous agent can perform many sets of actions. It must choose one set of actions based on some behavioral constraints on the agent. Past work has used deontic logic to declaratively express such constraints in logic, and developed the concept of a feasible status set (FSS), a set of actions that satisfy these constraints. However, multiple FSSs may exist and an agent needs to choose one in order to act. As there may be many different objective functions to evaluate status sets, we propose the novel concept of Pareto-optimal FSSs or POSS. We show that checking if a status set is a POSS is co-NP-hard. We develop an algorithm to find a POSS and in special cases when the objective functions are monotonic (or anti-monotonic), we further develop more efficient algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments to show the efficacy of our approach and we discuss possible ways to handle multiple Pareto-optimal Status Sets.},

  abstract     = {The broad learning system (BLS) is a versatile and effective tool for analyzing tabular data. However, the rapid expansion of big data has resulted in an overwhelming amount of tabular data, necessitating the development of specialized tools for effective management and analysis. This article introduces an optimized BLS (OBLS) specifically tailored for big data analysis. In addition, a deep-optimized BLS (DOBLS) network is developed further to enhance the performance and efficiency of the OBLS. The main contributions of this article are: 1) by retracing the network’s error from the output space to the latent space, the OBLS adjusts parameters in the feature and enhancement node layers. This process aims to achieve more resilient representations, resulting in improved performance; 2) the DOBLS is a multilayered structure consisting of multiple OBLSs, wherein each OBLS connects to the input and output layers, enabling direct data propagation. This design helps reduce information loss between layers, ensuring an efficient flow of information throughout the network; and 3) the proposed methods demonstrate robustness across various applications, including multiview feature embedding, one-class classification (OCC), camera model identification, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing, and radar signal analysis. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. To ensure reproducibility, the source code is available at https://github.com/1027051515/OBLS_DOBLS .},

  abstract     = {This article proposes model-free reinforcement learning methods for minimum-cost state-flipped control in Boolean control networks (BCNs). We tackle two questions: 1) finding the flipping kernel, namely, the flip set with the smallest cardinality ensuring reachability and 2) deriving optimal policies to minimize the number of flipping actions for reachability based on the obtained flipping kernel. For Question 1), Q-learning’s capability in determining reachability is demonstrated. To expedite convergence, we incorporate two improvements: 1) demonstrating that previously reachable states remain reachable after adding elements to the flip set, followed by employing transfer learning and 2) initiating each episode with special initial states whose reachability to the target state set are currently unknown. For Question 2), it is challenging to encapsulate the objective of simultaneously reducing control costs and satisfying terminal constraints exclusively through the reward function employed in the Q-learning framework. To bridge the gap, we propose a BCN-characteristics-based reward scheme and prove its optimality. Questions 1) and 2) with large-scale BCNs are addressed by employing small memory Q-learning, which reduces memory usage by only recording visited action-values. An upper bound on memory usage is provided to assess the algorithm’s feasibility. To expedite convergence for Question 2) in large-scale BCNs, we introduce adaptive variable rewards based on the known maximum steps needed to reach the target state set without cycles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated on both small- and large-scale BCNs.},

In this article, stability maintenance of large boolean networks (BNs) subjected to perturbations is investigated using a distributed pinning control (PC) strategy. The concept of edge removal as a form of perturbation is introduced, and several criteria for achieving global stability are established. Two forms of distributed PCs, one implemented before perturbation occurs and the other after, are introduced. It is noteworthy that the designs of the controllers are solely dependent on the system’s in-neighbors. The proposed method significantly decreases the computational complexity, reducing it from $O(2^{2|\texttt {V}|})$ to $O(|\texttt {V}|+ |\texttt {E}| + \kappa \cdot 2^{K})$ , where $|\texttt {V}|, |\texttt {E}|$ denotes the cardinality of vertices and arcs of the adjacent graph of BN, $\kappa $ is the number of the pinning nodes, and K represents the maximum in-degree of the network. In the worst-case scenario, the computational complexity is bounded by $O(|\texttt {V}|+ |\texttt {E}| + \kappa \cdot 2^{|\texttt {V}|})$ . To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, results from multiple gene networks are presented, including a model representing the human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast, among which only 12 of the 359 nodes are deemed essential.},

  abstract     = {Predominant instrument recognition plays a vital role in music information retrieval. This task involves identifying and categorizing the dominant instruments present in a piece of music based on their distinctive time–frequency characteristics and harmonic distribution. Existing predominant instrument recognition approaches mainly focus on learning implicit mappings (such as deep neural networks) from time-domain or frequency-domain representations of music audio to instrument labels. However, different instruments playing in polyphonic music produce local superposed time–frequency representations while most implicit models could be sensitive to such local data changes. This thus poses a challenge for these implicit methods to accurately capture the unique harmonic features of each instrument. To address this challenge, considering that the complete harmonic information of an instrument is also distributed across a wide range of frequencies, we design a label-specific time–frequency feature learning approach to convert the task of building implicit classification mappings into the process of extracting and matching features that are specific to each instrument, as a result, a new explicit learning model: label-specific time–frequency energy-based neural network (LSTN) is proposed. Unlike existing implicit models, LSTN not only extracts their commonly used local time–frequency features but also incorporates time-domain factors and frequency-domain factors in its energy function to explicitly parameterize the long-term correlation and long-frequency correlation features. Using the extracted time–frequency features and the two long correlation features as instrument label-specific features, LSTN detects whether the harmonic distribution of each instrument appears in polyphonic music on both long time–frequency scales and local time–frequency scales to mitigate the challenges posed by local superposed representations. We conduct an analysis of the complexity and the convergence of LSTN, then experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LSTN over other established instrument recognition algorithms.},

However, it contains the coupling terms arising from the Markov jump parameters, which are difficult to solve. To address this issue, we propose a framework for parallel reinforcement learning. Thereafter, a model-based resilient hybrid learning scheme is first designed to obtain the optimal policies, where the system dynamics are required during the learning process. Furthermore, a novel online model-free resilient hybrid learning scheme combining the advantages of value iteration and policy iteration is proposed without using the system dynamics. Besides, the convergence of the proposed hybrid learning schemes is discussed. Eventually, the effectiveness of the designed algorithms is demonstrated with the inverted pendulum model.},

Furthermore, we have substantiated that the developed approach can not only make certain that all the tracking errors of the resulting closed-loop system, including output tracking errors and virtual tracking errors, enter a prespecified small region near equilibrium point with fixed-time convergence rate, but also guarantee them obey the corresponding constraints throughout the entire control operation, where the regulation time and the tracking accuracy level keep prior known and could be prespecified arbitrarily. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are illustrated through a representative application instance.},

Based on dynamic output feedback control and disturbance observer, a fuzzy composite controller, following the core idea of nonparallel distribution compensation, is designed to compensate for the impact of multiple disturbances. For replay attacks, a multisensor scheme with the detection mechanism is introduced, enabling the studied systems to remain stable even under attacks. Afterward, with the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for ensuring the stability of the resulting systems are deduced, and then the gains of the desired controller and disturbance observer are obtained. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the established method are demonstrated through simulation, as well as its superiority over the traditional ${\mathcal {H}}_{infty }$ control method.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) generally requires the number of anchors to be the same in all views. Also, this number needs to be tuned with extra manual efforts. This not only degenerates the diversity of multiview data but also limits the model’s scalability. For generating differentiated numbers of anchors without tuning, in this article we devise a novel framework named DAQINT. To be specific, the most perfect solution is to jointly find the optimal number of anchors that belongs to respective view. Regretfully, it is extremely time consuming. In view of this, we choose to first offer a set of anchor numbers for each view, and then integrate their contributions by adaptive weighting to approximate the optimal number. In particular, these offered numbers are all predefined and do not require any tuning. Through adaptively weighting them, we hold that this equivalently makes each view enjoy a different number of anchors. Accordingly, the bipartite graphs generated on all views are with diverse scales. Besides exploring multiview features more deeply, they also balance the importance between views. Then, to fuse these multiscale bipartite graphs, we design a combination strategy that owns linear computation and storage overheads. Afterward, to solve the resulting optimization problem, we also carefully develop a three-step iterative algorithm with linear complexities and demonstrated convergence. Experiments on the multiple public datasets validate the superiority of DAQINT against several advanced IMVC methods, such as on Mfeat, DAQINT surpasses the competitors like MKC, EEIMVC, FLSD, DSIMVC, IMVC-CBG, and DCP by 36.65%, 6.33%, 48.53%, 22.46%, 15.06%, and 32.04%, respectively, in ACC.},

Second, compared with some existing results, how to relax the general assumption about deception attack is also a difficult research topic. In this article, an unusual observer that uses the attacked system output is designed to estimate the real unavailable states caused by deception attacks, so that the impact of deception attacks is eliminated and the output feedback control is also achieved. By selecting the virtual controllers and the real controller as corresponding optimized controllers within the framework of the RL algorithm, the control strategy can ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately bounded.

To capture the different operating conditions of the load in the multiarea power systems, a Markov superposition technique is skillfully employed to model the system’s component matrices. To solve the Nash equilibrium solution of the zero-sum differential game problem, an improved online adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm based on the experience replay technique (ERT) is developed, which addresses the nonlinear coupling difficulties encountered in solving the game algebraic Riccati equations (Game AREs). The proposed algorithm weakens the condition that traditional policy iteration online solutions of zero-sum games require an initial stabilizing control policy pair, and considers the fact that only the transition probability matrix is known, while the prior knowledge of the dynamics is completely unknown. The algorithm is used to obtain both a minimum LFC and maximum disturbance policy for a given disturbance rejection level. Additionally, a safer LFC controller of the power systems with the Markov jumping parameters is designed. The stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated. Finally, the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed design method are validated using a two-area four-mode simulation example.},

First, a drill-string axial finite element model with the uncertain PRC is established, and a control-oriented low-order model is derived via mode selection. A gain-scheduling controller is computed based on the quadratic stability condition of the closed-loop system, which can cope with the system’s parameter uncertainty using variable low-frequency gain. An adaptive observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable scheduling variable. Field data from a geothermal drilling well is obtained to validate our model. According to this drilling well scenario, both numerical and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method. The explicit relationship between the controller gain and the uncertain parameter is presented. It is found that the performance of the closed-loop system is more sensitive to the controller gain when drilling in soft formations, requiring more attention in such scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved considerable success in dealing with graph-structured data by the message-passing mechanism. Actually, this mechanism relies on a fundamental assumption that the graph structure along which information propagates is perfect. However, the real-world graphs are inevitably incomplete or noisy, which violates the assumption, thus resulting in limited performance. Therefore, optimizing graph structure for GNNs is indispensable and important. Although current semi-supervised graph structure learning (GSL) methods have achieved a promising performance, the potential of labels and prior graph structure has not been fully exploited yet. Inspired by this, we examine GSL with dual reinforcement of label and prior structure in this article. Specifically, to enhance label utilization, we first propose to construct the prior label-constrained matrices to refine the graph structure by identifying label consistency. Second, to adequately leverage the prior structure to guide GSL, we develop spectral contrastive learning that extracts global properties embedded in the prior graph structure. Moreover, contrastive fusion with prior spatial structure is further adopted, which promotes the learned structure to integrate local spatial information from the prior graph. To extensively evaluate our proposal, we perform sufficient experiments on seven benchmark datasets, where experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method and the rationality of the learned structure from various aspects.},

In order to effectively alleviate the current difficulties, the FEFP-Net with three key components is proposed, and the improved detection accuracy is proved in various applications: 1) Extraction Phase: an adaptive fine-grained feature extraction network is proposed to capture features of interest from coarse to fine details, which effectively avoids misclassification due to feature similarity; 2) Fusion Phase: a bidirectional neighbor connection network is designed to identify objects with different sizes by aggregating multilevel features and 3) Prediction Phase: in order to improve the accuracy of object localization and classification, a task specific prediction network is presented, which sufficiently exploits both the spatial and channel information of features. Compared with the State-of-the-Art methods, we achieved competitive results in the MS-COCO dataset. Further, we demonstrated the performance of FEFP-Net in different application fields, such as medical imaging, industry, agriculture, transportation, and remote sensing.

To further improve its search ability, a co-evolving framework is designed, which includes both a network-embedded subpopulation and a regular one. The former focuses on its global search while the latter ensures LGA’s convergence. An information exchange method between the two subpopulations balances global and local search, improving its overall optimization ability.

In this article, we propose a novel decentralized event-triggered tracking control (ETTC) strategy for a class of continuous-time nonlinear LSIS with unmatched interconnected terms and asymmetric input constraints. First, auxiliary subsystems are established to address the unmatched cross-linking terms. Next, the dynamics states of the tracking error and the exosystem are combined to construct a nominal augmented subsystem. By employing a nonquadratic performance function, the input-constrained decentralized tracking control problem is transformed into an optimal control problem for the nominal augmented subsystem. A group of independent parameters and event-triggered conditions are designed to save communication bandwidth and computational resources. Subsequently, the critic-only adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is used to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equation (HJBE) associated with the optimal control problem. To improve training success rate, the weights of the critic neural network (NN) are updated by introducing a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA). The tracking error and the NN weights are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) under the proposed ETTC by using the Lyapunov extension theorem. Finally, the simulation example of an unmatched interconnected system is provided to verify the validity of the proposed decentralized method.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous multiagent systems are characterized by diverse task distributions, which are prevalent in practical scenarios, such as distributed decision making and robotic collaboration. A significant challenge in these systems is the constraint of limited observations, where each agent has access only to partial information. Many studies facilitate information exchange by employing shared parameters among agents. However, this approach is generally more effective for homogeneous systems where agents have similar observation or action spaces. In heterogeneous systems, indiscriminate parameter sharing can significantly increase the exploration cost required for effective adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel communication complementary graph model (CCGM) for enhancing collaboration in heterogeneous multiagent systems. Our approach builds upon the training framework of heterogeneous agent reinforcement learning (HARL) with trust region learning and nonparameter sharing. This model utilizes advantage function decomposition and sequential updates to promote policy convergence. Within this framework, we introduce a novel communication method inspired by signaling games, where agents acting as receivers, process messages from other agents alongside their own observations. CCGM aligns the messages with observations in a graph-based communication module, which establishes communication relationships and supplements observational information. Subsequently, agents generate self-interested information, which they then share with others as senders. We evaluate our algorithm across various environments, including multiagent particle environments (MPE) and multiagent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo) robot experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of CCGM in enhancing HARL-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based soft sensor modeling methods have been extensively studied and applied to industrial processes in the last decade. However, existing soft sensor models mainly focus on the current step prediction in real time and ignore the multistep prediction in advance. In actual industrial applications, compared to the current step prediction, it is more useful for on-site workers to predict some key performance indicators in advance. Nowadays, multistep prediction task still suffers from two key issues: 1) complex coupling relationships between process variables and 2) long-term dependency learning. To ravel out these two problems, in this article, we propose a graph-based time-frequency two-stream network to achieve multistep prediction. Specifically, a multigraph attention layer is proposed to model the dynamical coupling relationships between process variables from the graph perspective. Then, in the time-frequency two-stream network, multi-GAT is used to extract time-domain features and frequency-domain features for long-term dependency, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a feature fusion module to combine these two kinds of features based on the minimum redundancy and maximum correlation learning paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets show that the proposed multistep prediction model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. In particular, compared to the existing SOTA method, the proposed method has achieved 12.40%, 22.49%, and 21.98% improvement in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the three-step prediction task using waste incineration dataset.},

The network communication from nodes to the fusion center is confined to the limited bit rate. To alleviate the impact from less measurement information of the binary sensor, a modified innovation is constructed to improve the estimation accuracy. Then, a novel coding-decoding approach is proposed to ensure that the decoder has the ability to decode information from each node. Based on the matrix weighting fusion method, a distributed fusion algorithm is put forward under the zonotopic set-membership filtering framework, and the F-radius of the local zonotopic sets are derived and minimized by selecting the filtering gain parameters. Moreover, the bit rate allocation scheme and the weighting coefficients are determined by resolving two optimization problems. In addition, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the uniform boundedness of the F-radius of the fused zonopotic.

  abstract     = {Differential game is an effective technique to describe the negotiation between the humans and robots, which is widely used to realize the trajectory tracking tasks in the human-robot interaction (HRI). However, most existing works consider the control-affine HRI systems and assume the desired trajectory is available to both the human and the robot, which limit the scope of applications. To overcome these difficulties, this work focuses on the nonaffine HRI system and supposes that the desired trajectory is not available to the robot. A novel differential game framework encoding the desired trajectory estimator is proposed, where the desired trajectory is estimated via the Gaussian process regression (GPR) technique. To address the challenge arising from the nonlinearity of the HRI system, we equivalently transform the original problem into the one in a differentially flat space, and seek the equilibrium strategies for the transformed problem substitutionally. We further prove that the trajectory tracking error satisfies a probabilistic bound, whose confidence interval tightens as the decrease of noise variance during the interaction. Comparative simulation results show that our method outperforms the learning-based method in terms of robustness, parameters setting, and time consumption. Experiment results further show that the tracking error under the proposed human-robot cooperative algorithm is reduced by 55% compared to the human direct control.},

The underlying complex network model, which is inherently nonlinear and stochastic, is affected by additive process and measurement noises. Owing to the limited bandwidth of the transmission channel, the measurement outputs are quantized by a probabilistic quantizer prior to transmission. To enhance the signal quality over long-distance transmissions, the quantized measurements are sent to AF relays and subsequently forwarded to the estimator. Utilizing the unscented Kalman filter approach, a novel state estimator is designed to minimize an upper bound on the estimation error covariance. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the estimation error is exponentially bounded in the mean-square sense.

In this article, we address resilient consensus problems for first- and second-order discrete-time MASs, considering the presence of malicious agents, a dynamic leader, and communication delay. First, a resilient controller is designed for first-order MASs, and sufficient conditions are derived based on existing robust graph concepts to achieve consensus with ultimately bounded error. Next, since the derived error bound grows factorially with the system scale, a novel graph structure and a modified controller are proposed to limit the growth to a linear rate. Building upon the obtained results, an estimator-based control framework is introduced to solve resilient consensus problems for second-order MASs.

  abstract     = {Quantized signal-driven control for nonlinear systems is of special interest in practice. However, it is nontrivial in the presence of mismatched uncertainties and intermittent denial of service (DoS) attacks. The underlying problem becomes even more complicated when both the input and output signals are attacked, rendering the state variables and the input signal inaccessible or unavailable for the control design. Only the quantized (and thus nondifferentiable) output signal is available in the absence of attack, making regular backstepping design inapplicable. This article introduces a novel adaptive output feedback control method to tackle the aforementioned challenges. First, we design a gain-switched quantized observer to estimate the unmeasurable state variables. Second, by employing a first-order dynamic filtering technique, we circumvent the nondifferentiability issue of virtual controller arising from the signal quantization. Third, we establish design conditions for the controller parameters. Fourth, we utilize a more comprehensive sector quantizer and develop adaptive estimators to deal with the unknown quantization parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that with the proposed control method, all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SUUB), and the regulation error can be made small enough by appropriately tuning the design parameters.

By combining this method with backstepping, a dwell-time state-dependent switching law and an ET funnel controller of each subsystem are constructed, effectively eliminating the issue of the “explosion of complexity” encountered in traditional backstepping without using dynamic surface control or command filters. Additionally, the designed switching DETM ensures that the tracking error always evolves within a performance funnel in any consecutive triggering interval, excluding Zeno behavior, and guaranteeing positive constant lower bounds for two consecutive triggering intervals and any switching interval, respectively. Finally, an example is provided to show the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates an output rate-coded secure control based on backstepping for the consensus of heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) with output-triggering condition. Due to the nondifferentiable virtual control inputs caused by discontinuous triggering signals, it presents a technical obstacle in implementing the recursive backstepping, rendering previous results inapplicable. To address this problem, an auxiliary high-order filter is elaborately constructed to guarantee the required-order derivatives of virtual control inputs. As this filter is driven by local triggering consensus error, it allows our MASs to have different system orders and relative degrees. Besides, to reduce communication bit and strengthen communication security, we propose a novel distributed rate-coded algorithm from an encoding-decoding viewpoint. When it is triggered, agent’s output is encrypted into an L-length codeword, then transmitted to neighbors without exposing any sensitive system states or real control inputs. It is shown that all the closed-loop system signals are ultimately bounded, and the mean square consensus tracking error can be reduced by appropriately selecting control parameters. Simulations illustrate our theoretical finding.},

However, the existing PI-based results for output-feedback (OPFB) continuous-time systems relied heavily on an initial stabilizing full state-feedback (FSFB) policy. It thus raises the question of violating the OPFB principle. This article addresses such a question and establishes the PI under an initial stabilizing OPFB policy. We prove that an off-policy Bellman equation can transform any OPFB policy into an FSFB policy. Based on this transformation property, we revise the traditional PI by appending an additional iteration, which turns out to be efficient in approximating the optimal control under the initial OPFB policy.

Two practical considerations motivate the current work. First, considering that the system mode cannot always be observed accurately, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is adopted to describe the relationship between the mismatched modes. Second, considering that the TPs information related to the Markov process and the observation process is difficult to obtain, the nonideal TPs (unknown or uncertain) are simultaneously considered on the two processes. Under the considerations, several new sufficient conditions are developed for concerned closed-loop 2-D MJSs with nonideal TPs, by which the asymptotic mean square stability is ensured with an ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ performance index. A nonconservative separation strategy is utilized to decouple the system mode TPs and the observation TPs to facilitate the analysis of nonideal TPs. An unified LMI-based condition is finally developed for the concerned closed-loop 2-D MJSs with/without nonideal TPs, showing more satisfactory conservatism than that in the literature.

  abstract     = {Despite various measures across different engineering and social systems, network robustness remains crucial for resisting random faults and malicious attacks. In this study, robustness refers to the ability of a network to maintain its functionality after a part of the network has failed. Existing methods assess network robustness using attack simulations, spectral measures, or deep neural networks (DNNs), which return a single metric as a result. Evaluating network robustness is technically challenging, while evaluating a single metric is practically insufficient. This article proposes a multitask analysis system based on the graph isomorphism network (GIN) model, abbreviated as GIN-MAS. First, a destruction-based robustness metric is formulated using the destruction threshold of the examined network. A multitask learning approach is taken to learn the network robustness metrics, including connectivity robustness, controllability robustness, destruction threshold, and the maximum number of connected components. Then, a five-layer GIN is constructed for evaluating the aforementioned four robustness metrics simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental studies reveal that 1) GIN-MAS outperforms nine other methods, including three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based robustness evaluators, with lower prediction errors for both known and unknown datasets from various directed and undirected, synthetic, and real-world networks; 2) the multitask learning scheme is not only capable of handling multiple tasks simultaneously but more importantly it enables the parameter and knowledge sharing across tasks, thus preventing overfitting and enhancing the performances; and 3) GIN-MAS performs multitasks significantly faster than other single-task evaluators. The excellent performance of GIN-MAS suggests that more powerful DNNs have great potentials for analyzing more complicated and comprehensive robustness evaluation tasks.},

During the design process, real system states are initially estimated by developing an improved state observer, which effectively addresses the problem of state unavailability. Then, a coordinate transformation technology, in which the estimated states of observer are considered, is presented to stabilize the studied system. By constructing the singularity-free finite time virtual controls, the singularity problem in the traditional finite time design algorithms is cleverly avoided. Furthermore, to minimize communication overhead, a final finite-time controller is established by using a relative threshold event-triggered scheme. The developed event-triggered adaptive finite-time control strategy guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally bounded in finite time without Zeno behavior. Finally, the correctness of the proposed control strategy is validated through two simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Message passing (MP) is crucial for effective graph neural networks (GNNs). Most local message-passing schemes have been shown to underperform on heterophily graphs due to the perturbation of updated representations caused by local redundant heterophily information. However, our experiment findings indicate that the distribution of heterophily information during MP can be disrupted by disentangling local neighborhoods. This finding can be applied to other GNNs, improving their performance on heterophily graphs in a more flexible manner compared to most heterophily GNNs with complex designs. This article proposes a new type of simple message-passing neural network called Flow2GNN. It uses a two-way flow message-passing scheme to enhance the ability of GNNs by disentangling and redistributing heterophily information in the topology space and the attribute space. Our proposed message-passing scheme consists of two steps in topology space and attribute space. First, we introduce a new disentangled operator with binary elements that disentangle topology information in-flow and out-flow between connected nodes. Second, we use an adaptive aggregation model that adjusts the flow amount between homophily and heterophily attribute information. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that disentangling in message-passing can reduce the generalization gap, offering a deeper understanding of how our model enhances other GNNs. The extensive experiment results show that the proposed model, Flow2GNN, not only outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs, but also helps improve the performance of other commonly used GNNs on heterophily graphs, including GCN, GAT, GCNII, and H2GCN, specifically for GCN, with up to a 25.88% improvement on the Wisconsin dataset.},

In this article, a performance-based FTC strategy is proposed for the closed-loop systems with multiplicative faults. Considering the high efforts in modeling complex systems, the proposed FTC strategy is realized in the data-driven context. Specifically, a nominal feedback-feedforward controller is first established for the fault-free systems. By selecting the system stability and reference tracking behavior as the key performance indices, two performance evaluators are constructed to detect and classify the occurred multiplicative faults based on the fault-induced effects on the system performance. Then, with the aid of the coprime factorization technique, the multiplicative faults, in the form of additive perturbations to the system coprime factors, are estimated utilizing the closed-loop process data. Furthermore, based on the fault knowledge, a hierarchical fault-tolerant tracking controller is developed according to the levels of system performance degradations, where the functional controller parameters are reconfigured with different priorities. Finally, case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the resilient noncooperative game strategy design problem for the continuous-time system subjected to the Wiener type disturbance. To reflect the reality, the fading measurement and gain perturbation phenomena are simultaneously taken into consideration. Due to the considered complexities, there is little chance of obtaining the accurate cost function. For the sake of quantifying the controller performance, we resort to a certain upper bound of cost function (UBoCF) as an alternative. Then, the so-called noncooperative game strategy is designed which is capable of minimizing the derived UBoCF in a parallel manner. The designed noncooperative game strategy is the solution to a bunch of coupled differential Riccati-like equations (DREs). In addition, the theory analysis is generalized to the infinite-horizon with hope to describe the steady-state behavior. Specifically, the restraint conditions are provided to guarantee the stability of the system. Finally, a numerical example on the load frequency control (LFC) system is shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has emerged as a promising technique for effective neural architecture search, and it mainly contains two steps to find the high-performance architecture. First, the DARTS supernet that consists of mixed operations will be optimized via gradient descent. Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of neural architecture search (NAS), it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this article, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.},

To this end, an optimal synchronization problem of heterogeneous MASs is first formulated, and then an arbitration RL mechanism is developed for well addressing key challenges faced by the current RL techniques, that is, insufficient data and environmental changes. In the developed mechanism, an improved Q-function with an arbitration factor is designed for accommodating the fact that control protocols tend to be made by historic experiences and instinctive decision-making, such that the degree of control over agents’ behaviors can be adaptively allocated by on-policy and off-policy RL techniques for the optimal multiagent synchronization problem. Finally, an arbitration RL algorithm with critic-only neural networks is proposed, and theoretical analysis and proofs of synchronization and performance optimality are provided.

  abstract     = {The asynchronization among autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is inevitable due to the inherent offsets and drifts in clocks, which critically degrades the accuracy of AUV cooperative localization (CL), especially in underwater anchor-free environments. This article designs a novel relative measurement representation called time difference of communication (TDOC) to eliminate the impact of asynchronization, which only requires one-way inter-AUV communications at different time steps even in the presence of large asynchronization. By exploiting TDOC, a joint spatial-temporal CL model is established with specially constructed measurement vectors, and a CL method, termed TDOC-CL, is proposed. It transforms the nonlinear observations into a weighted least-square (WLS) formation and is solved via iterative optimization, where various coupled uncertainties (i.e., measurement biases, measurement noises, and position errors) are involved and analyzed. Moreover, to compensate the accuracy degradation caused by the uncertainties, the TDOC-CL with bias reduction and error compensation, named iTDOC-CL-BREC, is further designed. In addition, the hybrid Cramér-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) is derived as the performance benchmark to evaluate the localization behaviors. Simulations and field experiments show that iTDOC-CL-BREC can provide higher localization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, especially for long-duration tasks.},

The OC-AFT meaning that the output constraint only occurs during a finite number of time periods while being absent in others, which is more general and complex than traditional infinite-time/deferred output constraints. A stretch model-based nonlinear mapping function is constructed to handle the OC-AFT, and a salient advantage is that the proposed algorithm is also suit for CPSs with infinite-time/deferred output (or funnel) constraints, as well as those that are constraint-free, without necessitating changes to the control structure. The uncertain terms (including system model uncertainties, malicious attacks, and external disturbances) are compensated by fuzzy logic systems. Furthermore, a novel practical prescribed-time stability criterion is proposed, under which a novel PTOFC scheme is given. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can ensure that both tracking error and observation error converge to a neighborhood centered on zero within a prescribed time, while accommodating the OC-AFT and malicious attacks. Additionally, the settling time remains unaffected by control parameters and initial states, and the limitations of excessive initial control inputs and singularity problems in existing prescribed-time control algorithms are eliminated. The developed algorithm is exemplified through simulation instances.},

In this article, we propose SPSC, a serverless-based stream computing framework where events are discretized into the atomic stream and stateless Lambda functions are taken as context-irrelevant operators, achieving task parallelism and inherent data parallelism in processing. Also, we implement a prototype of the framework on Amazon Web service (AWS) using AWS Lambda, AWS simple queue service, and AWS DynamoDB. The evaluation shows that compared with Alibaba’s real-time computing Flink version, SPSC outperforms by 10.12% when the overhead is close.},

Along with the proposed self-supervision strategies and deep architectures, we devise a feature normalization strategy to resolve the intra-/inter-subject variability problem. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed deep learning framework on the four publicly available datasets by conducting comparisons with the state of the art baselines. It is also noteworthy that we exploit the same network architecture for the four different EEG paradigms and outperform the comparison methods, thereby meeting the challenge of the task-dependent network architecture engineering in EEG-based applications.},

Contrary to most of the related studies, this work is focused on the case where neither the odd powers nor their bounds are known. This renders the majority of the existing methods for stability analysis and control design for the odd-power systems infeasible. To surmount this challenge, a robust prescribed performance control strategy together with a constraint analysis by contradiction is put forward. Instead of the well-established adding one power integrator technique, a group of barrier functions are employed to combat the tracking error and the intermediate errors. In lieu of the Lyapunov stability theory, a constraint analysis by contradiction is carried out, which discloses the inherent robustness of the control system against the nonparametric uncertainties, the unmatched disturbances and the unknown odd powers. It is guaranteed that the tracking error enters into a preassigned neighborhood of zero after a given time, with a predefined bound on the overshoot. In addition, the proposed control exhibits a striking simplicity. Despite the severe model uncertainties and the recursive control design, no effort needs to be paid for parameter identification, function approximation, disturbance estimation, or derivative calculation. The above theoretical findings are substantiated by the comparative simulation results.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel fuzzy clustering model guided by spectral rotation and scaling (FCSR). In FCSR, both spectral embeddings and membership degrees are considered as new representations of data. They can complement each other from different perspectives which enables the model to engage more structural properties of the data. The process of solving the problem of membership degrees not only inherits the merits of traditional FCM but also preserves data neighborhood structures revealed by the spectral decomposition based on an affinity matrix. Furthermore, to improve the adaptability and extensibility of FCSR, the projected and kernel versions of FCSR (FCSR-P and FCSR-K) are formed. We demonstrate that FCSR-P is suitable for high-dimensional scenarios and FCSR-K can improve the linear separability among data. Extensive experiments conducted on various well-known data sets illustrate the validity of the proposed ideas.},

In contrast to linearization, the inherent challenge in directly solving the above nonlinear optimal control problem lies in addressing the highly coupled nonlinear forward and backward differential equations. In order to address this problem, an equivalent relationship is established between these equations and a new optimization problem. By exploiting the inherent relationship between supervised learning and an optimization problem from the view of a dynamical system, a deep neural network framework is constructed for describing the new optimization problem. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm for optimal control, which is very powerful for a large variety of nonlinear dynamical systems, is implemented by training a deep residual network. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving a trajectory tracking control problem for automatic guided vehicle.

First, taking into account that the system is with aperiodic sampling, the weighting matrices used for judgement in the event-triggered scheme are designed to be related to each sampling interval or its upper and lower bounds, according to the sampling interval being predictable or not. This design makes the scheme more flexible, thereby improving control effectiveness. Second, a sampling-dependent discontinuous functional is introduced into event-triggered control, which contains matrix variables depending on the aperiodic sampling, and incorporates an improved discontinuous term and a vector related to event-triggered condition. Thus, the functional reduces the conservativeness of stability and stabilization criteria. Based on the above aperiodic-sampling-dependent strategy, the derived results achieve better event-triggered control effects compared with the recent literature. At the end, two examples are given to validate the theoretical effectiveness and advantages of the results under various parameters.},

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) with semi-supervised learning relieves label dependence and expands application. Despite some efforts and progress, the semi-supervised BLS still needs improvement, especially in handling imbalanced data or concept drift scenarios for self-training-based methods. To this extent, this article proposes a robust semi-supervised BLS guided by ensemble-based self-training (ESTSS-BLS). Distinctive to self-training that assigns the pseudo-label via a single classifier and confidence, the advocated ensemble-based self-training determines the pseudo-label according to the turnout of multiple BLSs. In addition, label purity is proposed to ensure the correctness and credibility of the auxiliary training data, which is a comprehensive evaluation of the voting. During iterative learning, a small portion of labeled data first trains multiple BLSs in parallel. Then, the system recursively updates its data, structure, and meta-parameters using label purity and a data-driven dynamic nodes mechanism that dynamically guides the network’s structural adjustments to solve the concept drift problem caused by a large amount of auxiliary training data. The experimental results demonstrate that ESTSS-BLS exhibits exceptional performance compared to existing methods, with the lowest-time consumption and the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. Exhilaratingly, it achieves an accuracy of 87.84% with only 0.1% labeled data on MNIST, and with just 2% labeled data, it matches the performance of supervised learning using all training data on NORB. In addition, ESTSS-BLS also performs stably on medical or biological data, verifying its high adaptability.},

However, public opinion analysis still needs help with issues, such as data security, data sharing, and data credibility, which may result in information leakage and inaccurate analysis results. This article proposes a secure management method for public opinion analysis to address these issues. First, a group key management framework is proposed, and then device grouping and mutual authentication methods are used to determine device identity, addressing the data security issue. A dynamic key generation algorithm is proposed to solve the data sharing problem, and a group key management algorithm is implemented to manage the entire lifecycle of group keys, addressing the data credibility issue and establishing a more secure data processing, and storage environment for public opinion analysis. This article utilizes OpenEthereum to build a blockchain network and conducts simulation experiments on the proposed solution.

This study focuses on selecting a set of agents as leaders that receive information from a reference signal directly, while minimizing the number of leaders, subject to consensus tracking performance. First, adopting the average dwell time technique and a time-ratio constraint, an explicit criterion for consensus tracking is derived as prepreparation for leader selection. Second, applying the submodular optimization framework, leader selection metrics are established based on the derived criterion. Third, employing the greedy rule, an efficient leader selection scheme is presented according to the established metrics. The scheme comprises two polynomial-time algorithms that return selected leader sets within a logarithmic bound of the optimum. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed leader selection scheme is verified using an illustrative example.},

  abstract     = {In most existing results, event-triggered controllers are designed based on the backstepping design approach for uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems (SFNSs). However, the transmitted signals in the event-triggered scheme (ETS) are discontinuous, which makes the repetitive differentiation of virtual control signals undefined. To overcome this deficiency, this article designs an event-triggered adaptive controller for uncertain SFNSs based on the fully actuated system (FAS) approach. Since the system states and the adaptive parameters are only updated at each triggering instant, the original dynamics cannot be completely removed by using the FAS approach, leading to that the asymptotic stability of the control system is difficult to be guaranteed. To handle such a problem, an ETS with the adaptive parameters is constructed based on Lyapunov method to compensate the effect of triggering. As a result, the asymptotic stability of the system can be guaranteed in the presence of nonlinearities without the global Lipschitz condition, and Zeno behavior can be avoided by using the contradiction method. Furthermore, a positive lower bound for interevent intervals can be got by adding a constant into the ETS, which ensures that the system is practically stabilizable under the bounded nonlinearities. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, the order delivery efficiency decreases when different logistics statuses are faced. In order to improve the performance of ACO, an adaptive ACO algorithm based on real-time logistics features (AACO-RTLFs) is proposed. First, features are extracted from the event dimension, spatial dimension, and time dimension of the instant delivery to describe the real-time logistics status. Five key factors are further selected from the above three features to assist in problem modeling and ACO designing. Second, an adaptive instant delivery model is built considering the customer’s acceptable delivery time. The acceptable time is calculated by emergency order mark and weather conditions in the event dimension feature. Third, an adaptive ACO algorithm is proposed to obtain the instant delivery order schedules. The parameters of the probability equation in ACO are adjusted according to the extracted key factors. Finally, the Gurobi solver in Python is used to perform numerical experiments on the classical datasets to verify the effectiveness of the instant delivery model. The proposed AACO-RTLF algorithm shows its advantages in instant delivery order scheduling when compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In contrast to previous studies, the proposed scheme can not only constrain the tracking error rapidly to a prearranged vicinity of origin, but also ensure that the upper bound of convergence time can be adjusted in advance via a separate control parameter. In terms of the predefined-time stability theory, the boundedness of all system states can be proven within a predefined time.

Meanwhile, the event-driven Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equation (ED-HJBE) is developed for the optimal regulation problem in order to acquire the optimal control with distinctly decreased computational burden. To solve the ED-HJBE, a single critic neural network (CNN) is designed in the adaptive dynamic programming framework. Meanwhile, the gradient descent method is employed to update the CNN’s weights. After that, both the weight estimation error and the tracking error are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded via Lyapunov’s direct method.

The proposed method effectively combines these approaches, eliminating the need for inverse Jacobian calculations to determine multirotor motion by directly relating pixel variations to the multirotor’s torque and thrust inputs, while also strengthening the method’s robustness through the utilization of the PINN to model and address uncertainties in camera and multirotor parameters, as well as the modeling inaccuracies inherent in the dynamics-centered visual servoing technique. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches, the proposed PINN approach requires, on average, 65% less labeled data to characterize uncertainties and inaccuracies. To ensure real-time implementation of the visual servoing model, the PINN-learned model is combined with an adaptive horizon monotonically weighted nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), capable of processing control efforts at rates 10 times faster than existing Tube MPC and Adaptive MPC strategies. These findings are validated through real-time trajectory tracking experiments, which not only highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in approximating modeling inaccuracies but also its capability in handling uncertainties upto 70% in camera parameters.},

The proposed learning control has a tunable learning gain computed through the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It warrants a bounded convergence within the predesignated finite iterations. In the proposed DDRFILC, not only can the tracking error bound be determined in advance but also the convergence iteration number can be designated beforehand. To deal with nonrepetitive uncertainty, the MIMO uncertain system is reformulated as an iterative incremental linear model by defining a pseudo partitioned Jacobian matrix (PPJM), which is estimated iteratively by using a projection algorithm. Further, both the PPJM estimation and its estimation error bound are included in the LMIs to restrain their effects on the control performance. The proposed DDRFILC can guarantee both the iterative asymptotic convergence with increasing iterations and the FIC within the prespecified iteration number.

The MJS is characterized by a piecewise nonhomogeneous Markovian chain, where the switching of the system TP matrix is governed by a higher-level chain. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to observe the system mode, which cannot always be correctly detected in practice. Under this framework, the partially unknown TPs existing in both higher-level TPs (HTPs) and conditional TPs (CTPs) are taken into account for practical consideration. Additionally, an observed-mode-dependent event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is employed to design an asynchronous controller, which is expected to alleviate the burden of the communication network. Evidently, the considered scenario is fairly general and covers some special cases. With the above consideration, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee stochastic stability of the resulting closed-loop system with a prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance.

  abstract     = {This article devises a new dynamic double event-triggered anti-disturbance tracking control scheme for a 2-degree of freedom (DOF) laboratory helicopter subject to external time-varying disturbances and load fluctuation by using the generalized proportional-integral observer technique. The helicopter system is separated into two subsystems in the proposed control method, i.e., the pitch subsystem and the yaw subsystem. Each subsystem includes a discrete-time dynamic double event-triggering mechanism (DDETM), and the control laws of the two subsystems are independent of each other. There are two triggering conditions in the designed double triggering mechanism: one is designed based on the system states and the other is based on the lumped disturbance estimation. These two triggering conditions form a competitive relationship such that the controller updates the control signal as long as one of the triggering conditions is satisfied. Theoretical analysis is provided for achieving the better communication and control performance of the proposed DDETM-based robust control method. Through rigorous stability analysis, it is proved that the closed-loop hybrid system is globally ultimately bounded. At last, numerical simulations show that the suggested control strategy not only reduces the event-triggering number, but also improves the initial dynamic performance of the system.},

  abstract     = {A safe time-varying formation (TVF) control framework is proposed in this article for heterogeneous multiagent systems under the constraints of denial of service (DoS) attacks, noncooperative dynamic obstacles, and input saturation. The framework integrates both the cyber-layer and physical-layer components to address the challenges posed by these adverse conditions. In the cyber-layer, a distributed resilient observer is provided based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-quadratic program (QP). This observer estimates a reference exosystem, effectively decoupling heterogeneous dynamics from unsafe networks and optimizing the system resilience against DoS attacks. At the physical-layer, for the first time, a collision-free TVF controller is presented based on the CLF-exponential control barrier function-QP. The controller guarantees high-order heterogeneous agents’ operation safety under noncooperative obstacles and input saturation. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms are verified through the comparative simulations and experiments conducted on a physical system comprising unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.},

Considering the dynamic changes of communication connections in uncertain environments, a double semi-Markov process is first introduced into the leader-follower structure to describe the random switching of communication topologies. Then, a novel adaptive distributed fault-tolerant output formation tracking control framework is established using the backstepping and Nussbaum gain technique to address matched/mismatched uncertainties and disturbances, time-varying actuator faults, and unknown nonidentical control directions. In this control framework, the independent variable of the Nussbaum function is designed as a non-negative function that monotonically increases with respect to time, thereby overcoming the presence of the absolute value of its derivative in the integration process. Based on the distributed structure, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is further proposed to achieve the asymptotic output formation tracking in mean-square sense. The stability of the closed-loop nonlinear multiagent systems is analysed through the contradiction argument and Lyapunov theorem.

Despite the presence of the nonautonomous leader and the adversarial followers, the remaining benign followers are still expected to track the leader’s trajectory with the prescribed time-varying formation. To this end, a resilient scheme comprising an attack detection and isolation strategy and a formation tracking protocol is proposed. The detection strategy enables every benign follower to identify its adversarial neighbors with two-hop communication information, as long as the underlying topology meets given conditions. Then, the detected adversarial agents are directly removed to avoid the spread of their influence, which induces a new problem called node loss. To accommodate possible node loss events, the designed tracking protocol is independent of certain global knowledge, and its convergence is demonstrated by means of the impulsive Lyapunov functions. Finally, the proposed resilient scheme is verified by two simulation examples.},

For efficient design of the controllers to realize the tracking performance, a new coordinate transformation is developed under the backstepping method, and the PDE subsystem is transformed into a new form. In addition, the effect of the unknown control gains and the uncertain nonlinearities caused by attacks are alleviated by introducing the Nussbaum technology and NNs.

Importantly, the proposed attack policy refrains from the assumption that the system knowledge is known to attackers. A novel strictly stealthy attack sequence (SSAS), coordinating the sensor and actuator signals simultaneously, is proposed with a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of such an attack presented. Specifically, the SSAS is parameterized as a vector in the null space of a specific matrix which is constructed by a parity matrix and the system Markov parameters. For the purpose of data-driven attack realization, modified subspace identification methods are utilized to achieve an unbiased estimation of the required parameters via the closed-loop data. On this basis, the attack design is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, an explicit solution to which is given to characterize the optimal strictly stealthy attack. Finally, the vulnerability of the cyber-physical systems is analysed from the perspective of the parameter selection for the parity space-based detector. A case study on a three-tank model verifies the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

It is well known that the existence of affine terms brings great difficulties in analysis of the finite-time property of such systems. Furthermore, the design of the globally feasible event-triggered mechanism (ETM) under a finite-time control framework is challenging. Thus, a two-step hybrid control scheme is proposed in this article. The first step focuses on the event-triggered finite-time control for practical stability, while the second step aims to achieve finite-time stabilization. Particularly, in step one, by constructing the intersection between the affine term’s threshold and feasible state region of the established ETM, it is verified that the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Thereafter, an affine state-dependent switching law and sufficient conditions are provided for achieving practical stability. Meanwhile, an estimation for the practical settling time to enter the bounded set is provided. In step two, the criteria for finite-time stabilization of the considered systems are further presented, and an overall settling-time upper bound is derived. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To address this issue, this article proposes an end-to-end framework, i.e., relational part-aware network (REPAN), to explore the semantic correlation and extract discriminative features among multiple parts. Specifically, we first design a part region proposal network (P-RPN) to locate discriminative yet subtle regions. With butterfly units (BFUs) embedded, feature-scale confusion problems stemming from aliasing effects can be largely alleviated. Second, a feature relation Transformer (FRT) plumbs the depths of the spatial relationships by part-and-global joint learning, exploring correlations between various parts to enhance significant part representation. Finally, a contextual detector (CD) classifies and detects parts and the whole composite object through multirelation-aware features, where part information guides to locate the whole object. We collect three remote sensing object detection datasets with four categories to evaluate our method. Consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art methods, the results of extensive experiments underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.},

Furthermore, how these models would integrate implicit, diverse feedback and goals of multiple users remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind system that produces novel images of faces by inferring human goals directly from cross-subject brain signals while study subjects are looking at example images. We report on an experiment where brain responses to images of faces were recorded using electroencephalography in 30 subjects, focusing on specific salient visual features (VFs). Preferences toward VFs were decoded from subjects’ brain responses and used as implicit feedback for a generative adversarial network (GAN), which generated new images of faces. The results from a follow-up user study evaluating the presence of the target salient VFs show that the images generated from brain feedback represent the goal of the study subjects and are comparable to images generated with manual feedback. The methodology provides a stepping stone toward humans-in-the-loop image generation.},

Instead of relying on the traditional transition probability, a sojourn-probability-based SCP is efficiently established to characterize the stochastic nature more precisely. In response to unrestricted deception attacks, an NN-based technique is deployed to estimate and counteract their detrimental impacts on system performance. Moreover, the design of the sliding-mode controller integrates the singular perturbation parameter and fuzzy rules, addressing the challenge of imperfect premise matching. The proposed controller guarantees exponential ultimate boundedness in the mean square sense and ensures the reachability of the specified sliding surface for the closed-loop system. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed theoretical framework is validated through two illustrative examples, confirming its practical applicability and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high-stakes nature of industrial processes, there is an immediate and pressing need on soft sensors for stability and interpretability. In this regard, causality-inspired modeling aims to learn causal features corresponding to the direct causes of quality variables, exhibiting great potential in terms of both stability and interpretability. However, most existing causality-inspired methods overlook temporal modeling and domain knowledge integration, which hinders their real-world application in industrial soft sensing. To this end, this article proposes a novel causality-inspired stable long short-term memory (Stable-LSTM), which leverages Bayesian-based causal structure inference and incorporates domain knowledge as a prior to enhance the performance stability and physical interpretability of soft sensors. After extracting temporal features via long short-term memory (LSTM), a Bayesian-based causal structure inference approach is developed by leveraging variational inference to learn the underlying hidden causal structure within the industrial processes. Through a hidden explanation of domain knowledge, a prior distribution is placed on the hidden causal structure, which will greatly enhance the physical interpretability and facilitate the exploration for true causality. Moreover, we also introduce a global sample reweighting strategy to remove spurious correlations and reveal causal effects between time series hidden features and quality variables. Finally, the performance stability and physical interpretability of the proposed Stable-LSTM are verified using a three-phase flow facility and a m-phenylenediamine distillation process. The results show that the Stable-LSTM achieves the highest soft sensing accuracy under distribution shift, and the inferred causal structure exhibits the greatest consistency with the domain knowledge, when compared with the seven existing methods.},

  abstract     = {External disturbances and packet dropouts will lead to poor control performance for the wastewater treatment process (WWTP). To address this issue, a robust model-free adaptive predictive control (RMFAPC) strategy with a packet dropout compensation mechanism (PDCM) is proposed for WWTP. First, a dynamic linearization approach (DLA), relying only on perturbed process data, is employed to approximate the system dynamics. Second, a predictive control strategy is introduced to avoid a short-sighted control decision, and an extended state observer (ESO) is used to attenuate the disturbance effectively. Furthermore, a PDCM strategy is designed to handle the packet dropout problem, and the stability of RMFAPC is rigorously analyzed. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of RMFAPC are verified through extensive simulations. The simulation results indicate that RMFAPC can significantly reduce IAE by 0.0223 and 0.1976 in two scenarios, regardless of whether the expected value remains constant or varies. This comparison to MFAPC demonstrates the superior robustness of RMFAPC against disturbances. The ablation experiment on PDCM further confirms its capability in handling the packet dropout problem.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates an optimized containment control problem for multiagent systems (MASs), where all followers are subject to deferred full-state constraints. A universal nonlinear transformation is proposed for simultaneously handling the cases with and without constraints. Particularly, for the constrained case, initial values of states are flexibly managed to the midpoint between upper and lower boundaries by utilizing a state-shifting function, thus eliminating the initial restriction conditions. By deferred constraints, the state is forced to fall back into the restrictive boundaries within a preassigned time. A neural network (NN)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is executed under the identifier-critic–actor architecture, where the Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is built in every subsystem to optimize control performance. For actor and critic NNs, updating laws are simplified, since the gradient descent method is performed based on a simple positive function rather than square of Bellman residual error. In view of the Lyapunov stability theorem and graph theory, it is proved that all signals are bounded and the outputs of followers can eventually enter into the convex hull constituted by leaders. Finally, simulations confirm the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The application of reinforcement learning (RL) in artificial intelligence has become increasingly widespread. However, its drawbacks are also apparent, as it requires a large number of samples for support, making the enhancement of sample efficiency a research focus. To address this issue, we propose a novel N-step method. This method extends the horizon of the agent, enabling it to acquire more long-term effective information, thus resolving the issue of data inefficiency in RL. Additionally, this N-step method can reduce the estimation variance of Q-function, which is one of the factors contributing to estimation errors in Q-function estimation. Apart from high variance, estimation bias in Q-function estimation is another factor leading to estimation errors. To mitigate the estimation bias of Q-function, we design a regularization method based on the V-function, which has been underexplored. The combination of these two methods perfectly addresses the problems of low sample efficiency and inaccurate Q-function estimation in RL. Finally, extensive experiments conducted in discrete and continuous action spaces demonstrate that the proposed novel N-step method, when combined with classical deep Q-network, deep deterministic policy gradient, and TD3 algorithms, is effective, consistently outperforming the classical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The problem of sampled-data $H_{\infty }$ dynamic output-feedback control for networked control systems with successive packet losses (SPLs) and stochastic sampling is investigated in this article. The aim of using sampled-data control techniques is to alleviate network congestion. SPLs that occur in the sensor-to-controller (S-C) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) channels are modeled using a packet loss model. Additionally, it is assumed that stochastic sampling follows a Bernoulli distribution. A model is established to capture the stochastic characteristics of both the SPL model and stochastic sampling. This model is crucial as it allows us to determine the probability distribution of the sampling interval between successive update instants, which is essential for stability analysis. An exponential mean-square stability condition for the constructed equivalent discrete-time stochastic system, which also guarantees the prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance, is established by incorporating probability theory. The desired controller is designed using a step-by-step synthesis approach, which may offer lower design conservatism compared to some existing methods. Finally, our designed approach using a networked F-404 engine system model is validated and its merits relative to existing results are discussed. The proposed method is finally validated by employing a networked model of the F-404 engine system. Furthermore, the advantages of our method are presented in comparison to previous results.},

First, by associating the sawtooth characteristics of the input delay in SDSs with free matrices, an SCBHII is proposed; its accuracy improves as the hierarchy increases. Subsequently, a high-order two-sided looped-functional, which considers both the sampling multi-integral states and the sawtooth pattern, is introduced to cater to the aforementioned inequality. In addition, the system variables are augmented by sawtooth pattern-related terms, which eliminates the need for additional secondary processing when determining the negative-definiteness of derivatives with high-order terms. By combining the high-order two-sided looped-functional with the proposed SCBHII, a stability criterion for SDSs with reduced conservatism is achieved, presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed inequality technique and the stability criterion are shown to be effective and superior through three numerical examples and a real-world simplified power market model.},

While numerous methods have been developed to assist machine learning models in adapting to such changeable data, the problem of improperly keeping or discarding data samples remains. This may results in the loss of valuable knowledge that could be utilized in subsequent time points, ultimately affecting the model’s accuracy. To address this issue, a novel method called time segmentation-based data stream learning method (TS-DM) is developed to help segment and learn the streaming data for concept drift adaptation. First, a chunk-based segmentation strategy is given to segment normal and drift chunks. Building upon this, a chunk-based evolving segmentation (CES) strategy is proposed to mine and segment the data chunk when both old and new concepts coexist. Furthermore, a warning level data segmentation process (CES-W) and a high-low-drift tradeoff handling process are developed to enhance the generalization and robustness. To evaluate the performance and efficiency of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By comparing the results with several state-of-the-art data stream learning methods, the experimental findings demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

However, the essential prior knowledge and pretrained text features are often ignored at the early stage of the development of quantum-inspired models. To attacking the above challenges, a pretrained quantum-inspired deep neural network is proposed in this work, which is constructed based on quantum theory for carrying out strong performance and great interpretability in related NLP fields. Concretely, a quantum-inspired pretrained feature embedding (QPFE) method is first developed to model superposition states for words to embed more textual features. Then, a QPFE-ERNIE model is designed by merging the semantic features learned from the prevalent pretrained model ERNIE, which is verified with two NLP downstream tasks: 1) sentiment classification and 2) word sense disambiguation (WSD). In addition, schematic quantum circuit diagrams are provided, which has potential impetus for the future realization of quantum NLP with quantum device. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate QPFE-ERNIE is significantly better for sentiment classification than gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM, and TextCNN on five datasets in all metrics and achieves better results than ERNIE in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on two datasets (CR and SST), and it also has advantage for WSD over the classical models, including BERT (improves F1-score by 5.2 on average) and ERNIE (improves F1-score by 4.2 on average) and improves the F1-score by 8.7 on average compared with a previous quantum-inspired model QWSD. QPFE-ERNIE provides a novel pretrained quantum-inspired model for solving NLP problems, and it lays a foundation for exploring more quantum-inspired models in the future.},

It has been demonstrated that the signals generated by the controlled system exhibit uniform boundedness. Additionally, the followers’ states can achieve and maintain consensus with that of the leader. Ultimately, the simulation results are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the designed theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The extraction of spatiotemporal neuron activity from calcium imaging videos plays a crucial role in unraveling the coding properties of neurons. While existing neuron extraction approaches have shown promising results, disturbing and scattering background and unused depth still impede their performance. To address these limitations, we develop an automatic and accurate neuron extraction paradigm, dubbed as decomposition–estimation–reconstruction (DER), consisting of D-procedure, E-procedure, and R-procedure. Specifically, the D-procedure first decomposes the raw data into a low-rank background and a sparse neuron signal, and regularizes $L_{0}$ -norm priors of intensity and gradient of the neuron signal to suppress blurring and artifact effects. Then, the E-procedure estimates the depth-dependent transmission of the neuron signal based on its bright and dark channel priors. The R-procedure finally integrates the depth estimation of the neuron signal as a content-importance weight into a constrained non-negative matrix decomposition framework, which facilitates accurate neuron locations to boost the quality of extracted neurons. These three procedures are coupled in a cascade manner, where the former copes with calcium imaging data to facilitate the subsequent one. Comprehensive experiments on neuron extraction from calcium imaging videos demonstrate the superiority of our DER paradigm in both qualitative results and quantitative assessments over state-of-the-art methods.},

An adaptive IOC approach is proposed to recover the cost functional using only the system state data, which integrates the finite-time concurrent learning (FTCL) technique and the semidefinite programming (SDP) technique. First, an identifier neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear control policy, and an FTCL-based update law is proposed to estimate the weights of the identifier NN online, which removes the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition. Moreover, the finite-time convergence as well as the uniformly ultimately boundness (UUB) of estimation error of the identifier NN weights are analysed according to whether or not there exists the identifier NN approximation error. Then, with the help of a value NN for approximating the value function, an SDP problem with a quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the weighting matrices of the cost functional.

When the model information of a redundant manipulator is unknown, the trajectory-tracking control with model-based methods may fail to complete a given task. To this end, this article proposes a data-driven neural dynamics-based model predictive control (NDMPC) algorithm, which consists of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme, a neural dynamics (ND) solver, and a discrete-time Jacobian matrix (DTJM) updating law. With the help of the DTJM updating law, the future output of the model-unknown redundant manipulator is predicted, and the MPC scheme for trajectory tracking is constructed. The ND solver is designed to solve the MPC scheme to generate control input driving the redundant manipulator. The convergence of the proposed data-driven NDMPC algorithm is proven via theoretical analyses, and its feasibility and superiority are demonstrated via simulations and experiments on a redundant manipulator. Under the drive of the proposed algorithm, the redundant manipulator successfully carries out the trajectory-tracking task without the need for its kinematics model.},

The challenge lies in the realization of a complete performance specification for trajectory tracking in the sense of quantitatively regulating the peak value, overshoot, settling time, and accuracy while ensuring that the initial condition holds naturally. To this end, an error transformation, equipped with a shifting function, is introduced and incorporated with a new-type barrier function. Then, a class of performance functions is exploited to quantify the settling times and steady-state bounds of the intermediate errors. Moreover, to improve the flexibility of formulating performance specifications for the tracking error, a pair of asymmetric performance boundaries are further designed. With their combination, a novel robust prescribed performance control (PPC) approach is proposed in this article. It not only achieves the quantitative performance guarantees but also preserves the unique simplicity of PPC, evading the needs for function approximation, parameter identification, disturbance estimation, derivative calculation, or command filtering. The above theoretical findings are confirmed via three simulation studies.},

In case of an unknown fault in the communication link, there is no constant Laplacian matrix anymore and each follower agent cannot be informed of the global information simultaneously. To deal with this problem, an adaptive compensating estimator is constructed to estimate the signal spanned by the leaders. Instead of using the linear filter, a nonlinear filter is employed, which both solves the classical complexity explosion in the traditional backstepping method and flushes out the usefulness of the boundary layer error. Considering the dead zone input, we propose two event-triggered schemes, that is, the update-triggered scheme and the transmit-triggered scheme. In the former, the threshold function involves the tracking errors and additional dynamic variable, which can provide the desirable tradeoff between the containment control performance of the considered MASs and saving communication resources. In the latter, the triggered condition is designed according to the characteristic of dead zone, which makes the communication burden be reduced further. Following the backstepping design framework, an adaptive containment control is constructed, it is shown that the containment error can converge to an adjustable residual set even if MASs are subjected to the unknown and bounded communication link faults and dead-zone inputs. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

First, different from previous studies, the cognitive and interest conflicts of internal and external experts are considered simultaneously. But interest conflict is emphasized for internal experts, and cognitive conflict is mainly considered for external experts. Second, we explore the categorization and management methods of noncooperative behaviors (NCBs) of experts. The relative projection-based indexes are proposed for the first time to measure the degrees of cognitive and interest conflicts by using multiattribute preference matrices (MAPMs) and the weight vectors of attributes. A group of experts are divided into three categories and the corresponding management strategies are developed. Third, we investigate the consensus mechanism among experts with cognitive and interest conflicts. For reaching an acceptable consensus level, an adjustment process is proposed to revise some local entries in MAPMs and mutual evaluation matrix (MEM). A penalty mechanism is further established to dynamically update the weights of experts. An algorithm is designed to capture the consensus reaching process in multiattribute group decision making, where internal and external experts are distinguished by proposing a parameter. Finally, the high-performance battery supplier selection of new energy vehicle is studied to illustrate the proposed model. The results reveal that the efficiency of reaching consensus can be enhanced by using the developed model with effective management of NCBs.},

To establish the stability conditions on the basis of the high-order integral inequalities, two challenging issues are required to be resolved. One is the formulation of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), the other is the high-degree polynomial negative conditions (NCs). By transforming the integrals in N-order generalized free-matrix-based integral inequalities (GFIIs) into the multiple integrals, the hierarchical LKFs are constructed by adopting these multiple integrals. Then, the novel modified matrix polynomial NCs are presented for the $2N-1$ degree delay polynomials in the LKF differentials. Thus, the hierarchical linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are set up and the nonlinear problems caused by the GFIIs are solved at the same time. Eventually, the superiority of the provided hierarchical stability criteria is demonstrated by several numeric examples.},

  abstract     = {Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are receiving increased attention due to their time-dependent properties and the evolving nature of knowledge over time. TKGs typically contain complex geometric structures, such as hierarchical, ring, and chain structures, which can often be mixed together. However, embedding TKGs into Euclidean space, as is typically done with TKG completion (TKGC) models, presents a challenge when dealing with high-dimensional nonlinear data and complex geometric structures. To address this issue, we propose a novel TKGC model called multicurvature adaptive embedding (MADE). MADE models TKGs in multicurvature spaces, including flat Euclidean space (zero curvature), hyperbolic space (negative curvature), and hyperspherical space (positive curvature), to handle multiple geometric structures. We assign different weights to different curvature spaces in a data-driven manner to strengthen the ideal curvature spaces for modeling and weaken the inappropriate ones. Additionally, we introduce the quadruplet distributor (QD) to assist the information interaction in each geometric space. Ultimately, we develop an innovative temporal regularization to enhance the smoothness of timestamp embeddings by strengthening the correlation of neighboring timestamps. Experimental results show that MADE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.},

To solve such a problem, a modified memoryless dual-observer-based stabilizing controller is designed, and the closed-loop stability is proven under some additional conditions. Compared with the reduced-order observer-based controller, the dimension of the dual-observer-based controller is smaller if the system has more inputs than outputs. At the same time, the design approach is more challenging in proving closed-loop stability, as for example a more intricate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional has to be constructed associated with the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Radiation therapy treatment planning requires balancing the delivery of the target dose while sparing normal tissues, making it a complex process. To streamline the planning process and enhance its quality, there is a growing demand for knowledge-based planning (KBP). Ensemble learning has shown impressive power in various deep learning tasks, and it has great potential to improve the performance of KBP. However, the effectiveness of ensemble learning heavily depends on the diversity and individual accuracy of the base learners. Moreover, the complexity of model ensembles is a major concern, as it requires maintaining multiple models during inference, leading to increased computational cost and storage overhead. In this study, we propose a novel learning-based ensemble approach named LENAS, which integrates neural architecture search with knowledge distillation for 3-D radiotherapy dose prediction. Our approach starts by exhaustively searching each block from an enormous architecture space to identify multiple architectures that exhibit promising performance and significant diversity. To mitigate the complexity introduced by the model ensemble, we adopt the teacher-student paradigm, leveraging the diverse outputs from multiple learned networks as supervisory signals to guide the training of the student network. Furthermore, to preserve high-level semantic information, we design a hybrid loss to optimize the student network, enabling it to recover the knowledge embedded within the teacher networks. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public datasets: 1) OpenKBP and 2) AIMIS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods. Code: github.com/hust-linyi/LENAS.},

  abstract     = {Real hyperspectral images (HSIs) are ineluctably contaminated by diverse types of noise, which severely limits the image usability. Recently, transfer learning has been introduced in hyperspectral denoising networks to improve model generalizability. However, the current frameworks often rely on image priors and struggle to retain the fidelity of background information. In this article, an unsupervised adaptation learning (UAL)-based hyperspectral denoising network (UALHDN) is proposed to address these issues. The core idea is first learning a general image prior for most HSIs, and then adapting it to a real HSI by learning the deep priors and maintaining background consistency, without introducing hand-crafted priors. Following this notion, a spatial–spectral residual denoiser, a global modeling discriminator, and a hyperspectral discrete representation learning scheme are introduced in the UALHDN framework, and are employed across two learning stages. First, the denoiser and the discriminator are pretrained using synthetic noisy-clean ground-based HSI pairs. Subsequently, the denoiser is further fine-tuned on the real multiplatform HSI according to a spatial–spectral consistency constraint and a background consistency loss in an unsupervised manner. A hyperspectral discrete representation learning scheme is also designed in the fine-tuning stage to extract semantic features and estimate noise-free components, exploring the deep priors specific for real HSIs. The applicability and generalizability of the proposed UALHDN framework were verified through the experiments on real HSIs from various platforms and sensors, including unmanned aerial vehicle-borne, airborne, spaceborne, and Martian datasets. The UAL denoising scheme shows a superior denoising ability when compared with the state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoisers.},

In order to solve this problem, a new kind of distributed observer-based RPOC control framework is presented. First, for obtaining the information of nonidentical leaders’ dynamics, including uncertain parameters in leaders’ system matrices, output matrices, states, and outputs, four kinds of adaptive observers are constructed in a fully distributed form without any knowledge of the dynamics of nonidentical leaders, exactly. Second, on the basis of adaptive learning technique, a new RPOC controller is then developed by using the presented observers, where the adaptive observers can make up for the uncertain parameter in followers’ dynamics, and the solutions of output regulation equations can be obtained adaptively by the developed adaptive strategy. Furthermore, with the help of the output regulation method and Lyapunov stability theory, the RPOC criteria for the considered system under unknown nonidentical leaders’ dynamics are derived from the constructed controller. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RPOC controller.},

Moreover, thanks to the idea of switching topology, the mixed ZS game problem under the influence of node-based DoS attacks is solved efficiently.

A nonlinear HOFA system model is used to describe the multiagent systems (MASs) with heterogeneous uncertain nonlinear dynamics, which is called the HUN-HOFAMASs. A predictive terminal sliding-mode control-based robust cooperative control scheme is presented to address this problem. In this scheme, heterogeneous nonlinear dynamics of original system are offset to establish a linear constant HOFA system with the help of full actuation feature. Then, a terminal sliding-mode variable for enhancing the system robustness is introduced to handle the uncertainties. Furthermore, a linear incremental prediction model is developed in a HOFA form by means of a Diophantine equation. According to this model, the multistep terminal sliding-mode predictions are yielded to optimize the robust cooperative control performance and compensate for the network-induced communication constraints in the feedback and forward channels. Based on a linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, a necessary and sufficient criterion is derived to discuss the simultaneous consensus and stability of closed-loop HUN-HOFAMASs. The simulation and comparison results of cooperative flying around of multiple spacecraft system are shown to illustrate the capability and advantage of the presented predictive terminal sliding-mode control for robust cooperative control.},

To begin with, a mathematical model is introduced to capture intragroup strategy dynamics and intergroup conflicts of HNEGs-IC via the algebraic state space representation (ASSR). A necessary and sufficient condition for achieving global cooperation of HNEGs-IC is established. Then, a criterion for verifying the $\kappa $ -cooperation below a certain mortality is presented. Considering the HNEGs-IC with strategy feedback control, it is proven that the feedback control, subject to global cooperation, is robust to conflicts when the intersection of the strategy threshold set and the reachable set of the preset initial strategy profiles is empty. Finally, for verification and demonstration, the obtained results are applied to a simplified virtual game model of the NATO and the Warsaw Pact.},

The local cost function of each player depends on its own decision and an aggregate of the decisions of all the players. An adaptive continuous-time distributed strategy is developed for uncertain EL systems to reach the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of multicluster aggregative game. In particular, a new auxiliary system is synthesized using a projection operator, gradient descent, and dynamic average consensus to estimate the GNE. Based on the outputs of the auxiliary system, an adaptive tracking algorithm is developed for an EL system with uncertain parameters. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that the developed distributed strategy achieves accurate convergence to the GNE.

  abstract     = {Safety as a fundamental requirement for human-swarm interaction has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Most existing approaches solve a constrained optimization problem at each time step, which has a high real-time requirement. To deal with this challenge, this article formulates the safe human-swarm interaction problem as a Stackerberg–Nash game, in which the optimization is performed over the entire time domain. The leader robot is supposed to be in a dominant position, interacting directly with the human operator to realize trajectory tracking and responsible for guiding the swarm to avoid obstacles. The follower robots always take their best responses to leader’s behavior with the purpose of achieving the desired formation. Following the bottom-up principle, we first design the best-response controllers, that is, Nash equilibrium strategies, for the followers. Then, a Lyapunov-like control barrier function-based safety controller and a learning-based formation tracking controller for the leader are designed to realize safe and robust cooperation. We show that the designed controllers can make the robotic swarms move in a desired geometric formation following the human command and modify their motion trajectories autonomously when the human command is unsafe. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through simulation and experiments. The experiment results further show that safety can still be guaranteed even when there exists a dynamic obstacle.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a formation control problem for a group of heterogeneous, nonlinear, uncertain, input-affine, second-order agents modeled by a directed graph. A tunable neural network (NN) is presented, with three layers (input, two hidden, and output) that can approximate an unknown nonlinearity. Unlike one- or two-layer NNs, this design has the advantage of being able to set the number of neurons in each layer ahead of time rather than relying on trial and error. The NN weights tuning law is rigorously derived using the Lyapunov theory. The formation control problem is tackled using a robust integral of the sign of the error feedback and NNs-based control. The robust integral of the sign of the error feedback compensates for the unknown dynamics of the leader and disturbances in the agent errors, while the NN-based controller accounts for the unknown nonlinearity in the multiagent system. The stability and semi-global asymptotic tracking of the results are proven using the Lyapunov stability theory. The study compares its results with two others to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

To make asymptotic rendezvous between agents and their corresponding targets, we use an autonomous system consisting of attraction forces and velocity alignments. If the target’s position, velocity, and acceleration information are available, we derive a multiagent system for complete rendezvous and obtain its exponential convergence result. If we have only the location and velocity information of the targets, we provide an autonomous system for practical rendezvous and the corresponding mathematical analysis. To prove the main results, we employ frame-rotation–structure decomposition for the double-integrator model and the geometric properties of a rigid formation on a sphere. We also provide numerical simulations to confirm our mathematical results and apply them to multiagent dynamics with a rigid formation that patrols the boundary line for a certain area on the sphere.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a new formation scheme for a leader-follower unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system inspired by a human pilot’s behavior wherein the formation geometry does not necessarily remain fixed as the vehicles maneuver. In other words, the position and the orientation of the follower with respect to the leader are subject to change as they maneuver while satisfying some constraints. Our strategy ensures that the follower UAV maintains a desired fixed relative distance with respect to the leader UAV, whereas its orientation with respect to the leader UAV may change to reduce its control effort and provide it with a tactical advantage. We call this new relational maneuvering scheme flexible since the set of feasible positions for the follower UAV is not fixed, as is common in close proximity two-ship formations in air-to-air combat. By assigning the follower UAV’s linear and angular velocities as its control inputs, our approach tries to emulate a human pilot’s behavior in UAVs by taking anticipatory maneuvers when the leader UAV makes aggressive turns. The proposed flexible-geometry formation scheme is robust to the leader’s maneuver changes since the follower UAV’s control law does not need the information of the leader’s angular speed control and only uses relative measurements. This makes the design lucrative even when the vehicles are heterogeneous, global measurements are unavailable, or if the leader UAV is noncooperative. Finally, we present multiple simulations to highlight the merits of the flexible formation control laws.},

  abstract     = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect neurophysiological changes of the brain in response to external events and their associated underlying complex spatiotemporal feature information is governed by ongoing oscillatory activity within the brain. Deep learning methods have been increasingly adopted for ERP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to their excellent feature representation abilities, which allow for deep analysis of oscillatory activity within the brain. Features with higher spatiotemporal frequencies usually represent detailed and localized information, while features with lower spatiotemporal frequencies usually represent global structures. Mining EEG features from multiple spatiotemporal frequencies is conducive to obtaining more discriminative information. A multiscale feature fusion octave convolution neural network (MOCNN) is proposed in this article. MOCNN divides the ERP signals into high-, medium- and low-frequency components corresponding to different resolutions and processes them in different branches. By adding mid- and low-frequency components, the feature information used by MOCNN can be enriched, and the required amount of calculations can be reduced. After successive feature mapping using temporal and spatial convolutions, MOCNN realizes interactive learning among different components through the exchange of feature information among branches. Classification is accomplished by feeding the fused deep spatiotemporal features from various components into a fully connected layer. The results, obtained on two public datasets and a self-collected ERP dataset, show that MOCNN can achieve state-of-the-art ERP classification performance. In this study, the generalized concept of octave convolution is introduced into the field of ERP-BCI research, which allows effective spatiotemporal features to be extracted from multiscale networks through branch width optimization and information interaction at various scales.},

Given the intrinsic time-space coupling characteristic inherent in PDE computations, implementing a state-dependent DETM for PDE-based flexible risers presents a significant challenge. To overcome this difficulty, a novel dynamic event-triggered control method is introduced for flexible riser systems, focusing on optimizing available control inputs. In order to save computational costs from the controller to the actuator, a dynamic event-triggered adaptive boundary controller is designed to effectively reduce boundary position vibrations. Additionally, considering external disturbances, an adaptive bounded compensation term is incorporated to counteract the influence of external disturbances on the system. Addressing boundary position constraints, a new integral barrier Lyapunov function (iBLF) tailored specifically for flexible riser systems is introduced, thereby alleviating conservatism in the controller design of flexible risers modeled by PDEs. At last, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation example.},

The neighbor relationship of all agents is described by a spatial variable and two static-feedback controllers are introduced, which can be expressed as a second-order space difference of the spatial variable. Then, the deployment of MASs can be transformed into the stabilization of discrete-space partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Three virtual agents are introduced to constitute the Dirchlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Several algebraic inequality criteria are derived to guarantee that the prescribed-time time-varying deployment can be achieved within a prescribed time under the Dirchlet and mixed boundary conditions. Unlike the published results, our results are derived based on the discrete-space PDE systems instead of continuous-space PDE systems, which is consistent with the discrete spatial distribution of agents.

However, it is difficult for existing dynamic multiobjective algorithms (DMOAs) to handle DMOPs due to their inability to learn in different environments to guide the search. Besides, solving DMOPs is typically an online task, requiring low computational cost of a DMOA. To address the above challenges, we propose a particle search guidance network (PSGN), capable of directing individuals’ search actions, including learning target selection and acceleration coefficient control. PSGN can learn the actions that should be taken in each environment through rewarding or punishing the network by reinforcement learning. Thus, PSGN is capable of tackling DMOPs of various dynamics. Additionally, we efficiently adjust PSGN hidden nodes and update the output weights in an incremental learning way, enabling PSGN to direct particle search at a low computational cost. We compare the proposed PSGN with seven state-of-the-art algorithms, and the excellent performance of PSGN verifies that it can handle DMOPs of various dynamics in a computationally very efficient way.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the stability issue of switched network control systems (SNCSs) under deception attacks described by a Bernoulli process with unknown probability distribution. The false information in deception attacks is unknown but bounded and may be state dependent or state independent. By means of the input-to-state stability (ISS) tool and the convex combination method, an improved lemma is first developed for SNCSs, which facilitates the derivations of our results. After that, some attack-independent sufficient conditions for the ISS of SNCSs are obtained for mode-dependent average dwell time switching and stochastic switching, respectively. Different from existing results, the concerned switching contributes to the stability of SNCSs, which benefits the ISS performance of SNCSs even though the unknown deception attacks cause all subsystems to be non-ISS. The proposed results provide an effective solution with strong robustness to deal with unknown deception attacks or denial-of-service attacks.},

In addition, the binomial coefficients are applied to derive new finite linear programming conditions.

Considering that not all followers are able to access the information of the leader, a distributed auxiliary perception system is proposed to estimate the state information of the leader to guarantee that the estimation errors converge to zero within fixed time. Then, based on the estimated states, a prescribed performance fault-tolerant control (FTC) approach is proposed, which achieves the user-defined performance specifications even in the presence of system faults. Moreover, as accurate system dynamic models are perhaps hard to acquire in practical engineering, a data-based method is proposed by using the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to design the fault-tolerant controller, which only needs the off-policy online data and is independent of the model dynamics of followers. The stability and synchronization with the prescribed behavior are guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability theorem.

The characteristic of state dimension switching caused by ground contact is modeled via the singular system presentation with mode-dependent singularity matrices, based on which numerically testable criteria of stability and stabilization in the stochastic sense are derived.

This article introduces a novel scheme for practical uncertainty estimation to mitigate peaking dynamics and enhance overall dynamic behavior. A fusion estimation framework for lumped uncertainties using multiple extended state observers (ESOs) is constructed, and the low-frequency adaptive parameter learning technique is employed to approximate the optimal fusion. The adaptive fusion estimation not only attenuates transient peaks in uncertainty estimation but also attains fast convergence and high accuracy under the high-gain scheduling of ESOs. Furthermore, the robustness of uncertainty estimation against measurement noises is enhanced by cascading filters in the proposed adaptive fusion framework for multiple ESOs. Extensive theoretical analyses are executed to verify practical applicability in peak and noise rejection.

  abstract     = {With the escalating severity of environmental pollution caused by effluent, the wastewater treatment process (WWTP) has gained significant attention. The wastewater treatment efficiency and effluent quality are significantly impacted by effluent scheduling that adjusts the hydraulic retention time. However, the sequential batch and continuous nature of the effluent pose challenges, resulting in complex scheduling models with strong constraints that are difficult to tackle using existing scheduling methods. To optimize maximum completion time and effluent quality simultaneously, this article proposes a restructured set-based discrete particle swarm optimization (RS-DPSO) algorithm to address the WWTP effluent scheduling problem (WWTP-ESP). First, an effective encoding and decoding method is designed to effectively map solutions to feasible schedules using temporal and spatial information. Second, a restructured set-based discrete particle swarm algorithm is introduced to enhance the searching ability in discrete solution space via restructuring the solution set. Third, a constraint handling strategy based on violation degree ranking is designed to reduce the waste of computational resources. Fourth, a Sobel filter based local search is proposed to guide particle search direction to enhance search efficiency ability. The RS-DPSO provides a novel method for solving WWTP-ESP problems with complex discrete solution space. The comparative experiments indicate that the novel designs are effective and the proposed algorithm has superior performance over existing algorithms in solving the WWTP-ESP.},

In this article, we propose a continuous-time model for arbitrary-step prediction to learn an unknown PDE system in multivariate time series whose governing equations are parameterized by self-attention and gated recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, exogenous-guided PDE network (EgPDE-Net), takes account of the relationships among the exogenous variables and their effects on the target series. Importantly, the model can be reduced into a regularized ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem with specially designed regularization guidance, which makes the PDE problem tractable to obtain numerical solutions and feasible to predict multiple future values of the target series at arbitrary time points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model could achieve competitive accuracy over strong baselines: on average, it outperforms the best baseline by reducing 9.85% on RMSE and 13.98% on MAE for arbitrary-step prediction.},

Then, the D3IMC is proposed with both a nominal control algorithm and an uncertainty compensation control algorithm. The former can quickly respond to the feedback errors and the latter can compensate the model-plant mismatch and external disturbances. Meanwhile, the adaptive parameter updating law in the proposed D3IMC method inherits the robustness against uncertainties. A nominal D3IMC is also designed without including the compensator when there is no exogenous disturbance since the adaptive mechanism can handle system uncertainty. Further, the results are extended and a full-form dynamic linearization-based D3IMC is developed to address control of nonlinear systems with more complex dynamics. All the proposed D3IMC methods are data-driven without need of an explicit model, and thus they are significant extensions from the traditional model-based IMC.

  abstract     = {Approximation biases of value functions are considered a key problem in reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, existing RL algorithms are hindered by overestimation and underestimation biases, i.e., value mismatching between RL’s actual returns and action-value approximations limits the performance of RL algorithms. In this article, we first develop a new synthesis loss function for RL’s action-value estimation integrating a regularization term and a modified “clipped double Q-learning” structure for solving overestimation and underestimation biases. To minimize the differences between action-value estimations and actual returns in RL, we develop a new discrepancy function to determine the type and magnitude of approximation biases. Then, two coefficients embedded in the synthesis loss are automatically tuned by minimizing the discrepancy function during training to minimize approximation biases. We further design a new actor-critic (AC) algorithm, named AC with synthesis loss (ACSL), by integrating the synthesis loss function and an error-controlled mechanism. Experimental results on continuous control tasks illustrate that the proposed ACSL algorithm outperforms other cutting-edge RL methods in many tasks and that the proposed synthesis loss function is easily implemented into other algorithms and significantly reduces approximation biases while improving performance. The proposed method can successfully handle many complex continuous control tasks and can greatly outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms on most tasks.},

This article explores grounded theory on the pinning synchronization of the emerging multiplex dynamical networks. The multiplex dynamical networks under study can describe many real-world scenarios, in which different layers have distinct individual dynamics of node. In this work, we build the bridge between multiplex structures and network dynamics by using the Lyapunov stability theory and the spectral graph theory. Furthermore, by analyzing spectral properties of the grounded super-Laplacian matrices, we set up several graph-based synchronization criteria for multiplex networks via pinning control. In addition, we overcome the difficulties induced by distinct node dynamics in different layers, and find that interlayer coupling strengths promote intralayer synchronization of multiplex networks.

However, traditional multiparty learning approaches are confronted with obstacles, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and incentive design. Determining how to deal with these challenges and further improve the efficiency and performance of multiparty learning has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this article, we propose a novel contrastive multiparty learning framework for knowledge refinement and sharing with an accountable incentive mechanism. Since the existing parameter averaging method is contradictory to the learning paradigm of neural networks, we simulate the process of human cognition and communication and analogize multiparty learning as a many-to-one knowledge-sharing problem. The approach is capable of integrating the acquired explicit knowledge of each client in a transparent manner without privacy disclosure, and it reduces the dependence on data distribution and communication environments. The proposed scheme achieves significant improvement in model performance in a variety of scenarios, as we demonstrated through experiments on several real-world datasets.},

Various types of state estimation and controller design problems for the polynomial fuzzy PDEs system are discussed concerning the state estimation problem. To investigate the relaxed stability problem, Euler’s homogeneous theorem, Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with polynomial matrices (LKFPM), and the sum-of-squares (SOSs) approach are adopted. The exponential stabilization condition is formulated in terms of the spatial-derivative-SOSs (SD-SOSs).

A novel Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) framework is presented to accomplish safe and precise rendezvous under input limitations and external disturbances. First, by incorporating the prescribed performance control (PPC) technique into the LMPC framework, we transform the original ascending state of the AUV into a self-constrained state, which serves as the decision variable of the model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem. Then, PPC-aided auxiliary control laws based on disturbance observers (DOBs) are designed to establish a robust contractive constraint to provide stability margins. Combining the LMPC with the PPC technique makes the original state-constrained problem an equivalent state-constraint-free problem. By addressing the MPC problem for the equivalent unconstrained system, the proposed method preserves the rendezvous safety. With the robust contractive constraint, the proposed safety-preserving LMPC (SP-LMPC) controller can inherit robustness and stability from the robust auxiliary control laws. Furthermore, theoretical analyses are conducted to assess recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability. With comprehensive theoretical support, the proposed method provides a new framework to simultaneously address state constraints and disturbances for highly nonlinear marine systems. Finally, simulations and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

To handle the unexpected actuator faults encountered by the FO MASs, a hierarchical FTC mechanism is developed for each system by constructing an event-triggered distributed FO estimator at the upper layer to estimate the leader system’s output via conditionally triggered neighboring information, and an FTC unit at the lower layer to counteract the loss-of-effectiveness faults via Nussbaum function with FO criteria. To further address the unknown nonlinear functions involving bias faults and periodic disturbances, the Fourier series expansion technique is used to construct the input variables of fuzzy neural networks (FNNs), such that the FNNs with dynamically adjusted weight matrices, centers, and widths can be developed for each FO system to act as the learning module. It is shown by FO Lyapunov stability analysis that all follower systems can track the leader system against faults and periodic disturbances.

Notably, the settling time and initial condition of the prescribed performance function are completely independent of the initial tracking error and system parameters, thereby improving upon existing results.

Over the past decades, despite demonstrating its effectiveness in data classification, genetic programming (GP) has still encountered three major challenges when dealing with high-dimensional data: 1) solution diversity; 2) multiclass imbalance; and 3) large feature space. In this article, we have developed a problem-specific multiobjective GP framework (PS-MOGP) for handling classification tasks with high-dimensional data. To reduce the large solution space caused by high dimensionality, we incorporate the recursive feature elimination strategy based on mining the archive of evolved GP solutions. A progressive domination Pareto archive evolution strategy (PD-PAES), which optimizes the objectives in a specific order according to their objectives, is proposed to evaluate the GP individuals and maintain a better diversity of solutions. Besides, to address the seriously imbalanced class issue caused by traditional binary decomposition (BD) one versus rest (OVR) for multiclass classification problems, we design a method named BD with a similar positive and negative class size (BD-SPNCS) to generate a set of auxiliary classifiers. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed PS-MOGP outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and evolutionary classification methods in the context of high-dimensional data classification.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for learning from interactions within a stationary environment where state transition and reward distributions remain constant throughout the process. Addressing the practical but challenging nonstationary environments with time-varying state transition or reward function changes during the interactions, ingenious solutions are essential for the stability and robustness of DRL agents. A key assumption to cope with nonstationary environments is that the change points between the previous and the new environments are known beforehand. Unfortunately, this assumption is impractical in many cases, such as outdoor robots and online recommendations. To address this problem, this article presents a robust DRL algorithm for nonstationary environments with unknown change points. The algorithm actively detects change points by monitoring the joint distribution of states and actions. A detection boosted, gradient-constrained optimization method then adapts the training of the current policy with the supporting knowledge of formerly well-trained policies. The previous policies and experience help the current policy adapt rapidly to environmental changes. Experiments show that the proposed method accumulates the highest reward among several alternatives and is the fastest to adapt to new environments. This work has compelling potential for increasing the environmental suitability of intelligent agents, such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and underwater robots.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the control design and reachable set estimation problem for T–S fuzzy systems under bounded external disturbances. By designing a fuzzy controller, the reachable set of the closed-loop fuzzy system can be bounded by an ellipsoid that is minimized via two optimization algorithms. When the fuzzy control scheme is implemented under an event-triggered framework, the limited information availability may degrade desired control performance due to only the triggered state being available for the fuzzy controller. To alleviate this problem, a novel reachable-set-dependent event-triggering condition is proposed such that satisfactory control performance can still be ensured by the above fuzzy controller. Meanwhile, the bounding ellipsoid of the reachable set is explicitly given, and a relationship is established between control performance and communication cost under the event-triggered scheme. In addition, under the condition that the reachable set remains within a specified safe area, the communication rate can be reduced while still achieving optimal control performance. The proposed strategies are verified via a simulation example.},

In this article, we strive to explore the robust features that are not affected by the adversarial perturbations, that is, invariant to the clean image and its adversarial examples (AEs), to improve the model’s adversarial robustness. Specifically, we propose a feature disentanglement model to segregate the robust features from nonrobust features and domain-specific features. The extensive experiments on five widely used datasets with different attacks demonstrate that robust features obtained from our model improve the model’s adversarial robustness compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the trained domain discriminator is able to identify the domain-specific features from the clean images and AEs almost perfectly. This enables AE detection without incurring additional computational costs. With that, we can also specify different classifiers for clean images and AEs, thereby avoiding any drop in clean image accuracy.},

  abstract     = {For underactuated robots working in complex environments, an important objective is to drive all variables (particularly for unactuated end-effectors) to move along the specific path and restrict positions/velocities to avoid obstacles, rather than using only point-to-point control. Unfortunately, most path planning methods are only suitable to fully actuated systems or depend on linearized models. The main motivations of our work are to directly fulfill motion constraints and achieve path following for both actuated and unactuated states (e.g., payload swing of cranes) when lacking effective control inputs. To this end, this article presents a new time-optimal trajectory planning-based motion control method for general underactuated robots. By constructing auxiliary signals (in Cartesian space) to express all actuated/unactuated variables (in joint space), their position/velocity constraints are converted into some convex/nonconvex inequalities related to a to-be-optimized path parameter and its derivatives. Then, an optimization algorithm is constructed to solve the available path parameter and derive a group of time-optimal trajectories for actuated states. As we know, this is the first study to ensure path following and necessary full-state constraints for actuated/unactuated states. Then, a tradeoff among path-constrained motions, time optimization, and state constraints is achieved together. This article takes the rotary crane as an example and provides detailed analysis of calculating desired trajectories based on the proposed planning frame, whose effectiveness is also verified through hardware experiments.},

Then, the adaptive dynamic programming method with concurrent learning is proposed to approximate the Pareto optimal strategies wherein both current and historical data are utilized. To further lessen the consumptions of computation/communication resources, the DETM is integrated into the adaptive algorithm framework which can avoid Zeno phenomena.

  abstract     = {Ensuring robust and precise tracking control in the presence of uncertain multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) system dynamics and environmental variations is a significant challenge in the field of robust and adaptive control theory. While fuzzy control strategies have demonstrated good tracking performance in normal conditions, designing and tuning fuzzy controllers can be a challenging task in highly uncertain environments. In this study, we investigate a novel approach that combines robust nonlinear negative-imaginary (NI) systems theory with a self-adaptive fuzzy control scheme and the Lyapunov synthesis to develop a robust adaptive negative-imaginary-fuzzy (RANIF) control scheme. We optimize the critical parameters of the proposed fuzzy system using a self-tuning technique with a proportional–derivative sliding manifold. Furthermore, unlike the existing adaptive fuzzy control methods, we propose a small number of membership functions and systematically derive the fuzzy rules by employing Lyapunov, nonlinear NI, and dissipativity theories, which simplify the tuning process, work out the matter of “explosion of complexity,” and reduce computational complexity. We demonstrate the global stability of the closed-loop system using nonlinear NI theory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we present simulation results for two examples involving uncertain MIMO second-order Euler–Lagrange systems. These systems, known for their capacity to represent a diverse range of practical physical systems, serve as suitable testbeds for our methodology. Our results show that RANIF outperforms other control methods, such as nonlinear strictly NI-Fuzzy, fuzzy-logic control, model predictive control, and conventional PID control, in terms of robustness to disturbances and inestimable faults, trajectory tracking performance, and computational complexity.},

First of all, the mathematical expression of the control inputs in the considered system is given by introducing the models of the above two types of actuator failures. Following, two classes of synchronization strategies, which are state feedback control strategies and event-triggered control strategies, are proposed by using some inequality techniques and Lyapunov stability theories. The designed controllers can, respectively, guarantee the realization of synchronizations of the global exponential, the finite-time and the fixed-time for the MNNs by selecting different parameter conditions. Then the estimations of settling times of provided synchronization schemes are computed and the Zeno phenomenon of proposed event-triggered strategies is explicitly excluded.

Among the promising solutions provided for such scenarios, the application of unmanned vehicles has attracted ever more attention. However, such scenarios are often very complex, while the existing studies have not fully addressed the trajectory optimization problem of multiple unmanned ground vehicles (multi-UGVs) against the scenario. This study focuses on multi-UGVs trajectory optimization in the sight of first aid supply delivery tasks in mass accidents. A two-stage completely decoupling fuzzy multiobjective optimization strategy is designed. On the first stage, with the proposed timescale involved tridimensional tunneled collision-free trajectory (TITTCT) algorithm, collision-free coarse tunnels are build within a tridimensional coordinate system, respectively, for the UGVs as the corresponding configuration space for a further multiobjective optimization. On the second stage, a fuzzy multiobjective transcription method is designed to solve the decoupled optimal control problem (OCP) within the configuration space with the consideration of priority constrains. Following the two-stage design, the computational time is significantly reduced when achieving an optimal solution of the multi-UGV trajectory planning, which is crucial in a first aid task. In addition, other objectives are optimized with the aspiration level reflected. Simulation studies and experiments have been curried out to testify the effectiveness and the improved computational performance of the proposed design.},

The uncertain nonlinear systems are characterized as the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model, and IT2 membership functions are employed to effectively handle uncertainties. A fuzzy observer, utilizing only sampled-output measurements, is applied to simultaneously estimate actuator faults and system states. Based on the estimation, the fault-tolerant controller is designed to ensure the system stability under a predefined $H_{\infty }$ performance. The sampling behavior complicates the system dynamics and makes the integrated FTC design more challenging. To confront this issue, the discontinuous Lyapunov functional technique is exploited to enhance stability results by considering the sampling characteristic, upon which FE and FTC units are co-designed in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework. To further relax stability criteria, the analysis process incorporates the bound information of membership functions through the membership-function-dependent (MFD) method. Additionally, the relationship of mismatched premise variables resulting from the sampling scheme is also taken into account. Moreover, considering the imperfect premise matching (IPM) framework, the proposed fault-tolerant controller provides greater flexibility in selecting the shapes of membership functions and number of fuzzy rules that can vary from the counterpart of the fuzzy system. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed FTC technique is validated through a detailed numerical example.},

The control requirements are achieved based on the multiconstraints which contain three layers: 1) prescribed performance functions (PPFs); 2) actual constraints; and 3) virtual constraints. The errors remain within the prescribed small neighborhood of zero by using the PPFs, the error constraints ensure that the time-varying constraints are never violated even if the PPFs are not available, and the virtual constraints are applied in a new time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) to design virtual controllers and controller to solve the singularity problem of the traditional TVBLF.

  abstract     = {Segmenting polyps from colonoscopy images is very important in clinical practice since it provides valuable information for colorectal cancer. However, polyp segmentation remains a challenging task as polyps have camouflage properties and vary greatly in size. Although many polyp segmentation methods have been recently proposed and produced remarkable results, most of them cannot yield stable results due to the lack of features with distinguishing properties and those with high-level semantic details. Therefore, we proposed a novel polyp segmentation framework called contrastive Transformer network (CTNet), with three key components of contrastive Transformer backbone, self-multiscale interaction module (SMIM), and collection information module (CIM), which has excellent learning and generalization abilities. The long-range dependence and highly structured feature map space obtained by CTNet through contrastive Transformer can effectively localize polyps with camouflage properties. CTNet benefits from the multiscale information and high-resolution feature maps with high-level semantic obtained by SMIM and CIM, respectively, and thus can obtain accurate segmentation results for polyps of different sizes. Without bells and whistles, CTNet yields significant gains of 2.3%, 3.7%, 3.7%, 18.2%, and 10.1% over classical method PraNet on Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, Endoscene, ETIS-LaribPolypDB, and CVC-ColonDB respectively. In addition, CTNet has advantages in camouflaged object detection and defect detection. The code is available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/CTNet .},

The detection of addiction-related brain connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a critical step in study of this mechanism. However, it is challenging to accurately estimate addiction-related brain connectivity due to the low-signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI and the issue of small sample size. In this work, a prior-embedding graph generative adversarial network (PG-GAN) is proposed to capture addiction-related brain connectivity accurately. By designing a dual-generator-based scheme, the addiction-related connectivity generator is employed to learn the feature map of addiction connection, while the reconstruction generator is used for sample reconstruction. Moreover, a bidirectional mapping mechanism is designed to maintain the consistency of sample distribution in the latent space so that addiction-related brain connectivity can be estimated more accurately. The proposed model utilizes prior knowledge embeddings to reduce the search space so that the model can better understand the latent distribution for the issue of small sample size. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PG-GAN.},

  abstract     = {The use of nonideal communication networks makes communication constraints become a topical issue in the research of dc microgrids. How to design a distributed secondary control scheme for voltage recovery and accurate current sharing in islanded dc microgrids subject to communication constraints is of interest in this article. In order to restore the bus voltage to the rated value, a nonlinear element is first introduced into the primary control layer. Then, the closed-loop system of primary control is modeled as a data-driven time-varying linear system. Based on the established model, considering communication constraints, a distributed secondary predictive control strategy is developed to achieve accurate current sharing. While actively compensating for network delays and packet losses, the proposed method renders mathematical physical models unnecessary for the traditional predictive control, and simultaneously completes the multitask in dc microgrids. Finally, several case studies are conducted on a hardware microgrid experimental platform, which not only verifies the effectiveness of the designed data-driven predictive control strategy but also tests microgrid properties such as the plug-and-play ability.},

The local quantum operation is designed based on the Hamiltonian by using the local information of each quantum system in a network of qubits. We construct the unitary transformation for each quantum system to achieve the partial quantum consensus, that is, the directions of the quantum states in the Bloch ball will reach an agreement. A simple case of two-qubit quantum systems is considered first, and a minimum completing time of reaching partial consensus is obtained based on the geometric configuration of each qubit. Furthermore, we extend the approaches to deal with the more general $N$ -qubit networks. Two partial quantum consensus protocols, based on the Lyapunov method for chain graphs and the geometry method for connected graphs, are proposed. The geometry method can be utilized to deal with more general connected graphs, while for the Lyapunov method, the global consensus can be obtained. The numerical simulation over a qubit network is demonstrated to verify the validity and the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

A resilient neuroadaptive distributed fixed-time control scheme is investigated to solve this challenging problem. First, an improved adaptive distributed observer is established for followers to estimate the states of the leader when considering communication link faults. The proposed observer improves the resilience against communication link faults. Subsequently, to further cope with the problem of actuator faults, inertial uncertainties, and external disturbances, based on the proposed observer and the technique of adding a power integrator, a neuroadaptive distributed fixed-time attitude coordination controller is developed. Unlike the existing controllers, the proposed one requires less information when dealing with faults and lumped uncertainties, and has a lower-computational cost. Moreover, the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system is ensured under the designed resilient neuroadaptive distributed control scheme.

To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a novel scalable and reliable control scheme for dc microgrids. Initially, a general model for dc microgrids is established to enhance reliability, considering scenarios involving loss of control effectiveness (LoCE) and offset faults. Subsequently, a structured free-weight matrix technique is introduced to mitigate negative coupling effects of power lines, and to address numerical infeasibility by avoiding the assumption about the Lyapunov matrix. Furthermore, the stability of the entire dc microgrid is guaranteed by checking local agent conditions, independently of power line couplings. Therefore, the proposed control scheme ensures plug-and-play scalability with varying number of agents. Finally, theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox.},

  abstract     = {Image compressed sensing (ICS) has been extensively applied in various imaging domains due to its capability to sample and reconstruct images at subNyquist sampling rates. The current predominant approaches in ICS, specifically pure convolutional networks (ConvNets)-based ICS methods, have demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing local features for image recovery. Simultaneously, the Transformer architecture has gained significant attention due to its capability to model global correlations among image features. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel hybrid network for ICS, named MTC-CSNet, which effectively combines the strengths of both ConvNets and Transformer architectures in capturing local and global image features to achieve high-quality image recovery. Particularly, MTC-CSNet is a dual-path framework that consists of a ConvNets-based recovery branch and a Transformer-based recovery branch. Along the ConvNets-based recovery branch, we design a lightweight scheme to capture the local features in natural images. Meanwhile, we implement a Transformer-based recovery branch to iteratively model the global dependencies among image patches. Ultimately, the ConvNets-based and Transformer-based recovery branches collaborate through a bridging unit, facilitating the adaptive transmission and fusion of informative features for image reconstruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MTC-CSNet surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on various public datasets. The code and models are publicly available at MTC-CSNet.},

The approach is comprised of two main complementary learning algorithms that enhance the prediction and generalization capabilities: 1) a standard reservoir computing scheme for high-dimensional encoding exploitation and 2) a nonlinear control scheme that gives a physical feedback to the reservoir weights to ensure the prediction error is minimized. The nonlinear control scheme is modeled by the prediction error dynamics and a feedback linearization controller. Two different PIRC schemes are proposed which preserve the reservoir properties and enhance the prediction robustness. Lyapunov stability theory is used to verify the boundedness and convergence of the proposed algorithms. Simulation studies and comparisons are given to verify the proposed approach.},

To improve the network resource efficiency, a multidomain probabilistic event-triggered mechanism (MDPETM) is proposed. The mode mismatched phenomenon is modeled based on the switching delay information between the controller mode and the system mode. To extract the true signal generated by the MDPETM, a virtual delay concept is developed. The constraint that the controller and the system must have the same premise variables is removed. Based on the MDPETM, mismatched fuzzy state feedback controllers are first devised which may not share the same modes with the system. Then, by establishing fuzzy basis and controller mode-dependent Lyapunov functionals, sufficient criteria free of nonlinear terms existing in the literature are derived, which ensure the ED-FTB of the closed-loop system under admissible delays and deception attacks. Finally, an application-oriented one-link robotic arm system is utilized to validate the theoretical results.},

Moreover, existing results consider consensus among normal nodes in only one of the two states, with the other state converging to either zero or a predefined value. In this article, a distributed control algorithm capable of withstanding both locally bounded and totally bounded Byzantine misbehavior is proposed. When employing the proposed algorithm, the normal nodes use a combination of the two relative state values obtained from their neighboring nodes to decide which neighbors should be ignored.

This study proposes a simple IK calculation scheme for an industrial serial manipulator. The proposed technique can calculate appropriate values of the joint variables to realize the desired end-effector position and orientation while considering the motion costs of each joint. Two scalar functions are defined for the joint variables: one is to evaluate the end-effector position and orientation, whereas the other is to evaluate the motion efficiency of the joints. By combining the two scalar functions, the IK calculation of the manipulator is formulated as a numerical optimization problem. Furthermore, a simple algorithm for solving the IK via the aforementioned optimization is constructed on the basis of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with a norm-limited update vector (NLSPSA). The proposed scheme considers not only the accuracy of the position and orientation of the end-effector but also the efficiency of the robot movement. Therefore, it yields a practical result of the inverse problem. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement owing to the high-calculation efficiency of NLSPSA. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical examples using a redundant manipulator.},

These PG methods can be categorized into single-stage and multistage approaches. Single-stage methods are faster but less accurate, while multistage methods offer high accuracy at the expense of time efficiency. To address this issue, a novel end-to-end PG method called efficient PG network (EPGNet) is proposed in this article. EPGNet achieves both high accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. To optimize performance with fewer parameters, EfficientNet-B0 is used as the backbone of EPGNet. Additionally, a novel cross-fusion module is introduced to enhance network performance in robotic PG tasks. This module fuses and utilizes local and global features, aiding the network in handling objects of varying sizes in different scenes. EPGNet consists of two branches dedicated to predicting PG actions, respectively. Both branches are trained simultaneously within a Q-learning framework. Training data is collected through trial and error, involving the robot performing PG actions. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, a unique PG dataset is proposed. Additionally, a YOLACT network is trained on the PG dataset to facilitate object detection and segmentation. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted in simulated environments and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that EPGNet outperforms single-stage methods and offers competitive performance compared to multistage methods, all while utilizing fewer parameters.

  abstract     = {A novel fuzzy adaptive knowledge-based inference neural network (FAKINN) is proposed in this study. Conventional fuzzy cluster-based neural networks (FCBNNs) suffer from the challenge of a direct extraction of fuzzy rules that can capture and represent the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity when the data possess complex structures. Moreover, the capability of the cluster-based rule generator in FCBNNs may decrease with the increase of data dimensionality. These drawbacks impede the generation of desired fuzzy rules, and affect the inference results depending on the fuzzy rules, thereby limiting their generalization ability. To address these drawbacks, an adaptive knowledge generator (AKG), consisting of the observation paradigm (OP) and clustering strategy (CS), is effectively designed to improve the generalization ability in FAKINN. The OP distills the characteristic information (CI) from data to highlight the homogeneity and heterogeneity of objects, and the CS, viz., the weighted condition-driven fuzzy clustering method (WCFCM), is proposed to summarize the CI to construct fuzzy rules. Moreover, the feedback between the OP and CS can control the dimensionality of CI, which endows FAKINN with the potential to tackle high-dimensional data. The main originality of the study focuses on the AKG and WCFCM that are proposed to develop the structural design methodology of FNNs. The performance of FAKINN is evaluated on various benchmarks with 27 comparative methods, and two real-world problems are adopted to validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that FAKINN outperforms the comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {This article studies Lyapunov stability for nonlinear systems based on discrete-time self-triggered impulsive control (STIC). With the help of comparison approach, some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions guaranteeing nonZeno behavior and global asymptotic stability of nonlinear systems under STIC are derived. Different from the existing self-triggered mechanisms using implicit expressions to compute the next impulse instant, which may result in computational burden, we propose a novel discrete-time self-triggered mechanism (STM) by which the next impulse instant can be predicted directly by the information of the comparison system. Moreover, the resulting algorithm is easy to be implemented. It is shown that the designed STIC strategy can not only achieve a tradeoff between computational complexity, communication resource usage and control performance, but also has strong robustness and flexibility. Finally, an illustrative simulation is provided showing the effectiveness of the results.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to analyze $H_{\infty }$ stability of a class of networked control systems (NCSs) under random denial of service (DoS) attacks and design a sampled-data-based state feedback security controller to mitigate the influence of attacks. Different from the existing random attacks, the information about the maximum duration time of DoS attacks can be captured by introducing a predesigned logical processor. Then, based on the periodic sampling technique, the probability of attack occurrence and the resultant number of maximum allowable consecutive packet dropouts can be calculated, which is quite significant to investigating the security problem of NCSs. A DoS-dependent security controller which makes full use of the attack probability information and the number of attack-induced packet dropouts is designed. A novel networked sampled-data system model is first established that enables us to deal with the random DoS attacks phenomena and the time-varying delay induced by attacks under a uniform framework. By structuring a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, the relationship between mean square asymptotic stability and attack characteristics is obtained. Finally, the reliability and applicability of the presented control strategy in eliminating the influence of DoS attacks are validated by two practical engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Microwave cavity filters are essential electromechanical coupling devices in communication systems. Structural-parameter tuning by experienced operators improves the filter performance but is demanding and time-consuming. The automatic tuning method has received extensive research attentions using data-driven modeling approaches. However, two main issues affect the accuracy and efficiency of the model construction: 1) features of tuning processes, as model inputs, have limited adaptability and extraction accuracy to different resonant states and 2) models require plentiful training data and the training process is time-consuming. Thus, dynamic hybrid models are developed in this study with self-selected inputs, self-organized samples, and a self-learning structure. First, spatial features are extracted to flexibly depict the tuning characteristic, and double-domain (spatial or circuital) features are selected adaptively to accommodate distinct resonance states. Second, a trustworthiness-curiosity-driven active sampling method is exploited to attain fewer and better-training data. Third, an improved glsms broad learning system acrlong BLS is developed using new modules of incremental node calculation and weight pruning, characterized by more lightweight and flexible structures. The proposed method is effective and flexible demonstrated by simulations and experiments, and the tuning task of microwave cavity filters is fulfilled in a more accurate and efficient manner.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) empowers fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) with the ability to infer, even when presented with a sparse rule base where no direct rules are applicable to a given observation. The core principle lies in creating an intermediate fuzzy rule—either interpolated or extrapolated—derived from rules neighboring the observation. Conventionally, the selection of these rules hinges upon distance metrics. While this approach is easy to grasp and has been instrumental in the evolution of various FRI methods, it is burdened by the necessity of extensive distance calculations. This becomes particularly cumbersome when swift responses are imperative or when dealing with large datasets. This article introduces a groundbreaking rule-ranking-based FRI method, termed RT-FRI, which overcomes the constraints of the longstanding distance-centric FRI approach. Instead of relying on distances, RT-FRI harnesses ranking scores for rules and unmatched observation. These scores are produced by amalgamating the antecedent attributes using aggregation functions, thus streamlining the rule selection procedure. Recognizing the rigid monotonicity demands of aggregation functions, a variant—DMRT-FRI—has been introduced to ensure directional monotonicity. Experimental results indicate that RT-FRI emerges as a highly efficient technique, with DMRT-FRI exemplifying a notable balance of accuracy and efficiency.},

To tackle this issue, we propose When to Explore (WToE), a simple yet effective variational exploration method to learn WToE under nonstationary environments. WToE employs an interaction-oriented adaptive exploration mechanism to adapt to environmental changes. We first propose a novel graphical model that uses a latent random variable to model the step-level environmental change resulting from interaction effects. Leveraging this graphical model, we employ the supervised variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework to derive a short-term inferred policy from historical trajectories to deal with the nonstationarity. Finally, agents engage in exploration when the short-term inferred policy diverges from the current actor policy. The proposed approach theoretically guarantees the convergence of the $Q$ -value function. In our experiments, we validate our exploration mechanism in grid examples, multiagent particle environments and the battle game of MAgent environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of WToE over multiple baselines and existing exploration methods, such as MAEXQ, NoisyNets, EITI, and PR2.},

Abundant artificial test problems are carrying out to test the performance of $\mu $ MOEA. Through various experiments, it can be found that $\mu $ MOEA has outstanding performance in ZDT, DTLZ, SMOP, and MaF problems.

Although existing works have introduced the knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) into VQA, there are still some limitations that hinder the full exploitation of HVS, including incomplete modeling with few HVS characteristics and insufficient connection among these characteristics. In this article, we present a novel spatial–temporal VQA method termed HVS-5M, wherein we design five modules to simulate five characteristics of HVS and create a bioinspired connection among these modules in a cooperative manner. Specifically, on the side of the spatial domain, the visual saliency module first extracts a saliency map. Then, the content-dependency and the edge masking modules extract the content and edge features, respectively, which are both weighted by the saliency map to highlight those regions that human beings may be interested in. On the other side of the temporal domain, the motion perception module extracts the dynamic temporal features. Besides, the temporal hysteresis module simulates the memory mechanism of human beings and comprehensively evaluates the video quality according to the fusion features from the spatial and temporal domains. Extensive experiments show that our HVS-5M outperforms the state-of-the-art VQA methods. Ablation studies are further conducted to verify the effectiveness of each module toward the proposed method.

Furthermore, in view of the time-varying dynamics of actual WWTP, a recursive bilinear subspace identification method based on sliding window is adopted to establish the optimization models as well as the constraint models with self-learning parameter, which provides accurate model guarantee for high-performance multiobjective operation optimization.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA), which transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, has attracted tremendous attention in many machine learning applications. Recently, there have been attempts to apply domain adaption for sensor time series data, such as human activity recognition and gesture recognition. However, existing methods suffer from some drawbacks that hinder further performance improvement. They often require access to source data or source models during training, which is unavailable in some fields because of privacy protection and storage limit. Typically, the source domains may only provide an application programming interface (API) for the target domain to call. On the other hand, current UDA methods have not considered the temporal consistency and low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensor time series. To address the challenges, this article presents a black-box domain adaption framework for sensor time series data (B2TSDA). First, we propose a single/multi-source teacher–student learning framework to distill the knowledge from the source domains to a customized target model. Then we design a new temporal consistency loss by combining an adaptive mask method and dynamic threshold method to maintain consistent temporal information and balance the learning difficulties of different classes. For the multisource black-box domain adaption, we further propose a Shapley-enhanced method to determine the contribution of each source domain. Experimental results on both single-source and multisource domain adaption show that our framework has superior performance compared to other black-box UDA methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the application of function approximators, such as neural networks and polynomials, has ushered in a new stage of development in solving optimal control problems. However, considering the existence of approximation errors, the stability of the controlled system cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, in view of the prevalence of approximation errors, we investigate optimal tracking control problems for discrete-time systems. First, a novel value function is introduced into the intelligent critic framework. Second, an implicit method is utilized to demonstrate the boundedness of the iterative value functions with approximation errors. An explicit method is applied to prove the stability of the system with approximation errors. Furthermore, an evolving policy is designed to iteratively tackle the optimal tracking control problem and demonstrate the stability of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is verified through numerical as well as practical examples.},

To address this problem, this article develops a novel consensus-based optimal coordination protocol and a robust controller, which adopts a hierarchical architecture. On the top layer, the spherical coordinate transform is introduced to tackle the nonholonomic constraint, and then a distributed optimal motion coordination strategy is developed. As a result, the optimal formation tracking of UUVs fleet can be achieved, and the constraints are fulfilled. To realize the generated optimal commands better and, meanwhile, deal with the underactuation, at the lower-level control loop a neurodynamics-based robust backstepping controller is designed, and in particular, the issue of “explosion of terms” appearing in conventional backstepping-based controllers is avoided and control activities are improved. The stability of the overall UUVs formation system is established to ensure that all the states of the UUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of unknown disturbances. Finally, extensive simulation comparisons are made to illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the derived optimal formation tracking protocol.},

However, these approaches typically struggle to extract valuable features from low-luminance images, which often exhibit blurriness and dim appearence, leading to detection failures. To overcome this issue, we introduce an innovative unsupervised feature domain knowledge distillation (KD) framework. The proposed framework enhances the generalization capability of neural networks across both low- and high-luminance domains without incurring additional computational costs during testing. This improvement is made possible through the integration of generative adversarial networks and our proposed unsupervised KD process. Furthermore, we introduce a region-based multiscale discriminator designed to discern feature domain discrepancies at the object level rather than from the global context. This bolsters the joint learning process of object detection and feature domain distillation tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments shown that the proposed method, empowered by the region-based multiscale discriminator and the unsupervised feature domain distillation process, can effectively extract beneficial features from low-luminance images, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches in both low- and sufficient-luminance domains.},

To improve the efficiency of the dynamic triggering law, a mixed triggering threshold is designed with a resilient function integrated to further enlarge interevent intervals. Within the proposed DETC protocol, the computational cost is significantly reduced especially for MASs with nonsparse and high-dimensional agent system matrices. In addition, for each individual agent, the states of neighboring agents used for triggering detections or controller updates are required in an on-demand (instead of continuous) way, which preserves communication resources and facilitates practical implementation. The feasibility of the designed DETC protocol is corroborated by rigorous theoretical analysis on consensus convergence and Zeno behavior exclusion.

This article introduces an innovative approach that merges modern control theory with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to bridge the gap among multiscale discrete information. Specifically, the macroscopic point-to-point trajectory is formulated as an optimal control problem with fixed terminal time and state, and it is iteratively solved using the direct dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm. Additionally, SNN is utilized to simulate microscale neural activities in the premotor cortex, employing the product of the weighted adjacency matrix and the mesoscale firing rate to approximate the macroscopic trajectory. The error between actual macroscale behavior and the preceding approximation is then used to update the weighted adjacency matrix through the recursive least square (RLS) method. Analysis and simulation of various tasks, including low-dimensional point-to-point tasks, high-dimensional complex Lorenz systems, and center-out-and-back tasks, verify the feasibility and interpretability of our method in processing multiscale signals ranging from spiking neurons to motion trajectory through the integration of SNN and control theory.},

Based on the DETM, a distributed consensus control protocol is designed under fading channels. Then, sufficient criteria are provided to ensure that MASs can achieve the leaser-following consensus, and satisfy the $H_{\infty }$ performance index in the presence of fading channels. The desired controller parameters can be derived in terms of solutions of matrix inequalities that are lightly solvable.

Considering two different time-scale characteristics of the hydraulic and thermal processes in the SHN, this article proposes a mechanism and data-driven dual estimation method for the coupling hydraulic–thermal dynamic states. Due to the fact that the existing coupled estimation methods with one time scale may suffer from heavy computational burden, a data-driven dual sequential acrlong DSE method of the SHN is proposed based on the two-time scales, in which the dynamics of slow thermal states can also be captured when performing the acrlong SE of the fast hydraulic process. Furthermore, to improve the computational and communicational efficiency, a distributed interaction strategy based on the nodal transformation matrix is designed for large-scale steam systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a single pipeline system and two real-world industrial superheated steam networks are employed. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves the best tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

This work proposes a city/customer-centric model called cumulative capacitated CTSP (C2-CTSP) to tackle some practical problems with fast response requirements. Its hypergraph and mathematical programming formulations are developed for the first time. A general variable neighborhood search (GVNS) metaheuristic is designed to solve it. Specifically, greedy backtracking is proposed to initialize a solution taking into account the cumulative cost and two constraints including colors and capacities. Next, 2-swap, reinsertion, and double-bridge operations are randomly selected and carried out to execute the perturbation. Moreover, neighborhood-list-2-opt, relocation move, and generalized partition crossover are organized as variable neighborhood descent to constitute the local search for better solutions. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed GVNS with four genetic algorithms, two hybrid ant colony systems, two variable neighborhood search methods, and a perturb-based local search in 20 regular and random cases. The statistical results demonstrate that GVNS is superior to all competitors tuned by irace package in terms of both search ability and convergence rate. In addition, the study of six GVNS variants lacking different operators validates the significant role of each corresponding operator in GVNS’s outstanding performance.},

  abstract     = {Mode collapse has been a persisting challenge in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and it directly affects the applications of GAN in many domains. Existing works that attempt to solve this problem have some serious limitations: models using optimal transport (OT) strategies (e.g., Wasserstein distance) lead to vanishing or exploding gradients; increasing the number of generators can cause several generators focusing on the same mode; and approaches that modify the loss also do not satisfactorily resolve mode collapse. In this article, we reduce mode collapse by formulating it as a Monge problem of OT map. We show that the Monge problem can be transformed to the distribution transformation problem in GAN, and a rectified affine neural network can be considered as a measurable function. In this way, we propose Monge GAN that uses this measurable function to transform the generated data distribution into the original data distribution. We utilize the Kantorovich formulation to obtain the OT cost, which is regarded as the OT distance between the two distributions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both image and numerical datasets to validate our Monge GAN in reducing model collapse.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction (DR) targets to learn low-dimensional representations for improving discriminability of data, which is essential for many downstream machine learning tasks, such as image classification, information clustering, etc. Non-Gaussian issue as a long-standing challenge brings many obstacles to the applications of DR methods that established on Gaussian assumption. The mainstream way to address above issue is to explore the local structure of data via graph learning technique, the methods based on which however suffer from a common weakness, that is, exploring locality through pairwise points causes the optimal graph and subspace are difficult to be found, degrades the performance of downstream tasks, and also increases the computation complexity. In this article, we first propose a novel self-evolution bipartite graph (SEBG) that uses anchor points as the landmark of subclasses, and learns anchor-based rather than pairwise relationships for improving the efficiency of locality exploration. In addition, we develop an efficient local coherent structure learning (ELCS) algorithm based on SEBG, which possesses the ability of updating the edges of graph in learned subspace automatically. Finally, we also provide a multivariable iterative optimization algorithm to solve proposed problem with strict theoretical proofs. Extensive experiments have verified the superiorities of the proposed method compared to related SOTA methods in terms of performance and efficiency on several real-world benchmarks and large-scale image datasets with deep features.},

  abstract     = {It is an interesting open problem to enable robots to efficiently and effectively learn long-horizon manipulation skills. Motivated to augment robot learning via more effective exploration, this work develops task-driven reinforcement learning with action primitives (TRAPs), a new manipulation skill learning framework that augments standard reinforcement learning algorithms with formal methods and parameterized action space (PAS). In particular, TRAPs uses linear temporal logic (LTL) to specify complex manipulation skills. LTL progression, a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, is then used to decompose the training task at an abstract level, informs the robot about their current task progress, and guides them via reward functions. The PAS, a predefined library of heterogeneous action primitives, further improves the efficiency of robot exploration. We highlight that TRAPs augments the learning of manipulation skills in both learning efficiency and effectiveness (i.e., task constraints). Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that TRAPs outperforms most existing methods.},

In this article, we study a more general case where the dynamics of agents are unknown, nonlinear, nonaffine, and heterogeneous, and the communication topologies can be iteration-varying. More specifically, we first apply the controller-based dynamic linearization method in the iteration domain to obtain a parametric learning controller using only the local input–output data collected from neighboring agents in a directed graph, and then propose a data-driven distributed adaptive iterative learning control (DAILC) method through the parameter-adaptive learning methods. We show that for each time instant, the tracking error is ultimately bounded in the iteration domain for both of the cases with iteration-invariant and iteration-varying communication topologies. The simulation results show that the proposed DAILC method has faster convergence speed, higher tracking accuracy, and more robust learning and tracking in comparison with a typical DAILC method.},

  abstract     = {The goal of constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization is to obtain a set of well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. To achieve this goal, a delicate tradeoff must be struck among feasibility, diversity, and convergence. However, balancing these three elements simultaneously through a single tradeoff model is nontrivial, mainly because the significance of each element varies in different evolutionary phases. As an alternative approach, we adapt distinct tradeoff models in various phases and introduce a novel algorithm named adaptive tradeoff model with reference points (ATM-R). In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between diversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward feasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase, ATM-R promotes the transition from “the tradeoff between feasibility and diversity” to “the tradeoff between diversity and convergence.” This transition is instrumental in discovering an adequate number of feasible regions and accelerating the search for feasible Pareto optima in succession. In the feasible phase, ATM-R places an emphasis on balancing diversity and convergence to obtain a set of feasible solutions that are both well-converged and well-distributed. It is worth noting that the merits of reference points are leveraged in ATM-R to accomplish these tradeoff models. Also, in ATM-R, a multiphase mating selection strategy is developed to generate promising solutions beneficial to different evolutionary phases. Systemic experiments on a diverse set of benchmark test functions and real-world problems demonstrate that ATM-R is effective. When compared to eight state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms, ATM-R consistently demonstrates its competitive performance.},

In this study, we propose a safety-oriented speed tracking control algorithm for wheelchair systems that accounts for external disturbances and uncertain parameters at the dynamic level. We employ a set-membership approach to estimate uncertain parameters online in deterministic sets. Additionally, we present a model predictive control scheme with real-time adaptation of the system model and controller parameters to ensure safety-related constraint satisfaction during the tracking process. This proposed controller effectively guides the wheelchair speed toward the desired reference while maintaining safety constraints. In cases where the reference is inadmissible and violates constraints, the controller can navigate the system to the vicinity of the nearest admissible reference. The efficiency of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through high-fidelity speed tracking results from two tasks involving both admissible and inadmissible references.},

Second, under the time interval sequence, two types of path conditions are constructed for designing switching schemes.

  abstract     = {Completing low-rank matrices from subsampled measurements has received much attention in the past decade. Existing works indicate that $\mathcal {O}(nr\log ^{2}(n))$ datums are required to theoretically secure the completion of an $n \times n$ noisy matrix of rank $r$ with high probability, under some quite restrictive assumptions: 1) the underlying matrix must be incoherent and 2) observations follow the uniform distribution. The restrictiveness is partially due to ignoring the roles of the leverage score and the oracle information of each element. In this article, we employ the leverage scores to characterize the importance of each element and significantly relax assumptions to: 1) not any other structure assumptions are imposed on the underlying low-rank matrix and 2) elements being observed are appropriately dependent on their importance via the leverage score. Under these assumptions, instead of uniform sampling, we devise an ununiform/biased sampling procedure that can reveal the “importance” of each observed element. Our proofs are supported by a novel approach that phrases sufficient optimality conditions based on the Golfing scheme, which would be of independent interest to the wider areas. Theoretical findings show that we can provably recover an unknown $n\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ from just about $\mathcal {O}(nr\log ^{2} (n))$ entries, even when the observed entries are corrupted with a small amount of noisy information.

Necessary and/or sufficient controllability conditions are proposed and validated by numerical and practical examples, requiring less computation than the classic Kalman criterion. Single-rate and multirate sampling patterns are analyzed, showing that adjusting the sampling rate of local channels can affect the controllability of the overall system. It is shown that the pathological sampling of single-node systems can be eliminated by an appropriate design of interlayer structures and inner couplings. In the case of systems with drive–response mode, the overall system may not lose controllability even when the response layer is uncontrollable.

  abstract     = {The federated learning (FL) paradigm aims to distribute the computational burden of the training process among several computation units, usually called agents or workers, while preserving private local training datasets. This is generally achieved by resorting to a server–worker architecture where agents iteratively update local models and communicate local parameters to a server that aggregates and returns them to the agents. However, the presence of adversarial agents, which may intentionally exchange malicious parameters or may have corrupted local datasets, can jeopardize the FL process. Therefore, we propose selective trimmed average (SETA), which is a resilient algorithm to cope with the undesirable effects of a number of misbehaving agents in the global model. SETA is based on properly filtering and combining the exchanged parameters. We mathematically prove that the proposed algorithm is resilient against data and local model poisoning attacks. Most resilient methods presented so far in the literature assume that a trusted server is in hand. In contrast, our algorithm works both in server–worker and shared memory architectures, where the latter excludes the necessity of a trusted server. The theoretical findings are corroborated through numerical results on MNIST dataset and on multiclass weather dataset (MWD).},

To enhance controller design, the systems are categorized into two groups: 1) input-dimension-dominant and 2) state-dimension-dominant, based on signal dimensions and their potential for achieving thorough time-synchronized convergence. We explore sufficient Lyapunov conditions using terminal sliding-mode designs and develop adaptive controllers for the input-dimension-dominant case. To handle perturbations, we design a multivariable disturbance observer with a super-twisting structure, which is integrated into the controller. By utilizing the sliding-mode technique and the disturbance observer, the proposed controller ensures simultaneous convergence of all output dimensions. In the state-dimension-dominant case, where a full-rank system matrix is absent, only specific output elements converge to equilibrium simultaneously. We conduct comparative simulations on a practical system to highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method for the input-dimension-dominant case. Statistical results reveal the benefits of shorter output trajectories and reduced energy consumption. For the state-dimension-dominant case, we present numerical examples to validate the semi-time-synchronized property.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a reconfiguration strategy for the corrective controller achieving model matching control of an input/state asynchronous sequential machine (ASM). The considered controller is vulnerable to permanent faults that degenerate a subset of the controller’s states. If the controller has a certain amount of redundancy in terms of its states, one can build a reconfiguration scheme in which the functionality of degenerated states is taken over by supplementary states. The proposed reconfiguration scheme is superior to conventional methods of fault tolerance with hardware redundancy since the required number of redundant states is much smaller. Hardware experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits are provided to validate the applicability of the proposed scheme. The present study serves as the first research report on the reconfigurable corrective controller.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the event-triggered switching control (ETSC) of switched nonlinear time-delay systems (SNTDSs) with asynchronous switching. First, we study the input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral ISS (iISS) for SNTDSs with asynchronous switching, where switching instants are generated based on the designed event-triggered mechanism. Among existing works on the ETSC, systems behavior at event-triggered instants is neglected. In fact, whenever an event is triggered, the systems mode will jump suddenly such that a switch is imposed to the systems, leading to the change of subsystems. Moreover, asynchronous switching behavior may occur between the actual subsystem and its corresponding controller. These facts bring great challenges for the event-triggered mechanism design and ISS analysis. To tackle these problems, a new Lyapunov-based event-triggered mechanism with adjustable parameters is designed to establish the relationship between systems switches and event triggers, and exclude the Zeno phenomenon. The analysis of the asynchronous switching behavior can be implemented and some ISS and iISS criteria of SNTDSs are derived utilizing the merging switching technique. Finally, two numerical examples, including a practical stirred tank reactor system, are presented to show the validity of the proposed methods.},

The motivation of this article is that the extensive lower level optimization required by each upper level solution consumes too many function evaluations, leading to poor optimization performance of EAs. To this end, during the upper level optimization, the BL-SAEA builds an upper level surrogate model to select several promising upper level solutions for the lower level optimization. Because only a small number of upper level solutions require the lower level optimization, the number of function evaluations can be considerably reduced. During the lower level optimization, the BL-SAEA constructs multiple lower level surrogate models to initialize the population of the lower level optimization, thus further decreasing the number of function evaluations. Experimental results on two widely used benchmarks and two real-world BLOPs demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over six state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Then, this article generates fresh insight into counteracting the effects of uncertainty by developing a novel parallel control system that invokes the formulated virtual control law and an auxiliary variable obtained from the relationship between the solutions of the optimal control problems for the uncertain system and the nominal one.

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering aims to discover the inherent structure of data by fusing multiple views of complementary information. Most existing methods first extract multiple types of handcrafted features and then learn a joint affinity matrix for clustering. The disadvantage of this approach lies in two aspects: 1) multiview relations are not embedded into feature learning and 2) the end-to-end learning manner of deep learning is not suitable for multiview clustering. Even when deep features have been extracted, it is a nontrivial problem to choose a proper backbone for clustering on different datasets. To address these issues, we propose the multiview deep subspace clustering networks (MvDSCNs), which learns a multiview self-representation matrix in an end-to-end manner. The MvDSCN consists of two subnetworks, i.e., a diversity network (Dnet) and a universality network (Unet). A latent space is built using deep convolutional autoencoders, and a self-representation matrix is learned in the latent space using a fully connected layer. Dnet learns view-specific self-representation matrices, whereas Unet learns a common self-representation matrix for all views. To exploit the complementarity of multiview representations, the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced as a diversity regularizer that captures the nonlinear, high-order interview relations. Because different views share the same label space, the self-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by universality regularization. The MvDSCN also unifies multiple backbones to boost clustering performance and avoid the need for model selection. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the MvDSCN.},

  abstract     = {The multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is one of the most widely used evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms. The MFEA implements knowledge transfer among optimization tasks via crossover and mutation operators and it obtains high-quality solutions more efficiently than single-task evolutionary algorithms. Despite the effectiveness of MFEA in solving difficult optimization problems, there is no evidence of population convergence or theoretical explanations of how knowledge transfer increases algorithm performance. To fill this gap, we propose a new MFEA based on diffusion gradient descent (DGD), namely, MFEA-DGD in this article. We prove the convergence of DGD for multiple similar tasks and demonstrate that the local convexity of some tasks can help other tasks escape from local optima via knowledge transfer. Based on this theoretical foundation, we design complementary crossover and mutation operators for the proposed MFEA-DGD. As a result, the evolution population is endowed with a dynamic equation that is similar to DGD, that is, convergence is guaranteed, and the benefit from knowledge transfer is explainable. In addition, a hyper-rectangular search strategy is introduced to allow MFEA-DGD to explore more underdeveloped areas in the unified express space of all tasks and the subspace of each task. The proposed MFEA-DGD is verified experimentally on various multitask optimization problems, and the results demonstrate that MFEA-DGD can converge faster to competitive results compared to state-of-the-art EMT algorithms. We also show the possibility of interpreting the experimental results based on the convexity of different tasks.},

Both the cases with known and unknown control/fault directions are investigated. By properly fusing the techniques of disturbance observers and adaptive compensation, it is shown that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically, no matter the control/fault directions are known or not. In the case of known directions, the proposed control scheme, for the first time, guarantees asymptotic tracking and ${L}_{\infty }$ tracking performance simultaneously in face of disturbances and actuator faults. Moreover, novel Nussbaum functions and a contradiction argument are introduced, which allow the system to have multiple unknown nonidentical control directions and unknown time-varying fault direction.

Second, an event-triggered controller is constructed via intermittent state feedback, making the output of each agent follow the corresponding estimated signal with guaranteed tracking performance. The proposed co-design scheme is of relatively low complexity in structure and cheap in computation since a priori knowledge of system nonlinearities or estimation of their bounds is not required in building the control scheme, and yet neither approximating structures nor adaptive online updating algorithms are needed. It is shown that the output tracking error of each agent is ensured to shrink into a prescribed precision set at an arbitrarily assignable convergence rate, although the plant states and the actuation signal are triggered simultaneously. All the internal signals are uniformly bounded and the occurrence of Zeno behavior is precluded. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified via numerical simulation.},

On the basis of predict technology, the original system is converted into a common $n$ -step-ahead input–output predict model. The predict model causes every estimated neural weight to converge to $n$ different constants using the existing control framework. To solve such a problem, the predict model is further decomposed into $n$ one-step-ahead subsystems, which can be viewed as $n$ independent agents. Subsequently, the distributed cooperative weight adaptive laws are designed by introducing an undirected and connected interconnection topology among subsystems. By constructing the variable relationship between the subsystems and the $n$ -step-ahead predict model, a new internal weight interaction-based neural dynamic LC framework is proposed for the whole closed-loop system, in which estimated weights at different times share their weight knowledge. The proposed framework ensures the ultimately uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system and achieves the excellent control performance. By combining the consensus theory and a cooperative persistent excitation condition, every estimated weight along the neural input orbit is verified to exponentially converge to a close vicinity of a unique ideal constant, rather than $n$ different constants. Consequently, the developed LC framework facilitates constant weights storage, saves the knowledge storage space, and improves the robustness of knowledge utilization. These characteristics are verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the containment control problem in multiagent systems with nonlinear heterogeneous followers and multiple unknown leaders whose dynamics are exclusively known to their neighbors. The primary goal is to ensure the convergence of each follower to the dynamic convex hull spanned by the leaders under the constraints of limited communication resources. To achieve this, this article introduces a modular event-triggered containment control scheme with three modules. The first module, Module I-signal generator, is designed for each follower to generate a reference signal asymptotically entering the dynamic convex hull without relying on follower dynamics. The second module, Module II-event-triggered mechanism, is tailored to save communication resources effectively by determining when to broadcast information based on perturbed system stability and input-to-state stability theories. The third module, Module III-tracking controller, treats each follower as an independent agent and is crafted to track the reference signal generated by Module I using an output regulation approach. It is established that the system achieves containment control without Zeno behavior under the influence of these modules, and the theoretical results are validated through simulation examples, demonstrating the practical validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization is a special type of optimization in which one problem is embedded within another. The bilevel optimization problem (BLOP) of which both levels are multiobjective functions is usually called the multiobjective BLOP (MBLOP). The expensive computation and nested features make it challenging to solve. Most existing studies look for complete lower-level solutions for every upper-level variable. However, not every lower-level solution will participate in the bilevel Pareto-optimal front. Under a limited computational budget, instead of wasting resources to find complete lower-level solutions that may not be in the feasible region or inducible region of the MBLOP, it is better to concentrate on finding the solutions with better performance. Bearing these considerations in mind, we propose a multiobjective bilevel optimization solving routine combined with a knee point driven algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm aims to quickly find feasible solutions considering the lower-level constraints in the first stage and then concentrates the computational resources on finding solutions with better performance. Besides, we develop several multiobjective bilevel test problems with different properties, such as scalable, deceptive, convexity, and (dis)continuous. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is validated on a practical petroleum refining bilevel problem, which involves a multiobjective environmental regulation problem and a petroleum refining operational problem. Comprehensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our presented algorithm in solving MBLOPs.},

Unlike previous RCMIs, the matrix inequality in this article produces a polynomial of any degree in the time-varying delay, which helps to reduce conservatism. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity caused by dealing with the negative definite of the high-degree terms, an improved lemma is presented. Applying the above matrix inequalities and improved negative definiteness condition helps to generate a more relaxed stability criterion for analyzing time-varying DNNs.

  abstract     = {Reconstructing a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HSI) from a low-resolution HSI is significant for many applications, such as remote sensing and aerospace. Most deep learning-based HSI super-resolution methods pay more attention to developing novel network structures but rarely study the HSI super-resolution problem from the perspective of image dynamic evolution. In this article, we propose that the HSI pixel motion during the super-resolution reconstruction process can be analogized to the particle movement in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) field. To this end, we design an SPH network (SPH-Net) for HSI super-resolution in light of the SPH theory. Specifically, we construct a smooth function based on SPH and design a smooth convolution in multiscales to exploit spectral correlation and preserve the spectral information in the super-resolved image. In addition, we apply the SPH approximation method to discretize the Navier–Stokes motion equation into SPH equation form, which can guide the HSI pixel motion in the desired direction during super-resolution reconstruction, thereby producing clear edges in the spatial domain. Experiments on three public hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed SPH-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and visual quality.},

However, current methods typically assume clean training scenarios with accurately labeled samples, which are often unrealistic. The training set can include mislabeled samples, and the robustness to label noises is essential for commonsense reasoning methods to be practical, but this problem remains largely unexplored. This work focuses on commonsense reasoning with mislabeled training samples and makes several technical contributions: 1) we first construct diverse augmentations from knowledge and model, and offer a simple yet effective multiple-choice alignment method to divide the training samples into clean, semi-clean, and unclean parts; 2) we design adaptive label correction methods for the semi-clean and unclean samples to exploit the supervised potential of noisy information; and 3) finally, we extensively test these methods on noisy versions of commonsense reasoning benchmarks (CommonsenseQA and OpenbookQA). Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance robustness and improve overall performance. Furthermore, the proposed method is generally applicable to multiple existing commonsense reasoning frameworks to boost their robustness.

A dual phase performance-guaranteed approach is established. In the first phase, a fully distributed robust filter is constructed for each agent to estimate the desired trajectory with prescribed performance such that the control directions of all agents are allowed to be nonidentical. In the second phase, by establishing a novel lemma regarding Nussbaum function, a new adaptive control protocol is developed for each agent based on backstepping technique, which not only steers the output to track the corresponding estimated signal asymptotically with arbitrarily prescribed transient response but also extends the application scope of the proposed control scheme largely since the unknown control gains are allowed to be time-varying and even state-dependent. In such a way, the underlying problem is tackled with the output tracking error converging into an arbitrarily preassigned residual set exhibiting an arbitrarily predefined convergence rate. Besides, all the internal signals are ensured to be semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded (SGUUB). Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the co-designed scheme.},

The method is based on a modular structure, resulting in the separation of three modules: 1) a variable update law for the parameterized path; 2) a high-order neural observer; and 3) an output-feedback consensus maneuvering control law. The proposed distributed neural observer-based adaptive control method ensures that all followers agree on a common motion guided by a desired parameterized path, and the proposed method evades adopting the adaptive backstepping or dynamic surface control design by reformulating the dynamics of agents, thereby reducing the complexity of the control structure. Combined with the cascade system analysis and interconnection system analysis, the input-to-state stability of the consensus maneuvering closed loop is established in the Lyapunov sense.

  abstract     = {Observer-based disturbance rejection holds substantial theoretical and practical relevance in the field of control engineering, with numerous variants of disturbance observers already schemed. Nevertheless, the criteria for accuracy and avenues for enhancement remain areas warranting further investigation. This article introduces an integral compensation function observer (CFO) featuring a novel structure and efficient utilization of information for estimating disturbances in $n$ th-order uncertain systems. This approach enhances estimation accuracy by addressing the inherent limitations of the linear extended state observer (LESO), such as low order, lacking usage of information, nonconvergence, and limited bandwidth. Through the derivation and quantification of the disturbance sensitivity transfer function (DSTF), this study examines the disturbance sensitivities of the CFO, LESO, and an improved ESO (IESO). The findings indicate that the CFO elevates the estimable order of disturbance and surpasses both LESO and IESO in bandwidth and disturbance estimation accuracy. In evaluating both the estimation accuracy of disturbance of the CFO and the disturbance-rejection performance (DRP) of CFO-based control, nonlinear pole assignment controls (NPACs) employing 2nd/3rd-order CFO, IESO, LESO, and 4th-order CFO are implemented in the context of attitude control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV) that is exposed to prearranged disturbance torques. The results illustrate that the CFO outperforms the IESO and LESO in terms of accurately estimating the prearranged disturbing torques. Furthermore, the recorded magnitudes of attitude in response to disturbances underscore the superior DRP of CFO-NPAC relative to IESO-NPAC and LESO-NPAC.},

In order to reduce the communication usage between the controller and the actuators, it is supposed that only one actuator node can gain the access to the network at each sampling time along horizontal or vertical direction, where a proper 2-D round-robin protocol is designed to periodically regulate the access token and a set of zero-order holders (ZOHs) is employed to keep the other actuator nodes unchanged until the next renewed signal arrives. Based on a novel 2-D common sliding function, a token-dependent 2-D SMC scheme with first-order sliding mode is appropriately constructed to cope with the impacts from the periodic scheduling signal and the ZOHs. Furthermore, a novel super-twisting-like 2-D SMC scheme with second-order sliding mode is designed to improve the robustness against the bounded disturbance. By resorting to token-dependent Lyapunov-like function, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the horizontal and vertical states as well as the 2-D common sliding function. For acquiring the optimized gain matrices, two searching algorithms are formulated to solve two optimization problems arising from finding optimized control performance. Finally, two comparative examples are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantageous of the proposed first- and second-order 2-D SMC design schemes under round-robin scheduling mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Despite the dominance of unsupervised and self-supervised anomaly detection methods in the current satellite fault diagnosis domain, supervised anomaly detection offers a superior alternative for high-sensitivity detection and lightweight deployment requirements specific to subsystems or components, such as attitude control systems (ACSs). This article addresses the issues of over-design and insufficient accuracy in the CNN network design for satellite ACS fault diagnosis by introducing the modified particle swarm optimization-advanced convolution blocks-based CNN (MPSO-ACBCNN) method. First, we present the ACBCNN, a lightweight, flexible-layer CNN architecture. This architecture leverages advanced convolution blocks (ACBs), which incorporate numerous efficient design elements to enhance feature extraction capabilities within power spectral density (PSD) graphs of various fault samples, and employs classical dense connection methods to prevent the issue of gradient vanishing. Second, we devise the MPSO-ACBCNN algorithm to optimize the ACBCNN fault diagnosis architecture for specified ACS using MPSO. In MPSO-ACBCNN, several optimizations to the canonical PSO are implemented, including the fitness design that balances the tradeoff between total parameter quantity and the training effectiveness, and methods to ensure feasible solutions, etc. Finally, numerical experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MPSO-ACBCNN in fault diagnosis for ACS.},

  abstract     = {Data incompleteness is a serious challenge in real-world machine-learning tasks. Nevertheless, it has not received enough attention in symbolic regression (SR). Data missingness exacerbates data shortage, especially in domains with limited available data, which in turn limits the learning ability of SR algorithms. Transfer learning (TL), which aims to transfer knowledge across tasks, is a potential solution to solve this issue by making amends for the lack of knowledge. However, this approach has not been adequately investigated in SR. To fill this gap, a multitree genetic programming-based TL method is proposed in this work to transfer knowledge from complete source domains (SDs) to incomplete related target domains (TDs). The proposed method transforms the features from a complete SD to an incomplete TD. However, having many features complicates the transformation process. To mitigate this problem, we integrate a feature selection mechanism to eliminate unnecessary transformations. The method is examined on real-world and synthetic SR tasks with missing values to consider different learning scenarios. The obtained results not only show the effectiveness of the proposed method but also show its training efficiency compared with the existing TL methods. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method reduced an average of more than 2.58% and 4% regression error on heterogeneous and homogeneous domains, respectively.},

For the first time, the piecewise homogeneous Markov chain (MC) which depends on the system mode and the controller mode is applied to control the scheduling of stochastic communication protocol (SCP), so that the MCs in the system models, the controller and the SCP constitute a three-layer nonstationary Markov model (NMM). This model perfectly describes the different objects of the three MCs and reflects the mutual regulation among them. The critical issue is to devise an adaptive controller and a sliding surface (SS) simultaneously under SCP scheduling. By applying a standard singular sliding mode surface, an appropriate nonstationary SMC law is established to promise the accessibility of the SS and the stability of the closed-loop system (CLS), and meet the expected performance indicator. Further, using the mode-dependent Lyapunov function and piecewise homogeneous Markov model method, sufficient criteria are obtained. The specific expression of the control gain is obtained by matrix decoupling technology. Finally, a numerical simulation is furnished to testify the correctness of the conclusion.},

An SFDES is comprised of multiple fuzzy automata that occur randomly one at time with different occurrence probabilities. It uses either the max-product fuzzy inference or the max–min fuzzy inference. This article focuses on single-event SFDES—each of the fuzzy automata of such an SFDES has one event. Assuming nothing is known about an SFDES, we develop an innovative technique capable of determining number of fuzzy automata and their event transition matrices as well as estimating their occurrence probabilities. The technique, called prerequired-pre-event-state-based technique, creates and uses merely $N$ particular pre-event state vectors of dimension $N$ to identify event transition matrices of $M$ fuzzy automata, involving a total of $MN^{2}$ unknown parameters. One necessary and sufficient condition and three sufficient conditions are established for the identification of SFDES with different settings.

  abstract     = {Aircraft recognition is crucial in both civil and military fields, and high-spatial resolution remote sensing has emerged as a practical approach. However, existing data-driven methods fail to locate discriminative regions for effective feature extraction due to limited training data, leading to poor recognition performance. To address this issue, we propose a knowledge-driven deep learning method called the explicable aircraft recognition framework based on a part parsing prior (APPEAR). APPEAR explicitly models the aircraft’s rigid structure as a pixel-level part parsing prior, dividing it into five parts: 1) the nose; 2) left wing; 3) right wing; 4) fuselage; and 5) tail. This fine-grained prior provides reliable part locations to delineate aircraft architecture and imposes spatial constraints among the parts, effectively reducing the search space for model optimization and identifying subtle interclass differences. A knowledge-driven aircraft part attention (KAPA) module uses this prior to achieving a geometric-invariant representation for identifying discriminative features. Part features are generated by part indexing in a specific order and sequentially embedded into a compact space to obtain a fixed-length representation for each part, invariant to aircraft orientation and scale. The part attention module then takes the embedded part features, adaptively reweights their importance to identify discriminative parts, and aggregates them for recognition. The proposed APPEAR framework is evaluated on two aircraft recognition datasets and achieves superior performance. Moreover, experiments with few-shot learning methods demonstrate the robustness of our framework in different tasks. Ablation analysis illustrates that the fuselage and wings of the aircraft are the most effective parts for recognition.},

  abstract     = {Binary hashing is an effective approach for content-based image retrieval, and learning binary codes with neural networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, the training of hashing neural networks is difficult due to the binary constraint on hash codes. In addition, neural networks are easily affected by input data with small perturbations. Therefore, a sensitive binary hashing autoencoder (SBHA) is proposed to handle these challenges by introducing stochastic sensitivity for image retrieval. SBHA extracts meaningful features from original inputs and maps them onto a binary space to obtain binary hash codes directly. Different from ordinary autoencoders, SBHA is trained by minimizing the reconstruction error, the stochastic sensitive error, and the binary constraint error simultaneously. SBHA reduces output sensitivity to unseen samples with small perturbations from training samples by minimizing the stochastic sensitive error, which helps to learn more robust features. Moreover, SBHA is trained with a binary constraint and outputs binary codes directly. To tackle the difficulty of optimization with the binary constraint, we train the SBHA with alternating optimization. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that SBHA is competitive and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for binary hashing.},

  abstract     = {The cubature Kalman filter (CKF) overcomes the limitations of the Kalman filter in strong nonlinear systems, which has been widely used in many fields. However, in practical engineering, the abnormal measurement information obtained by the sensor causes the measurement noise covariance to change, which may deteriorate the filtering performance and even cause the filter failure. The fault-tolerant filter can deal with the state estimation problem for the systems with abnormal measurements. The key of the fault-tolerant filter is to forcefully correct filter innovation by using a fading factor. The fault-tolerant filter technology has been extensively applied in many practical systems, but it is still lack of reasonable theoretical analysis. To this end, the measurement noise model is established and the magnitude of the noise deviation is analyzed. The filtering performance under abnormal measurement is analyzed by three mean squared errors (MSEs), which are the ideal MSE, the filter calculated MSE and the true MSE. In order to solve the influence of sampling approximation deviation of CKF on fault detection, an improved fault detection algorithm is proposed. The performance of fault-tolerant CKF is analyzed from two views. The first view is about comparing the filter calculated MSEs of CKF and of fault-tolerant CKF, the second view is about comparing the relative closeness of the filter calculated MSE to the true MSE for the two algorithms.

This article investigates a new reconciliatory input design problem for both achieving control objectives and improving fault detection performance. An exemplary algorithm for the reconciliatory input design is proposed, by using a trajectory optimization approach. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts: 1) residual generation; 2) trajectory optimization; and 3) input design. A state observer is designed to obtain residual signals used as fault indicators. Considering the optimization index composed of the fault indicators, a trajectory optimization technique is carried out to find an optimal system trajectory which can improve the fault detection ability to the greatest extent. The control input is designed to track this optimal trajectory while complying with system physical constraints.

These conditions can facilitate the control protocol design by solving a bilinear programming problem, and also generate hyperpyramidal regions to confine the output consensus error.

It is a challenging issue because humans have different walking motions, and the interactions between humans and objects in the current environment, especially between humans themselves, are complex. Previous researchers focused on how to model human–human interactions but neglected the relative importance of interactions. To address this issue, a novel mechanism based on correntropy is introduced. The proposed mechanism not only can measure the relative importance of human–human interactions but also can build personal space for each pedestrian. An interaction module, including this data-driven mechanism, is further proposed. In the proposed module, the data-driven mechanism can effectively extract the feature representations of dynamic human–human interactions in the scene and calculate the corresponding weights to represent the importance of different interactions. To share such social messages among pedestrians, an interaction-aware architecture based on long short-term memory network for trajectory prediction is designed. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than several latest methods with good performance.},

To pursue this objective, a distributed proportional-integral-derivative controller is first introduced, whose sampled-data implementation is enabled by leveraging the finite-difference approximation for the derivative action, which leads to a distributed proportional-integral-retarded (PIR) controller with a small enough sampling period $h&amp;gt;0$ . Then, the resulting fully distributed PIR control law is combined with a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM), which embeds Zeno-freeness property and avoids the requirement of continuous transmission in triggering process. Thus, the communication burden is significantly mitigated and the waste of communication resources is avoided. By exploiting Lyapunov–Krasovkii method, we derive exponential stability conditions expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), whose solution allows evaluating the maximum sampling period and DETM parameters preserving the stability of the microgrid. A thorough numerical analysis, carried out on the standard IEEE 14-bus test system, confirms the theoretical derivation.},

  abstract     = {The process industry is an industrial field of interdisciplinary nature involving electrical engineering, energy, petroleum, chemical, and metallurgy, which play a key role in the sustainable development. As a main source of CO2 emissions, the process industry will undertake a large part of the emission reduction task. In order to incorporate the impact of social factors, such as environment, society, and human to support the future process industry, the cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) framework should be considered as a promising way to enhance the transformation of the process industry. The development of CPSS technologies will fundamentally change the infrastructure of conventional industrial systems, offering a great opportunity for the greenization, high-value, and digitalization in the process industry. This article first presents the current status of the process industry. Through a CPSS framework, the current developments of the process industry as well as the main challenges and opportunities are discussed. A vision for the future process industry based on CPSS is described by focusing on three aspects, namely, the greenization and low carbon, high-value and high-end, digitalization, and intellectualization in process manufacturing. Finally, the advanced technologies and approaches in CPSS driven by artificial intelligence and industrial digitalization, which are important in achieving the sustainable development of the process industry, are outlined. The development of the comprehensive digital technologies, such as virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, and big data, will stimulate the implementation of a ground-breaking concept formed in the CPSS framework called industrial metaverse.},

However, many typical scenarios in 3C assembly, such as the assembly of flexible printed circuits (FPCs), involve complex manipulations with long-horizon steps and high-precision requirements that cannot be effectively accomplished through manual programming or conventional skill-learning methods. To address this challenge, this article proposes a learning-based framework for the acquisition of complex 3C assembly skills assisted by a multimodal digital-twin environment. First, we construct a fully equivalent digital-twin environment based on the real-world counterpart, equipped with visual, tactile force, and proprioception information, and then collect multimodal demonstration data using virtual reality (VR) devices. Next, we construct a skill knowledge base through multimodal skill parsing of demonstration data, resulting in primitive policy sequences for achieving 3C assembly tasks. Finally, we train primitive policies via a combination of curriculum learning, residual reinforcement learning, and domain randomization methods and transfer the learned skill from the digital-twin environment to the real-world environment. The experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In these problems, decision variables may have different impacts on objectives and constraints, which could be detected by sensitivity analysis. Most existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms do not analyze variable sensitivity, thus, useless effort may be made on some less sensitive variables. This article proposes a surrogate-assisted bilevel evolutionary algorithm to solve a real-world engine calibration problem. Principal component analysis is performed to investigate the impact of variables on constraints and to divide decision variables into lower-level and upper-level variables. The lower-level aims at optimizing lower-level variables to make candidate solutions feasible, and the upper-level focuses on adjusting upper-level variables to optimize the objective. In addition, an ordinal-regression-based surrogate is adapted to estimate the ordinal landscape of solution feasibility. Computational studies on a gasoline engine model demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient in constraint handling and also achieves a smaller fuel consumption value than other state-of-the-art calibration methods.},

Specifically, we construct the incoherent clip by multiple subclips hierarchically sampled from the same raw video with various lengths of incoherence. The network is trained to learn the high-level representation by predicting the location and length of incoherence given the incoherent clip as input. Additionally, we introduce intravideo contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between incoherent clips from the same raw video. We evaluate our proposed method through extensive experiments on action recognition and video retrieval using various backbone networks. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance across different backbone networks and different datasets compared to previous coherence-based methods.},

The asymmetrically saturated LTI system is converted to a switched system with symmetrically saturated subsystems, and a dwell time switching rule is presented to govern the switching between different antiwindup gains. Based on multiple Lyapunov functions, we derive sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the regional stability and weighted $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ performance of the closed-loop system. The switching anti-windup synthesis that designs a separate anti-windup gain for each subsystem is cast as a convex optimization problem. In comparison with the design of a single anti-windup gain, our method can induce less conservative results since the asymmetric character of the saturation constraint is fully utilized in the switching anti-windup design. Two numerical examples, and an application to aeroengine control (the experiments are conducted on a semiphysical test bench), demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed scheme.},

Moreover, instead of minimizing the tensor nuclear norm which treats all singular values equally and neglects their differences, PTN2MSL develops the partial tubal nuclear norm (PTNN) as a better alternative solution by minimizing the partial sum of tubal singular values. The PTN2MSL method was applied to the above three multiview subspace learning tasks.

To achieve the exact relative localization, a persistent excitation (P.E.) signal is introduced in the controller which, however, perturbs the motion of each robot and affects the formation accuracy. To resolve the conflict, an autonomous system with its output regulated by a carefully designed function of range measurements is introduced to generate the persistent excitation. It is proved that the similar formation control problem can be solved by our proposed scheme with global asymptotic convergence for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

  abstract     = {Approximation models play a crucial role in model-based methods, as they enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency. This article studies distributed and asynchronous discretized models to approach continuous-time nonlinear systems. The considered continuous-time system consists of some distributed but physically coupled nonlinear subsystems that exchange information. We propose two Lebesgue approximation models (LAMs): 1) the unconditionally triggered LAM (CT-LAM) and 2) the CT-LAM. In both approaches, a specific LAM approximates an individual subsystem. The iteration of each LAM is triggered by either itself or its neighbors. The collection of different LAMs executing asynchronously together form the approximation of the overall distributed continuous-time system. The aperiodic nature of LAMs allows for a reduction in the number of iterations in the approximation process, particularly when the system has slow dynamics. The difference between the unconditionally and CT-LAMs is that the latter checks an “importance” condition, further reducing the computational effort in individual LAMs. Furthermore, the proposed LAMs are analyzed by constructing a distributed event-triggered system which is proved to have the same state trajectories as the LAMs with linear interpolation. Through this specific event-triggered system, we derive conditions on the quantization sizes in LAMs to ensure asymptotic stability of the LAMs, boundedness of the state errors, and prevention of Zeno behavior. Finally, simulations are carried out on a quarter-car suspension system to show the advantage and efficiency of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the design of feedback controllers for generalized cost functions to deal with stochastic optimal control problems. Target linear systems contain time-invariant stochastic parameters that describe system uncertainty. The cost functions involve nonlinear mappings and polynomial forms of the system states and inputs to express various performance metrics. Unfortunately, these properties cause difficulties in solving the problems. Conventional methods, such as the principle of optimality, are not employed to solve such problems owing to the time-invariant parameters. As opposed to the well-known quadratic functions, handling the generalized cost functions is a complicated task. This study overcomes these challenges by deriving an explicit relation between the cost function and the linear feedback gain of a controller. The derived relation enables the feedback gain to be optimized via a gradient method. A theoretical analysis ensures the convergence of the proposed gradient method. A suboptimal feedback controller is obtained to solve the problem, even for the generalized cost. Furthermore, the controller guarantees robust stability of the feedback system even with the stochastic parameters. It is demonstrated that the proposed cost function can express an expectation of a quadratic cost, risk-sensitive cost, polynomial cost, and input-to-state gain. A numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, very little is currently known about the pectoral-fin-driven 3-D locomotion of manta-inspired robots. This study is focused on the development and 3-D path-following control of an agile robotic manta. First, a novel robotic manta with 3-D mobility is constructed, of which the distinctive pectoral fins provide the only propulsion. Specifically, the unique pitching mechanism is detailed in which the time-coupled coordination movement of the pectoral fins is applied. Second, based on a 6-axis force measuring platform, the propulsion characteristics of the flexible pectoral fins are analyzed. Then, the force-data-driven 3-D dynamic model is further established. Third, a control scheme combined with a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance system and a sliding-mode fuzzy controller is conceived, addressing the 3-D path-following task. Finally, various simulated and aquatic experiments are conducted, demonstrating the superior performance of our prototype and the effectiveness of the proposed path-following scheme. This study will hopefully generate fresh insights into the updated design and control of agile bioinspired robots performing underwater tasks in dynamic environments.},

In this study, an online behavior learning method is proposed for continuous-time linear human-in-the-loop shared control systems by using the system state data only. A two-player nonzero-sum linear quadratic dynamic game paradigm is used for modeling the control interaction between a human operator and an automation that actively compensates for human control action. In this game model, the cost function representing the human behavior is assumed to have an unknown weighting matrix. Here, we want to learn the human behavior or retrieve the weighting matrix by using the system state data only. Accordingly, a new adaptive inverse differential game (IDG) method, which integrates concurrent learning (CL) and linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, is proposed. First, a CL-based adaptive law and an interactive controller of the automation are developed to estimate the feedback gain matrix of the human online, and second, an LMI optimization problem is solved to determine the weighting matrix of the human cost function. Finally, simulation results on a cooperative shared control driver assistance system are provided to elucidate the feasibility of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) aims to find task-solving policies from prerecorded datasets without online environment interaction. It is unfortunate that extrapolation errors can cause over-optimistic Q-value estimates when learning with a fixed dataset, limiting the performance of the learned policy. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an offline actor–critic with behavior value regularization (OAC-BVR) method. In the policy evaluation stage, the difference between the Q-function and the value of the behavior policy is considered as the regularization term, driving the learned value function to approach the value of the behavior policy. The convergence of the proposed policy evaluation with behavior value regularization (PE-BVR) and the value function difference are analyzed, respectively. Compared with existing offline actor–critic methods, the proposed OAC-BVR method integrates the value of the behavior policy, thereby simultaneously alleviating over-optimistic Q-value estimates and reducing Q-function bias. Experimental results on the D4RL MuJoCo and Maze2d datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed PE-BVR and the performance advantage of OAC-BVR over the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. The code of OAC-BVR is available at https://github.com/LongyangHuang/OAC-BVR .},

First, an augmented fixed-time observer with measurement noise oppression is adopted to estimate and compensate actuator faults and disturbance in rotational and translational dynamics. Then, a baseline attitude controller, a command filter, and a velocity controller are proposed for each quadrotor UAV to track the desired velocity within a fixed time. Next, a distributed fixed-time sliding-mode controller that integrates the gradient of repulsive potential function into the sliding manifold is designed to achieve leader–follower formation control and collision avoidance simultaneously. The control scheme is proven to be fixed-time convergent via Lyapunov stability analysis and is normalized in accordance with the compatibility of hardware implementation. Finally, the designed algorithm is embedded into PX4 architecture to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the control strategy.},

However, the strategy of reaching group consensus via an incentive mechanism encouraging adjustment of preferences is more effective than forcing, which is the aim of this article. Specifically, this article establishes a novel incentive mechanism to support group consensus under dynamic trust relationship. First, the supremum and infimum incentives-based rule driven by trust relationship is defined. Based on the assumption that if incentive conditions are met, then experts will be willing to adjust their preferences, the incentive behavior-driven minimum adjustment consensus model is developed to generate optimal incentive-based recommendation preferences. Thus, the proposed incentive mechanism can effectively reduce the preference adjustment cost and promote group consensus reaching. Third, the updated trust relationships between experts are shown to be strengthen by the proposed incentive-driven preference revision. Consequently, the optimization model based on trust interaction relationship is constructed to obtain the final group preference matrix. Finally, a supplier selection case of high-end medical equipment is provided to illustrate the proposed method and show the rationality and advantages of the proposed methodology with both a sensitivity analysis and a comparison analysis.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by alterations of the brain’s structural and functional connectivity during its progressive degenerative processes. Existing auxiliary diagnostic methods have accomplished the classification task, but few of them can accurately evaluate the changing characteristics of brain connectivity. In this work, a prior-guided adversarial learning with hypergraph (PALH) model is proposed to predict abnormal brain connections using triple-modality medical images. Concretely, a prior distribution from anatomical knowledge is estimated to guide multimodal representation learning using an adversarial strategy. Also, the pairwise collaborative discriminator structure is further utilized to narrow the difference in representation distribution. Moreover, the hypergraph perceptual network is developed to effectively fuse the learned representations while establishing high-order relations within and between multimodal images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other related methods in analyzing and predicting AD progression. More importantly, the identified abnormal connections are partly consistent with previous neuroscience discoveries. The proposed model can evaluate the characteristics of abnormal brain connections at different stages of AD, which is helpful for cognitive disease study and early treatment.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as the genetic algorithm (GA), offer an elegant way to handle combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, limited by expertise and resources, most users lack the capability to implement EAs for solving COPs. An intuitive and promising solution is to outsource evolutionary operations to a cloud server, however, it poses privacy concerns. To this end, this article proposes a novel computing paradigm called evolutionary computation as a service (ECaaS), where a cloud server renders evolutionary computation services for users while ensuring their privacy. Following the concept of ECaaS, this article presents privacy-preserving genetic algorithm (PEGA), a privacy-preserving GA designed specifically for COPs. PEGA enables users, regardless of their domain expertise or resource availability, to outsource COPs to the cloud server that holds a competitive GA and approximates the optimal solution while safeguarding privacy. Notably, PEGA features the following characteristics. First, PEGA empowers users without domain expertise or sufficient resources to solve COPs effectively. Second, PEGA protects the privacy of users by preventing the leakage of optimization problem details. Third, PEGA performs comparably to the conventional GA when approximating the optimal solution. To realize its functionality, we implement PEGA falling in a twin-server architecture and evaluate it on two widely known COPs: 1) the traveling Salesman problem (TSP) and 2) the 0/1 knapsack problem (KP). Particularly, we utilize encryption cryptography to protect users’ privacy and carefully design a suite of secure computing protocols to support evolutionary operators of GA on encrypted chromosomes. Privacy analysis demonstrates that PEGA successfully preserves the confidentiality of COP contents. Experimental evaluation results on several TSP datasets and KP datasets reveal that PEGA performs equivalently to the conventional GA in approximating the optimal solution.},

Moreover, the fast-transient, satisfactory robustness, and high-precision position/force synchronization are also realized by design of fixed-time impedance control strategies. Furthermore, the “complexity explosion” issue triggered by traditional backstepping technology is averted efficiently via a novel fixed-time command filter and filter compensation signals.

  abstract     = {In recent times, significant advancements have been made in delving into the optimization landscape of policy gradient methods for achieving optimal control in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Compared with state-feedback control, output-feedback control is more prevalent since the underlying state of the system may not be fully observed in many practical settings. This article analyzes the optimization landscape inherent to policy gradient methods when applied to static output feedback (SOF) control in discrete-time LTI systems subject to quadratic cost. We begin by establishing crucial properties of the SOF cost, encompassing coercivity, $L$ -smoothness, and $M$ -Lipschitz continuous Hessian. Despite the absence of convexity, we leverage these properties to derive novel findings regarding convergence (and nearly dimension-free rate) to stationary points for three policy gradient methods, including the vanilla policy gradient method, the natural policy gradient method, and the Gauss–Newton method. Moreover, we provide proof that the vanilla policy gradient method exhibits linear convergence toward local minima when initialized near such minima. This article concludes by presenting numerical examples that validate our theoretical findings. These results not only characterize the performance of gradient descent for optimizing the SOF problem but also provide insights into the effectiveness of general policy gradient methods within the realm of reinforcement learning.},

Taking into account the energy constraint, the malicious attacker is required to schedule the off-line generated signals to modify the transmitted data with limited times over a finite-time horizon under the stealthiness condition, which makes the design of attack strategy more complex. Different from the attack schedules which are studied on the basis of prescribed attack signals in the existing results, the attack strategy is presented under the framework of collaborative design to deteriorate the estimation performance to the largest extent, which yet leads to the coupling between the attack schedules and attack signals. To overcome the difficulty without sacrificing the optimality, the attack design problem is solved in two steps. First, analyze the problem with the given attack schedule to derive the optimal attack signals. Then, the optimal schedule is obtained by efficiently solving the nonlinear 0–1 programming problem based on the algorithm of reducing the search space which is designed to eliminate a part of the nonoptimal solutions. To demonstrate the theoretical results, a simulation example is provided.},

  abstract     = {For a nonlinear parabolic distributed parameter system (DPS), a fuzzy boundary sampled-data (SD) control method is introduced in this article, where distributed SD measurement and boundary SD measurement are respected. Initially, this nonlinear parabolic DPS is represented precisely by a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) model. Subsequently, under distributed SD measurement and boundary SD measurement, a fuzzy boundary SD control design is obtained via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) on the basis of the T–S fuzzy parabolic PDE model to guarantee exponential stability for closed-loop parabolic DPS by using inequality techniques and a acrlong LF. Furthermore, respecting the property of membership functions, we present some LMI-based fuzzy boundary SD control design conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed fuzzy boundary SD controller is demonstrated via two simulation examples.},

To tackle with nonconvex and nondifferentiable issue, a randomized gradient-free-based successive convex approximation is developed to smooth economic objective function. Due to resilience ability against security issue, a security event-triggered mechanism-based distributed energy management is proposed to optimize social welfare, which coordinately controls both power generators and load demand. The security event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce power system security risks, and relieve communication burden caused by smoothing calculation, the convergence of proposed distributed algorithm is also properly proved. According to those obtained results on both IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus systems, it reveals that the proposed approach can achieve good convergence performance and have less security risks than other alternatives, which also proves that the proposed approach can be a viable and promising way for tackling with energy management issue of cyber-physical isolated power system.},

The CTLC approach is first used to cancel the exact nonlinear dynamics of the original tracking error system to obtain a set of decoupling linear tracking error subsystems, thus reducing the optimization complexity of model predictive control (MPC). The composite DO-ET-RMPC scheme is then developed based on the so-called dual-mode MPC approach to robustly stabilize the tracking error subsystems, which could improve the robustness of MPC and save its computational resources simultaneously. The continuous-time theoretical properties of the DO-ET-RMPC scheme, considering disturbances and state and control input constraints simultaneously, are provided for the first time, including the avoidance of Zeno behavior, robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and stability. In the end, the superiorities of the proposed control scheme are verified by the comparative simulations.},

We analyze the performance degradation of distributed estimation caused by the replay attack, and utilize the Kullback–Leibler (K–L) divergence to quantify the attack stealthiness. Specifically, for a stable system, we prove that under any replay attack, the estimation error is not only bounded, but also can re-enter the steady state. In that case, we prove that the replay attack is $\epsilon $ -stealthy, where $\epsilon $ can be calculated based on two Lyapunov equations. On the other hand, for an unstable system, we prove that the trace of estimation error covariance is lower bounded by an exponential function, which indicates that the estimation error may diverge due to the attack. In view of this, we provide a sufficient condition to ensure that any replay attack is detectable. Furthermore, we analyze the case that the adversary starts to attack only if the current measurement is close to a previously recorded one. Finally, we verify the theoretical results via several numerical simulations.},

To do this, initially, the state-space model is derived when a PMSG is penetration into IPSs. Differing from existing works, IPSs with PMSG-based WTs, including the stochastic disturbance, are modeled as a stochastic state-space model. Then, decentralized sampled-data load frequency control is designed to regulate the frequency response of the proposed model against the deterministic and stochastic noises. By constructing bilateral looped Lyapunov functional and using Itôs formula, stochastic sufficient conditions are derived, which ensure that the closed-loop form of the proposed model is asymptotically stable in the mean square with $H_{\infty }$ performance index $\gamma $ . Finally, three-area IPSs with PMSG-based WTs are validated with derived sufficient conditions. The simulation results confirmed the better-stability performance of frequency response for the proposed stochastic IPSs with PMSG-based WTs.},

  abstract     = {The competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) classifies swarm particles into loser and winner particles and then uses the winner particles to efficiently guide the search of the loser particles. This approach has very promising performance in solving large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). However, most studies of CSOs ignore the evolution of the winner particles, although their quality is very important for the final optimization performance. Aiming to fill this research gap, this article proposes a new neural net-enhanced CSO for solving LMOPs, called NN-CSO, which not only guides the loser particles via the original CSO strategy, but also applies our trained neural network (NN) model to evolve winner particles. First, the swarm particles are classified into winner and loser particles by the pairwise competition. Then, the loser particles and winner particles are, respectively, treated as the input and desired output to train the NN model, which tries to learn promising evolutionary dynamics by driving the loser particles toward the winners. Finally, when model training is complete, the winner particles are evolved by the well-trained NN model, while the loser particles are still guided by the winner particles to maintain the search pattern of CSOs. To evaluate the performance of our designed NN-CSO, several LMOPs with up to ten objectives and 1000 decision variables are adopted, and the experimental results show that our designed NN model can significantly improve the performance of CSOs and shows some advantages over several state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms as well as over model-based evolutionary algorithms.},

An adaptive formation control algorithm with bearing-only measurements is proposed under a hierarchical control framework. More specifically, a saturated adaptive distributed control force is developed in the position loop with bearing-only measurements. Since the bearing vectors with respect to the neighbors can be directly measured by low-cost onboard cameras, the proposed formation algorithm can be implemented without interagent communication. Subsequently, in the attitude loop, an adaptive hybrid control scheme via two modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) sets is proposed, which achieves the command attitude tracking globally and also avoids the unwinding problem of MRPs. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis and hybrid theory, we prove that the overall closed-loop error system is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, we provide a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

First, distributed event-based reference generators are proposed to generate continuously differentiable reference signals via event-based communication under jointly connected digraphs. Unlike some existing works, only the states of agents rather than virtual internal reference variables need to be transmitted among agents. Second, adaptive controllers are exploited based on the reference generators so that each agent can track the reference signals. The uncertain parameters converge to their real values under an initially exciting (IE) assumption. It is proved that the uncertain EL MAS achieves state consensus asymptotically under the proposed event-triggered protocol composed of the reference generators and the adaptive controllers. A unique feature of the proposed event-triggered protocol is its fully distributed property: the protocol does not depend on global information about the jointly connected digraphs. Meanwhile, a minimum interevent time (MIET) is guaranteed. Finally, two simulations are conducted to show the validity of the proposed protocol.},

Based on the distributed policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) theory, a data-driven distributed optimal control strategy is obtained to guarantee the bipartite consensus of all agents’ position and velocity states. In addition, the offline data sets ensure the learning efficiency of the system. These data sets are generated by running the system in real time. Besides, the designed algorithm is an asynchronous version, which is essential to solve the challenge caused by the computational ability difference between nodes in MASs. Then, by means of the functional analysis and Lyapunov theory, the stability of the proposed MASs and the convergence of the learning process are analyzed.

Within the detection range, each agent regards other agents and static or dynamic objects as obstacles. The nonlinear error variables for formation tracking and collision avoidance are presented, and the auxiliary signals in formation tracking errors are introduced to maintain network connectivity under the avoidance mechanism. The adaptive formation controllers using command-filtered backstepping are constructed to ensure closed-loop stability with collision avoidance and preserved connectivity. Compared with the previous formation results, the resulting features are as follows: 1) the nonlinear error function for the avoidance mechanism is considered an error variable, and an adaptive tuning mechanism for estimating the dynamic obstacle velocity is derived in a Lyapunov-based control design procedure; 2) network connectivity during dynamic obstacle avoidance is preserved by constructing the auxiliary signals; and 3) owing to neural networks-based compensating variables, the bounding conditions of time derivatives of virtual controllers are not required in the stability analysis.},

  abstract     = {Social network analysis is a popular tool to understand the relationships between interacting agents by studying the structural properties of their connections. However, this kind of analysis can miss some of the domain-specific knowledge available in the original information domain and its propagation through the associated network. In this work, we develop an extension of classical social network analysis to incorporate external information from the original source of the network. With this extension we propose a new centrality measure, the semantic value, and a new affinity function, the semantic affinity, that establishes fuzzy-like relationships between the different actors in the network. We also propose a new heuristic algorithm based on the shortest capacity problem to compute this new function. As an illustrative case study, we use the novel proposals to analyze and compare the gods and heroes from three different classical mythologies: 1) Greek; 2) Celtic; and 3) Nordic. We study the relationships of each individual mythology and those of the common structure that is formed when we fuse the three of them. We also compare our results with those obtained using other existing centrality measures and embedding approaches. In addition, we test the proposed measures on a classical social network, the Reuters terror news network, as well as in a Twitter network related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the novel method obtains more meaningful comparisons and results than previous existing approaches in every case.},

And, a zero rendezvous speed is not required in the problem. Two new consensus protocols that employ no absolute states are proposed, depending on the presence of delay. Sufficient synchronization conditions are obtained for both protocols. It is shown that consensus can be reached, provided there is a sufficiently small gain and periodically joint connectivity in the sense of scrambling graph or spanning tree. Finally, both numerical and practical examples are supplied for illustrative purpose, and both show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Salient instance segmentation (SIS) is an emerging field that evolves from salient object detection (SOD), aiming at identifying individual salient instances using segmentation maps. Inspired by the success of dynamic convolutions in segmentation tasks, this article introduces a keypoints-based SIS network (KepSalinst). It employs multiple keypoints, that is, the center and several peripheral points of an instance, as effective geometrical guidance for dynamic convolutions. The features at peripheral points can help roughly delineate the spatial extent of the instance and complement the information inside the central features. To fully exploit the complementary components within these features, we design a differentiated patterns fusion (DPF) module. This ensures that the resulting dynamic convolutional filters formed by these features are sufficiently comprehensive for precise segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a high-level semantic guided saliency (HSGS) module. This module enhances the perception of saliency by predicting a map for the input image to estimate a saliency score for each segmented instance. On four SIS datasets (ILSO, SOC, SIS10K, and COME15K), our KepSalinst outperforms all previous models qualitatively and quantitatively.},

A new model is presented to describe the dynamical behaviors of ROMOs by using a set of independent and identically distributed stochastic scalars. A probabilistic encoding–decoding scheme is exploited to convert the measurement signal into the digital format. For the purpose of preserving the filtering process from the performance degradation induced by measurement outliers, a novel recursive filtering algorithm is developed by using the active detection-based method where the “problematic” measurements (i.e., the measurements contaminated by outliers) are removed from the filtering process. A recursive calculation approach is proposed to derive the time-varying filter parameter via minimizing such the upper bound on the filtering error covariance. The uniform boundedness of the resultant time-varying upper bound is analyzed for the filtering error covariance by using the stochastic analysis technique. Two numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness and correctness of our developed filter design approach.},

We propose a combined task and motion planning approach to optimize the sequencing, assignment, and execution of tasks under temporal and spatial variability. The framework relies on decoupling tasks and actions, where an action is one possible geometric realization of a symbolic task. At the task level, timeline-based planning deals with temporal constraints, duration variability, and synergic assignment of tasks. At the action level, online motion planning plans for the actual movements dealing with environmental changes. We demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness in a collaborative manufacturing scenario, in which a robotic arm and a human worker shall assemble a mosaic in the shortest time possible.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the security problems for networked Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems with asynchronous premise constraints. The primary objective of this article is twofold. First, a novel important-data-based (IDB) denial-of-service (DoS) attack mechanism is proposed from the perspective of the adversary for the first time to reinforce the destructive effect of the DoS attacks. Different from most existing DoS attack models, the proposed attack mechanism can utilize the information of packets, evaluate the importance degree of packets, and only attack the most “important” ones. As such, a larger system performance degradation can be expected. Second, corresponding to the proposed IDB DoS mechanism, a resilient $H_{\infty }$ fuzzy filter is designed from the defender’s point of view to alleviate the negative effect of the attack. Furthermore, since the defender does not know the attack parameter, an algorithm is designed to estimate it. In a word, a unified attack-defense framework is developed in this article for networked T–S fuzzy systems with asynchronous premise constraints. With the help of the Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions are successfully established to compute the desired filtering gains and ensure the $H_{\infty }$ performance of the filtering error system. Finally, two examples are exploited to demonstrate the destructiveness of the proposed IDB DoS attack and the usefulness of the developed resilient $H_{\infty }$ filter.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) techniques using a few compressed measurements have drawn considerable interest in reconstructing multispectral imagery (MSI). Nonlocal-based tensor methods have been widely used for MSI-CS reconstruction, which employ the nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) property of MSI to obtain satisfactory results. However, such methods only consider the internal priors of MSI while ignoring important external image information, for example deep-driven priors learned from a corpus of natural image datasets. Meanwhile, they usually suffer from annoying ringing artifacts due to the aggregation of overlapping patches. In this article, we propose a novel approach for highly effective MSI-CS reconstruction using multiple complementary priors (MCPs). The proposed MCP jointly exploits nonlocal low-rank and deep image priors under a hybrid plug-and-play framework, which contains multiple pairs of complementary priors, namely, internal and external, shallow and deep, and NSS and local spatial priors. To make the optimization tractable, a well-known alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm based on the alternating minimization framework is developed to solve the proposed MCP-based MSI-CS reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MCP algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art CS techniques in MSI reconstruction. The source code of the proposed MCP-based MSI-CS reconstruction algorithm is available at: https://github.com/zhazhiyuan/MCP_MSI_CS_Demo.git .},

That is, only the signs of the relative state information between neighbors are required. By virtue of differential inclusion theory, we prove that the system converges from arbitrary initial states. In addition, we derive the convergence rate as ${\mathcal {O}}(1/t)$ . Furthermore, in comparison to the existing models, we introduce a novel comparison filter to eliminate the resolution ratio requirement on the input signal, that is, the difference between the $k$ th and $(k+1)$ th largest inputs must be larger than a positive threshold. As a result, the proposed distributed $k$ WTA model is capable of solving the $k$ WTA problem, even when more than two elements of the input signal share the same value. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results through two simulation examples.},

Inspired by digital twin technology, a twin layer (TL) with higher security and privacy is employed to decouple the above problem into two tasks: 1) defense protocols against DoS attacks on TL and 2) defense protocols against actuation attacks on the cyber–physical layer (CPL). Initially, considering modeling errors of leader dynamics, distributed observers are introduced to reconstruct the leader dynamics for each follower on TL under DoS attacks. Subsequently, distributed estimators are utilized to estimate follower states based on the reconstructed leader dynamics on the TL. Then, decentralized solvers are designed to calculate the output regulator equations on CPL by using the reconstructed leader dynamics. Simultaneously, decentralized adaptive attack-resilient control schemes are proposed to resist unbounded actuation attacks on the CPL. Furthermore, the aforementioned control protocols are applied to demonstrate that the followers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence, with the upper bound of the UUB convergence being explicitly determined. Finally, we present a simulation example and an experiment to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Automatic kidney and tumor segmentation from CT volumes is a critical prerequisite/tool for diagnosis and surgical treatment (such as partial nephrectomy). However, it remains a particularly challenging issue as kidneys and tumors often exhibit large-scale variations, irregular shapes, and blurring boundaries. We propose a novel 3-D network to comprehensively tackle these problems; we call it 3DSN-Net. Compared with existing solutions, it has two compelling characteristics. First, with a new scale-aware feature extraction (SAFE) module, the proposed 3DSN-Net is capable of adaptively selecting appropriate receptive fields according to the sizes of targets instead of indiscriminately enlarging them, which is particularly essential for improving the segmentation accuracy of the tumor with large scale variation. Second, we propose a novel yet efficient nonlocal context guidance (NCG) mechanism to capture global dependencies to tackle irregular shapes and blurring boundaries of kidneys and tumors. Instead of directly harnessing a 3-D NCG mechanism, which makes the number of parameters exponentially increase and hence the network difficult to be trained under limited training data, we develop a 2.5D NCG mechanism based on projections of feature cubes, which achieves a tradeoff between segmentation accuracy and network complexity. We extensively evaluate the proposed 3DSN-Net on the famous KiTS dataset with many challenging kidney and tumor cases. Experimental results demonstrate our solution consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3-D networks after being equipped with scale aware and NCG mechanisms, particularly for tumor segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) have been very successful at handling uncertainty in data using fuzzy mappings and if-then rules. However, they suffer from generalization and dimensionality issues. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) represent a step toward processing high-dimensional data, their capacity to address data uncertainty is limited. Furthermore, deep learning algorithms designed to improve robustness are either time consuming or yield unsatisfactory performance. In this article, we propose a robust fuzzy neural network (RFNN) to overcome these problems. The network contains an adaptive inference engine that is capable of handling samples with high-level uncertainty and high dimensions. Unlike traditional FNNs that use a fuzzy AND operation to calculate the firing strength for each rule, our inference engine is able to learn the firing strength adaptively. It also further processes the uncertainty in membership function values. Taking advantage of the learning ability of neural networks, the acquired fuzzy sets can be learned from training inputs automatically to cover the input space well. Furthermore, the consequent layer uses neural network structures to enhance the reasoning ability of the fuzzy rules when dealing with complex inputs. Experiments on a range of datasets show that RFNN delivers state-of-the-art accuracy even at very high levels of uncertainty. Our code is available online. https://github.com/leijiezhang/RFNN},

The transmission constraints are represented by heterogeneous functions that reflect the impact of environmental interference in multiagent systems or social networks. A directed random graph is applied to model the stochastic information flow where every edge is connected probabilistically. Using stochastic stability theory and the martingale convergence theorem, it is demonstrated that the agent states will converge to a consensus value with probability 1, despite information distortions and randomness in information flow.

Focusing on securing the data transmission, a novel dynamic data encryption scheme is developed and historical system data is used to dynamically update a secret key involved in the encryption. The core idea of the dynamic data encryption scheme is to establish a dynamic relationship between original data, secret key, ciphertext and its decrypted value, and in particular, this dynamic relationship will be destroyed once an attack occurs, which can be used to detect attacks. Then, based on dynamic data encryption, a unified fast attack detection method is proposed to detect different attacks, including replay, false data injection (FDI), zero-dynamics, and setpoint attacks. Extensive comparison studies are conducted by using the power system and flight control system. It is verified that the proposed method can immediately trigger the alarm as soon as attacks are launched while the conventional $\chi ^{2}$ detection could only capture the attacks after the estimation residual goes over the predetermined threshold.

Different from most existing works where event-triggering mechanisms are considered for only the controller-to-actuator channel or the sensor-to-controller channel, this work adopts event-triggering mechanisms for both channels as well as adaptive laws. An adaptive states observer is designed to estimate the unavailable system state and then a novel adaptive event-triggered controller is proposed based on the celebrated backstepping technique. By utilizing the cyclic small-gain theorem and Lyapunov theory, it is shown that the proposed control scheme ensures that all the closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and the Zeno behavior is successfully excluded. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

Notably, stochastic signals can be considered in the proposed model, different from the case in the deterministic model. By adopting a high-order operator, equivalent control and stabilization control laws are realized to guarantee the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networking (SDN) allows flexible and centralized control in cloud data centers. An elastic set of distributed SDN controllers is often required to provide sufficient yet cost-effective processing capacity. However, this introduces a new challenge: Request Dispatching among the controllers by SDN switches. It is essential to design a dispatching policy for each switch to guide the request distribution. Existing policies are designed under certain assumptions, including a single centralized agent, global network knowledge, and a fixed number of controllers, which often cannot be satisfied in practice. This article proposes MADRina, Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for request dispatching, to design policies with high dispatching adaptability and performance. First, we design a multiagent system to address the limitation of using a centralized agent with global network knowledge. Second, we propose a Deep Neural Network-based adaptive policy to enable request dispatching over an elastic set of controllers. Third, we develop a new algorithm to train the adaptive policies in a multiagent context. We prototype MADRina and build a simulation tool to evaluate its performance using real-world network data and topology. The results show that MADRina can significantly reduce response time by up to 30% compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised video anomaly detection is generally formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where an anomaly detector learns to generate frame-level anomaly scores under the supervision of MIL-based video-level classification. However, most previous works suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they lack ability to model temporal relationships between video segments and 2) they cannot extract sufficient discriminative features to separate normal and anomalous snippets. In this article, we develop a weakly supervised temporal discriminative (WSTD) paradigm, that aims to leverage both temporal relation and feature discrimination to mitigate the above drawbacks. To this end, we propose a transformer-styled temporal feature aggregator (TTFA) and a self-guided discriminative feature encoder (SDFE). Specifically, TTFA captures multiple types of temporal relationships between video snippets from different feature subspaces, while SDFE enhances the discriminative powers of features by clustering normal snippets and maximizing the separability between anomalous snippets and normal centers in embedding space. Experimental results on three public benchmarks indicate that WSTD outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and weakly supervised methods, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method.},

The outputs of the followers are controlled to track those of multiple leaders with respect to a convex point while achieving an expected time-varying formation. To obviate the requirement of various system prior knowledge in typical MAS control, a hierarchical frame is developed with three learning and control stages using the online measured data. First, a distributed adaptive observer is designed to coordinate the state convex of multiple leaders while estimating unknown dynamics. The adaptive mechanism relaxes the demand for global topology. Second, by collecting and reusing the online system data, an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed in a continuous form to acquire nominal feedback gains from partial observations of the followers. Essential system models are learned along with the RL process, while solutions to the output regulation equations are implicitly obtained. Third, a comprehensive robust controller is further presented based on the previous learning results. To address the actuator faults with efficiency loss and bias, the adaptive neural networks and robust compensations are utilized in a model-free manner. The output formation tracking is achieved under a derived feasibility condition while stabilities of the learning and control methods are analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity of this fully data-driven control frame.},

However, the quality of transfer solutions will significantly impact the transfer effect, which may even deteriorate the optimization performance with an improper selection of transfer solutions. To alleviate this issue, this article suggests a new multiobjective multitasking evolutionary algorithm (MMTEA) with decomposition-based transfer selection, called MMTEA-DTS. In this algorithm, all tasks are first decomposed into a set of subproblems, and then the transfer potential of each solution can be quantified based on the performance improvement ratio of its associated subproblem. Only high-potential solutions are selected to promote knowledge transfer. Moreover, to diversify the transfer of search experiences, a hybrid transfer evolution method is designed in this article. In this way, more diverse search experiences are transferred from high-potential solutions across different tasks to speed up their convergence. Three well-known benchmark suites suggested in the competition of evolutionary MTO and one real-world problem suite are used to verify the effectiveness of MMTEA-DTS. The experiments validate its advantages in solving most of the test problems when compared to five recently proposed MMTEAs.},

However, most current tensor decomposition models consider the rank-1 component simply to be the vector outer product, which may not fully capture the correlated spatial information effectively for large-scale and high-order multidimensional datasets. In this article, we develop a new novel tensor decomposition model by extending it to the matrix outer product or called Bhattacharya–Mesner product, to form an effective dataset decomposition. The fundamental idea is to decompose tensors structurally in a compact manner as much as possible while retaining data spatial characteristics in a tractable way. By incorporating the framework of the Bayesian inference, a new tensor decomposition model on the subtle matrix unfolding outer product is established for both tensor completion and robust principal component analysis problems, including hyperspectral image completion and denoising, traffic data imputation, and video background subtraction. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the highly desirable effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Hyperspectral images (HSIs) with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension are intrinsically three-order tensors. However, most of the existing anomaly detectors were designed after converting the 3-D HSI data into a matrix, which destroys the multidimension structure. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose a spatial invariant tensor self-representation (SITSR) hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm, which is derived based on the tensor–tensor product (t-product) to preserve the multidimension structure and achieve a comprehensive description of the global correlation of HSIs. Specifically, we exploit the t-product to integrate spectral information and spatial information, and the background image of each band is represented as the sum of the t-product of all bands and their corresponding coefficients. Considering the directionality of the t-product, we utilize two tensor self-representation methods with different spatial modes to obtain a more balanced and informative model. To depict the global correlation of the background, we merge the unfolding matrices of two representative coefficients and constrain them to lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, the group sparsity of anomaly is characterized by $l_{2.1.1}$ norm regularization to promote the separation of background and anomaly. Extensive experiments conducted on several real HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of SITSR compared with state-of-the-art anomaly detectors.},

The intricacy arises from the asymmetry inherent in information interaction. Achieving scaled position consensus in high-order multiagent systems over directed graphs remains a significant challenge, particularly when confronted with the following complex features: 1) uniformly jointly connected switching directed graphs; 2) complex agent dynamics with unknown inertias, unknown control directions, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances; 3) interacting with each other via only relative scaled position information (without high-order derivatives of relative position); and 4) fully distributed in terms of no shared gains and no global gain dependency. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed adaptive algorithm based on a acrlong MRACon scheme, where a linear high-order reference model is designed for every individual agent employing relative scaled position information as input. A new transformation is proposed which converts the scaled position consensus of high-order linear reference models to that of first-order ones. Theoretical analysis is presented where agents’ positions achieve the scaled consensus over switching directed graphs. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the efficacy of our algorithm and some collective behaviors on traditional consensus, bipartite consensus, and cluster consensus are shown by precisely choosing the scales of the agents.},

  abstract     = {Modeling correlations between multimodal physiological signals [e.g., canonical correlation analysis (CCA)] for emotion recognition has attracted much attention. However, existing studies rarely consider the neural nature of emotional responses within physiological signals. Furthermore, during fusion space construction, the CCA method maximizes only the correlations between different modalities and neglects the discriminative information of different emotional states. Most importantly, temporal mismatches between different neural activities are often ignored; therefore, the theoretical assumptions that multimodal data should be aligned in time and space before fusion are not fulfilled. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative correlation fusion method coupled with a temporal alignment mechanism for multimodal physiological signals. We first use neural signal analysis techniques to construct neural representations of the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS). respectively. Then, emotion class labels are introduced in CCA to obtain more discriminative fusion representations from multimodal neural responses, and the temporal alignment between the CNS and ANS is jointly optimized with a fusion procedure that applies the Bayesian algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the emotion recognition performance. Additionally, we show that this fusion method can model the underlying mechanisms in human nervous systems during emotional responses, and our results are consistent with prior findings. This study may guide a new approach for exploring human cognitive function based on physiological signals at different time scales and promote the development of computational intelligence and harmonious human–computer interactions.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is capable of obtaining the high-resolution 2-D image of the interested target scene, which enables advanced remote sensing and military applications, such as missile terminal guidance. In this article, the terminal trajectory planning for SAR imaging guidance is first investigated. It is found that the guidance performance of an attack platform is determined by the adopted terminal trajectory. Therefore, the aim of the terminal trajectory planning is to generate a set of feasible flight paths to guide the attack platform toward the target and meanwhile obtain the optimized SAR imaging performance for enhanced guidance precision. The trajectory planning is then modeled as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem given a high-dimensional search space, where the trajectory control and SAR imaging performance are comprehensively considered. By utilizing the temporal-order-dependent property of the trajectory planning problem, a chronological iterative search framework (CISF) is proposed. The problem is decomposed into a series of subproblems, where the search space, objective functions, and constraints are reformulated in chronological order. The difficulty of solving the trajectory planning problem is thus significantly alleviated. Then, the search strategy of CISF is devised to solve the subproblems successively. The optimization results of the preceding subproblem can be utilized as the initial input of the subsequent subproblems to enhance the convergence and search performance. Finally, a trajectory planning method is put forward based on CISF. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CISF compared with the state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary methods. The proposed trajectory planning method can generate a set of feasible terminal trajectories with optimized mission performance.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and intelligent exploration remains a major challenge in the field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Bayesian inference with a distributional representation is usually an effective way to improve the exploration ability of the RL agent. However, when optimizing Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), most algorithms need to specify an explicit parameter distribution such as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This may reduce the flexibility of model representation and affect the algorithm performance. Therefore, to improve sample efficiency and exploration based on Bayesian methods, we propose a novel implicit posteriori parameter distribution optimization (IPPDO) algorithm. First, we adopt a distributional perspective on the parameter and model it with an implicit distribution, which is approximated by generative models. Each model corresponds to a learned latent space, providing structured stochasticity for each layer in the network. Next, to make it possible to optimize an implicit posteriori parameter distribution, we build an energy-based model (EBM) with value function to represent the implicit distribution which is not constrained by any analytic density function. Then, we design a training algorithm based on amortized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to improve the model learning efficiency. We compare IPPDO with other prevailing DRL algorithms on the OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo, and Box2D platforms. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can represent the parameter uncertainty implicitly for a learned policy and can consistently outperform competing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fractional-order derivatives have the potential to improve the performance of backpropagation (BP) neural networks. Several studies have found that the fractional-order gradient learning methods may not converge to real extreme points. The truncation and the modification of the fractional-order derivative are applied to guarantee convergence to the real extreme point. Nonetheless, the real convergence ability is based on the assumption that the algorithm is convergent, which limits the practicality of the algorithm. In this article, a novel truncated fractional-order BP neural network (TFO-BPNN) and a novel hybrid TFO-BPNN (HTFO-BPNN) are designed to solve the above problem. First, to avoid overfitting, a squared regularization term is introduced into the fractional-order BP neural network. Second, a novel dual cross-entropy cost function is proposed and employed as a loss function for the two neural networks. The penalty parameter helps to adjust the effect of the penalty term and further alleviates the gradient vanishing problem. In terms of convergence, the convergence ability of the two proposed neural networks is first proved. Then, the convergence ability to the real extreme point is further analyzed theoretically. Finally, the simulation results effectively illustrate the feasibility, high accuracy, and good generalization ability of the proposed neural networks. Comparative studies among the proposed neural networks and some related methods further substantiate the superiority of the TFO-BPNN and the HTFO-BPNN.},

Then, the infinite and finite-dimensional backstepping methods are skillfully applied to the design of control schemes. Specifically, the infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation and its inverse are utilized to obtain a new PDE subsystem, which is convenient for control design. Next, based on the new target PDE-ODE cascade system, a novel first-order filter is subtly introduced into each step of the finite-dimensional backstepping-based controller design procedure to avoid the issue of “explosion of complexity.” Furthermore, a novel barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed to guarantee that the states of the ODE subsystem do not violate the constraints. The controller designed in this article ensures that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the states can converge to zero. Finally, a simulation example verifies that the proposed scheme can achieve satisfactory performance.},

  abstract     = {This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering-based neural networks (FCNNs) based on information granulation techniques have been shown to be effective Takagi–Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy models. However, the existing FCNNs could not cope well with sequential learning tasks. In this study, we introduce incremental FCNNs (IFCNNs), which could dynamically update themselves whenever new learning data (e.g., single datum or block data) are incorporated into the dataset. Specifically, we employ dynamic (incremental) fuzzy C-means (FCMs) clustering algorithms to reveal a structure in data and divide the entire input space into several subregions. In the aforementioned partition, the dynamic FCM adaptively adjusts the position of its prototypes by using sequential data. Due to the time-sharing arrival of training data, compared with batch learning models, incremental learning methods may lose classification (prediction) accuracy. In order to tackle this challenge, we utilize quasi-fuzzy local models (QFLMs) based on modified Schmidt neural networks to replace the popular linear functions in TS-type fuzzy models to refine and enhance the ability to represent the behavior of fuzzy subspaces. Meanwhile, the recursive least square error (LSE) estimation is utilized to update the weights of QFLMs from one-by-one or block-by-block (fixed or varying block size) learning data. In addition, the $L_{2}$ regularization is considered to ameliorate the deterioration of generalization abilities caused by potential overfitting when carrying out weight estimation. The proposed method leads to the construction of FCNNs in a new way, which can effectively deal with incremental data as well as deliver sound generalization capability. Extensive machine-learning datasets and a real-world application are employed to show the validity and performance of the presented methods. From the experimental results, we show that the proposal can maintain sound classification accuracy when effectively processing sequential data.},

Most previous works assume that they can access enough interaction history to build the model. However, it may not be realistic. To solve this problem, we present a novel rationality-consistent opponent modeling (ROM) method for games with imperfect information. In our approach, a game-theoretical concept of consistence about rationality is proposed to take advantage of the characteristic of imperfect information sequential games that rational behavior at disjoint information sets is correlated through anticipated opponent’s behavior. With the correlation between different information sets, agents could infer the opponents’ strategies at information sets correlated to observed behavior. To exploit the correlation, ROM attempts to conduct reasoning from the opponent’s perspective and rationalize its past behavior. In this way, ROM acquires the ability to better adapt to different opponents and achieves a more accurate opponent model with insufficient observation history, which is verified by experiments in different settings. A heuristic adaptation approach is also applied in ROM, which updates the opponent model in an online manner and significantly reduces the computation cost. We evaluate ROM in both a grid world game and a poker game. Compared with other opponent modeling methods, ROM shows better performance and has more accurate predictions in both games against different types of opponents with limited action interactions. Experimental results also show that ROM’s time cost is significantly reduced through heuristic adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Given a network, it is well recognized that attributed network embedding represents each node of the network in a low-dimensional space, and, thus, brings considerable benefits for numerous graph mining tasks. In practice, a diverse set of graph tasks can be processed efficiently via the compact representation that preserves content and structure information. The majority of attributed network embedding approaches, especially, the graph neural network (GNN) algorithms, are substantially costly in either time or space due to the expensive learning process, while the randomized hashing technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which does not need learning, can speedup the embedding process at the expense of losing some accuracy. In this article, we propose the MPSketch model, which bridges the performance gap between the GNN framework and the LSH framework by adopting the LSH technique to pass messages and capture high-order proximity in a larger aggregated information pool from the neighborhood. The extensive experimental results confirm that in node classification and link prediction, the proposed MPSketch algorithm enjoys performance comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms and outperforms the existing LSH algorithms, while running faster than the GNN algorithms by 3–4 orders of magnitude.

The authors provide three contributions: 1) a searching mechanism to obtain the approximate value of the practical input signal from the so-called hysteretic temporary control law; 2) the arbitrarily small $\mathit {L}_{\infty }$ norm of the tracking error attained by utilizing the proposed initializing technique, which applies the combination of FLSs and a finite covering lemma to deal with time delays; and 3) the construction of a triple-axis giant magnetostrictive motion control platform, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In practical assembly enterprises, customization and rush orders lead to an uncertain demand environment. This situation requires managers and researchers to configure an assembly line that increases production efficiency and robustness. Hence, this work addresses cost-oriented mixed-model multimanned assembly line balancing under uncertain demand, and presents a new robust mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the production and penalty costs simultaneously. In addition, a reinforcement learning-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is designed to tackle the problem. The algorithm includes a priority-based solution representation and a new task-worker-sequence decoding that considers robustness processing and idle time reductions. Five crossover and three mutation operators are proposed. The $Q$ -learning-based strategy determines the crossover and mutation operator at each iteration to effectively obtain Pareto sets of solutions. Finally, a time-based probability-adaptive strategy is designed to effectively coordinate the crossover and mutation operators. The experimental study, based on 269 benchmark instances, demonstrates that the proposal outperforms 11 competitive MOEAs and a previous single-objective approach to the problem. The managerial insights from the results as well as the limitations of the algorithm are also highlighted.},

The topographic information, described as a form of friction in the double-integrator system, affects the velocity and acceleration of the target and agents. The target information required by the tracking agents consists of position, velocity, and acceleration. We can obtain practical rendezvous results when agents utilize only target position and velocity information. If the acceleration data of the target is accessible, we can get the complete rendezvous result using an additional control term in the form of the Coriolis force.

  abstract     = {An optimal energy scheduling strategy for integrated energy systems (IESs) can effectively improve the energy utilization efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Due to the large-scale state space of IES caused by uncertain factors, it would be beneficial for the model training process to formulate a reasonable state-space representation. Thus, a condition knowledge representation and feedback learning framework based on contrastive reinforcement learning is designed in this study. Considering that different state conditions would bring inconsistent daily economic costs, a dynamic optimization model based on deterministic deep policy gradient is established, so that the condition samples can be partitioned according to the preoptimized daily costs. In order to represent the overall conditions on a daily basis and constrain the uncertain states in the IES environment, the state-space representation is constructed by a contrastive network considering the time dependence of variables. A Monte-Carlo policy gradient-based learning architecture is further proposed to optimize the condition partition and improve the policy learning performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, typical load operation scenarios of an IES are used in our simulations. The human experience strategies and state-of-the-art approaches are selected for comparisons. The results validate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of cost effectiveness and ability to adapt in uncertain environments.},

We first characterize a density path which corresponds to the expected evolution of the macroscopic state of the MT system, which is represented by the probability density function (PDF) of a time-varying Gaussian mixture (GM). We compute this density path by using an adaptive optimal control method which accounts for the distribution of the (possibly moving) obstacles over the environment described by a time-varying obstacle map function. We show that each target of the MT system can find microscopic inputs that can collectively realize the density path while guaranteeing obstacle avoidance at all times. Subsequently, we propose a Voronoi distributed motion coordination algorithm which determines the individual microscopic control inputs of each agent of the MA network so that the latter can track the MT system while avoiding collisions with obstacles and their teammates. The proposed algorithm relies on a distributed move-to-centroid control law in which the density over the Voronoi cell of each agent is determined by the estimated macroscopic state evolution of the MT system. Finally, simulation results are presented to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Such a linear regression analysis can be easily applied for linear estimation and equalization in signal processing for cybernetics. Nonetheless, the current LS approach for linear regression is unfortunately limited to the dimensionality of data, that is, the exact LS solution can involve only a data matrix. As the dimension of data increases and such data need to be represented by a tensor, the corresponding exact tensor-based LS (TLS) solution does not exist due to the lack of a pertinent mathematical framework. Lately, some alternatives such as tensor decomposition and tensor unfolding were proposed to approximate the TLS solutions to the linear regression problems involving tensor data, but these techniques cannot provide the exact or true TLS solution. In this work, we would like to make the first-ever attempt to present a new mathematical framework for facilitating the exact TLS solutions involving tensor data. To demonstrate the applicability of our proposed new scheme, numerical experiments regarding machine learning and robust speech recognition are illustrated and the associated memory and computational complexities are also studied.},

In the proposed framework, a fast nonsingular terminal sliding surface is first developed such that the singularity problem is avoided and the convergence rate is improved. Then, we design a continuous modified super-twisting algorithm with an adaptive gain, under which the need for the bounds information of the disturbance and its derivative is relaxed and the performance of the closed-loop system is enhanced. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove the finite-time convergence of the system states to small regions containing the origin.

Most existing studies pertaining to the visual servoing of mobile manipulators do not consider the kinematic uncertainties and the singularity of the manipulator that can occur during actual operations; furthermore, they required external sensors other than a single camera. In this study, the kinematics of an OMM are modeled considering kinematic uncertainties. Accordingly, an integral sliding-mode observer (ISMO) is designed to estimate the kinematic uncertainties. Subsequently, an integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) law is proposed to achieve robust visual servoing using the estimates of the ISMO. Additionally, an ISMO–ISMC-based HVS method is proposed to address the singularity issue of the manipulator; this method guarantees both robustness and finite-time stability in the presence of kinematic uncertainties. Overall, the entire visual servoing task is performed using only a single camera attached to the end effector without any other external sensors, unlike in previous studies. The stability and performance of the proposed method are verified numerically and experimentally in a slippery environment that generates kinematic uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Active pantograph control is the most promising technique for reducing contact force (CF) fluctuation and improving the train’s current collection quality. Existing solutions, however, suffer from two significant limitations: 1) they are incapable of dealing with the various pantograph types, catenary line operating conditions, changing operating speeds, and contingencies well and 2) it is challenging to implement in practical systems due to the lack of rapid adaptability to a new pantograph-catenary system (PCS) operating conditions and environmental disturbances. In this work, we alleviate these problems by developing a revolutionary context-based deep meta-reinforcement learning (CB-DMRL) algorithm. The proposed CB-DMRL algorithm combines Bayesian optimization (BO) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), allowing the general agent to adapt to new tasks quickly and efficiently. We evaluated the CB-DMRL algorithm’s performance on a proven PCS model. The experimental results demonstrate that meta-training DRL policies with latent space swiftly adapt to new operating conditions and unknown perturbations. The meta-agent adapts quickly after two iterations with a high reward, which require only ten spans, approximately equal to 0.5 km of PCS interaction data. Compared with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and traditional solutions, the proposed method can promptly traverse scenario changes and reduce CF fluctuations, resulting in an excellent performance.},

As the most common use case for the intelligence industry, a lot of studies based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been conducted to improve the performances of single peg-in-hole assembly. However, existing RL methods are difficult to apply to multiple peg-in-hole issues due to more complicated geometric and physical constraints. In addition, previously limited solutions for multiple peg-in-hole assembly are hard to transfer into real industrial scenarios flexibly. To effectively address these issues, this work designs a novel and more challenging multiple peg-in-hole assembly setup by using the advantage of the Industrial Metaverse. We propose a detailed solution scheme to solve this task. Specifically, multiple modalities, including vision, proprioception, and force/torque, are learned as compact representations to account for the complexity and uncertainties and improve the sample efficiency. Furthermore, RL is used in the simulation to train the policy, and the learned policy is transferred to the real world without extra exploration. Domain randomization and impedance control are embedded into the policy to narrow the gap between simulation and reality. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, showcasing successful multiple peg-in-hole assembly and generalization across different object shapes in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Industries, such as manufacturing, are accelerating their embrace of the metaverse to achieve higher productivity, especially in complex industrial scheduling. In view of the growing parking challenges in large cities, high-density vehicle spatial scheduling is one of the potential solutions. Stack-based parking lots utilize parking robots to densely park vehicles in the vertical stacks like container stacking, which greatly reduces the aisle area in the parking lot, but requires complex scheduling algorithms to park and take out the vehicles. The existing high-density parking (HDP) scheduling algorithms are mainly heuristic methods, which only contain simple logic and are difficult to utilize information effectively. We propose a hybrid residual multiexpert (HIRE) reinforcement learning (RL) approach, a method for interactive learning in the digital industrial metaverse, which efficiently solves the HDP batch space scheduling problem. In our proposed framework, each heuristic scheduling method is considered as an expert. The neural network trained by RL assigns the expert strategy according to the current parking lot state. Furthermore, to avoid being limited by heuristic expert performance, the proposed hierarchical network framework also sets up a residual output channel. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms various advanced heuristic methods and the end-to-end RL method in the number of vehicle maneuvers, and has good robustness to the parking lot size and the estimation accuracy of vehicle exit time. We believe that the proposed HIRE RL method can be effectively and conveniently applied to practical application scenarios, which can be regarded as a key step for RL to enter the practical application stage of the industrial metaverse.},

  abstract     = {Early classification predicts the class of the incoming sequences before it is completely observed. How to quickly classify streaming time series without losing interpretability through early classification method is a challenging problem. A novel memory shapelet learning framework for early classification is proposed in this article. First, a memory distance matrix is introduced to store the historical characteristics of streaming time series, which can alleviate repetitive calculations caused by the growing length of time series. Second, early interpretable shapelets are extracted in the proposed method by optimizing both accuracy objective and earliness objective simultaneously. The proposed method employs end-to-end learning, which allows the model to directly learn early shapelets without the necessity of searching for numerous candidate shapelets. Third, an objective function of memory shapelet learning is proposed by overall considering accuracy and earliness, which can be optimized by gradient descent algorithm. Finally, experiments are conducted on benchmark dataset UCR, Tennessee Eastman process, and real-world aluminum electrolysis process in China. Comparable results with other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in interpretability, accuracy, earliness, and time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot fault diagnosis is a challenging problem for complex engineering systems due to the shortage of enough annotated failure samples. This problem is increased by varying working conditions that are commonly encountered in real-world systems. Meta-learning is a promising strategy to solve this point, open issues remain unresolved in practical applications, such as domain adaptation, domain generalization, etc. This article attempts to improve domain adaptation and generalization by focusing on the distribution-shift robustness of meta-learning from the task generation perspective. In fact, few-shot fault diagnosis under varying working conditions allows to address the distribution shift problem in a natural way. An unsupervised across-tasks meta-learning strategy with distributional similarity preference is proposed, where the core is the distribution-distance-weighting mechanism. Differently from the naive random meta-train task generation strategy used in existing meta-learning methods, the source instances that present a more similar distribution with respect to the target instances gain larger weightings in the task generation. This strategy leads to a meta-task training set that is enough diverse, and at the same time can be easily learned due to the distribution similarity features of the source tasks. The proposed method introduces the concept of maximum mean discrepancy that is applied to derive the distribution distance of the measurements. Moreover, a model-agnostic meta-learning is applied to realize few-shot fault diagnosis under varying working conditions. The proposed solutions are verified and compared by considering two public datasets used for bearing fault diagnosis. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms different related few-shot fault diagnosis methods under varying working conditions. Moreover, it is thus proved that, meta-learning with distribution similarity feature represents an effective approach for domain adaptation and generalization.},

In this context, multiple real and complex concept drifts are inevitable in industrial settings, making it crucial to understand their detection and adaptation processes. The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues. In this article, a dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed a dynamic model interpretation-guided learning scheme (DMI-LS), is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Image anomaly detection (IAD) is an emerging and vital computer vision task in industrial manufacturing (IM). Recently, many advanced algorithms have been reported, but their performance deviates considerably with various IM settings. We realize that the lack of a uniform IM benchmark is hindering the development and usage of IAD methods in real-world applications. In addition, it is difficult for researchers to analyze IAD algorithms without a uniform benchmark. To solve this problem, we propose a uniform IM benchmark, for the first time, to assess how well these algorithms perform, which includes various levels of supervision (unsupervised versus fully supervised), learning paradigms (few-shot, continual and noisy label), and efficiency (memory usage and inference speed). Then, we construct a comprehensive IAD benchmark (IM-IAD), which includes 19 algorithms on seven major datasets with a uniform setting. Extensive experiments (17 017 total) on IM-IAD provide in-depth insights into IAD algorithm redesign or selection. Moreover, the proposed IM-IAD benchmark challenges existing algorithms and suggests future research directions.

The metaverse technology offers an available simulated-reality-based platform to verify the proposed method. The hybrid controller contains two main parts. A muscle-synergy-based radial basis function (RBF) network is proposed as the feedforward controller, which is able to characterize the phasic and the tonic muscle synergies simultaneously. The adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is applied as the feedback controller to address the optimal control problem. The actor–critic structure is applied in the ADP-based controller, where the critic network is trained to approximate the optimal performance index and the actor network is trained to compute the optimal muscle excitations. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the ADP algorithm are also analyzed. Finally, experiments have been designed to verify the effectiveness of this hybrid controller on an upper limb musculoskeletal system, and the comparisons with other controllers are also illustrated.

Therefore, a multiscale attention-based CNN (MSACNN) is proposed in this article to alleviate such problems. In MSACNN, convolutional kernels of different sizes are first designed in parallel in the convolutional layers, which can generate feature maps containing local spatiotemporal features at different scales. Meanwhile, a channel-wise attention mechanism is designed on the feature maps in parallel to get their attention weights, representing the significance of the local spatiotemporal feature at different scales. The superiority of the proposed MSACNN over the other state-of-the-art methods is validated through the performance evaluation in two real industrial processes.},

When acting these attacks successfully, random data losses and disorders are caused in the forward and feedback channels.

In this scheme, a dynamic model of networked multiagent system is established with the help of a HOFA system model, which is called the HOFANMAS.

Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to analyze the consensus and stability of closed-loop HOFANMASs.

This article considers the output formation-containment problem for MASs under multipoint multipattern false data injection (FDI) attacks. The multipoint describes the attacks simultaneously occurring on the sensors, actuators, and communication channels; the multipattern captures that sensor and actuator attack signals are both continuous deterministic variables, and the communication channel attack signals are intermittent random variables, obeying the Bernoulli distribution. For such compromised MASs, a novel hybrid protocol is proposed, which integrates a state observer, an attack estimator, an impulsive interactor and a compensation controller. Thereinto, the state observer and the attack estimator are constructed to recover the unmeasured system states and the unknown FDI attack signals, respectively; the impulsive interactor is designed to guarantee that the neighbor’s signals are transmitted only at impulsive instants, and meanwhile the channel attacks are randomly launched; using the recovered signals, the compensation controller is devised to alleviate the effect of attacks. A sufficient condition is identified, under which the output formation containment is achieved with cooperative uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB).

  abstract     = {Appearance-based gaze estimation has been widely studied recently with promising performance. The majority of appearance-based gaze estimation methods are developed under the deterministic frameworks. However, the deterministic gaze estimation methods suffer from large performance drop upon challenging eye images in low-resolution, darkness, partial occlusions, etc. To alleviate this problem, in this article, we alternatively reformulate the appearance-based gaze estimation problem under a generative framework. Specifically, we propose a variational inference model, that is, variational gaze estimation network (VGE-Net), to generate multiple gaze maps as complimentary candidates simultaneously supervised by the ground-truth gaze map. To achieve robust estimation, we adaptively fuse the gaze directions predicted on these candidate gaze maps by a regression network through a simple attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks, that is, MPIIGaze, EYEDIAP, and Columbia, demonstrate that our VGE-Net outperforms state-of-the-art gaze estimation methods, especially on challenging cases. Comprehensive ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of our contributions. The code will be publicly released.},

  abstract     = {Visual reasoning between visual images and natural language is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Most of the methods aim to look for answers to questions only on the basis of the analysis of the offered questions and images. Other approaches treat knowledge graphs as flattened tables to search for the answer. However, there are two major problems with these works: 1) the model disregards the fact that the world we surrounding us interlinks our hearing and speaking of natural language and 2) the model largely ignores the structure of the acrlong KG. To overcome these challenging deficiencies, a model should jointly consider two modalities of vision and language, as well as the rich structural and logical information embedded in knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a general joint representation learning framework for visual reasoning, namely, knowledge-embedded mutual guidance. It realizes mutual guidance not only between visual data and natural language descriptions but also between knowledge graphs and reasoning models. In addition, it exploits the knowledge derived from the reasoning model to boost knowledge graphs when applying the visual relation detection task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks for visual reasoning.},

  abstract     = {This work solves the countermeasure design problems of distributed resilient output time-varying formation-tracking (TVFT) of heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) against general Byzantine attacks (GBAs). Inspired by the concept of Digital Twin, a hierarchical protocol equipped with a twin layer (TL) is proposed, which decouples the above problem into the defense against Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs) on the TL and the defense against Byzantine node attacks (BNAs) on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). First, a secure TL with respect to (w.r.t.) the high-order leader dynamics is designed, which achieves resilient estimation against BEAs. A trusted-node strategy against BEAs is proposed, which promotes network resilience by protecting almost the smallest fraction of crucial nodes on the TL. It is proven that strongly $(2f+1)$ -robustness w.r.t. the above trusted nodes is sufficient for the resilient estimation performance of the TL. Second, a decentralized adaptive and chattering-free controller against potentially unbounded BNAs is designed on the CPL. This controller has the merit of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence and an assignable exponential decay rate when converging into the above UUB bound. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to achieve resilient output TVFT against GBAs, rather than under GBAs. Finally, the practicability and validity of this new hierarchical protocol are illustrated via a simulation example.},

The communication from the controller to actuators is scheduled via a stochastic protocol modeled as Markov chain, by which only one controller node is permitted to transmit its data at each instant. A compensator for other unavailable controller nodes is introduced by means of previous transmitted signals at two most adjacent points. To characterize the features of 2-D FMII systems state recursion and stochastic scheduling protocol, a sliding function associated with the states at both the present and previous positions is constructed, and a scheduling signal-dependent SMC law is designed. By constructing token- and parameter-dependent Lyapunov functionals, both the reachability of the specified sliding surface and the uniform ultimate boundedness in the mean-square sense of the closed-loop system are analyzed and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the convergent bound via searching desirable sliding matrices, meanwhile, a feasible solving procedure is provided by using the differential evolution algorithm. Finally, the proposed control scheme is further demonstrated via simulation results.},

It is assumed that data transmission between sensors requires energy consumption, and each sensor can harvest energy from the external environment. A Poisson process models the energy harvested by each sensor, and the sensor’s transmission decision depends on its current energy level. One can obtain the sensor transmission probability through a recursive calculation of the probability distribution of the energy level. Under such energy harvesting constraints, the proposed estimator only uses local and neighbor data to simultaneously estimate the system state and the fault, thereby establishing a distributed estimation framework. Moreover, the estimation error covariance is determined to possess an upper bound, which is minimized by devising energy-based filtering parameters. The convergence performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed. Finally, a practical example is presented to verify the usefulness of the main results.},

In this article, “multitype state constraint” means that the upper and lower constraint boundaries include multiple types, such as both being strictly positive (or negative), sometime be positive or negative, and so on (cases ①–⑥). By designing a unified mapping function (UMF), the multitype state constraints are processed under removal the feasibility conditions (FCs). Furthermore, a technical design makes the proposed method also applicable to unconstrained HONSs without changing the control structure. By means of a fuzzy-logic system (FLS) and fixed-time stability theory (FTST), the proposed algorithm can ensure that the tracking error converges to a zero-centered neighborhood within a fixed time, and the singularity which often appears in the existing fixed-time control (FTC) methods of HONSs is effectively avoided.

The adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is extended to approximately obtain the optimal strategy for the interaction system to reduce the populations of TCs. Due to the consideration of asymmetric control constraints, the nonquadratic functions are proposed to formulate the value function such that the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (HJBE) is derived which can be deemed as the cornerstone of ADP algorithms. Then, the ADP method of a single-critic network architecture which integrates MDRM is proposed to obtain the approximate solutions of HJBE and eventually derive the optimal strategy. The design of MDRM makes it possible for the dosage of the agentia containing oncolytic virus particles to be regulated timely and necessarily. Furthermore, the uniform ultimate boundedness of the system states and critic weight estimation errors is validated by Lyapunov stability analysis.

First, we put forward a distributed switched cascade compensator by introducing multiple equations, and we design the delay-dependent distributed output feedback controller with the compensator.

  abstract     = {The relational triplet is a format to represent relational facts in the real world, which consists of two entities and a semantic relation between these two entities. Since the relational triplet is the essential component in a knowledge graph (KG), extracting relational triplets from unstructured texts is vital for KG construction and has attached increasing research interest in recent years. In this work, we find that relation correlation is common in real life and could be beneficial for the relational triplet extraction task. However, existing relational triplet extraction works neglect to explore the relation correlation that bottlenecks the model performance. Therefore, to better explore and take advantage of the correlation among semantic relations, we innovatively utilize a three-dimension word relation tensor to describe relations between words in a sentence. Then, we treat the relation extraction task as a tensor learning problem and propose an end-to-end tensor learning model based on Tucker decomposition. Compared with directly capturing correlation among relations in a sentence, learning the correlation of elements in a three-dimension word relation tensor is more feasible and could be addressed through tensor learning methods. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, extensive experiments are also conducted on two widely used benchmark datasets, that is, NYT and WebNLG. Results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of F1 scores, such as the developed model has an improvement of 3.2% on the NYT dataset compared to the state-of-the-art.

First, for removing the assumption that all agents are required to know the information of leader’s system matrices and the upper boundary of its unknown control input in previous studies, a kind of finite-time observer is constructed by exploiting the neighboring information, which can estimate not only the leader’s state and system matrices but also can compensate for the effects of unknown input. On the basis of the developed finite-time observers and adaptive output regulation method, a novel finite-time distributed output TVFT controller is proposed with the help of the technique of coordinate transformation by introducing an extra variable, which removes the assumption that the generalized inverse matrix of follows’ input matrix needs to be found in the existing results. By means of the Lyapunov and finite-time stability theory, it is proven that the expected finite-time output TVFT can be realized by the considered heterogeneous nonlinear MASs within a finite time.

  abstract     = {Neural networks have been widely investigated for the control of robot manipulators and recurrent neural network (RNN) is accepted as a powerful tool for visual servoing. Different from existing control schemes for robot–camera systems, this article proposes a novel image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control scheme for both the regulation and tracking control of robot manipulators in the framework of a special class of RNN, termed zeroing neural network (ZNN), which does not require prior knowledge about camera configuration and kinematic model parameters. The proposed control scheme is composed of a data-driven mapping estimator and a controller, both of which are designed based on ZNN. To facilitate the deployment of the proposed IBVS control scheme, a discrete-time version of the proposed control scheme is developed. Theoretical analysis for the proposed method is presented in terms of convergence, stability, and robustness. In addition, simulations and experiments are carried out based on different types of robot–camera systems to verify the efficacy and portability of the proposed control scheme for solving regulation and trajectory IBVS problems. Moreover, comparative studies are performed to reveal the merits of the proposed control scheme.},

Toward this end, graph theory is used to allow us to synthesize the distributed controller with a stability guarantee. Due to the fact that the parameter uncertainties only arise in the vessels’ dynamic model, the backstepping control technique is then employed. Subsequently, to overcome the difficulties in handling time-varying and unknown systems, an online learning procedure is developed in the proposed distributed formation control protocol. Moreover, modeling errors, environmental disturbances, and measurement noises are considered and tackled by introducing a neurodynamics model in the controller design to obtain a robust solution. Then, the stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system under the proposed scheme is provided to ensure the robust adaptive performance at the theoretical level.

  abstract     = {Classification is a fundamental task in the field of data mining. Unfortunately, high-dimensional data often degrade the performance of classification. To solve this problem, dimensionality reduction is usually adopted as an essential preprocessing technique, which can be divided into feature extraction and feature selection. Due to the ability to obtain category discrimination, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is recognized as a classic feature extraction method for classification. Compared with feature extraction, feature selection has plenty of advantages in many applications. If we can integrate the discrimination of LDA and the advantages of feature selection, it is bound to play an important role in the classification of high-dimensional data. Motivated by the idea, we propose a supervised feature selection method for classification. It combines trace ratio LDA with $\ell _{2,p}$ -norm regularization and imposes the orthogonal constraint on the projection matrix. The learned row-sparse projection matrix can be used to select discriminative features. Then, we present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed method. Finally, the extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This article proposes a method on the exponential synchronization for the Markovian jump neural networks, which is achieved by designing a new asynchronous delayed-feedback controller, with its feedback delay taken into account. The quantized relationship between the exponential synchronization and the feedback delay is derived from a new designed Lyapunov functional, to acquire delay boundaries. With the help of a hidden-Markov process, the designed controller shows asynchrony, which allows controller modes to run free. In particular, the detection probability is assumed to be bounded known, marking a breakthrough over existing results. Moreover, the proposed method proves to be applicable in both synchronous and asynchronous cases. By using the proposed method, the computation freedom of the controller gain matrix can be substantially augmented. Further, comparative numerical studies are implemented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

Since a jointly strongly connected network can be directed and disconnected at every time instant, our result strictly includes the existing results as special cases. Moreover, in addition to some analytic conditions on the payoff functions, the existing results also rely on the satisfaction of an inequality involving some Lipschitz constant and the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the network graph. By adopting a different approach, our result does not rely on the satisfaction of this inequality.

This article further improves PPLS/D by introducing two new cooperative process techniques, namely, a cooperative search mechanism and a cooperative subregion-adjusting strategy. In the cooperative search mechanism, the parallel processes share high-quality solutions with each other during the search according to a distributed topology. In the proposed subregion-adjusting strategy, a master process collects useful information from all processes during the search to approximate the Pareto front (PF) and redivide the subregions evenly.

An event-triggered scheme (ETS) is designed to reduce the workload of data transmission, which is effective to select some most useful information to transmit and discard some redundant data. DoS attacks can block the data transmission when it is active, so a resilient event-triggered $H_{\infty } $ control method is built based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The exponential stability of the controlled suspension system, as well as the $H_{\infty } $ performance, is analyzed in this article.

  abstract     = {Benign and malignant classification of clustered microcalcifications (MCs) in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an essential task in computer-aided diagnosis. However, due to the anisotropic resolution of DBT, three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods cannot extract hierarchical features efficiently. Moreover, the sparse distribution of MC points in the cluster makes it difficult for the CNN to extract discriminative structural information for classification. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a novel structure-aware hierarchical network (SAH-Net) for benign and malignant classification of clustered MC in a DBT volume. Specifically, the two-dimensional (2-D) group convolution is used to extract intraslice features. The one-to-one correspondence between group convolutions and slices ensures the independence of hierarchical feature extraction. Then, a partial deformable Transformer-based 3-D structural feature learning module is proposed to capture the long-range dependency between MC points in the cluster. We evaluate the proposed method on an in-house dataset with 495 clustered MCs collected from 462 DBT images. Experimental results confirm the validity of our proposed modules. The results also show that the proposed SAH-Net outperforms several other representative methods on this topic, and achieves the best classification result, with an area under the receiver operation curve (AUC) of 86.87%.

In general, an optimal control method is regarded as an optimization process for solving the optimal control laws. However, for uncertain nonlinear systems with complex optimization objectives, the solving of optimal reference trajectories is difficult and significant that might be ignored to obtain robust performance. For this problem, a double-closed-loop robust optimal control (DCL-ROC) is proposed to maintain the optimal control reliability of uncertain nonlinear systems. First, a double-closed-loop scheme is established to divide the optimal control process into a closed-loop optimization process that solves optimal reference trajectories and a closed-loop control process that solves optimal control laws. Then, the ability of the optimal control method can be improved to solve complex uncertain optimization problems. Second, a closed-loop robust optimization (CL-RO) algorithm is developed to express uncertain optimization objectives as data-driven forms and adjust optimal reference trajectories in a close loop. Then, the optimality of reference trajectories can be improved under uncertainties. Third, the optimal reference trajectories are tracked by an adaptive controller to derive the optimal control laws without certain system dynamics. Then, the adaptivity and reliability of optimal control laws can be improved.

  abstract     = {For various typical cases and situations where the formulation results in an optimal control problem, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach and its variants continue to be highly attractive. In certain scenarios, it can happen that some prescribed structural constraints on the gain matrix would arise. Consequently then, the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) is no longer applicable in a straightforward way to obtain the optimal solution. This work presents a rather effective alternative optimization approach based on gradient projection. The utilized gradient is obtained through a data-driven methodology, and then projected onto applicable constrained hyperplanes. Essentially, this projection gradient determines a direction of progression and computation for the gain matrix update with a decreasing functional cost; and then the gain matrix is further refined in an iterative framework. With this formulation, a data-driven optimization algorithm is summarized for controller synthesis with structural constraints. This data-driven approach has the key advantage that it avoids the necessity of precise modeling which is always required in the classical model-based counterpart; and thus the approach can additionally accommodate various model uncertainties. Illustrative examples are also provided in the work to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The networked structure has attracted significant attention due to high demand for industrial systems and rapid developments of network communication. Among various network randomness, fading is a common phenomenon, which can lead to signal attenuation, distortion, loss, and interference. This study concentrates on the point-to-point tracking problem via fading communications by proposing a reference update strategy. Using this strategy, the tracking performance is continuously improved even with faded information as the number of iterations increases. A learning control scheme is established and proved convergent in both mean-square and almost-sure senses under mild conditions. The convergence rate is accelerated by introducing the virtual reference compared with the traditional update approach. Illustrative simulations verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of impulse noise image restoration is investigated. A typical way to eliminate impulse noise is to use an $L_{1}$ norm data fitting term and a total variation (TV) regularization. However, a convex optimization method designed in this way always yields staircase artifacts. In addition, the $L_{1}$ norm fitting term tends to penalize corrupted and noise-free data equally, and is not robust to impulse noise. In order to seek a solution of high recovery quality, we propose a new variational model that integrates the nonconvex data fitting term and the nonconvex TV regularization. The usage of the nonconvex TV regularizer helps to eliminate the staircase artifacts. Moreover, the nonconvex fidelity term can detect impulse noise effectively in the way that it is enforced when the observed data is slightly corrupted, while is less enforced for the severely corrupted pixels. A novel difference of convex functions algorithm is also developed to solve the variational model. Using the variational method, we prove that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the nonconvex objective function. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is efficient and compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Wearable walking exoskeletons show great potentials in helping patients with neuro musculoskeletal stroke. Key to the successful applications is the design of effective walking trajectories that enable smooth walking for exoskeletons. This work proposes a walking planning method based on the divergent component of motion to obtain a stable joint angle trajectory. Since periodic and nonperiodic disturbances are ubiquitous in the repeating walking motion of an exoskeleton system, a major challenge in the walking control of wearable exoskeleton is the joint angle drift problem, that is, the joint angle motion trajectories are not necessarily periodic due to the presence of disturbance. To address this challenge, this work develops an adaptive repetitive control strategy to guarantee that the motion trajectories of joint angle are repetitive. In particular, by treating the disturbance as system uncertainties, an adaptive controller is designed to compensate for the uncertainties based on an integral-type Lyapunov function. A fully saturated learning approach is then developed to achieve asymptotic tracking of repetitive walking trajectories. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tracking performance.},

Due to communication efficiency and privacy concerns, distributed algorithms with event-triggered communications are proposed in this article. The communication is only permitted or triggered if variation of gradient of the local objective function exceeds a threshold. By constructing a novel technical lemma and a universal scalar function, the convergence and linear convergence rates are established under some mild assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power system demonstrate that: Compared to the periodic algorithms, such as ADMM and Mirror-P-EXTRA, the proposed algorithms not only remarkably reduce the communication times but also have competitive convergence speed. The latter is striking that it implies there exist useless communications in the periodic algorithms that are censored by the proposed event-triggered strategy.},

A minimum reconstructible state set (MRSS) is constructed to determine this input sequence. Next, based on the estimated state, a finite-time stabilization scheme is proposed by constructing a switching controller consisting of three stages. A controller is first developed to estimate the state of BCNs in finite-time steps, and a state reachable controller is also provided to make the state of BCNs reachable to a given equilibrium point. Subsequently, a constant controller is further developed to stabilize the state of BCNs to the equilibrium point.

However, it is the quality of training samples, not just the quantity, that influences transfer performance. In this article, we propose a multidomain adaptation method with sample and source distillation (SSD), which develops a two-step selective strategy to distill source samples and define the importance of source domains. To distill samples, the pseudo-labeled target domain is constructed to learn a series of category classifiers to identify transfer and inefficient source samples. To rank domains, the agreements of accepting a target sample as the insider of source domains are estimated by constructing a domain discriminator based on selected transfer source samples. Using the selected samples and ranked domains, transfer from source domains to the target domain is achieved by adapting multilevel distributions in a latent feature space. Furthermore, to explore more usable target information which is expected to enhance the performance across domains of source predictors, an enhancement mechanism is built by matching selected pseudo-labeled and unlabeled target samples. The degrees of acceptance learned by the domain discriminator are finally employed as source merging weights to predict the target task. Superiority of the proposed SSD is validated on real-world visual classification tasks.},

Various DMs among HFLTSs have been proposed, which enhance the applicability of HFLTSs in multicriteria decision making (MCDM) under qualitative hesitation information. However, existing strategies not only have their own pros and cons but also fail to measure linguistic assessments from multiple linguistic term sets with different distributions (i.e., multigranular unbalanced linguistic information). In this article, we first propose a new strict DM between two hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (HFLEs) based on the Wasserstein distance of their semantics intervals. Then, two novel kinds of DMs (Euclidean and Chebyshev forms) for HFLTSs are proposed and their strictness is proved. Weighted and ordered weighted versions of HFLTSs based on Euclidean form are derived. Afterward, illustrative examples, simulations, and related analyses are given to demonstrate the rationality of the proposals.

A hybrid attention mechanism structure is proposed for a DST model. The DST model uses a dual-branch structure to fuse convolutional and transformer features. Combining the features learned by the transformer and convolution effectively saves model computational resources. In addition, an evolutionary optimizer is proposed to optimize the parameters of the model. The excellent search ability of the evolutionary algorithm is utilized to optimize the transformer model parameters. The convergence of the evolutionary optimizer is proved in this article. In addition, the proposed E-DST model is experimentally compared with a variety of classic models and their deformations based on three datasets. And, the evolutionary optimizer proves its generality in convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The experimental results show that the E-DST model can effectively reduce computational resources and that the evolutionary optimizer can solve large-scale optimization problems.

The SCC introduces a space division of the human and the exoskeleton, while the ICC allows the robot to perceive the human intention and follows human motor, thereby improving the collaborative performance. The ICC formulates the impedance connection between the human and the exoskeleton in the divided orthogonal subspaces of walking, such that the robot is able to modify its position of center of mass (COM) when its motor trajectory deviates the one of the human. In addition, a novel adaptation control is proposed to deal with the unmodeled dynamics and trajectory tracking. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed controller, a series of experiments are conducted in three adults in gait at different speeds. It shows that the proposed controller can preserve the periodic walking gait and inherit the robustness of dealing with perturbations during walking.},

  abstract     = {This article presents rigidity-based formation maneuvering for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots subject to limited sensing capability, where the performance bounds are introduced to constrain the distance and angle errors. The time-varying and asymmetric performance constraints can prescribe the transient and steady-state performance of the closed-loop systems, which further specify collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance among neighboring robots and avoid the controller singularity issue. To satisfy the constraint requirements and fixed-time convergence, universal barrier Lyapunov functions are incorporated with control design such that angle errors are fixed-time stable and distance errors can converge to a small neighborhood around zero in fixed time. Under the proposed control protocol, all robots can track the desired time-varying velocity while generating and maintaining the predefined formation defined by a minimally and infinitesimally rigid graph. Simulation and experiment studies are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {The next-generation power grid evolves from the development of fundamental cyber–physical energy systems called smart microgrids. In order to improve the reliability, safety, and security of smart microgrids and achieve a more cost-effective operation, innovative approaches for physical fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) as well as intrusion detection and attack-resilient control (ARC) should be investigated. Given that, this article considers a smart hybrid renewable-based microgrid with different types of distributed generation units, including solar photovoltaic (PV) array, wind turbines, and battery energy storage system. Novel active FTC and ARC strategies are designed for pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters at microgrid level. The proposed fault-tolerant controller is based on an optimal fuzzy gain-scheduling technique that is used to accommodate the adverse impacts of PV power-loss faults. Also, the proposed attack-resilient controller relies on the estimated values of sensor measurements during the occurrence of data integrity cyber-attacks. To access and evaluate the microgrid’s real-time health status, both FTC and ARC strategies employ an integrated model-based intrusion detection and fault diagnosis (IDFD) system that is designed using a fuzzy modeling and identification technique. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed solutions is demonstrated via a series of simulations in MATLAB/Simulink using an advanced microgrid benchmark.},

Due to the fact that information is transmitted via a bandwidth-limited communication network, a quantized control scheme with a uniform quantizer is introduced for leader-following consensus. In order to decrease the communication load and save the limited communication network resources, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is studied for leader-following consensus problem of linear MASs with quantized state measurements. In the presence of actuator faults, external disturbances, and unknown parameter uncertainties, an adaptive coupling gain for the controller is presented. Based on the Lyapunov function approach, the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of consensus errors are proved. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is excluded for the triggering time sequences.

The specific mechanism of the modified nested saturated controllers with different parameter assignments, in which control parameters appear before states, saturation functions, or saturation levels, is comprehensively analyzed. With the help of a modified saturation function, the global convergence domain of each state can be kept invariable in the saturation reduction analysis. Meanwhile, a large saturation level is obtained by adjusting positive tunable parameters. Combining with derivatives calculation and $M$ -matrix-based comparison theory, proposed saturated control schemes are utilized to handle the considered system.

A necessary and sufficient condition is derived to ensure the isolation of attacked links and no mistaken isolation of normal ones. For the case with collusive attacks on links, a novel attack isolation algorithm is proposed by constructing extra observers on the basis of the previous designed distributed fixed-time observer via sequentially removing the information associated with one of the links.

  abstract     = {Dung beetles can effectively transport dung pallets of various sizes in any direction across uneven terrain. While this impressive ability can inspire new locomotion and object transportation solutions in multilegged (insect-like) robots, to date, most existing robots use their legs primarily to perform locomotion. Only a few robots can use their legs to achieve both locomotion and object transportation, although they are limited to specific object types/sizes (10%–65% of leg length) on flat terrain. Accordingly, we proposed a novel integrated neural control approach that, like dung beetles, pushes state-of-the-art insect-like robots beyond their current limits toward versatile locomotion and object transportation with different object types/sizes and terrains (flat and uneven). The control method is synthesized based on modular neural mechanisms, integrating central pattern generator (CPG)-based control, adaptive local leg control, descending modulation control, and object manipulation control. We also introduced an object transportation strategy combining walking and periodic hind leg lifting for soft object transportation. We validated our method on a dung beetle-like robot. Our results show that the robot can perform versatile locomotion and use its legs to transport hard and soft objects of various sizes (60%–70% of leg length) and weights (approximately 3%–115% of robot weight) on flat and uneven terrains. The study also suggests possible neural control mechanisms underlying the dung beetle Scarabaeus galenus’ versatile locomotion and small dung pallet transportation.},

The Nussbaum-type function approach is adopted to solve the problem of actuator faults with UTVFD. The designed NDO not only can estimate the lumped disturbance accurately but also can reduce the control peaking and chattering phenomena caused by the Nussbaum-type function. Then, an adaptive saturation compensator is designed to compensate for the influence of actuator saturation on the system. In addition, by combining SMC technology with the prescribed tracking performance (PTP) approach, a distributed fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to not only ensure collision avoidance and communication connectivity but also realize a variety of driving scenarios, such as multilane vehicle merging and vehicular platoon lane changing.

As one of its main features, the proposed kinematics allows the whole multiagent configuration to rotate safely along the perimeter under both full and partial connectivity properties of the underlying topology graph. Steady-state conditions are analyzed and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of kinematic model parameters.

On the one hand, we need to fixate the task goal to retrieve visual information required for safe and precise action-execution. On the other hand, gaze movements fulfil the purpose of communication, both for reading the intention of our interaction partners, as well as to signal our action intentions to others. We study this Gaze Dialogue between two participants working on a collaborative task involving two types of actions: 1) individual action and 2) action-in-interaction. We recorded the eye-gaze data of both participants during the interaction sessions in order to build a computational model, the Gaze Dialogue, encoding the interplay of the eye movements during the dyadic interaction. The model also captures the correlation between the different gaze fixation points and the nature of the action. This knowledge is used to infer the type of action performed by an individual. We validated the model against the recorded eye-gaze behavior of one subject, taking the eye-gaze behavior of the other subject as the input. Finally, we used the model to design a humanoid robot controller that provides interpersonal gaze coordination in human–robot interaction scenarios. During the interaction, the robot is able to: 1) adequately infer the human action from gaze cues; 2) adjust its gaze fixation according to the human eye-gaze behavior; and 3) signal nonverbal cues that correlate with the robot’s own action intentions.},

  abstract     = {Different from visible cameras which record intensity images frame by frame, the biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and sparse events with much lower latency. In practice, visible cameras can better perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be free from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to work well under fast motion and low illumination (LI). Therefore, the two sensors can cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this work, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to the lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists of 820 video pairs captured under LI, high speed, and background clutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each of which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we transform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline methods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality versions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking algorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective feature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the proposed VisEvent dataset, FE108, COESOT, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and VOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model.

Specifically, it leverages a novel routing encoder to extract information for both the entire multiobjective aspect and every individual objective from the MOTSP instance. The global embeddings and each objective’s embeddings are adaptively aggregated via a routing network to form the subproblems’ embedding that can well represent the MOTSP features. Using a modified context embedding, the subproblems’ embeddings are fed into a decoder to produce a set of approximate Pareto-optimal solutions in parallel. Additionally, we develop a Top-k baseline to enable more efficient data utilization and lightweight training for our proposed method.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the synchronization tracking problem for high-order uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems via intermittent feedback under a directed graph. By resorting to a novel storer-based triggering transmission strategy in the state channels, we propose an event-triggered neuroadaptive control method with quantitative state feedback that exhibits several salient features: 1) avoiding continuous control updates by making the parameter estimations updated intermittently at the trigger instants; 2) resulting in lower-frequency triggering transmissions by using one event detector to monitor the triggering condition such that each agent only needs to broadcast information at its own trigger times; and 3) saving communication and computation resources by designing the intermittent updating of neural network weights using a dual-phase technique during the triggering period. Besides, it is shown that the proposed scheme is capable of steering the tracking/disagreement errors into an adjustable neighborhood close to the origin, and the existence of a strictly positive dwell time is proved to circumvent Zeno behavior. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation authenticate and validate the efficiency of the proposed protocols.},

  abstract     = {The neural network-based adaptive backstepping method is an effective tool to solve the cooperative tracking problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). However, this method cannot be directly extended to the case without continuous communication. It is because the discontinuous communication results in discontinuous signals in this case, the standard backstepping method is inapplicable. To solve this problem, a hierarchical design scheme that involves distributed cooperative estimators and neural network-based decentralized tracking controllers is proposed. By introducing a dynamic event-triggered mechanism, cooperative intermediate parameter estimators are first designed to estimate the unknown parameters of the leader. By using the interpolation polynomial method, these estimators are extended to smooth estimators with high-order derivatives to guarantee that the backstepping method is applicable. Based on the state of the smooth estimators, a backstepping-based decentralized neural network tracking controller is designed. It is shown that the tracking errors are asymptotically convergent and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Compared with the existing cooperative tracking results for nonlinear MASs with event-triggered communication, a more general class of MASs is considered in this article and a better performance in terms of asymptotic tracking is achieved. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of our developed method.},

Due to the mode mismatch between the original system and the control law in the operating process, a hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the considered asynchronous situation. The main aim of this study is to construct an asynchronous SMC mechanism based on an incomplete SMK framework under the condition of random denial-of-service attacks so that the resulting closed-loop system can realize the mean-square stability. By virtue of the upper bound of the sojourn time in each mode, innovative techniques are developed for mean-square stability analysis under an incomplete SMK. Furthermore, an asynchronous SMC scheme is designed to achieve the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode. Finally, the effectiveness is verified using an electronic throttle model.},

  abstract     = {The aim of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is to utilize knowledge from a source domain to enhance the performance of a given target domain. Due to the lack of accessibility to the target domain’s labels, UDA’s efficacy is highly reliant on the source domain’s quality. However, it is often impractical and expensive to obtain an appropriate transferable source domain. To address this issue, we propose a novel UDA setting, source domain reconstruction (SDR), which seeks to construct a new transferable source domain utilizing labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. SDR has a significant advantage over the conventional method as it is much less expensive to construct a suitable pseudo-source domain rather than collecting an actual transferable source domain in real-world scenarios. To test the practice of SDR, we investigate SDR theoretically. We propose an easily implementable algorithm, the domain MixUp (DMU), which is motivated by the MixUp strategy, to solve the SDR problem. The algorithm can be used to design a UDA framework to significantly enhance the performance of several existing UDA algorithms. Results from extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmarks $(66$ UDA tasks) indicate that the reconstructed source domain has stronger transferability than the original source domain.},

  abstract     = {High-performance learning-based control for the typical safety-critical autonomous vehicles invariably requires that the full-state variables are constrained within the safety region even during the learning process. To solve this technically critical and challenging problem, this work proposes an adaptive safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that invokes innovative safety-related RL methods with the consideration of constraining the full-state variables within the safety region with adaptation. These are developed toward assuring the attainment of the specified requirements on the full-state variables with two notable aspects. First, thus, an appropriately optimized backstepping technique and the asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) methodology are used to establish the safe learning framework to ensure system full-state constraints requirements. More specifically, each subsystem’s control and partial derivative of the value function are decomposed with asymmetric BLF-related items and an independent learning part. Then, the independent learning part is updated to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation through an adaptive learning implementation to attain the desired performance in system control. Second, with further Lyapunov-based analysis, it is demonstrated that safety performance is effectively doubly assured via a methodology of a constrained adaptation algorithm during optimization (which incorporates the projection operator and can deal with the conflict between safety and optimization). Therefore, this algorithm optimizes system control and ensures that the full set of state variables involved is always constrained within the safety region during the whole learning process. Comparison simulations and ablation studies are carried out on motion control problems for autonomous vehicles, which have verified superior performance with smaller variance and better convergence performance under uncertain circumstances. The effectiveness of the safe performance of overall system control with the proposed method accordingly has been verified.},

  abstract     = {Coverage path planning (CPP) is essential for robotic tasks, such as environmental monitoring and terrain surveying, which require covering all surface areas of interest. As the pioneering approach to CPP, inspired by the concept of predation risk in predator–prey relations, the predator–prey CPP (PPCPP) has the benefit of adaptively covering arbitrary bent 2-D manifolds and can handle unexpected changes in an environment, such as the sudden introduction of dynamic obstacles. However, it can only work in bounded environment and cannot handle tasks in unbounded one, e.g., search and rescue tasks where the search boundary is unknown. Sometimes, robots are required to handle both bounded and unbounded environments, i.e., dual environments, such as capturing criminals in a city. Once encountering a building, the robot enters it to cover the bounded environment, then continues to cover the unbounded one when leaving the building. Therefore, the capability of swarm robots for the coverage tasks both in bounded and unbounded environments is important. In nature, herbivores live in groups to find more food and reduce the risk of predation. Especially the juvenile ones prefer to forage near the herd to protect themselves. Inspired by the foraging behavior of animals in a herd, this article proposes an online adaptive CPP approach that enables swarm robots to handle both bounded and unbounded environments without knowing the environmental information in advance, called dual-environmental herd-foraging-based CPP (DH-CPP). It’s performance is evaluated in dual environments with stationary and dynamic obstacles of different shapes and quantity, and compared with three state-of-the-art approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that it is highly effective to handle dual environments.},

  abstract     = {Multitask image clustering approaches intend to improve the model accuracy on each task by exploring the relationships of multiple related image clustering tasks. However, most existing multitask clustering (MTC) approaches isolate the representation abstraction from the downstream clustering procedure, which makes the MTC models unable to perform unified optimization. In addition, the existing MTC relies on exploring the relevant information of multiple related tasks to discover their latent correlations while ignoring the irrelevant information between partially related tasks, which may also degrade the clustering performance. To tackle these issues, a multitask image clustering method named deep multitask information bottleneck (DMTIB) is devised, which aims at conducting multiple related image clustering by maximizing the relevant information of multiple tasks while minimizing the irrelevant information among them. Specifically, DMTIB consists of a main-net and multiple subnets to characterize the relationships across tasks and the correlations hidden in a single clustering task. Then, an information maximin discriminator is devised to maximize the mutual information (MI) measurement of positive samples and minimize the MI of negative ones, in which the positive and negative sample pairs are constructed by a high-confidence pseudo-graph. Finally, a unified loss function is devised for the optimization of task relatedness discovery and MTC simultaneously. Empirical comparisons on several benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE, Pascal VOC, Caltech-256, CIFAR-100, and COCO, show that our DMTIB approach outperforms more than 20 single-task clustering and MTC approaches.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) can automatically design architectures for deep neural networks (DNNs) and has become one of the hottest research topics in the current machine learning community. However, NAS is often computationally expensive because a large number of DNNs require to be trained for obtaining performance during the search process. Performance predictors can greatly alleviate the prohibitive cost of NAS by directly predicting the performance of DNNs. However, building satisfactory performance predictors highly depends on enough trained DNN architectures, which are difficult to obtain due to the high computational cost. To solve this critical issue, we propose an effective DNN architecture augmentation method named graph isomorphism-based architecture augmentation method (GIAug) in this article. Specifically, we first propose a mechanism based on graph isomorphism, which has the merit of efficiently generating a factorial of $\boldsymbol n$ (i.e., $\boldsymbol n!$ ) diverse annotated architectures upon a single architecture having $\boldsymbol n$ nodes. In addition, we also design a generic method to encode the architectures into the form suitable to most prediction models. As a result, GIAug can be flexibly utilized by various existing performance predictors-based NAS algorithms. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets on small-, medium- and large-scale search space. The experiments show that GIAug can significantly enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art peer predictors. In addition, GIAug can save three magnitude order of computation cost at most on ImageNet yet with similar performance when compared with state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The large-scale multiobjective optimization problem (LSMOP) is characterized by simultaneously optimizing multiple conflicting objectives and involving hundreds of decision variables. Many real-world applications in engineering can be modeled as LSMOPs; simultaneously, engineering applications require insensitivity in performance. This requirement typically means that the algorithm should not only produce good results in terms of performance for every run but also the performance of multiple runs should not fluctuate too much. However, existing large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithms often focus on improving algorithm performance, but pay little attention to improving the insensitivity characteristic of algorithms. This directly leads to substantial limitations when solving practical problems. In this work, we propose an evolutionary algorithm called large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithm via Monte Carlo tree search, which is based on the Monte Carlo tree search and aims to improve the performance and insensitivity of solving LSMOPs. The proposed method samples decision variables to construct new nodes on the Monte Carlo tree for optimization and evaluation, and it selects nodes with good evaluations for further searches in order to reduce the performance sensitivity caused by large-scale decision variables. We propose two metrics to measure the sensitivity of the algorithm and compare the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art designs on different benchmark functions and metrics. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and performance insensitivity of the proposed design for solving LSMOPs.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the cooperative control problem for stochastic multiagent systems (MASs) with dynamic constraints. A new universal barrier function is proposed, which is applicable to many systems with different types of constraint functions, even unconstrained systems. Several mapping functions are constructed to constrain the state variables directly without feasibility conditions, and the tracking control is achieved for stochastic MASs with deferred full-state constraints under the backstepping framework. In order to regulate the tracking error more precisely, the funnel error transformation is improved and the deferred funnel controller is developed by introducing a preassigned finite-time function. Based on the deferred funnel controller, the tracking error can be maintained within the predetermined funnel in the preassigned time. The convergence time can be defined according to the actual requirements, and it is independent of the design controller parameters and initial conditions. Finally, some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

This study proposes a distributed learning control scheme based on a multiagent system framework for trajectory tracking of HSTs subject to operation safety constraints. Two different connection modes are considered between the carriages: 1) a soft connection achieved via information exchange and 2) a hard connection enforced via couplers. Both relative displacement and speed constraints are carefully analyzed in the tracking control process. By constructing an appropriate barrier composite energy function, the convergence of the tracking error and satisfaction of the operation safety constraints are rigorously proven for the proposed scheme.

A hybrid model is constructed to describe the closed-loop system with both flow and jump dynamics. Then, based on the hybrid model, Lyapunov-based consensus analysis, hybrid ETM design, and robust performance analysis results are developed. Compared with the existing results, the minimum triggering interval (MTI) can be prespecified, and Zeno behavior is ensured to be excluded no matter there exist disturbances or not, which is useful for control implementation. Besides, the packet losses are allowed to be nonidentical, that covers identical packet losses as a special case. Moreover, the tradeoff between MTI and the number of maximum-allowable successive packet losses is explicitly given.

  abstract     = {When there is a sudden load disturbance in an islanded microgrid, the peer-to-peer control model requires the energy resource to maintain a margin of generation, resulting in a relatively limited regulation range, that is, voltage/frequency sometimes requires additional control to maintain stability. A “source–storage–load” coordinated master–slave control strategy is proposed in this study to address the aforementioned issues. The system voltage and frequency will be stable as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of resources to support the supply–demand balance. The following tasks are included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational security in the face of load disruption, a source–storage–load coordinated control method based on the “ramping speed” ratio is proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2) to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication interruption problem by constructing an internal network among source–storage–load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods.

The innovation points of this research can be highlighted as follows: first of all, the dynamics of the plant are stochastic, nonlinear, and time varying, which resembles the natural systems in practice closely. Meanwhile, an energy harvesting protocol is put forward to collect adequate energy from the external environment. Second, as a generalization of the existing result, the ultimate control objective is quasi-consensus in a probabilistic sense, that is, designing a distributed control protocol in order that the probability of centering the allowable region for the states of each agent is larger than some predetermined values. Third, the MASs are subject to false data-injection (FDI) attacks, and a more general multimodal FDI model is proposed. On the basis of the probabilistic-constrained analysis technique and the recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs), sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the probabilistic quasi-consensus property. To derive the controller gains, an optimal probabilistic-constrained algorithm is designed by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, two examples are provided to substantiate the validity of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of vast data collection ways, data are often with multiple modalities or coming from multiple sources. Traditional multiview learning often assumes that each example of data appears in all views. However, this assumption is too strict in some real applications such as multisensor surveillance system, where every view suffers from some data absent. In this article, we focus on how to classify such incomplete multiview data in semisupervised scenario and a method called absent multiview semisupervised classification (AMSC) has been proposed. Specifically, partial graph matrices are constructed independently by anchor strategy to measure the relationships among between each pair of present samples on each view. And to obtain unambiguous classification results for all unlabeled data points, AMSC learns view-specific label matrices and a common label matrix simultaneously. AMSC measures the similarity between pair of view-specific label vectors on each view by partial graph matrices, and consider the similarity between view-specific label vectors and class indicator vectors based on the common label matrix. To characterize the contributions of different views, the $p$ th root integration strategy is adopted to incorporate the losses of different views. By further analyzing the relation between the $p$ th root integration strategy and exponential decay integration strategy, we develop an efficient algorithm with proved convergence to solve the proposed nonconvex problem. To validate the effectiveness of AMSC, comparisons are made with some benchmark methods on real-world datasets and in the document classification scenario as well. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed approach.},

An adjustable positive lower bound of interevent times for each ETM is found to preclude Zeno behavior. Meanwhile, mixed attacks, that is, deception attacks on sampled state and controller data and dual random denial-of-service attacks on sampled switching signal data, are handled by constructing event-triggered adaptive fuzzy resilient controllers of subsystems. Compared with the existing works for switched systems with only single triggering, more complex asynchronous switching caused by dual triggering and mixed attacks and subsystem switching is addressed. Further, the obstacle caused by vanishing control gains at some points is eliminated by proposing an event-triggered state-dependent switching law and introducing vanishing control gains into a switching dynamic ETM.

Different from the existing literature, we focus on the linear networked systems with external disturbances and both sensor–controller channel and controller–actuator channel are studied. First, we present a discrete-time modeling framework that leads to a stochastic closed-loop system with randomly varying parameters. To facilitate the analysis and $H_{\infty }$ control of resulting discrete-time stochastic closed-loop system, an equivalent yet analyzable stochastic augmented model is further constructed by matrix exponential computation. Based on this model, a stability condition is derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) with the aid of a reduced-order confluent Vandermonde matrix, Kronecker product operation, and law of total expectation. Specifically, the dimension of the LMI obtained in this article does not increase as the upper bound of consecutive packet dropouts does, which is also different from the existing literature. Subsequently, a desired $H_{\infty }$ controller is obtained such that the original discrete-time stochastic closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable with a prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance. Finally, a numerical example and a direct current motor system are exploited to substantiate the effectiveness and practicability of the designed strategy.},

Since the system considered is nonlinear and nonaffine with no available model information, the IDL technique is also used along with a strategy similar to the parameter adaptive iterative learning law. Finally, the entire DD-iILC scheme is completed by incorporating the local PID controller. The convergence is proved by applying contraction mapping and mathematical induction. The theoretical results are verified by simulations on a numerical example and a permanent magnet linear motor example.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the convergence property and error bounds analysis of value iteration (VI) adaptive dynamic programming for continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems. The size relationship between the total value function and the single integral step cost is described by assuming a contraction assumption. Then, the convergence property of VI is proved while the initial condition is an arbitrary positive semidefinite function. Moreover, the accumulated effects of approximation errors generated in each iteration are taken into consideration while using approximators to implement the algorithm. Based on the contraction assumption, the error bounds condition is proposed, which ensures the approximated iterative results converge to a neighborhood of the optimum, and the relation between the optimal solution and approximated iterative results is also derived. To make the contraction assumption more concrete, an estimation way is proposed to derive a conservative value of the assumption. Finally, three simulation cases are given to validate the theoretical results.},

However, the existed methods of EMTO mainly focus on improving its convergence using parallelism knowledge belonging to different tasks. This fact may lead to the problem of local optimization in EMTO due to unexploited knowledge on behalf of the diversity. To address this problem, in this article, a diversified knowledge transfer strategy is proposed for multitasking particle swarm optimization algorithm (DKT-MTPSO). First, according to the state of population evolution, an adaptive task selection mechanism is introduced to manage the source tasks that contribute to the target tasks. Second, a diversified knowledge reasoning strategy is designed to capture the knowledge of convergence, as well as the knowledge associated with diversity. Third, a diversified knowledge transfer method is developed to expand the region of generated solutions guided by acquired knowledge with different transfer patterns so that the search space of tasks can be explored comprehensively, which is favor of EMTO alleviating local optimization. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in comparison with some other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms on multiobjective multitasking benchmark test suits, and the practicality of the algorithm is verified in a real-world application study. The results of experiments demonstrate the superiority of DKT-MTPSO compared to other algorithms.},

Multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) is a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm proposed to utilize a centralized critic within the actor–critic learning framework, which can reduce policy gradient variance. However, it is difficult to apply traditional MADDPG to swarm robots directly as it is time consuming during the path planning, rendering it necessary to propose a faster method to gather the trajectories. Besides, the trajectories obtained by the MADDPG are continuous by straight lines, which is not smooth and will be difficult for the swarm robots to track. This article aims to solve these problems by closing the above gaps. First, the ESB-MADDPG method is proposed to improve the training speed. The smooth processing of the trajectory is designed in the ESB-MADDPG. Furthermore, the expert system also provides us with many trained offline trajectories, which avoid the retraining each time we use the swarm robots. Considering the gathered trajectories, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is introduced to realize the optimal tracking of the offline trajectories. Simulation results show that combining ESB-MADDPG and MPC can realize swarm robot decision making efficiently.},

Thus, the satisfactory recognition accuracy of fault diagnosis cannot be achieved in the above methods. In this article, a new model based on the spiking neural network (SNN) is proposed, which is called deep the spiking residual shrinkage network (DSRSN) for bearing fault diagnosis. In the model, attention mechanisms and soft thresholding are introduced to improve the recognition rate under a high-level noise background. The higher recognition accuracy is obtained in the proposed model which is tested on the fault signal dataset under different noise intensities.

  abstract     = {Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) continue to be challenging for existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). The main difficulties are that: 1) the diversity preservation in both the objective space and the decision space needs to be taken into account when solving LSMOPs and 2) the existing learning structures in current MOEAs usually make the learning operators only coincidentally serve convergence and diversity, leading to difficulties in balancing these two factors. Therefore, balancing convergence and diversity in current MOEAs is difficult. To address these issues, this article proposes a multiobjective particle swarm optimizer with enhanced balance of convergence and diversity (MPSO-EBCD). In MPSO-EBCD, a novel velocity update structure for multiobjective particle swarm optimization is put forward, dividing the convergence, and diversity preservation operations into independent components. Following the proposed update structure, a weighted convergence factor is introduced to serve the convergence strategy, whilst a diversity preservation strategy is built to uniformly distribute the particles in the searched space based on a proposed multidimensional local sparseness degree indicator. By this means, MPSO-EBCD is able to balance convergence and diversity with specific parameters in independent operators. Experimental results on LSMOP benchmarks and a voltage transformer optimization problem demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to several state-of-the-art MOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic-flow prediction remains a critical challenge due to complicated spatial dependencies, temporal factors, and unpredictable events. Most existing approaches focus on single- or dual-view learning and thus face limitations in systematically learning complex spatial-temporal features. In this work, we propose a novel multiview spatial-temporal transformer (MVSTT) network that can effectively learn complex spatial-temporal domain correlations and potential patterns from multiple views. First, we examine a temporal view and design a short-range gated convolution component from a short-term subview, and a long-range gated convolution component from a long-term subview. These two components effectively aggregate knowledge of the temporal domain at multiple granularities and mine patterns of node evolution across time steps. Meanwhile, in the spatial view, we design a dual-graph spatial learning module that captures fixed and dynamic spatial dependencies of nodes, as well as the evolution patterns of edges, from the static and dynamic graph subviews, respectively. In addition, we further design a spatial-temporal transformer to mine different levels of spatial-temporal features through multiview knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.

The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is proved.

Then, an LMFAC scheme is designed on the basis of occurred maximum DoS attacks interval to adaptively tune the attenuation coefficient of the input signal for improving system performance during the next DoS attacks interval.

The SCIRM is built by innovating the optimization formulation of the recently proposed invariant risk minimization (IRM) and its variants through the integration of sparsity constraints. We prove that if a sparsity measure is differentiable, scale invariant, and semistrictly quasi-convex, the SCIRM can be guaranteed to solve the domain generalization problem based on a few predefined problem settings. We mathematically derive a family of such sparsity measures. A practical process of implementing the SCIRM for machinery fault diagnosis tasks is offered. We first verify our theoretical exploration of the SCIRM by using simulation data. We further compare SCIRM with a set of state-of-the-art methods by using real machinery fault data collected under a variety of working conditions. The computational results confirm that the machinery fault diagnosis model developed by the SCIRM offers a higher generalization capacity and performs better than the other benchmarks across the different testing datasets.},

Over the past decade, many efforts have been devoted to improving the verification performance from human faces only while lacking other biometric information, for example, speaking voice. In this article, to interpret and benefit from multiple modalities, we propose for the first time to combine human faces and voices to verify kinship, which we refer it as the audio-visual kinship verification study. We first establish a comprehensive audio-visual kinship dataset that consists of familial talking facial videos under various scenarios, called TALKIN-Family. Based on the dataset, we present the extensive evaluation of kinship verification from faces and voices. In particular, we propose a deep-learning-based fusion method, called unified adaptive adversarial multimodal learning (UAAML). It consists of the adversarial network and the attention module on the basis of unified multimodal features. Experiments show that audio (voice) information is complementary to facial features and useful for the kinship verification problem. Furthermore, the proposed fusion method outperforms baseline methods. In addition, we also evaluate the human verification ability on a subset of TALKIN-Family. It indicates that humans have higher accuracy when they have access to both faces and voices. The machine-learning methods could effectively and efficiently outperform the human ability. Finally, we include the future work and research opportunities with the TALKIN-Family dataset.},

This article is aimed at studying the issue in the distributed setup, where $N$ agents minimize the sum of their individual cost functions using local communication over a network. The cost functions are twice continuously differentiable. We first study the algorithm with one momentum term and develop a distributed heavy-ball (D-HB) method by adding one momentum term on to the distributed gradient algorithm. By borrowing tools from the control theory, we provide a simple convergence proof and an explicit expression of the optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we consider adding two momentum terms case and propose a distributed double-heavy-ball (D-DHB) method. We show that adding one momentum term allows faster convergence while adding two momentum terms does not perform any superiorities.

  abstract     = {In the context of customization and personalization, the multistage fine-manufacturing system has become emerging in modern manufacturing industries. In this study, the scheduling problem of such a system called distributed hybrid differentiation flowshop scheduling problem is addressed for the first time to minimize makespan. The manufacturing process has three dedicated stages, including distributed fabrication for jobs, assembly from jobs to products, and further differentiation for products to meet customized requirements. Due to the scheduling complexity of the problem, the evolutionary algorithm is designed. First, the population is initialized heuristically and divided into three subpopulations with different identities based on the quality. The identity will be transited dynamically along with evolution. Second, a distributed heterogeneous global exploration strategy is designed to coevolve three subpopulations. According to identity differences, different subpopulations will choose their suitable learning operators and learning strengths to make full use of superior search knowledge. Third, to enhance search intensification, a problem-specific local exploitation strategy consisting of a variable neighborhood local search and a random block local search is devised and carried out adaptively. Fourth, by organizing the global exploration and local exploitation, a novel distributed heterogeneous co-evolutionary algorithm (DHCA) is proposed. The effect of parameter setting on DHCA is investigated by design-of-experiment and computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the algorithm. The results validate the effectiveness of special designs and show that DHCA are more effective and efficient than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms in solving the considered problem.},

  abstract     = {Condition monitoring of assets is significant to the efficiency and reliability of industrial automation systems. However, the accuracy of condition monitoring results is easily impaired by variational environments and volatile operations, especially for complex automation systems. In this article, an environmentally adaptive and contrastive representation learning method is proposed to address the problem. To suppress the unexpected effects of environmental variations on operating data, a regression model between the operational and environmental variables is developed. The variable regression adjustment is achieved by solving a penalized optimization problem based on spline functions, and the solution is explicitly derived. Then, negative samples and pseudo labels are generated based on the designed pattern of data augmentation, and valid data representations for asset condition monitoring can be obtained by contrastive learning. Moreover, the reference statue of healthy assets is established by kernel density estimation, and control charts are employed for online monitoring with alarm thresholds. Taking wind turbine blades as examples, the remarkable performance of the developed method is demonstrated with real-world measurements from wind farms. Furthermore, comparative analysis with benchmark approaches and ablation study are conducted to reveal the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Neighborhood classification (NEC) algorithms have been widely used to solve classification problems. Most traditional NEC algorithms employ the majority voting mechanism as the basis for final decision making. However, this mechanism hardly considers the spatial difference and label uncertainty of the neighborhood samples, which may increase the possibility of the misclassification. In addition, the traditional NEC algorithms need to load the entire data into memory at once, which is computationally inefficient when the size of the dataset is large. To address these problems, we propose a novel Spark-based attribute reduction and NEC for rough evidence in this article. Specifically, we first construct a multigranular sample space using the parallel undersampling method. Then, we evaluate the significance of attribute by neighborhood rough evidence decision error rate and remove the redundant attribute on different samples subspaces. Based on this attribute reduction algorithm, we design a parallel attribute reduction algorithm which is able to compute equivalence classes in parallel and parallelize the process of searching for candidate attributes. Finally, we introduce the rough evidence into the classification decision of traditional NEC algorithms and parallelize the classification decision process. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are conducted in the Spark parallel computing framework. Experimental results on both small and large-scale datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperform the benchmarking algorithms in the classification accuracy and the computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Subspace learning (SL) plays a key role in various learning tasks, especially those with a huge feature space. When processing multiple high-dimensional learning tasks simultaneously, it is of great importance to make use of the subspace extracted from some tasks to help learn others, so that the learning performance of all tasks can be enhanced together. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to answer the following question: How can the commonality among different learning tasks and, of equal importance, the individuality of each single learning task, be characterized and extracted from the given datasets, so as to benefit the subsequent learning, for example, classification? Existing multitask SL methods usually focused on the commonality among the given tasks, while neglecting the individuality of the learning tasks. In order to offer a more general and comprehensive framework for multitask SL, in this article, we propose a novel method dubbed commonality and individuality-based SL (CISL). First, we formally define the notions and objective functions of both commonality and individuality with respect to multiple SL tasks. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to solve the formulated objective functions, with the convergence of the algorithm being guaranteed. To show the generality of the proposed method, we theoretically analyze its connections to existing single-task and multitask SL methods. Finally, we demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of incorporating both commonality and individuality by interpreting the learned subspaces and comparing the performance of CISL (in terms of the subsequent classification accuracy) with that of classical and state-of-the-art SL approaches on both synthetic and real-world multitask datasets. The empirical evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed method in characterizing the commonality and individuality for multitask SL.},

For local filtering, the LMB filter is extended to JDTC by augmenting the target state to incorporate class and mode information. Further, the well-known generalized covariance intersection and recently developed minimum information loss fusion paradigms are exploited for data fusion among sensors.

This teleoperation system consists of an end-to-end hand pose regression network and a controlled active vision system. The end-to-end pose regression network (Transteleop), combined with an auxiliary reconstruction loss function, captures the human hand through a low-cost depth camera and predicts joint commands of the robot based on the image-to-image translation method. To obtain the optimal observation of the human hand, an active vision system is implemented by a robot arm at the local site that ensures the high accuracy of the proposed neural network. Human arm motions are simultaneously mapped to the slave robot arm under relative control. Quantitative network evaluation and a variety of complex manipulation tasks, for example, tower building, pouring, and multitable cup stacking, demonstrate the practicality and stability of the proposed teleoperation system.},

However, there exist only few research works on developing local search algorithms for solving SCP. In this article, we propose a new local search algorithm for solving SCP, dubbed NuSC. In particular, NuSC introduces a new combined scoring function for subset selection, which combines different subset properties in an effective way and helps NuSC find more optimized solutions. Besides, NuSC incorporates a dynamic weighting scheme for elements, a tabu search strategy, and a novelty selection mechanism to further enhance its practical performance. In order to study the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed NuSC algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments to compare NuSC against many state-of-the-art competitors on various types of SCP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that NuSC significantly outperforms its competitors on the majority of instances, indicating the superiority of NuSC. Also, our empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each algorithmic technique underlying NuSC.},

A refined sampled-data-based DET scheme is proposed by introducing two dynamically adjusting threshold parameters to distinguish the different transmission requirements for neighboring agents intra and outer cluster. Faced with the difficulties of acquiring full state information among spatially distributed agents, output feedback is employed to construct cooperative control protocols. Both fixed and switching topologies are considered to execute the designed DET-based cooperative cluster consensus control protocols. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), some sufficient criteria in terms of matrix inequalities for the cluster consensus of MASs are derived, which can ensure that the error system with the proposed DET-based control strategy is asymptotically stable. Facing the nonconvex issue induced by output feedback, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based control design algorithm is novelly developed to calculate the control gains and event-triggering parameters jointly based on the derived stability criteria. The elements of the matrix variables are valued stochastically in certain ranges and the fitness function is designed as the accumulation of the weighting value of each matrix inequality. Finally, an application of multiple satellites formation flying is applied to numerically illustrate the effectiveness of the cluster consensus control strategy with the designed DET mechanism.},

Such mistakes degrade online human-machine interfacing methods and require costly post-hoc manual cleaning in the offline setting. In this article we propose an automated error correction methodology using a deep metric learning (DML) framework, generating embedding spaces in which spiking events can be both identified and assigned to their respective sources. Furthermore, we investigate the relative ability of different DML techniques to preserve the intraclass semantic structure needed to identify incorrect class labels in neurophysiological time series. Motivated by this analysis, we propose locality sensitive mining, an easily implemented sampling-based augmentation to typical DML losses which substantially improves the local semantic structure of the embedding space. We demonstrate the utility of this method to generate embedding spaces which can be used to automatically identify incorrectly labeled spiking events with high accuracy.},

The proposed lifelong dual generative adversarial networks (LD-GANs) consist of two generative adversarial networks (GANs), namely, a Teacher and an Assistant teaching each other in tandem while successively learning a series of tasks. A single discriminator is used to decide the realism of generated images by the dual GANs. A new training algorithm, called the lifelong self knowledge distillation (LSKD) is proposed for training the LD-GAN while learning each new task during lifelong learning (LLL). LSKD enables the transfer of knowledge from one more knowledgeable player to the other jointly with learning the information from a newly given dataset, within an adversarial playing game setting. In contrast to other LLL models, LD-GANs are memory efficient and does not require freezing any parameters after learning each given task. Furthermore, we extend the LD-GANs to being the Teacher module in a Teacher–Student network for assimilating data representations across several domains during LLL. Experimental results indicate a better performance for the proposed framework in unsupervised lifelong representation learning when compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the efficacy of a regularized multitask learning (MTL) framework based on SVM (M-SVM) to answer whether MTL always provides reliable results and how MTL outperforms independent learning. We first find that the M-SVM is Bayes risk consistent in the limit of a large sample size. This implies that despite the task dissimilarities, the M-SVM always produces a reliable decision rule for each task in terms of the misclassification error when the data size is large enough. Furthermore, we find that the task-interaction vanishes as the data size goes to infinity, and the convergence rates of the M-SVM and its single-task counterpart have the same upper bound. The former suggests that the M-SVM cannot improve the limit classifier’s performance; based on the latter, we conjecture that the optimal convergence rate is not improved when the task number is fixed. As a novel insight into MTL, our theoretical and experimental results achieved an excellent agreement that the benefit of the MTL methods lies in the improvement of the preconvergence-rate (PCR) factor (to be denoted in Section III ) rather than the convergence rate. Moreover, this improvement of PCR factors is more significant when the data size is small. In addition, our experimental results of five other MTL methods demonstrate the generality of this new insight.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression (SR) is an important problem with many applications, such as automatic programming tasks and data mining. Genetic programming (GP) is a commonly used technique for SR. In the past decade, a branch of GP that utilizes the program behavior to guide the search, called semantic GP (SGP), has achieved great success in solving SR problems. However, existing SGP methods only focus on the tree-based chromosome representation and usually encounter the bloat issue and unsatisfactory generalization ability. To address these issues, we propose a new semantic linear GP (SLGP) algorithm. In SLGP, we design a new chromosome representation to encode the programs and semantic information in a linear fashion. To utilize the semantic information more effectively, we further propose a novel semantic genetic operator, namely, mutate-and-divide propagation, to recursively propagate the semantic error within the linear program. The empirical results show that the proposed method has better training and test errors than the state-of-the-art algorithms in solving SR problems and can achieve a much smaller program size.},

Although there has been some existing research on the effect of disturbance for a single UAV, multi-UAV formation under external wind disturbances remains challenging, especially in a tight and confined environment. Inspired by nature, this study concentrates on an anti-disturbance mechanism for safe multi-UAV formation in a tight environment. The presented safety control system combines disturbance observer-based control (DOBC), bionic formation switching (BFS) strategy, and safety evaluation. Two safety issues are considered in this article. For a single UAV, the estimated disturbance is compensated in the inner-loop controller. While for multi-UAV formation, the BFS strategy attenuates the effect of external wind disturbance leveraging the formation configuration. The so-called group perturbation immune factor (GPIF) is designed to analyze and evaluate the safety of the overall formation. The experimental results validate the comprehensiveness and anti-disturbance capability of the system.},

  abstract     = {In an era of pervasive digitalization, the growing volume and variety of data streams poses a new challenge to the efficient running of data-driven optimization algorithms. Targeting scalable multiobjective evolution under large-instance data, this article proposes the general idea of using subsampled small-data tasks as helpful minions (i.e., auxiliary source tasks) to quickly optimize for large datasets—via an evolutionary multitasking framework. Within this framework, a novel computational resource allocation strategy is designed to enable the effective utilization of the minions while guarding against harmful negative transfers. To this end, an intertask empirical correlation measure is defined and approximated via Bayes’ rule, which is then used to allocate resources online in proportion to the inferred degree of source–target correlation. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified on: 1) sample average approximations of benchmark multiobjective optimization problems under uncertainty and 2) practical multiobjective hyperparameter tuning of deep neural network models. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain up to about 73% speedup relative to existing approaches, demonstrating its ability to efficiently tackle real-world multiobjective optimization involving evaluations on large datasets.},

  abstract     = {This article studies an event-based two-step transmission mechanism (TSTM) in the control design for networked T–S fuzzy systems. The transmission task is achieved in two steps. Consecutive triggering packets are relabeled in the first step by applying a traditional event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Then a probabilistic approach is employed to determine which packet is a real release packet (RRP) in the second step. This event-based TSTM is particularly suitable for scenarios in which traditional ETMs are unable to determine which packets are redundant. By discarding most of the unnecessary data packets, especially when the system is tending toward stability, the burden on the network bandwidth is reduced. To establish a control strategy for T–S fuzzy-based nonlinear systems with random uncertainties, a new timing analysis technique is proposed. Additionally, the necessary conditions for a nonlinear system’s mean-square asymptotic stability (MSAS) are derived. Finally, two practical applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested transmission mechanism in networked T–S fuzzy systems.},

First, a new Lyapunov stability lemma is developed, which provides a basic approach for the completely unknown nonlinear fractional-order system to realize finite-time convergence. Considering the containment control for FOMASs, the restricted assumption that the derivatives of leaders’ trajectories are known to the followers is removed, and only the boundedness of derivatives is required in this article, whose upper bound need not be known. To reduce the burden of communication, an event-triggered condition consisting of the control input and a decreasing function related to the containment errors is devised, which can provide more design freedom to balance the system performance and communication resources. According to the proposed fractional-order finite-time convergence lemma, a distributed adaptive containment control scheme is developed, such that each follower can be steered to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in finite time.

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering plays an important part in unsupervised learning. Although the existing methods have shown promising clustering performances, most of them assume that the data is completely coupled between different views, which is unfortunately not always ensured in real-world applications. The clustering performance of these methods drops dramatically when handling the uncoupled data. The main reason is that: 1) cross-view correlation of uncoupled data is unclear, which limits the existing multiview clustering methods to explore the complementary information between views and 2) features from different views are uncoupled with each other, which may mislead the multiview clustering methods to partition data into wrong clusters. To address these limitations, we propose a tensor approach for uncoupled multiview clustering (T-UMC) in this article. Instead of pairwise correlation, T-UMC chooses a most reliable view by view-specific silhouette coefficient (VSSC) at first, and then couples the self-representation matrix of each view with it by pairwise cross-view coupling learning. After that, by integrating recoupled self-representation matrices into a third-order tensor, the high-order correlations of all views are explored with tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN). And the view-specific local structures of each individual view are also preserved with the local structure learning scheme with manifold learning. Besides, the physical meaning of view-specific coupling matrix is also discussed in this article. Extensive experiments on six commonly used benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art multiview clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {The distributed subgradient (DSG) method is a widely used algorithm for coping with large-scale distributed optimization problems in machine-learning applications. Most existing works on DSG focus on ideal communication between cooperative agents, where the shared information between agents is exact and perfect. This assumption, however, can lead to potential privacy concerns and is not feasible when wireless transmission links are of poor quality. To meet this challenge, a common approach is to quantize the data locally before transmission, which avoids exposure of raw data and significantly reduces the size of the data. Compared with perfect data, quantization poses fundamental challenges to maintaining data accuracy, which further impacts the convergence of the algorithms. To overcome this problem, we propose a DSG method with random quantization and flexible weights and provide comprehensive results on the convergence of the algorithm for (strongly/weakly) convex objective functions. We also derive the upper bounds on the convergence rates in terms of the quantization error, the distortion, the step sizes, and the number of network agents. Our analysis extends the existing results, for which special cases of step sizes and convex objective functions are considered, to general conclusions on weakly convex cases. Numerical simulations are conducted in convex and weakly convex settings to support our theoretical results.},

Deception attacks, such as false data-injection attacks, which destroy sensor networks, make the outputs and states of the CPSs unavailable. It is very difficult and challenging for a designer to achieve the tracking control under the circumstance of cyberattacks. To realize the tracking control for the studied CPSs, we propose a new coordinate transformation technology without precedent, where it takes the attack gains into account and uses the compromised states to design the corresponding controllers. In the backstepping design process, Nussbaum functions are presented to alleviate the influence of the unknown attack gains. Furthermore, we consider the actuator faults problem, which includes the loss of effectiveness and the bias fault. By skillfully designing the adaptive laws, the effect of actuator faults is completely eliminated. It is theoretically proved that the first proposed tracking control scheme can guarantee all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the output can track the desired reference signal. In addition, the second adaptive control scheme is also developed for the CPSs under the actuator faults and a more general assumption on the deception attacks is proposed simultaneously. Finally, the feasibility of the new proposed methods is verified by MATLAB simulation analysis.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the distributed optimal output consensus problem of heterogeneous linear multiagent systems over weight-unbalanced directed networks. A novel distributed continuous-time state feedback controller is proposed to steer the outputs of all the agents to converge to the optimal solution of the global cost function. Under the standard condition that the unbalanced digraph is strongly connected and the local cost functions are strongly convex with global Lipschitz gradients, the exponential convergence of the closed-loop multiagent system is established. Then, the proposed state feedback control law is extended to an observer-based output feedback setting. Two examples are finally provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {Matrix factorization (MF) methods decompose a data matrix into a product of two-factor matrices (denoted as $U$ and $V$ ) which are with low ranks. In this article, we propose a generative latent variable model for the data matrix, in which each entry is assumed to be a Gaussian with mean to be the inner product of the corresponding columns of $U$ and $V$ . The prior of each column of $U$ and $V$ is assumed to be as a finite mixture of Gaussians. Further, we propose to model the attribute matrix with the data matrix jointly by considering them as conditional independence with respect to the factor matrix $U$ , building upon previously defined model for the data matrix. Due to the intractability of the proposed models, we employ variational Bayes to infer the posteriors of the factor matrices and the clustering relationships, and to optimize for the model parameters. In our development, the posteriors and model parameters can be readily computed in closed forms, which is much more computationally efficient than existing sampling-based probabilistic MF models. Comprehensive experimental studies of the proposed methods on collaborative filtering and community detection tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance against a great number of MF-based and non-MF-based algorithms.},

Different from the existing works, the time-varying parameters and the global output constraint are taken into account. First, by means of multifilters, the unmeasurable state variables are reconstructed, under which the unknown time-varying parameters and sensor sensitivity are transformed into the estimation problem of unknown parameters. Second, based on a barrier function, a novel constraint algorithm is established to make the output enter into asymmetric time-varying constraint boundaries, which is independent of the initial value of the output. To avoid continuous sampling of the controller, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed without the Zeno phenomenon. By means of the Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proved that the output enters into the pregiven asymmetric constraint boundaries, and never exceeds. Finally, the validity of our proposed control algorithm is illustrated by a numerical simulation.},

The key features of this work can be summarized as follows: 1) the proposed control is built upon the ESN embedded with multiclustered reservoir inspired from the hierarchically clustered organizations of cortical connections in mammalian brains; 2) the developed neuroadaptive control scheme utilizes unsupervised learning rules inspired from the neural plasticity mechanism of the individual neuron in nervous systems, called IP; 3) a multiclustered reservoir with IP is integrated into the algorithm to enhance the approximation performance of NN; and 4) the multiclustered reservoir is constructed offline and is task-independent, rendering the proposed method less expensive in computation. The effectiveness of the method is also confirmed by comparison with the existing neuroadaptive methods via numerical simulations, demonstrating that better tracking precision is achieved by the proposed method.},

However, most of the existing methods cannot handle the case that the training data of the target domain does not have labels. In this study, we propose a transductive transfer learning system, utilizing solutions evolved by genetic programming (GP) on a source domain to automatically pseudolabel the training data in the target domain in order to train classifiers. Different from many other transfer learning techniques, the proposed system pseudolabels target-domain training data to retrains classifiers using all target-domain features. The proposed method is examined on nine transfer learning tasks, and the results show that the proposed transductive GP system has better prediction accuracy on the test data in the target domain than existing transfer learning approaches including subspace alignment-domain adaptation methods, feature-level-domain adaptation methods, and one latest pseudolabeling strategy-based method.},

This research aims to develop some augmented state-related vectors and the corresponding extended free-weighting matrices zero equations to avoid the appearance of such high-degree polynomials and help to provide more freedom for the estimation results. Besides, an augmented delay-product-type LKF is also established for ameliorating the stability conditions of the time-varying delayed DNNs. Then, based on the above methods and Jensen’s summation inequality, the auxiliary-function-based summation inequality, and the reciprocally convex matrix inequality, some less conservatism stability criteria for time-varying delayed DNNs are formulated.

As such, it remains a challenge for robotic calligraphy systems to perform, mimicking human writers’ implicit intention. This article presents a new robot calligraphy system that is able to learn writing sequences with limited sequential information, producing writing results compatible to human writers with good diversity. In particular, the system innovatively applies a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to generate robotic writing actions with the support of a prelabeled trajectory sequence vector. Also, a new evaluation method is proposed that considers the shape, trajectory sequence, and structural information of the writing outcome, thereby helping ensure the writing quality. A swarm optimization algorithm is exploited to create an optimal set of parameters of the proposed system. The proposed approach is evaluated using Arabic numerals, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive writing performance of the system against state-of-the-art approaches regarding multiple criteria (including FID, MAE, PSNR, SSIM, and PerLoss), as well as diversity performance concerning variance and entropy. Importantly, the proposed GRU-based robotic motion planning system, supported with swarm optimization can learn from a small dataset, while producing calligraphy writing with diverse and aesthetically pleasing outcomes.},

Next, the prescribed performance function (PPF) is employed to impose the anticipant performance criterion on the trajectory tracking errors, for the purpose of preserving both desirable transient and steady-state responses. Afterward, we incorporate the recursive fast terminal sliding-mode technique into the active FTC (AFTC) design procedure to eliminate the influence of faults. In such a way, the fixed-time convergence property of tracking errors can be guaranteed without any restriction on the initial conditions.

Generally, the original input contains both output relevant and irrelevant information, whereas the latter may decrease the predictive performance to a certain extent. Without prior information about what information contributes to the prediction, the predictive performance of regression models can be improved based on such output relevant information as input. Thus, a joint autoencoder (JAE) combining the supervised and unsupervised mechanisms is proposed to learn output relevant features from the original input. In this way, both predictive and reconstructive performance are considered to learn the essential characteristics and avoid poor generalized performance on untrained instances. Meanwhile, hierarchy representations can be learned by successive JAEs with a local parameter embedding strategy, which is presented to preserve the predictive performance in this structure. In the experiments, the predictive performance and robustness of the proposal are verified on nine datasets with different sample sizes.},

To address this issue, a robust MOPSO with feedback compensation (RMOPSO-FC) is proposed. RMOPSO-FC provides a novel closed-loop optimization framework to reduce the negative influence of uncertainty. First, Gaussian process (GP) models are established by dynamically updated archives to obtain the posterior distribution of particles. Then, the feedback information of particle evolution can be collected. Second, an intergenerational binary metric is designed based on the feedback information to evaluate the evolutionary potential of particles. Then, the particles with negative evolutionary directions can be identified. Third, a compensation mechanism is presented to correct the negative evolution of particles by modifying the particle update paradigm. Then, the compensated particles can maintain the positive exploration toward the true PF. Finally, the comparative simulation results illustrate that the proposed RMOPSO-FC can provide superior search capability of PFs and algorithmic robustness over multiple runs.},

Among them, the deep learning-based embedding methods exhibit excellent performance, which encodes each node and edge as an embedding vector, enabling easy integration with traditional machine learning algorithms. However, there still remain some unsolved problems for this kind of methods, especially in the steps of node embedding and edge embedding. First, they either share exactly the same weight among all neighbors or assign a completely different weight to each node to obtain the node embedding. Second, they can hardly keep the symmetry of edge embeddings obtained from node representations by direct concatenation or other binary operations such as averaging and Hadamard product. In order to solve these problems, we propose a weighted symmetric graph embedding approach for link prediction. In node embedding, the proposed approach aggregates neighbors in different orders with different aggregating weights. In edge embedding, the proposed approach bidirectionally concatenates node pairs both forwardly and backwardly to guarantee the symmetry of edge representations while preserving local structural information. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can better predict network links, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The appropriate aggregating weight assignment and the bidirectional concatenation enable us to learn more accurate and symmetric edge representations for link prediction.},

Meanwhile, uncertain scheduling is becoming a force to be considered within intelligent manufacturing industries. However, little research has been found that surveyed the uncertain distributed scheduling considering both energy consumption and customer satisfaction. In this article, the fuzzy distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem considering on-time delivery (FDHFSP-OTD) is addressed, and a 3-D estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption while maximizing delivery accuracy. First, two heuristics and a random method are designed and used cooperatively for initialization. Next, an EDA with a 3-D probability matrix is innovated to generate offspring. Then, a biased decoding method based on $Q$ -learning is proposed to adjust the direction of evolution self-adaptively. Moreover, a local intensification strategy is employed for further enhancement of elite solutions. The effect of major parameters is analyzed and the best combination of values is determined through extensive experiments. The numerical results prove the effectiveness of each specially designed strategy and method, and the comparisons with existing algorithms demonstrate the high-potential of the 3D-EDA/RL in solving the FDHFSP-OTD.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of identifying disconnected agents in multiagent systems via external estimators. Specifically, we employ external estimators with an appropriately designed decision rule to identify the disconnectedness (i.e., the status of being disconnected) between two arbitrarily chosen agents in formation-control multiagent systems. The design of the decision rule is inspired by the unit-root testing problem of autoregressive time series. To make the best possible decision, a best-effort procedure is also proposed. Then, by introducing the concept of connected components (or just components) in graph theory, and using the methods of consensus analysis and time-series analysis, we develop an analytical framework to show the theoretical performance of the designed decision rule. A particularly important result shown by our analysis is that the miss probability of the decision rule can converge to 0 as the number of data samples increases. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of the decision rule and the best-effort procedure, showing that they can perform well even in small samples.},

  abstract     = {Many networked systems built upon real-life physical or social interactions have time-varying connections among individual units, where the temporal changes in connectivity and/or interaction strength lead to complicated dynamics. The temporal network model was proposed in the form of controlled linear dynamical systems acting in an ordered sequence of time intervals. One of the core challenges in network science is the control of networks and the optimization of the control strategy. However, most canonical frameworks for solving optimal control problems were established for static networks featuring constant topology. New theories and techniques are yet to be developed for the temporal networks, with an important case being that the input and the source-node connection are both variables. In this work, by formulating a quadratic energy cost without solving the Riccati differential equation, we show that the control effort can be reduced substantially by improving either the system trajectories or the input matrices. The two approaches are further combined in a coordinate descent framework, integrating linearly constrained quadratic programming, and a projected gradient descent method. Taken together, the results underline the potential of temporal networks as energy-efficient control systems and present strategies to improve the control input. Moreover, the proposed algorithms can serve as a starting point for future engineering of real-world temporal networks.},

MsFEFNet performs simultaneous feature extraction at multiple image scales and automatically learns spatial information of interest at each scale to achieve efficient multiscale information fusion. In addition, the potassium chloride flotation process is a multistage dynamic process with massive unlabeled data. To overcome its dynamic time-varying and working condition spatial similarity characteristics, a semi-supervised froth-grade prediction model based on a temporal-spatial neighborhood learning network combined with Mean Teacher (MT-TSNLNet) is proposed. MT-TSNLNet designs a new objective function for learning the temporal-spatial neighborhood structure of data. The introduction of Mean Teacher can further utilize unlabeled data to promote the proposed prediction model to better track the concentrate grade. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed MsFEFNet and MT-TSNLNet, froth image segmentation and grade prediction experiments are performed on a real-world potassium chloride flotation process dataset.},

Besides, GP also suffers from the lack of good generalization performance guarantees. To deal with data uncertainty and provide a numerical generalization performance guarantee on the unknown data distribution, this article proposes a novel robust noisy input GP (NIGP) algorithm based on the probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes theory. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity, we develop a sparse NIGP algorithm, and then develop a sparse PAC-Bayes NIGP approach. Compared with NIGP algorithms, instead of maximizing the marginal log likelihood, one can optimize the PAC-Bayes bound to pursue a tighter generalization error upper bound. Experiments verify that the NIGP algorithms can attain greater accuracy. Besides, the PAC-NIGP algorithms proposed herein can achieve both robust performance and improved generalization error upper bound in the face of both uncertain input and output data.},

  abstract     = {Image–text matching of natural scenes has been a popular research topic in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Recently, fine-grained image–text matching has shown its significant advance in inferring the high-level semantic correspondence by aggregating pairwise region–word similarity, but it remains challenging mainly due to insufficient representation of high-order semantic concepts and their explicit connections in one modality as its matched in another modality. To tackle this issue, we propose a relationship-enhanced semantic graph (ReSG) model, which can improve the image–text representations by learning their locally discriminative semantic concepts and then organizing their relationships in a contextual order. To be specific, two tailored graph encoders, visual relationship-enhanced graph (VReG) and textual relationship-enhanced graph (TReG), are respectively exploited to encode the high-level semantic concepts of corresponding instances and their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, the representations of each graph node are optimized by aggregating semantically contextual information to enhance the node-level semantic correspondence. Further, the hard-negative triplet ranking loss, center hinge loss, and positive–negative margin loss are jointly leveraged to learn the fine-grained correspondence between the ReSG representations of image and text, whereby the discriminative cross-modal embeddings can be explicitly obtained to benefit various image–text matching tasks in a more interpretable way. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of the proposed fine-grained graph matching approach, by achieving the state-of-the-art image–text matching results on public benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Gridless methods show great superiority in line spectral estimation. These methods need to solve an atomic $l_{0}$ norm (i.e., the continuous analog of $l_{0}$ norm) minimization problem to estimate frequencies and model order. Since this problem is NP-hard to compute, relaxations of the atomic $l_{0}$ norm, such as the nuclear norm and reweighted atomic norm, have been employed for promoting sparsity. However, the relaxations give rise to a resolution limit, subsequently leading to biased model order and convergence error. To overcome the above shortcomings of relaxation, we propose a novel idea of simultaneously estimating the frequencies and model order using the atomic $l_{0}$ norm. To accomplish this idea, we build a multiobjective optimization model. The measurement error and the atomic $l_{0}$ norm are taken as the two optimization objectives. The proposed model directly exploits the model order via the atomic $l_{0}$ norm, thus breaking the resolution limit. We further design a variable-length evolutionary algorithm to solve the proposed model, which includes two innovations. One is a variable-length coding and search strategy. It flexibly codes and interactively searches diverse solutions with different model orders. These solutions act as steppingstones that helpfully exploring the variable and open-ended frequency search space and provide extensive potentials toward the optima. Another innovation is a model-order pruning mechanism, which heuristically prunes less contributive frequencies within the solutions, thus significantly enhancing convergence and diversity. Simulation results confirm the superiority of our approach in both frequency estimation and model-order selection.},

To do this, the switching-type fuzzy state-feedback controller is designed with a set of switch modes so that more groups of gain matrices can be introduced to enhance the degree of freedom. What is far more important is that a novel augmented time-variant matrix approach is proposed in order to collect the proprietary features of normalized fuzzy weighting functions with regard to each switch mode. Then, all the obtained augmented time-variant matrices are split into a set of positive/negative matrices, which can be elaborately assigned into different monomials of our designing conditions under the framework of homogeneous polynomials. Therefore, less conservative results of resilient fuzzy stabilization are obtained even if some higher alert thresholds are chosen for probably ensuring the establishment of the involved precondition.

In this method, each time series is first transformed into a series of information granules with trend following the principle of justifiable granularity. The formed granular time series can well capture the main features lying in the original time series and help realize dimensionality reduction. Then, the wFCM method is developed to complete time-series clustering in the granular space. Here, the dynamic time warping (DTW) is extended to capture the similarity for trend-based granular time series. Furthermore, the weighted DTW barycenter averaging is introduced to derive prototypes presented in a granular format, capturing the level, the fluctuation, and the changing trend, which are meaningful and understandable clustering results. The experiments conducted on real-world datasets coming from the UCR time-series database and Chinese stocks are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the designed time-series clustering model.},

  abstract     = {The task of image captioning aims to generate captions directly from images via the automatically learned cross-modal generator. To build a well-performing generator, existing approaches usually need a large number of described images (i.e., supervised image-sentence pairs), requiring a huge effects on manual labeling. However, in real-world applications, a more general scenario is that we only have limited amount of described images and a large number of undescribed images. Therefore, a resulting challenge is how to effectively combine the undescribed images into the learning of cross-modal generator (i.e., semisupervised image captioning). To solve this problem, we propose a novel image captioning method by exploiting the cross-modal prediction and relation consistency (CPRC), which aims to utilize the raw image input to constrain the generated sentence in the semantic space. In detail, considering that the heterogeneous gap between modalities always leads to the supervision difficulty while using the global embedding directly, CPRC turns to transform both the raw image and corresponding generated sentence into the shared semantic space, and measure the generated sentence from two aspects: 1) prediction consistency: CPRC utilizes the prediction of raw image as soft label to distill useful supervision for the generated sentence, rather than employing the traditional pseudo labeling and 2) relation consistency: CPRC develops a novel relation consistency between augmented images and corresponding generated sentences to retain the important relational knowledge. In result, CPRC supervises the generated sentence from both the informativeness and representativeness perspectives, and can reasonably use the undescribed images to learn a more effective generator under the semisupervised scenario. The experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art comparison methods on the MS-COCO “Karpathy” offline test split under complex nonparallel scenarios, for example, CPRC achieves at least 6% improvements on the CIDEr-D score.},

The key challenge lies in how to guarantee both input and performance constraints simultaneously for nonlinear systems especially under external disturbance and unknown control directions. We propose concise finite-time tunnel prescribed performance (FTPP) for better tracking performance, which features tight allowable set and user-specified settling time. To comprehensively tackle the conflict between the above two constraints, an auxiliary system is designed to explore their interconnections instead of neglecting their contradictions. By introducing its generated signals into FTPP, the obtained saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP) has the ability to degrade or recover the performance boundaries in the light of different saturation conditions. Consequently, the developed SPC, together with nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO), can effectively improve the robustness and reduce the conservatism against external disturbances, input, and performance constraints. Finally, comparative simulations are presented to showcase these theoretical findings.},

Subsequently, a Correction Model adapted from gradient descent is combined with the Prediction Model as Post-Posed Shielding to enforce safe actions. The RP-SDRL method was validated using simulation. Noise is added to the states of the model to further test its performance under state uncertainty. Experimental results show that the combination of Residual Physics and DRL can significantly improve the initial policy, sample efficiency, and robustness. Residual Physics can also improve the sample efficiency and the accuracy of the prediction model. While DRL alone cannot avoid constraint violations, RP-SDRL can detect unsafe actions and significantly reduce violations. Compared to the baseline controller, about 13% of electricity usage can be saved.},

  abstract     = {Hashing technologies have been widely applied for large-scale multimodal retrieval tasks owing to their excellent performance in search and storage tasks. Although some effective hashing methods have been proposed, it is still difficult to handle the intrinsic linkages that exist among different heterogeneous modalities. Moreover, optimizing the discrete constraint problem through a relaxation-based strategy results in a large quantization error and leads to a suboptimal solution. In this article, we present a novel asymmetric supervised fusion-oriented hashing method, named (ASFOH), which investigates three novel schemes to remedy the above issues. Specifically, we first explicitly formulate the problem as matrix decomposition into a common latent representation and a transformation matrix, combined with an adaptive weight scheme and nuclear norm minimization to ensure the information completeness of multimodal data. Then, we associate the common latent representation with the semantic label matrix, thereby increasing the discriminative capability of the model by constructing an asymmetric hash learning framework, thus, making the generated hash codes more compact. Finally, an efficient discrete optimization iterative algorithm based on nuclear norm minimization is proposed to decompose the nonconvex multivariate optimization problem into several subproblems with analytical solutions. Comprehensive experiments on the MIRFlirck, NUS-WIDE, and IARP-TC12 datasets testify that ASFOH outperforms the compared state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Human motion prediction is to predict future human states based on the observed human states. However, current research ignores the semantic correlations between body parts (joints and bones) in the observed human states and motion time; thus, the prediction accuracy is limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic correlation attention-based multiorder multiscale feature fusion network (SCAFF), which includes an encoder and a decoder. In the encoder, a multiorder difference calculation module (MODC) is designed to calculate the multiorder difference information of joint and bone attributes in the observed human states. Then, multiple semantic correlation attention-based graph calculation operators (SCA-GCOs) are stacked to extract the multiscale features of the multiorder difference information. Each SCA-GCO captures joint and bone dependencies of the multiorder difference information, refines them with a semantic correlation attention module (SCAM), and captures temporal dynamics of the refined joint and bone dependencies as the output features. Note that SCAM learns a semantic attention mask describing the semantic correlations between body parts and motion time for feature refinement. Afterward, multiple multiorder feature fusion modules (MOFFs) and multiscale feature fusion modules (MSFFs) are designed to fuse the multiscale features of the multiorder difference information extracted by multiple SCA-GCOs, thus obtaining the motion features of the observed human states. Based on the obtained motion features, the decoder recurrently recruits a composite gated recurrent module (CGRM) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to predict future human states. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to consider the semantic correlations between body parts and motion time in human motion prediction. The results on public datasets demonstrate that SCAFF outperforms existing models.},

  abstract     = {Approximation ability is of much importance for neural networks. The broad learning system (BLS) (Chen and Liu, 2018), widely used in the industry with good performance, has been proved to be a universal approximator from the aspect of density. This kind of approximation property is very important, which proves the existence of the desired network but does not provide a means of construction that is commonly implemented through complexity aspect. Thus, such an approach lacks the advantage of determining constructively the network architecture and its weights. To the best of our knowledge, for a BLS, there is a few theory providing a constructive approach to obtain the network structure along with weights ensuring the approximation properties. By virtue of the long-term memory and nonlocality properties, fractional calculus has observed many distinctive applications. The purpose of this article is to study the BLS approximation ability constructively, which is valid for fractional case as well. Specifically, first we introduce two simplified BLSs by means of extending functions. For each of the simplified BLSs, an upper bound of error is derived through the modulus of continuity of Caputo fractional derivatives. As a result, two types of fractional convergent behaviors of BLS, that is: 1) pointwise and 2) uniform convergence, have been rigorously proved as well. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the approximation capabilities of BLSs.},

In contrast to the conventional centralized actor–critic learning, a novel cooperative finitely excited learning approach is developed to combine the online recorded data with instantaneous data for efficiency. By using an experience replay technique for each agent and distributed interaction amongst agents, we are able to replace the classical persistent excitation condition with an easy-to-check cooperative excitation condition. This approach also guarantees the consensus of the distributed actor–critic learning on the solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation. It is shown that both the closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point and convergence to the Nash equilibrium can be guaranteed. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach compared to previous methods.},

The attackers aim to increase the quadratic control cost and decrease the attack cost, which is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. Then, based on the cyclic property of the matrix trace, the nonconvex objective function is transformed into a linear function related to attack matrices and covariance matrices of the tampered innovations. The optimal strictly stealthy attack is obtained by utilizing the matrix decomposition technique. Furthermore, the optimal $\epsilon $ -stealthy attack is derived to achieve a higher-attack effect by an integrated convex optimization, which distinguishes from the existing suboptimal attacks developed by a two-stage optimization.

Due to the introduction of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii function into the total Lyapunov function, it makes it difficult to stabilize the controlled system within a fixed-time interval. L’Hopital’s rule is used to determine the boundedness of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii function, and the fixed-time boundedness of the integral functions can be inferred. By utilizing the fixed-time Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that the controlled system is semi-globally practical fixed-time stable (SGPFS), all the closed-loop signals (CLSs) are bounded within the fixed-time interval, and the tracking error converges into a small region around zero.

It is capable of guaranteeing the prescribed performance if the external disturbance is less than a specified threshold and degrading that in light of the user-appointed rule otherwise. Particularly, the disturbance interval observer is synthesized to generate the boundaries of the external disturbances and realize the judgment of that criterion. With the generated boundaries, the interval-type auxiliary system is designed to provide the modified performance functions (MPFs) that characterize performance requirement and degradation rule simultaneously. Based on the positive system theory and the Lyapunov method, it is theoretically shown that the system output can always track the reference signal and satisfy the constraints of MPFs.

In contrast, this article considers inverse RL in a more general case where the demonstrated system uses static OPFB control with only input–output measurements available. We first develop a model-based inverse RL algorithm to reconstruct an input–output objective function of a demonstrated discrete-time system using its system dynamics and the OPFB gain. This objective function infers the demonstrations and OPFB gain of the demonstrated system. Then, an input–output $Q$ -function is built for the inverse RL problem upon the state reconstruction technique. Given demonstrated inputs and outputs, a data-driven inverse $Q$ -learning algorithm reconstructs the objective function without the knowledge of the demonstrated system dynamics or the OPFB gain. This algorithm yields unbiased solutions even though exploration noises exist. Convergence properties and the nonunique solution nature of the proposed algorithms are studied.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive neural tracking control problem for a class of hyperbolic PDE with boundary actuator dynamics described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Particularly, the control input appears in the ODE subsystem with unknown nonlinearities requiring to be estimated and compensated, which makes the control task rather difficult. It is the first time to consider tracking control of such a class of systems, rendering our contributions essentially different from the existing literature that merely focus on the stabilization problem. By formulating a virtual exosystem to generate a reference trajectory, we propose a novel design of the adaptive geometric controller for the considered system where neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximately estimate nonlinearities, and finite and infinite-dimensional backstepping techniques are leveraged. Moreover, rigorously theoretical proofs based on the Lyapunov theory are provided to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, we illustrate the results through two numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Camera-based passive dietary intake monitoring is able to continuously capture the eating episodes of a subject, recording rich visual information, such as the type and volume of food being consumed, as well as the eating behaviors of the subject. However, there currently is no method that is able to incorporate these visual clues and provide a comprehensive context of dietary intake from passive recording (e.g., is the subject sharing food with others, what food the subject is eating, and how much food is left in the bowl). On the other hand, privacy is a major concern while egocentric wearable cameras are used for capturing. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserved secure solution (i.e., egocentric image captioning) for dietary assessment with passive monitoring, which unifies food recognition, volume estimation, and scene understanding. By converting images into rich text descriptions, nutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions instead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from images. To this end, an egocentric dietary image captioning dataset has been built, which consists of in-the-wild images captured by head-worn and chest-worn cameras in field studies in Ghana. A novel transformer-based architecture is designed to caption egocentric dietary images. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify the design of the proposed architecture for egocentric dietary image captioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies image captioning for dietary intake assessment in real-life settings.},

The estimation error dynamics is shown to be regulated by a switching system under certain assumptions on the frequency and the duration of the EC-DoS attacks. Then, by resorting to the average dwell-time method, a unified framework is established to analyze the dynamical behaviors of the resultant estimation error system, and sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability as well as the weighted $H_{\infty }$ performance of the estimation error dynamics.

  abstract     = {A significant number of industrial dynamic processes belong to time-varying distributed parameter systems (DPSs). To develop an accurate approximation model for these systems, it is critical to capture their time-varying behavior and strong nonlinearity. In this article, a multilayer online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine (ML-OSRKELM)-based online spatiotemporal modeling approach is developed for such DPSs. First, ML-OSRKELM stacks multiple online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine autoencoders (OSRKELM-AEs) to create a deep network, which can translate the spatiotemporal domain into a low-dimensional time domain. Then, an online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine (OS-RKELM) is employed to construct a dynamic temporal model. Finally, after obtaining time coefficients from the time domain, OS-RKELM is also used to reconstruct the original spatiotemporal domain. By using the kernel trick and the support vector selection strategy, the proposed method can remove redundant information while maintaining satisfactory nonlinear learning performance. Furthermore, the designed sequential update scheme can update the model parameters with real-time data, which makes it a promising method for capturing time-varying dynamics. Experiments and simulations on a lithium-ion battery’s thermal process confirm the excellent performance and validity of the proposed model.},

To address the above issue, a novel belief functions transformation is proposed, which can be interpreted based on both Smets’ canonical decomposition and Pichon’s canonical decomposition. The proposed method is validated based on consistency of combination rules, the least commitment principle, and its application in the fusion of information.

To address this negative impact of FDI attacks, a new coordinate transformation is designed in control design. Moreover, the Nussbaum gain technique is introduced to deal with the difficulty of unknown time-varying weights caused by FDI attacks. Based on the common Lyapunov function method, a finite-time resilient control algorithm is designed by employing compromised state variables, which ensures that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded under arbitrary switching rules even in the presence of unknown FDI attacks.

The advances in remote sensing provide accurate and continuous terrain monitoring, enabling the study and analysis of land deformation which, in turn, can be used for land deformation prediction. Prior studies either rely on predefined factors and patterns or model static land observations without considering the subtle interactions between different point locations and the dynamic changes of the surface conditions, causing the prediction model to be less generalized and unable to capture the temporal deformation characteristics. To address these issues, we present DyLand, a dynamic manifold learning framework that models the dynamic structures of the terrain surface. We contribute to the land deformation prediction literature in four directions. First, DyLand learns the spatial connections of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements and estimates the conditional distributions on a dynamic terrain manifold with a novel normalizing flow-based method. Second, instead of modeling the stable terrains, we incorporate surface permutations and capture the innate dynamics of the land surface while allowing for tractable likelihood estimations on the manifold. Third, we formulate the spatiotemporal learning of land deformations as a dynamic system and unify the learning of spatial embeddings and surface deformation. Finally, extensive experiments on curated real-world InSAR datasets (land slopes prone to landslides) show that DyLand outperforms existing benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask optimization is an emerging research topic that aims to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. A general challenge in solving multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) is how to effectively transfer common knowledge between/among tasks. However, knowledge transfer in existing algorithms generally has two limitations. First, knowledge is only transferred between the aligned dimensions of different tasks rather than between similar or related dimensions. Second, the knowledge transfer among the related dimensions belonging to the same task is ignored. To overcome these two limitations, this article proposes an interesting and efficient idea that divides individuals into multiple blocks and transfers knowledge at the block-level, called the block-level knowledge transfer (BLKT) framework. BLKT divides the individuals of all the tasks into multiple blocks to obtain a block-based population, where each block corresponds to several consecutive dimensions. Similar blocks coming from either the same task or different tasks are grouped into the same cluster to evolve. In this way, BLKT enables the transfer of knowledge between similar dimensions that are originally either aligned or unaligned or belong to either the same task or different tasks, which is more rational. Extensive experiments conducted on CEC17 and CEC22 MTOP benchmarks, a new and more challenging compositive MTOP test suite, and real-world MTOPs all show that the performance of BLKT-based differential evolution (BLKT-DE) is superior to the compared state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, another interesting finding is that the BLKT-DE is also promising in solving single-task global optimization problems, achieving competitive performance with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

If the exosystem has an unknown matrix, an adaptive observer is further proposed with the observer error system converging to zero exponentially. Then, we can obtain adaptive observer-based controls by combining adaptive observers and observer-based controls, which are able to regulate the tracking errors toward zero in case of the exactly unknown disturbances and references.

  abstract     = {Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption, learning to hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However, the known hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this article, we propose a generalized image transfer retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two crucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains, leading to an inevitable domain distribution gap and 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional feature gap. To address the GITR problem, we propose an asymmetric transfer hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semisupervised/supervised realizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate negative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks indicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the state-of-the-art hashing methods.},

  abstract     = {Information granularity and information granules are fundamental concepts that permeate the entire area of granular computing. With this regard, the principle of justifiable granularity was proposed by Pedrycz, and subsequently a general two-phase framework of designing information granules based on Fuzzy C-means clustering was successfully developed. This design process leads to information granules that are likely to intersect each other in substantially overlapping clusters, which inevitably leads to some ambiguity and misperception as well as loss of semantic clarity of information granules. This limitation is largely due to imprecise description of boundary-overlapping data in the existing algorithms. To address this issue, the rough $k$ -means clustering is introduced in an innovative way into Pedrycz’s two-phase information granulation framework, together with the proposed local boundary fuzzy metric. To further strengthen the characteristics of support and inhibition of boundary-overlapping data, an augmented parametric version of the principle is refined. On this basis, a local boundary fuzzified rough $k$ -means-based information granulation algorithm is developed. In this manner, the generated granules are unique and representative whilst ensuring clearer boundaries. The validity and performance of this algorithm are demonstrated through the results of comparative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent fault diagnosis has been increasingly improved with the evolution of deep learning (DL) approaches. Recently, the emerging graph neural networks (GNNs) have also been introduced in the field of fault diagnosis with the goal to make better use of the inductive bias of the interdependencies between the different sensor measurements. However, there are some limitations with these GNN-based fault diagnosis methods. First, they lack the ability to realize multiscale feature extraction due to the fixed receptive field of GNNs. Second, they eventually encounter the over-smoothing problem with increase of model depth. Finally, the extracted features of these GNNs are hard to understand due to the black-box nature of GNNs. To address these issues, a filter-informed spectral graph wavelet network (SGWN) is proposed in this article. In SGWN, the spectral graph wavelet convolutional (SGWConv) layer is established upon the spectral graph wavelet transform, which can decompose a graph signal into scaling function coefficients and spectral graph wavelet coefficients. With the help of SGWConv, SGWN is able to prevent the over-smoothing problem caused by long-range low-pass filtering, by simultaneously extracting low-pass and band-pass features. Furthermore, to speed up the computation of SGWN, the scaling kernel function and graph wavelet kernel function in SGWConv are approximated by the Chebyshev polynomials. The effectiveness of the proposed SGWN is evaluated on the collected solenoid valve dataset and aero-engine intershaft bearing dataset. The experimental results show that SGWN can outperform the comparative methods in both diagnostic accuracy and the ability to prevent over-smoothing. Moreover, its extracted features are also interpretable with domain knowledge.},

Meanwhile, to solve the impact of asynchronous switching on system performance, the information of the switching signal is considered into the event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Also, by introducing a normalized function transformation and a tan-type barrier function, the transient performance is regarded as a tracking error constraint without considering the initial conditions of system output and reference signal required in traditional prescribed performance bound (PPB) control. At the same time, the improved admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (AED-ADT) method is cleverly connected with adaptive backstepping control, and a state-feedback tracking algorithm is proposed, under which all closed-loop signals are bounded and the transient performance of the controlled plant is ensured.

  abstract     = {Finding the causal structure from a set of variables given observational data is a crucial task in many scientific areas. Most algorithms focus on discovering the global causal graph but few efforts have been made toward the local causal structure (LCS), which is of wide practical significance and easier to obtain. LCS learning faces the challenges of neighborhood determination and edge orientation. Available LCS algorithms build on conditional independence (CI) tests, they suffer the poor accuracy due to noises, various data generation mechanisms, and small-size samples of real-world applications, where CI tests do not work. In addition, they can only find the Markov equivalence class, leaving some edges undirected. In this article, we propose a GradieNt-based LCS learning approach (GraN-LCS) to determine neighbors and orient edges simultaneously in a gradient-descent way, and, thus, to explore LCS more accurately. GraN-LCS formulates the causal graph search as minimizing an acyclicity regularized score function, which can be optimized by efficient gradient-based solvers. GraN-LCS constructs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to simultaneously fit all other variables with respect to a target variable and defines an acyclicity-constrained local recovery loss to promote the exploration of local graphs and to find out direct causes and effects of the target variable. To improve the efficacy, it applies preliminary neighborhood selection (PNS) to sketch the raw causal structure and further incorporates an $l_{1}$ -norm-based feature selection on the first layer of MLP to reduce the scale of candidate variables and to pursue sparse weight matrix. GraN-LCS finally outputs LCS based on the sparse weighted adjacency matrix learned from MLPs. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and verify its efficacy by comparing against state-of-the-art baselines. A detailed ablation study investigates the impact of key components of GraN-LCS and the results prove their contribution.},

In order to reduce sampling frequency, multiple event-triggered schemes (ETSs) are introduced. Then hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to describe multiasynchronous jumps among subsystems, ETSs, and controller. Based on the HMM, the time-delay closed-loop model is constructed. In particular, when triggered data are transmitted over networks, a large transmission delay may cause disorder of transmission data such that the time-delay closed-loop model cannot be developed directly. To overcome this difficulty, a packet loss schedule is presented and the unified time-delay closed-loop system is obtained. By the use of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, sufficient conditions with the controller design are formulated for guaranteeing the $H_{\infty }$ performance of the time-delay closed-loop system.

Through extensive simulations, it is shown that the proposed policy with the repulsion function and limited visual field has a success rate of 93.8% in training environments, 85.6% in environments with a high number of UAVs, 91.2% in environments with a high number of obstacles, and 82.2% in environments with dynamic obstacles.

Subsequently, both continuous and periodic event-triggered mechanisms are considered and added into the proposed continuous SMC scheme. It is demonstrated that with appropriate selecting of control parameters, the use of hyperbolic tangent functions does not affect the boundary layer of quasi-sliding mode caused by event-triggered mechanisms. The proposed continuous and periodic event-triggered SMC strategies can make the sliding variables reach the quasi-sliding modes and stay in there. Moreover, energy consumption can be reduced.

Groups of nodes play an important role in the modeling process of BLS, and it means that there may be a correlation between nodes. The proposed CBLS not only focuses on the compactness of network structure but also pays closer attention to the correlation between nodes. Learning from the idea of Fused Lasso and Smooth Lasso, it uses the $L_{1}$ -regularization term and the fusion term to penalize each output weight and the difference between adjacent output weights, respectively. The $L_{1}$ -regularization term determines the correlation between the nodes and the outputs, whereas the fusion term captures the correlation between nodes. By optimizing the output weights iteratively, the correlation between the nodes and the outputs and the correlation between nodes are attempted to be considered in the simplification process simultaneously. Without reducing the prediction accuracy, finally, the network structure is simplified more reasonably and a sparse and smooth output weights solution is provided, which can reflect the characteristic of group learning of BLS. Furthermore, according to the fusion terms used in Fused Lasso and Smooth Lasso, two different simplification strategies are developed and compared.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning architecture, which leverages a large number of remote devices to learn a joint model with distributed training data. However, the system-heterogeneity is one major challenge in an FL network to achieve robust distributed learning performance, which comes from two aspects: 1) device-heterogeneity due to the diverse computational capacity among devices and 2) data-heterogeneity due to the nonidentically distributed data across the network. Prior studies addressing the heterogeneous FL issue, for example, FedProx, lack formalization and it remains an open problem. This work first formalizes the system-heterogeneous FL problem and proposes a new algorithm, called federated local gradient approximation (FedLGA), to address this problem by bridging the divergence of local model updates via gradient approximation. To achieve this, FedLGA provides an alternated Hessian estimation method, which only requires extra linear complexity on the aggregator. Theoretically, we show that with a device-heterogeneous ratio $\rho $ , FedLGA achieves convergence rates on non-i.i.d. distributed FL training data for the nonconvex optimization problems with $\mathcal{O} ({}[{(1+\rho)}/{\sqrt {ENT}}] + {}{1}/{T})$ and $\mathcal{O} ({}[{(1+\rho)\sqrt {E}}/{\sqrt {TK}}] + {}{1}/{T})$ for full and partial device participation, respectively, where $E$ is the number of local learning epoch, $T$ is the number of total communication round, $N$ is the total device number, and $K$ is the number of the selected device in one communication round under partially participation scheme. The results of comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets indicate that FedLGA can effectively address the system-heterogeneous problem and outperform current FL methods. Specifically, the performance against the CIFAR-10 dataset shows that, compared with FedAvg, FedLGA improves the model’s best testing accuracy from 60.91% to 64.44%.},

  abstract     = {Articulating crane (AC) is used in various industrial activities. The articulated multisection arm exacerbates nonlinearities and uncertainties, making the precise tracking control challenging. This study proposes an adaptive prescribed performance tracking control (APPTC) for AC to robustly fulfill the task of precise tracking control, with adaptation to resist time-variant uncertainties, whose bounds are unknown but lie in prescribed fuzzy sets. Particularly, a state transformation is applied to simultaneously track the desired trajectory and satisfy the prescribed performance. Adopting the fuzzy set theory to describe uncertainties, APPTC does not invoke any IF-THEN fuzzy rules. There is no linearizations, or nonlinear cancelation for APPTC, thus making it approximation free. The performance of the controlled AC is twofold. First, deterministic performance in fulfilling the control task is ensured by the Lyapunov analysis using uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. Second, fuzzy-based performance is further improved by an optimal design, which seeks the optima of control parameters by formulating a two-player Nash game. The existence of Nash equilibrium is theoretically proved, and its acquisition process is given. The simulation results are provided for validations. This is the first endeavor that explores the precise tracking control for fuzzy AC.},

In this study, a novel variational Bayesian Student’s-t mixture model (VBSMM) with a closed-form missing value imputation method is proposed to develop a robust process monitoring scheme for low-quality data. First, a new paradigm for the variational inference of Student’s-t mixture model is proposed to develop a robust VBSMM model, which optimizes the variational posteriors in an extended feasible region. Second, conditioned on the complete and partially missing data information, a closed-form missing value imputation method is derived to address the challenges of outliers and multimodality in accurate data recovery. Then, a robust online monitoring scheme that can maintain its fault detection performance in the presence of poor data quality is developed, where a novel monitoring statistic called the expected variational distance (EVD) is first proposed to quantify the changes in operating conditions and can be easily extended to other variational mixture models. Case studies on a numerical simulation and a real-world three-phase flow facility illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in missing value imputation and fault detection of low-quality data.},

In this article, the discontinuous adaptive law is proposed which only requires the state information be transmitted at impulsive instants, therefore, the communication cost could be reduced and the control system is more practical in implementation. Furthermore, a discontinuous adaptive impulsive control law is derived to realize stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems with stochastic perturbations and actuator saturation, and the robustness of the closed-loop system with the discontinuous adaptive impulsive control scheme is proved to be effective.

This fact makes the control design and stability analysis more difficult and complex via backstepping. This article focuses on this problem and works at coming up a new backstepping design procedure of event-triggered fuzzy adaptive control for nonlinear strict feedback systems. A concurrent event-triggered mechanism is proposed to ensure that the real control input and the virtual control signals have the same triggering instants. Then, a systemic backstepping design procedure is developed to construct event-triggered fuzzy adaptive controller. The Lyapunov technique for nonlinear impulsive system is employed to provide the closed-loop stability analysis. It is shown that the derived event-triggered fuzzy adaptive controller ensures that the closed-loop system output well follows the desired tracking trajectory and the other closed-loop signals remain bounded.

  abstract     = {Effective process monitoring is both a prerequisite and a guarantee for high system reliability. In modern industrial processes, binary variables may appear together with continuous variables, making process monitoring more intractable. Recently, a model named hybrid variable monitoring (HVM) has been proposed to conduct anomaly detection with both continuous and binary variables. Although the performance of HVM has been significantly improved after using the information of binary variables, it assumes that every continuous variable obeys a single Gaussian distribution and each binary variable obeys a single Bernoulli distribution. It is difficult for practical processes to satisfy such strict assumptions. To overcome this problem, this study proposes an improved algorithm called HVM mixture model (HVMMM). The HVMMM contains multiple components with the assumption of an HVM for every component. Compared with the HVM, the HVMMM is suitable for more general situations and has a more accurate characterization of the data features. Subsequently, the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted for parameter learning for multiple components. The mathematical expressions of the parameters are derived in detail. In addition, the improvement on the monitoring performance caused by multiple components is analyzed. Finally, a numerical example and a practical case are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HVMMM. After multiple components are considered, the fault detection rate increases by 5.49% in the numerical example and the false alarm rate reduces by 1.6% in the practical case.},

A minimum of two tasking agents is excepted to circumnavigate the target cooperatively and symmetrically without prior knowledge of its position and velocity in order to achieve optimal sensor coverage persistently for the target. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel adaptive neural anti-synchronization (AS) controller. Based on relative distance-only measurements between the target and two tasking agents, a neural network is used to approximate the displacement of the target such that the position of the target can be estimated accurately and in real time. On this basis, a target position estimator is designed by considering whether all agents are in the same coordinate system. Furthermore, an exponential forgetting factor and a new information utilization factor are introduced to improve the accuracy of the aforementioned estimator. Rigorous convergence analysis of position estimation errors and AS error shows that the closed-loop system is globally exponentially bounded by the designed estimator and controller. Both numerical and simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It is commonly known that in the existing work, either the state constraints are ignored which may reduce the stability and safety of the system, or the virtual controller is subjected to some feasibility conditions affecting real system implementation. In this work, it is the first attempt to directly deal with the time-varying displacement and velocity of the vehicle constraints in ASSs without involving any specific feasibility conditions. A novel coordinate transformation based on the NSDF is introduced and integrated into each step of the backstepping design. Thus, the proposed control scheme not only adapts to the time-varying motion (time-varying vertical displacement and velocity) constraints, but also eliminates the feasibility conditions of the virtual controller without the difficulty of obtaining system parameters. Finally, the control scheme for ASSs used in this work is compared with existing control schemes in order to demonstrate its superiority and rationality.},

Intuitively, using its ideal value (noise-free image) benefits FCM’s robustness enhancement. Therefore, the realization of accurate noise estimation in FCM is a new and important task. To date, only two noise-estimation-based FCM algorithms have been proposed for image segmentation, that is: 1) deviation-sparse FCM (DSFCM) and 2) our earlier proposed residual-driven FCM (RFCM). In this article, we make a thorough comparative study of DSFCM and RFCM. We demonstrate that an RFCM framework can realize more accurate noise estimation than DSFCM when different types of noise are involved. It is mainly thanks to its utilization of noise distribution characteristics instead of noise sparsity used in DSFCM. We show that DSFCM is a particular case of RFCM, thus signifying that they are the same when only impulse noise is involved. With a spatial information constraint, we demonstrate RFCM’s superior effectiveness and efficiency over DSFCM in terms of supporting experiments with different levels of single, mixed, and unknown noise.},

  abstract     = {Continuum robot has certain compliance and intrinsic safety, which makes it an excellent substitute for the traditional rigid robot in the various tasks, such as human–robot interaction or medical surgery. However, due to the complex nonlinearities which are induced by the compliance, parameter uncertainties, and unknown disturbances, good performance control scheme for the continuum robot is always a challenging task for the practical applications. Thus, to overcome this challenge of the uncertain dynamics and unknown external disturbances, this article develops a novel adaptive control scheme for a continuum robot using the function approximation technique (FAT). Specifically, for the proposed continuum robot, an adaptive FAT control (AFATC) strategy with no update laws is proposed to handle the uncertain parameters of the robot dynamics and external disturbances. The control law is expressed as a finite linear combination of the orthogonal basis functions by the FAT. The proposed AFATC scheme uses a fixed control structure, and the weight matrices are not updated in time. Then, the stability of the proposed controller is proved based on the Lyapunov function. Afterwards, the simulation results indicate the proposed AFATC scheme has good control performance compared with the regressor-free adaptive control (RFAC) method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed AFATC scheme is demonstrated in a group of real-time experiments.},

Existing gaze target detection studies learn gaze from gaze orientations and scene cues via a neural network to model gaze in unconstrained scenes. Though achieve decent accuracy, these studies either employ complex model architectures or leverage additional depth information, which limits the model application. This article proposes a simple and effective gaze target detection model that employs dual regression to improve detection accuracy while maintaining low model complexity. Specifically, in the training phase, the model parameters are optimized under the supervision of coordinate labels and corresponding Gaussian-smoothed heatmap labels. In the inference phase, the model outputs the gaze target in the form of coordinates as prediction rather than heatmaps. Extensive experimental results on within-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations on public datasets and clinical data of autism screening demonstrate that our model has high accuracy and inference speed with solid generalization capabilities.},

In this article, we propose a novel framework to learn personalized shapes so that the reconstructed model well fits the corresponding face images. Specifically, we augment the dataset following several principles to balance the facial shape and expression distribution. A mesh editing method is presented as the expression synthesizer to generate more face images with various expressions. Besides, we improve the pose estimation accuracy by transferring the projection parameter into the Euler angles. Finally, a weighted sampling method is proposed to improve the robustness of the training process, where we define the offset between the base face model and the ground-truth face model as the sampling probability of each vertex. The experiments on several challenging benchmarks have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Then, some sparse points in the predicted PF are selected to guide the search directions of the local search in order to promote the search of promising sparse areas. The approximation degree of the predicted and real PFs will influence the speed of the local search, while extreme points can significantly influence the shape of the PF. To accelerate the search progress, the optima of surrogate models are utilized to promote the progress of finding extreme points. The proposed local search method is incorporated into a surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The proposed surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with the proposed local search method is tested with Zitzler-Deb-Thiele (ZDT), Deb-Thiele-Laummans-Zitzler (DTLZ), and MAF instances.

The resulting construct arises as a granular model that produces granular outcomes generated as a result of the aggregation of the outputs produced by the numeric model (or its granular counterpart) and the corresponding error terms. Three different architectural developments are formulated and analyzed. In comparison with the numeric models, which strive to achieve the highest accuracy, granular models are developed in a way such that they produce comprehensive prediction outcomes realized as information granules. In virtue of the granular nature of results, the coverage and specificity of the constructed information granules express the quality of the results of prediction in a more descriptive and comprehensive manner.

The AWPRM improves the feasibility of finding the optimal sequence based on the proposed SFJ compared with a traditional probabilistic roadmap. To solve the solution to TSP with obstacles constraints, the proposed sequencing–bundling–bridging (SBB) framework combines the bundling ant colony system (BACS) and homotopic AWPRM.

  abstract     = {With the increasingly serious air pollution, people are paying more and more attention to air quality. However, air quality information is not available for all regions, as the number of air quality monitoring stations in a city is limited. Existing air quality estimation methods only consider the multisource data of partial regions and separately estimate the air qualities of all regions. In this article, we propose a deep citywide multisource data fusion-based air quality estimation (FAIRY) method. FAIRY considers the citywide multisource data and estimates the air qualities of all regions at a time. Specifically, FAIRY constructs images from the citywide multisource data (i.e., meteorology, traffic, factory air pollutant emission, point of interest, and air quality) and uses SegNet to learn the multiresolution features from these images. The features with the same resolution are fused by the self-attention mechanism to provide multisource feature interactions. To get a complete air quality image with high resolution, FAIRY refines low-resolution fused features by employing high-resolution fused features through residual connections. In addition, the Tobler’s first law of geography is used to constrain the air qualities of adjacent regions, which can fully use the air quality relevance of nearby regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FAIRY achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Hangzhou city dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 15.7% on MAE.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical frameworks—a special class of directed frameworks with a layer-by-layer architecture—can be an effective mechanism to coordinate robot swarms. Their effectiveness was recently demonstrated by the mergeable nervous systems paradigm (Mathews et al., 2017), in which a robot swarm can switch dynamically between distributed and centralized control depending on the task, using self-organized hierarchical frameworks. New theoretical foundations are required to use this paradigm for formation control of large swarms. In particular, the systematic and mathematically analyzable organization and reorganization of hierarchical frameworks in a robot swarm is still an open problem. Although methods for framework construction and formation maintenance via rigidity theory exist in the literature, they do not address cases of hierarchy in a robot swarm. In this article, we extend bearing rigidity to directed topologies and extend the Henneberg constructions to generate self-organized hierarchical frameworks with bearing rigidity. We investigate three-key self-reconfiguration problems: 1) framework merging; 2) robot departure; and 3) framework splitting. We also derive the mathematical conditions of these problems and then develop algorithms that preserve rigidity and hierarchy using only local information. Our approach can be used for formation control generally, as in principle it can be coupled with any control law that makes use of bearing rigidity. To demonstrate and validate our proposed hierarchical frameworks and methods, we apply them to four scenarios of reactive formation control using an example control law.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the leader-following consensus problem of multiple uncertain Euler–Lagrange systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. By introducing a dynamic compensator for each agent, a fully distributed control strategy is developed based on the fuzzy approximation approach, which is independent of any priori global information associated with the communication topology. Meanwhile, a distributed event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is designed such that each agent broadcasts its states only when an event occurs. It is shown that with the proposed ETM, the leader-following consensus is achieved with aperiodic intermittent communication and Zeno behavior is excluded by contradiction. Moreover, the consensus tracking errors converge to small sets around the origin. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.},

The sequences of cost functions and constraint functions, both of which have dynamic parameters following time-varying distributions, are unacquainted to the agent ahead of time. Agents in the network are able to interact with their neighbors through a sequence of strongly connected and time-varying graphs. We develop the adaptive distributed bandit primal-dual algorithm whose step size and regularization sequences are adaptive and have no prior knowledge about the total iteration span $T$ . The adaptive distributed bandit primal-dual algorithm applies bandit feedback with a one-point or two-point gradient estimator to evaluate gradient values. It is illustrated in this article that if the drift of the benchmark sequence is sublinear, then the adaptive distributed bandit primal-dual algorithm exhibits sublinear expected dynamic regret and constraint violation using both two kinds of gradient estimator to compute gradient information. We present a numerical experiment to show the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Black-box artificial intelligence (AI) induction methods such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are increasingly being used to find optimal policies for a given control task. Although policies represented using a black-box AI are capable of efficiently executing the underlying control task and achieving optimal closed-loop performance—controlling the agent from the initial time step until the successful termination of an episode, the developed control rules are often complex and neither interpretable nor explainable. In this article, we use a recently proposed nonlinear decision-tree (NLDT) approach to find a hierarchical set of control rules in an attempt to maximize the open-loop performance for approximating and explaining the pretrained black-box DRL (oracle) agent using the labeled state–action dataset. Recent advances in nonlinear optimization approaches using evolutionary computation facilitate finding a hierarchical set of nonlinear control rules as a function of state variables using a computationally fast bilevel optimization procedure at each node of the proposed NLDT. In addition, we propose a reoptimization procedure for enhancing the closed-loop performance of an already derived NLDT. We evaluate our proposed methodologies (open- and closed-loop NLDTs) on different control problems having multiple discrete actions. In all these problems, our proposed approach is able to find relatively simple and interpretable rules involving one to four nonlinear terms per rule, while simultaneously achieving on par closed-loop performance when compared to a trained black-box DRL agent. A postprocessing approach for simplifying the NLDT is also suggested. The obtained results are inspiring as they suggest the replacement of complicated black-box DRL policies involving thousands of parameters (making them noninterpretable) with relatively simple interpretable policies. The results are encouraging and motivating to pursue further applications of proposed approach in solving more complex control tasks.},

  abstract     = {The path-tracking control of an intelligent vehicle always suffers from the high-frequency measurement noises. To confront this issue, this work puts forward a novel delayed output-feedback implementation of proportional-integral-derivation (PID) control, which is called multidelay proportional-integral-retarded (PIR) control. The mathematical model of the vehicle system is represented in the form of a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system, which uses the car position as the scheduling variable for regulation. On this basis, the multidelay PIR controller is designed such that the tracking errors gradually converge to zero with the aid of the proportional and integral actions, and the harmful high-frequency measurement noises are attenuated by the retarded term consisting of a few delayed proportional actions. To tune the PIR controller parameters, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), derived by applying Taylor’s expansion to the retarded term, are used to compute the convex subcontroller gains. Then, the self-scheduled tracking controller is formulated as the weighted sum of convex subcontrollers, and the weight functions scheduled by the current position are adaptive to the different operational conditions. Experiments in real time using a laboratory car-like vehicle are employed to assess the performance of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Recent problems in robotics can sometimes only be tackled using machine learning technologies, particularly those that utilize deep learning (DL) with transfer learning. Transfer learning takes advantage of pretrained models, which are later fine-tuned using smaller task-specific datasets. The fine-tuned models must be robust against changes in environmental factors such as illumination since, often, there is no guarantee for them to be constant. Although synthetic data for pretraining has been shown to enhance DL model generalization, there is limited research on its application for fine-tuning. One limiting factor is that the generation and annotation of synthetic datasets can be cumbersome and impractical for the purpose of fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose two methods for automatically generating annotated image datasets for object segmentation, one for real-world and another for synthetic images. We also introduce a novel domain adaptation approach called filling the reality gap (FTRG), which can blend elements from real-world and synthetic scenes in a single image to achieve domain adaptation. We demonstrate through experimentation on a representative robot application that FTRG outperforms other domain adaptation techniques, such as domain randomization or photorealistic synthetic images, in creating robust models. Furthermore, we evaluate the benefits of using synthetic data for fine-tuning in transfer learning and continual learning with experience replay using our proposed methods and FTRG. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning with synthetic data can produce superior results compared to solely using real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Accuracy and speed are the most important indexes for evaluating many object tracking algorithms. However, when constructing a deep fully convolutional neural network (CNN), the use of deep network feature tracking will cause tracking drift due to the effects of convolution padding, receptive field (RF), and overall network step size. The speed of the tracker will also decrease. This article proposes a fully convolutional siamese network object tracking algorithm that combines the attention mechanism with the feature pyramid network (FPN), and uses heterogeneous convolution kernels to reduce the amount of calculations (FLOPs) and parameters. The tracker first uses a new fully CNN to extract image features, and introduces a channel attention mechanism in the feature extraction process to improve the representation ability of convolutional features. Then use the FPN to fuse the convolutional features of high and low layers, learn the similarity of the fused features, and train the fully CNNs. Finally, the heterogeneous convolutional kernel is used to replace the standard convolution kernel to improve the speed of the algorithm, thereby making up for the efficiency loss caused by the feature pyramid model. In this article, the tracker is experimentally verified and analyzed on the VOT-2017, VOT-2018, OTB-2013, and OTB-2015 datasets. The results show that our tracker has achieved better results than the state-of-the-art trackers.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new approach for providing an interpretation for a spiking neural network classifier by transforming it to a multiclass additive model. The spiking classifier is a multiclass synaptic efficacy function-based leaky-integrate-fire neuron (Mc-SEFRON) classifier. As a first step, the SEFRON classifier for binary classification is extended to handle multiclass classification problems. Next, a new method is presented to transform the temporally distributed weights in a fully trained Mc-SEFRON classifier to shape functions in the feature space. A composite of these shape functions results in an interpretable classifier, namely, a directly interpretable multiclass additive model (DIMA). The interpretations of DIMA are also demonstrated using the multiclass Iris dataset. Further, the performances of both the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA classifiers are evaluated on ten benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and compared with the other state-of-the-art spiking neural classifiers. The performance study results show that Mc-SEFRON produces similar or better performances than other spiking neural classifiers with an added benefit of interpretability through DIMA. Furthermore, the minor differences in accuracies between Mc-SEFRON and DIMA indicate the reliability of the DIMA classifier. Finally, the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA are tested on three real-world credit scoring problems, and their performances are compared with state-of-the-art results using machine learning methods. The results clearly indicate that DIMA improves the classification accuracy by up to 12% over other interpretable classifiers indicating a better quality of interpretations on the highly imbalanced credit scoring datasets.},
