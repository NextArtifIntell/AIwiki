  abstract     = {Proliferation of autonomous systems have increased the threat space and the economic risk in several national infrastructures, e.g., at airports. Therefore, reliable detection of their intention is paramount to ensure smooth operation of national services and societal safety. This article reports a data-driven trajectory intent prediction algorithm which is based on a linear model structure of the autonomous system dynamics obtained from a dynamic mode decomposition algorithm. The model computation is enhanced by two sources of physics informed knowledge associated to the energy functional. Two different prediction algorithms that consider fixed or time-varying references are designed in terms of the availability of control input measurements. Rigorous theoretical results are provided to support the approach using matrix decomposition and optimization techniques. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposal.},

  abstract     = {Unstructured dynamics, un-modeled parameters, and uncertainties in electro-hydraulic servo-valve-controlled actuators (EHSAs) bring difficulty in designing controllers for output tracking performance with stability and robustness satisfactions. Therefore, this article proposes an output feedback-based control for position regulation subject to fully unknown system behavior and uncertainties. With this idea, a coordinately transformed canonical system is utilized where all mismatched/matched uncertainties are lumped into one term with unknown dynamics. Then, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) with a norm of weighting vector estimation combined with a time-delayed estimation (TDE) is employed to effectively compensate for the system behavior. Accordingly, a second-order sliding-mode-based output feedback control is conducted to avoid following the step-by-step backstepping control (BSC) design. Interestingly, the proposed methodology requires only the measured output for the control law implementation with only one estimated variable for the system dynamics compensation due to using the hybrid RBF-based TDE (RBF-TDE). Moreover, to lower this approximated error, a modified sliding-mode-based nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB) is extensively involved. The closed-loop system stability is mathematically proven through the Lyapunov theorem with simulation and experiment on EHSA protocols to realize the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A polytopic parameter-varying framework is introduced to represent the dynamics of each agent with internal model perturbation and parameter uncertainties. In order to reduce the conservatism brought by full-frequency domain approaches, the finite-frequency technique is employed to design a FE observer that can estimate the magnitude of faults. To eliminate/reduce the impact of faults on system performance, an adaptive event-triggered fault-tolerant consensus controller is then developed, which adjusts the consensus protocol based on the FE information. With the developed distributed fault-tolerant protocol and adaptive event-triggered control scheme, the agents can reach consensus in the presence of system faults and the transmission of unnecessary information in the control channels is avoided. The proposed triggering scheme offers certain advantages over existing results in balancing desired consensus performance and improving network utilization. By constructing a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for designing the consensus controller gain and the adjustment matrix can be derived in the form of linear matrix inequality. Finally, two simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Industrial process data are usually high-dimensional with dynamic characteristics, and a mix of continuous and binary quantities. However, current dynamic latent variable (DLV) methods primarily focus on analyzing continuous variables (CVs), overlooking the prevalence and significance of binary variables (BVs). BVs often serve as control references, indicating operating conditions or specific states and influencing the behavior of CVs. Integrating BVs into DLV models is crucial for elucidating the correspondence between CVs and BVs and uncovering the real operating patterns of the system. The main challenge lies in effectively accommodating the statistical heterogeneity exhibited by CVs and BVs, while comprehensively investigating their contemporaneous and temporal dependencies. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel DLV model called hybrid probabilistic slow feature analysis (HPSFA). The HPSFA algorithm is specifically designed to extract slow features (SFs) from CVs while incorporating supervision from BVs. To efficiently infer posterior distributions of SFs, a variational recursive filter (VRF) is developed using the local approximation method, providing closed-form posterior estimations. Leveraging the VRF, an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. For process monitoring, three statistics are designed based on prediction or reconstruction errors, which are separated from dynamic variations and exhibit reduced variability. This reduction in variability enables the definition of narrower control regions while maintaining the desired confidence level. The HPSFA method is thoroughly evaluated through both simulated and real industrial case studies to demonstrate its validity and superior performance over existing approaches. The experimental results show that HPSFA timely detects both static and dynamic anomalies of the hybrid variables, and achieves the highest-fault detection rate (85.89%) while maintaining a considerably low-false alarm rate (2.67%) in the practical industrial case.},

Traditional CNNs are a type of closed-box techniques with little interpretability, and their effectiveness is greatly affected when fault mechanisms and modes are extremely complex. To cope with such issue, this article presents a way to integrate outlier-type prior knowledge into CNNs based on an attention mechanism for fault diagnosis. First, outliers of the image-like data obtained by a sliding window processing from the raw data are formally defined as prior knowledge. Then, the defined outlier-type prior knowledge is integrated into any layer of CNNs by a parameter-free attention mechanism. Compared with existing similar methods, the proposal realizes a novel and flexible definition of prior knowledge and achieves deep fusion of prior knowledge and CNNs with low computational cost. The performance of the proposal was evaluated on the Tennessee Eastman process dataset and the real wind turbine blade icing dataset, which indicates that the proposal could not only realize accurate results but also had good model interpretability in terms of achieving high accuracy. The acquisition of outlier-type prior knowledge was discussed and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prior knowledge integration method.},

First, the differentiated evaluation and reconstruction strategies are designed, which make reconstructed samples more reasonable and realistic, so that they can be employed to participate in sample generation. Second, the adaptive fusion mechanism is presented to introduce the knowledge of actual fault samples into the laboratory simulation samples, by which the quality and diversity of generated samples are guaranteed.

The noncooperative leader possesses escape capability due to its bounded input with an unknown bound: 1) the task planning layer is developed by building a distributed adaptive signal generator and a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism and 2) the task execution layer is formulated by designing individual tracking controllers for each follower. This layered approach effectively handles challenges arising from heterogeneous dynamics. By introducing adaptive parameters, it eliminates reliance on the upper bound for the leader’s input while ensuring that the control strategy is fully distributed. The event-triggered mechanism saves communication resources effectively and does not require a large amount of additional computing resources to monitor the triggering condition. Furthermore, the results are extended to a more generalized nonlinear heterogeneous case in order to highlight the advantages offered by this hierarchical control strategy.

To effectively characterize emotions, in this work, we propose a cognition-inspired graph embedding model in the L1-norm space (L1-CGE) to learn an optimal low-dimensional embedded manifold for emotional brain networks. In the L1-CGE, the original brain networks are first encoded in the affinity space with the proposed cognition-inspired metric to construct the latent geometry manifold structure of emotional brain networks, and then the graph learning objective function is defined in the L1-norm space to obtain the optimal low-dimensional representations of brain networks. Essentially, the modularized community structures of emotional brain networks can be effectively emphasized by the L1-CGE to realize an effective depiction for emotions. Compared with existing methods, the L1-CGE model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three public emotional EEG datasets in off-line conditions. Besides, the robust real-time experimental results have been achieved with the on-line emotion decoding system designed with L1-CGE. Both off- and on-line experimental results consistently demonstrate that the proposed L1-CGE is promising to provide a potential solution for the real-time affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) system.},

Such optimization does not distinctly address stabilization and optimization as separate concerns, leading to a situation where, as the system expands in size and complexity, the optimal controller suffers performance decreases and becomes increasingly sensitive and fragile. In this article, nested optimized control (NOC) and nested optimized adaptive control (NOAC) are introduced to explicitly handle the stabilization, optimization/adaptation for unknown parameters separately in an effort to strike a balance between guaranteed stability and optimal control. The robustness of the classical optimal control is inherent in the design itself, and the stability margin is relatively small subject to parameter uncertainties. In our NOC, the robustness is explicitly handled by the state feedback control and its stability margin is larger than the classical one, because of the introduction of the explicit state feedback control loop, the next optimized control loop is introduced for system performance. Note that, the term optimized rather than optimal is used here as it is not the classical optimal control anymore, but a fundamental change in design methodology. To further improve the stability margin due to parameter uncertainties, adaptive control is introduced to approximate the parameters in an effort to further improve the stability margin.

  abstract     = {The leader-following formation control is investigated for heterogeneous multiple unmanned surface vehicles with unknown upper bound disturbances and uncertain parameters in this article. Each vehicle has a limited communication range, restricting the information exchange between neighboring vehicles to a specified radius. Due to the limitations of sensors and communication components, the communication frequency between vehicles is taken into account. First, a novel hybrid event-triggered virtual trajectory generation protocol is proposed. In such a protocol, each vessel generates its reference states in real-time without requiring real-time information from its neighbors. Then, by designing error-constrained tracking controller and connectivity-preserving potential function, the initial connectivity of the topology is maintained. Furthermore, fuzzy logic approximation and adaptive control techniques are combined in order to tackle the issues of disturbances and uncertain parameters. Through the Lyapunov method, it is proven that formation errors converge to zero as time approaches infinity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed protocol is verified through a simulation involving a cluster of seven vehicles.},

We introduce a novel reconciling adaptive modification of the predefined performance specifications based on the input constraints of the controlled plant, providing the best-feasible output performance. The automatic gain tuning in combination with the simplicity of the proposed controller enhance its robustness and enable its easy deployment in practical scenarios. Notably, the introduced control methodology ensures the necessary compromise between input-output constraints on a semi-global sense for ISS systems. However, the stability attributes for general nonlinear systems are inevitably limited to compact domains due to the inherent conflict between performance demand and actuation capability. In this context, we provide a sufficient closed-loop stability criterion through Lyapunov analysis.

According to our review of relevant research, TDLN is the first lane-level navigation solution that can provide the following features: 1) it can navigate vehicles in a lane-level manner and classify the queuing state of each vehicle as passing through an intersection; 2) it can estimate the driving time of lanes and the stopping time of intersections in different lanes to calculate the total delay time of passing through each lane and intersection; and 3) it can predict future traffic flows to determine the congestion level of each lane and explore predicted flow conditions on the road network to achieve the fastest navigation path planning. Simulation results show that TDLN outperforms existing methods and can plan the lane-level navigation path with the shortest travel time.},

The algorithm’s time complexity rapidly increases with the total number of the challenge values, which should be unpredictable. Hence, the FFS protocol is not suitable for practical zero-knowledge proof systems. In this study, we propose new zero-knowledge proof systems based on phase mask generation that are complex sinusoidal waveform versions of the FFS algorithm for efficient anonymous authentication in the diverse interactive systems. The proposed anonymous authentication schemes need a single iteration only, allowing for efficient uses of a random challenge mask with large bit-depth. The proposed schemes allow the verifier to verify that the prover knows the secret mask, such as binary pattern, visual image, or hologram, which are the prover’s secrets, without revealing any information about it to anyone else, including the verifier.

The creative aspects of this study can be emphasized as follows: first, the dynamics of the considered system are time-varying and stochastic, which is in accordance with the practical application closely. Meanwhile, a differential privacy protection mechanism is proposed, which realizes the goal of sensitive information protection via adding random noises following the Laplace probability distribution, and an energy collecting procedure is proposed to gather external energy for information exchange. Furthermore, the ultimate control objective is to implement an appropriate quasi-bipartite consensus controller to ensure that the probability of the state/output error residing within an allowable range exceed a fixed scalar. By means of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs) and the matrix analysis theory, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing quasi-bipartite consensus are derived, and an optimal constraint set is obtained by addressing a convex minimization problem. Finally, the availability of the employed approach are upheld by two illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Line current differential relays (LCDRs) are high-speed relays progressively used to protect critical transmission lines. However, LCDRs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Fault-masking attacks (FMAs) are stealthy cyberattacks performed by manipulating the remote measurements of the targeted LCDR to disguise faults on the protected line. Hence, they remain undetected by this LCDR. In this article, we propose a two-module framework to detect FMAs. The first module is a mismatch index (MI) developed from the protected transmission line’s equivalent physical model. The MI is triggered only if there is a significant mismatch in the LCDR’s local and remote measurements while the LCDR itself is untriggered, which indicates an FMA. After the MI is triggered, the second module, a neural network-based classifier, promptly confirms that the triggering event is a physical fault that lies on the line protected by the LCDR before declaring the occurrence of an FMA. The proposed framework is tested using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can accurately detect FMAs on LCDRs and is not affected by normal system disturbances, variations, or measurement noise. Our experimental results using OPAL-RT’s real-time simulator confirm the proposed solution’s real-time performance capability.},

The challenge of the network disintegration problem is to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of strategies. In this article, we propose a cost-effective targeted enumeration (TE) method for network disintegration. The proposed approach includes two stages: 1) searching for candidate objects and 2) identifying an optimal solution. In the first stage, we use rank aggregation to generate a comprehensive ranking of node importance, upon which we identify a small-scale candidate set of nodes to remove. In the second stage, we use an enumeration method to find an optimal combination among the candidate nodes. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a satisfying tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. Our adaptable TE approach can effectively address a range of combinatorial optimization challenges with significant potential applications, including personnel recruitment, portfolio management, and pharmaceutical development.},

Although adversarial attacks can be detrimental, they are crucial for testing and assisting in enhancing the robustness of models. Existing attacks on MADRL-based models are not sufficient since these attacks involve fixed perturbed agents, without taking into account cases where perturbed agents change. In this article, we present a novel adversarial attack framework. In this framework, we define critical agents that change over time, i.e., when they are perturbed a little, the whole multiagent system is perturbed greatly. Then, we identify critical agents through their worst-case joint actions. In this identifying process, we use gradient information, differential evolution, and SARSA to deal with the challenge caused by changes in the perturbed agents and to compute the worst-case joint actions. After identifying them, we use the target attack method to perturb them. We apply our method to attack the models trained by two state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms under three environments, including two industry-related ones. The experimental results demonstrate our method has a stronger perturbing ability than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Personalized robotic exoskeleton control is essential in assisting individuals with motor deficits. However, current research still lacks a solution from the end of a practical need of the problem to the end of its successful demonstration in physical environments, namely an end-to-end solution, that enables stable and continuous walking across different tasks. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a hierarchical control framework for the purpose. At the low level, impedance control ensures joint compliance without causing injury to users. At the high level, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal adaptive controller automatically personalizes assistance to both hip extension and flexion (namely, bi-directional) to reach a target range of motion (ROM) under multiple walking conditions. As the first potentially feasible approach to this challenging problem and to meet practical use requirements, we developed a least-square policy iteration-based solution to configure the intrinsic parameters within the well-established finite state machine impedance control (FSM-IC). We successfully tested the control solution on eight young unimpaired participants and one participant post-stroke wearing a hip exoskeleton while walking on an instrumented treadmill. The proposed method can be applied to solving for optimal impedance parameters for individual users and different task scenarios to increase joint ROM. Our next step is to further evaluate this solution framework on additional people with hemiparesis who may benefit from hip joint assistance in therapy or daily activities to restore normative or improve gait patterns.},

A truncated predictor feedback law is first built for a category of systems under some common assumptions. Then, under some weakened assumptions, a predictor-type feedback law is developed for the other category of more general systems. The global exponential stability of the closed-loop systems is proved. Furthermore, the result on the truncated predictor feedback control law includes many existing results on LTV systems subject to bounded input delays and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to unbounded input delays as special cases. Finally, the results of simulations validate the effectiveness of the developed control laws.},

However, the conventional AF and PVC detection strategy draws support from manual examination of electrocardiogram (ECG) and in turn translates to a labor-intensive procedure. Motivated from state refinement for LSTM, we develop a modified state refinement gated recurrent unit (MSR-GRU) that adaptively refines the current states of signal points in ECG with a signal point-wise attention and a representation gate mechanism for automated AF and PVC detection. Comparative experiments across two public databases confirm the effectiveness of MSR-GRU enjoying a consistent improvement than plain GRU and current methods. In particular, we are the first to incorporate the interaction properties within ECG into neural network thus offering interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advancements in robotic exploration, estimating the three-dimensional (3-D) motion of unknown dynamic objects, which are prevalent in chaotic construction sites, remains an unresolved challenge. In this work, we studied the problem of detecting and tracking the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion of unknown moving objects using only a stereo camera. The fundamental idea of our approach is to estimate the positions of map points at each timestamp and model their uncertainty in position, such that the correlation between map points can be found by segmenting point clouds that are parts of moving objects into different groups. By analyzing the correlation between map points, we can detect the dynamic objects in the scene without making any assumptions about the type of objects. Thus, this approach enables tracking of both known and unknown moving objects, such as a robot carrier with stacked luggage. It surpasses the performance of existing appearance-based methods, which often face difficulties when dealing with unknown objects. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately tracking moving objects, highlighting its potential for various applications. In addition, we successfully deploy our object motion estimation algorithm in an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) for the purpose of avoiding unknown moving objects in real-world scenarios. This practical implementation underscores the applicability of our approach in real-world settings.},

This article proposes a new paradigm for temporary personality shaping by prescriptively interacting the human operator/user with his “digital assistant” in cyber space. As a first proposed personality shaping with AI-aided approach, the new paradigm involves digital human modeling with uncertain personality, computational experiments on personality evolution, and prescriptive interaction with user counterpart. By iteratively and repeatedly executing the three steps, the personality of human participants is gradually tailored and prescribed so that he can well undertake specific tasks. Experiments based on online social media data and human-machine shared driving have indicated that our new personality shaping paradigm is feasible and effective in performing representative tasks.},

  abstract     = {Since the 1990s, the automated process within open-pit mines has been rapidly advanced. However, mineral transportation, as the most costly and dangerous production process, has not witnessed efficient achievements. Adverse weather conditions and complex work environments are two critical bottlenecks that impede the development and deployment of autonomous transportation of open-pit mines. To alleviate this issue, this research proposes a novel paradigm, named IMAPeM, designed to enable safe and efficient autonomous transportation with humans in the loop. IMAPeM includes three categories of miners: 1) biological miners; 2) digital miners; and 3) robotic miners, as well as three operational modes: 1) autonomous model (AM); 2) parallel model (PM); and 3) expert/emergency model (EM). IMAPeM employs these miners and modes depend on the complexity of the task, optimizing the utilization of digital and robotic miners while reducing the workload for biological miners. In addition, we developed the YUGONG system based on IMAPeM. The empirical implementation demonstrates the exceptional performance of the YUGONG system in autonomous transportation across diverse open-pit mines. This system contributes to the advancement of sustainable mining practices, which also carries profound significance for achieving long-term environmentally responsible mining operations.},

A more generalized network model is considered where the communication topology may be variable and unbalanced over time, the information flows across agents are subject to time-varying communication delays, and agents are not required to know their out-degree information accurately. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed event-triggered delay subgradient algorithm. To facilitate convergence analysis, a consensus-only “virtual” agent technique is employed, dynamically adjusting its state (active or asleep) to ensure a delay-free information flow among agents. Additionally, an augmentation approach is proposed to ensure that the augmented time-varying weight matrix is row-stochastic. It is shown that the agents’ local decision variables converge to the same optimal solution, in the case of reasonable communication delays and event-triggering thresholds. Numerical examples show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

However, existing methods deal with them separately. This renders the existing methods inefficient in practice. In this article, we investigate the relation between robustness and liveness. First, we show how to define robustness in different net systems, i.e., the live, bounded, and nonreversible or reversible net systems. Second, we present a reachability graph-based method to assess the robustness of markings. Third, we clarify the relation between robustness and liveness, and conclude that liveness is a special case of robustness, under which the set of unreliable transitions is null.

Since the applicability of the large majority of the state-of-the-art control techniques depends on this property, they frequently encounter singularities. This fact can jeopardize the system’s safety, prevent the correct task execution, or reduce performance. In this work, we investigate the relative degree of dependence for a class of compliant underactuated arms. Our method leverages the well-known strong inertial coupling hypothesis that, if holds, guarantees a constant relative degree of two. We generalize it by introducing coupling conditions where the relative degree is assured to be piecewise constant and greater than two. Relying on the design parameters, we analyze the dynamic evolution of the coupling conditions, which are then used to synthesize a classic input-output feedback controller. We also prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, we validate the efficacy of the approach in simulation and on real hardware using a two and three degrees of freedom underactuated compliant arms with varying stiffness profiles, tasks, and disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Group regularization is commonly employed in network pruning to achieve structured model compression. However, the rationale behind existing studies on group regularization predominantly hinges on the sparsity capabilities of $L_{p}$ regularizers. This singular focus may lead to erroneous interpretations. In response to these limitations, this article proposes a novel framework for evaluating the penalization efficacy of group regularization methods by analyzing the impact of $L_{p}$ regularizers on weight magnitudes and weight group magnitudes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that $L_{1,2}$ regularization, contrary to prevailing literature, indeed exhibits favorable performance in structured pruning tasks. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a hybrid group regularization approach that integrates $L_{1,2}$ regularization and group $L_{1/2}$ regularization (denoted as HGL1,2&amp; $L_{1/2}$ ). This novel method addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate $L_{p}$ regularizers for penalizing weight groups by leveraging $L_{1,2}$ regularization for penalizing groups with magnitudes exceeding a critical threshold while employing group $L_{1/2}$ regularization for other groups. Experimental evaluations are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed hybrid group regularization method and the viability of the introduced framework.},

  abstract     = {Online intelligent knowledge extraction from real-world nonstationary data streams presents a multiobjective optimization challenge. Here, we characterize the learning process on a trajectory of global optimality to simultaneously satisfy six high-profile objectives: 1) optimum generalization for the best bias-variance tradeoff; 2) compactness of knowledgebase; 3) memory retention and stability-plasticity balance; 4) universality and full autonomy; 5) robustness against outliers, noise, and model uncertainty; and 6) active concept drift detection and adaptation. We propose a flexible Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system, named UFAREX, that self-constructs and self-guards from scratch in a non-iterative sample-wise training scheme without storing data. Through quantification of various uncertainties, an adaptive prediction interval (API) is sequentially learned for each local dynamism to automatically capture the most accurate compact representation with a 95% confidence. This leads to the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) of local trends. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, API collaborates with trapezoidal membership functions (TMFs) to expand local boundaries with maximum plasticity and without distortive extrapolation. As a robust detection mechanism, API also pinpoints regions in conflict (RIC) where concept drifts and outliers are actively expressed w.r.t. time of occurrence, location, type, and severity. This establishes a single-sample online active concept drift management with zero buffer latency for regression applications. No heuristic forgetting, pruning, splitting, merging, and weighting mechanisms are exercised to prevent human intervention and render universality. UFAREX was comparatively tested on four real-world benchmarks. It stands out as an autonomous system geared for adaptive modeling, time-series forecasting, anomaly monitoring, and robust fault detection and diagnosis.},

Additionally, the mode-dependent fuzzy rules describing nonlinear behavior are constructed, that is, the membership functions are dependent on the system modes, thus promoting the previous results efficacious in a more accurate form. Subsequently, by fully utilizing available SMK information, some sufficient conditions based on the slow state feedback technique are derived to ensure that the semi-Markov jump fuzzy SPSs are stabilized and satisfy the given passive performance.

  abstract     = {Visual reinforcement learning (VRL) aims to optimize policies by utilizing information derived from visual sensory inputs. To tackle the challenges of high dimensionality and sample efficiency, numerous studies have leveraged self-supervised learning to encode observations into latent state representations. Though these algorithms have shown promise, they may be susceptible to task-irrelevant distractions, such as changes in background, color, and camera angles. Thus, we propose the clustering-driven state embedding for reinforcement learning (RL) under visual distractions (CSE-RL) to learn more robust state representations. The student’s t distribution is first utilized to model the predicted clustering assignment. In this process, the reward centers are defined by hardening the target distribution. Subsequently, the state embeddings, rewards, and their respective centers are fed into the predicted clustering assignment function for clustering. To avoid trivial solutions, the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is adopted to balance observations across clusters. The proposed CSE-RL has the capacity to enhance the comprehension of inherent relationships among different states, while also filtering out irrelevant or redundant information, resulting in the creation of more efficient representations that are less prone to visual distractions. Experimental results from the distracting control suite (DCS) indicate that CSE-RL achieves comparable or even better performance compared with several state-of-the-art VRL algorithms in handling challenging visual distractions. Notably, CSE-RL exhibits remarkable improvements of 31.82% and 18.18% on DCS over baselines based on data-regularized Q (DrQ) and DrQv2 frameworks, respectively. Integrating CSE-RL into offline RL offers promising avenues for future study.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating heterogeneous microtargets based on optoelectronic tweezers (OETs) to construct micropatterns with specific distribution and ordered arrangement enables recapitulating the spatial architecture of cells in native tissues, and has significant potential in tissue regeneration, medical diagnostics, and cell behavior research. However, the uncertain disturbances in liquid environment, collision risk, and electrokinetic interference in OETs system can cause microtargets to deviate from the safe and controlled state, especially for manipulation tasks with heterogeneous microtargets. Here, we propose an improved hierarchical value iteration network (IHVIN)-GAT-based path planning method for parallel manipulation of heterogeneous microtargets with independent control, integrating goal assignment, feature extraction, and decentralized decision-making. The Kuhn-Munkres-based goal assignment model periodically modifies the matching relationship between microtargets and goal positions to reduce the task complexity. High-order features involving path planning are extracted by an IHVIN model, and then selectively aggregated and convolved through GAT to yield real-time locomotion strategies for all microtargets. For the issues of constraint variability and system heterogeneity, discrete locomotion constraints are developed through analysis of escape mechanism, then embedded into modeling procedures and converted to heterogeneous edge weights in graph domain. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the desired performance of the IHVIN-GAT model in high timeliness, high strategy quality, and compatibility for microtarget number, where up to 20 microtargets from three categories are parallel manipulated within 16 s to form arbitrary micropatterns recapitulating microscale architecture of cells in native tissues. We anticipate that our method will contribute to construct more biomimetic microstructures with heterogeneous cells for biomedical applications in the future.},

The acronym ID denotes the actual scheduling of the usual management operations (OPs) executed inside each review period. We show that the information carried by the ID is fundamental to define an efficient inventory control policy (ICP). The notion of ID is particularly important in the case of SCs characterized by elements of complexity like: 1) perishable goods with large, not exactly known deterioration rate; 2) the length of the review period is such as to produce a high spoilage within it; 3) an uncertain future customer demand with oscillations that are not statistically modelable. Exploiting the notion of ID, we define an inventory model properly capturing these features. This model encompasses as particular cases other SC models proposed in the literature. We also define a coherent two criteria-based evaluation of the bullwhip effect (BE). We also provide key managerial insights for a proper scheduling of all the OPs inside each review period.

The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through simulation and experimental tests, demonstrating their capability to address the control challenges posed by the considered system models in neural networks, robot control and a real-time oscillator applications. Simulation and empirical results illustrate the improved performance achieved by the control strategy over two existing adaptive control schemes in terms of lower-steady-state error, faster system responsiveness and increased stability (milder oscillation) in the state responses.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has been developed as a state-of-the-art population-based stochastic optimizer for continuous nonconvex search space in recent decades. It uses difference vectors among individuals to adaptively control the balance between exploration and exploitation for achieving an excellent search performance. Specifically, one-to-one selection in DE guarantees that difference vectors vary from large for exploration to small for exploitation. However, the selection may generate inappropriate scale of difference vectors, which causes insufficient exploitation when facing complex problems with, e.g., multimodal with a huge number of local optima or plain regions. In this article, we propose a multiselection-based DE (MSDE) to address such limitation. Specifically, three different types of selection strategies are adopted to deal with the different situation during a search process. The proposed MSDE is evaluated on the 2013, 2014, and 2017 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation real parameter optimization competitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSDE significantly outperforms the winners of those competitions. We further show that, when integrating the proposed multiselection-based strategy with the original DE or other advanced DE variants, it can also improve their search performance on most of test cases. This work makes a significant contribution to advance the state of the art in the area of population-based stochastic optimizers.},

  abstract     = {Improving classification performance and reducing the number of selected features are two conflicting objectives of feature selection, which can be well solved by multiobjective algorithms. However, as the dimensionality of the data increases, the search space for feature selection will grow exponentially, which leads to high-computational costs. Additionally, the complex interaction among features makes the population prone to falling into local optimal. To address these issues, feature grouping can treat one dimension as a group of features instead of one feature, effectively transforming the high-dimensional search space into a lower-dimensional one. Since different grouping forms can be converted into different feature combination spaces, the search directions of the population also vary. Inspired by this, a multiform optimization approach based on space transformation (MOFS-MST) is proposed in this article. Specifically, two different grouping forms are set based on the ranking of features in different evaluation criteria to construct a multiform framework, thereby increasing the diversity of the population. During the evolutionary process, a knowledge transfer strategy based on feature groups is executed between the two forms of grouping in order to help each other escape local optima. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the state of feature grouping to enhance the potential for feature interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms six other state-of-the-art multiobjective high-dimensional feature selection methods on 12 high-dimensional datasets.},

Next, to enhance the training speed of the network, a less parameter encoder mechanism is developed. Subsequently, a multiexpert learning method is proposed, in which the solutions obtained by these experts are used as the ground truth values to enhance the convergence and searching capabilities.

Finally, based on a realistic prefabricated component production horizon, a set of instances is generated to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The comprehensive computational comparison and statistical analysis reveal that the proposed IML algorithm, when compared to two recently published efficient algorithms, yields an average improvement of about 8.66% and 13.78%, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce adaptive robust observers for the estimation of comprehensive state variables and model parameters of a leader system. In particular, we suppose that the communication network among followers suffers communication link faults (CLFs), and the leader contains uncertainty, which means no follower knows the model parameters of leader system. Then, by applying the proposed observers, we elaborate on the design of a robust model-independent controller tailored for the leader-follower consensus problem (LFCP) of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems (MELSs). In contrast to the controllers currently employed for the LFCP in MELSs, the controller developed herein exhibits robustness against bounded external disturbances. Besides, the controller does not rely on the specific structure or characteristics of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) system model. At last, we provide simulation examples to demonstrate the validity of the proposed observers and the robust controller in the context of the LFCP for MELSs.},

Compared to traditional quadrotors, the HQWAW add two wings on left and right sides of the quadrotor. Each wing is a single structure that can rotate to any angle of attack independently, which is referred to as all-moving wing (AW) in this article. The dynamic modeling of this configuration takes into account a complete description of flight dynamics, including wing aerodynamics and the dynamics of motors and propellers. A comprehensive nonlinear flight controller is proposed using model feedforward and state feedback for the HQWAW that supports the whole flight envelope. The proposed HQWAW configuration is compared with a traditional quadrotor with all parameters being the same except for the absence of the AWs. A set of numerical results demonstrate that the proposed configuration can obtain flight flexibility beyond quadrotors, while effectively reducing energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of fault isolation is studied for linear stochastic time-varying systems. Different from the existing results about fault isolation, the system in this article suffers from strong noise, which increases the difficulty of distinguishing different fault components since the difference in measurement distributions caused by different fault components is small. To handle this problem, a novel fault isolation scheme comprising a set of residuals, a set of evaluation functions, and a decision logic is proposed. First, based on the hypothesis testing method, two performance indices reflecting the probability of two classes of false isolation induced by noise are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the influence of strong noise on residuals. Under a given threshold, the existence of the optimal residual with two minimal performance indices is proved in this article, which minimizes the effect of noise on residuals. Subsequently, a suboptimal recursive residual whose parameter gradually tends to the parameter of the optimal residual is designed. Following this, by employing the $\chi ^{2}$ test and the predesigned decision logic, fault isolation can be realized. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

High-quality SNE solutions are obtained by assigning each player a local stochastic rule based on its category and a finite memory. By demonstrating the existence of a finite improvement path from each INE to an SNE, we prove finite-time convergence of the NESA.

Moreover, a novel connectivity-preserving error function is designed to maintain the connection between two neighboring agents.

  abstract     = {Solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) is very challenging due to the requirements to respond rapidly and precisely to changes in an environment. Many prediction- and memory-based algorithms have been recently proposed for meeting these requirements. However, much useful knowledge has been ignored during the historical search process, and prediction deviations could occur, thus limiting the applicability of these methods to a variety of problems. Facing these concerns, this article proposes an evolutionary algorithm named FGTTMP based on feedback-guided transfer (FGT) and trend manifold prediction (TMP) for solving DMOPs. The FGT employs an information feedback model to extract valuable knowledge using all historical environments and then identifies excellent individuals using cluster-transfer learning. This can both accelerate convergence and introduce diversity for future environments. The TMP applies the probability-based trend prediction method to estimate the mass center of the whole population and the corresponding manifold, relying on the two previous moments. Thus, the FGT and TMP strategies combine historical knowledge with prediction techniques, synergistically leading the population in promising directions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is fully investigated and compared with eight state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FGTTMP method can achieve better convergence and diversity on 19 various benchmark problems than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multimode process monitoring plays a significant role in ensuring the stable operation of industrial processes under changing conditions. Due to the continuous emergence of new modes, some adaptive model updating methods are proposed. However, the updated model may forget important features learned in previous modes, thus reducing the monitoring performance. To address this problem, this article proposes a global information-based lifelong dictionary learning (GI-LDL) method for multimode process monitoring. Specifically, this article adopts dictionary atoms as the fundamental units for representing process data and proposes a method for measuring the importance of dictionary atoms based on global information. Then, to ensure that the dictionary retains its representational ability for both new and historical mode data during the mode updating process, a surrogate quadratic loss considering the importance is further proposed to penalize changes of important atoms. Compared with dictionary constraints, finer-grained atomic constraints ensure that the dictionary preserves important features of previous modes while learning features of new modes. Finally, considering that the number of modes in multimode industrial processes is often unknown in advance, this article explicitly derives analytical solutions for dictionary updating, thus it is capable of accommodating ever-increasing modes in real industrial processes. To verify the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed method, extensive experiments are elaborately designed, and experimental results indicate that the proposed method has precise monitoring capabilities for both historical and new modes.},

In this article, a noncascade structured velocity-tracking control scheme in accordance with an adaptive refined disturbance observer (ARDO) is figured out and applied to suppress multiple disturbances and promote tracking accuracy. However, because disturbances affect the current directly through the same channel under the noncascade structure, there are two issues: 1) overcurrent protection and 2) mismatched disturbance repression. For this purpose, a finite-time current-constrained controller is constructed to ensure the current constraint and handle the mismatched problem simultaneously. An ARDO consists of a disturbance observer (DO) to estimate rotor imbalance disturbance that is modeled by an exogenous system, and an adaptive sliding mode DO to handle residual disturbances with unknown change rate. Ultimately, experimental verifications are conducted to confirm the validity of proposed composite control strategy.},

The only available solution to this problem in the literature is that given by Nicopolitidis et al. (2003), Obaidat et al. (2002), and Papadimitriou et al. (2002). It was shown to solve a large set of the adaptive resource allocation problems under noisy environments (Nicopolitidis et al., 2003; Obaidat et al., 2002; Papadimitriou and Pomportsis, 2000 and 1999; Nicopolitidis et al., 2004; Obaidat et al., 2001; and Papadimitriou and Pomportsis, 2000). We make a threefold contribution. First, we take a two-timescale approach to the field of LA by estimating the reward probabilities on a faster timescale than the timescale for updating the polling probabilities. Second, by making a not-obvious choice of the objective function, we show that the NSPP problem is indeed an instantiation of the stochastic nonlinear fractional equality knapsack (NFEK) problem, which is a substantial resource allocation problem based on the incomplete and noisy information (Granmo and Oommen, 2010). Third, in contrast to the legacy approach taken by Papadimitriou and Maritsas (1992 and 1996), we show through the extensive experimental results that our solution is remarkably robust to the choice of tuning parameters and that it outperforms the state of the art solution in terms of the Bayesian expected loss.},

These elements are properly combined to develop a data-driven algorithm capable to derive an accurate outer convex approximation of the nonlinear evolution. In particular, an actor-critic RL scheme is designed to efficiently comply with the exhaustive research on the whole parameter space. At each iteration, the effectiveness of the obtained uncertain polytopic model is tested by a probabilistic approach based on a confidence level metrics. As the main merits of the proposed approach are concerned, the following aspect clearly stands up: the development of an interdisciplinary methodology that takes advantage of system theory, probabilistic arguments and RL capabilities giving rise to an harmonized architecture in charge to deal with a vast class of nonlinear systems. Finally, the validity of the proposed approach is tested by resorting to benchmark examples that allow to quantify the level of accuracy of the computed convex hull.},

While SGS can be paired with a variety of generative methods, this article specifically demonstrates its application using the spiral discovery method (SDM)—an autoregressive data generation model that allows for the exploratory manipulation of numerical data. The uniqueness and widespread applicability of this approach stems from its support for the fine-grained optimization of exploration versus exploitation goals through an interpretable set of hyperparameters.

First, an infinite horizon nonquadratic value function with a novel integrand is formulated for the studied system to evaluate the performance, tackle the asymmetric input saturation, and remove certain rigorous assumptions in prior related studies. Second, a critic neural network (CNN) in the adaptive dynamic programming framework is constructed to obtain the optimal event-triggered control (ETC). An improved concurrent learning technique is then developed to update the CNN’s weights without requiring the persistence of excitation condition. Compared with the static ETC scheme, the present dynamic ETC strategy consumes fewer computational resources. Third, the uniform ultimate boundedness of the state, the weight estimation error, and the internal dynamic variable are assured, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, a rotational-translational actuator system is given to validate the developed intermittent feedback optimal control scheme.},

Malicious DoS attacks disrupt the communication between the controller and the actuator. The finite attack resources of malevolent attackers are taken into consideration, and the DoS attacks are characterized using an aperiodic model. In contrast to prior results, the present study tackles the issues of security analysis and secure controller design by considering the attributes of the DoS attacks, instead of employing a switched system approach to address the aforementioned concerns. First, under aperiodic DoS attacks, sufficient criteria are established to guarantee that the closed-loop CPSs can attain asymptotical stability. Second, within a time-varying attack period, the relationship between the attack active interval and the attack silent interval is derived, if this relation is not satisfied, the stability of the system will deteriorate. Finally, a unified framework is developed to address the external disturbances and aperiodic DoS attacks. Sufficient criteria are introduced for evaluating the security of CPSs, and a corresponding secure control scheme is also designed. To verify the efficacy of the derived theory, a wheeled mobile robot system under aperiodic DoS attacks is illustrated.},

  abstract     = {Mass individualized prototyping (MIP) is a kind of advanced and high-value-added manufacturing service. In the MIP context, the service providers usually receive massive individualized prototyping orders, and they should keep a stable state in the presence of continuous significant stresses or disruptions to maximize profit. This article proposed a graph convolutional neural network-based deep reinforcement learning (GCNN-DRL) method to achieve the resilient production control of MIP (RPC-MIP). The proposed method combines the excellent feature extraction ability of graph convolutional neural networks with the autonomous decision-making ability of deep reinforcement learning. First, a three-dimensional disjunctive graph is defined to model the RPC-MIP, and two dimensionality-reduction rules are proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the disjunctive graph. By extracting the features of the reduced-dimensional disjunctive graph through a graph isomorphic network, the convergence of the model is improved. Second, a two-stage control decision strategy is proposed in the DRL process to avoid poor solution quality in the large-scale searching space of the RPC-MIP. As a result, the high generalization capability and efficiency of the proposed GCNN-DRL method are obtained, which is verified by experiments. It could withstand system performance in the presence of continuous significant stresses of workpiece replenishment and also make fast rearrangement of dispatching decisions to achieve rapid recovery after disruptions happen in different production scenarios and system scales, thereby improving the system’s resilience.},

A method of returning the truck to the desired position is proposed by analysing the movement trajectory of the truck. Two results are certified. The first result considers the issue of reachable set estimation (RSE) for the multirate sampled-data (MRSD) system in the aperiodic sampled-data framework based on the model knowledge. By constructing loop-based Lyapunov functional (LBLF), we obtain the sufficient condition that all the state trajectories are confined to target ellipsoid. This article also provides a computational method for an MRSD controller considering RSE. The second result provides the data-driven control tactics for the unknown sampled-data system to consider the RSE problem for the aperiodic sampled-data system, using only the noisy data. In addition, this article extends the data-driven control scheme to the design of MRSD controllers and ensures the stability of the system in agreement with the measured data. Simulation results show that the MRSD controller under both the model-driven method and the data-driven method is valid and achieves better control effect compared to the single-rate sampled-data (SRSD).},

  abstract     = {This article presents a resilient formation control framework for networked nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) that enables long-time recovery abilities subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by taking advantage of the Koopman operator. Due to the intermittent interruption of communication under DoS, the transmitted signals among the networked NMRs are incomplete. In the lifted space, the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator is employed to capture a linear characteristic of the missed signals from the available signals. Specifically, a data-driven cost function is developed to approximate the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator, allowing long-term recovery capabilities for the missed signals, where the useful historical data is identified by an event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Then, the least-squares method is implemented to calculate a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. Once DoS attacks are active, the missed signals are recovered forward from the latest received signals through the approximation Koopman operator. Furthermore, according to the recovered and transmitted signals, the resilient formation controller with a variable gain takes into account the convergence rate and the steady state formation error. The Lyapunov theorem is introduced to prove that the formation error quickly converges to the minor compact set. A distributed DoS attack example is conducted to validate the efficiency and superiority in numerical simulation, and the proposed method is implemented on the real networked NMRs.},

However, it is difficult for most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to get satisfactory results. To address this problem, this article proposes a dynamic knowledge-guided coevolutionary algorithm, which employs a cooperative coevolutionary framework tailored for large-scale SMOPs. Specifically, variable selection is performed initially for the dimension reduction, and two populations are evolved in the original and reduced decision spaces, respectively. After offspring generation, variable replacement is performed to precisely identify the sparse distribution of Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, a dynamic score update mechanism is designed based on the discovered sparsity knowledge, which aims to adjust the direction of evolution dynamically. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a variety of benchmark test instances and real-world test instances with the comparison of five other state-of-the-art MOEAs.},

Inspired by the observed three-section structure pattern revealed by human-labeled graspable rectangles, we first design a structure prior attention (SPA) module which uses two-dimensional encoding to enhance the local patterns and utilizes self-attention mechanism to reallocate distribution of grasping-specific features. Then, the proposed SPA module is integrated with fundamental feature extraction modules and residual connection to achieve the implicit and explicit feature fusion, which further serves as the building block of our proposed Unet-like grasp detection network. It takes RGBD images as input and outputs image-size feature maps, from which the grasp configurations can be determined. Extensive comparative experiments on the five public datasets prove our method’s superiority to other approaches in detection accuracy, achieving 99.2%, 96.1%, 98.0%, 86.7%, and 92.6% on the Cornell, Jacquard, Clutter, VMRD, and GraspNet datasets. With visual evaluation metrics and user study, the quality maps generated by our method possess more concentrative distribution of high-confidence grasps and clearer discrimination with backgrounds. In addition, its effectiveness is also verified by robotic grasping under real-world scenario, leading to higher success rate.},

Furthermore, a significant dynamic event-triggered control (DETC) protocol was developed based on the saturation controller and measurement error, which reduced the number of controller updates.

They significantly challenge the existing control solutions under discontinuous references which are based on filtering, guidance, or impulsive systems. To conquer this obstruction, a novel hybrid control scheme is devised in this article, which consists of a robust constraint-handling controller and a proportional controller. It steers the system output to track the discontinuous reference with tunable setting time and accuracy, without violation of the prescribed constraint. Moreover, the controller exhibits a significant simplicity. While it is independent of the specific model information of the plant or the derivatives of the intermediate control signals, no effort is paid for parameter identification, function approximation, command filtering, or disturbance estimation.

However, due to the diversity and complexity of users and information dissemination dynamics, localizing the rumor sources in social networks is still a critical and crucial problem yet to be well solved. Recent years, although several methods have been proposed to attempt to solve this problem, they suffer from the contradiction between accuracy and model complexity. To detect information sources efficiently, this article propose a heuristic framework for sources detection (HFSD) in social networks via graph convolutional networks which handles three major challenges, including: 1) the diversity and complexity of users and information dissemination dynamics; 2) difficulty to detect multiple sources, especially without knowing the number of sources; and 3) the class imbalance problem caused by the large differences in sample size of sources and nonsources. Specifically, first, to counteract the diversity and complexity of users and information, different kinds of features of users and information are encoded in the raw feature vectors; second, to address multisource detection, we adopt a binary classification in the last layer of model, which is different from the n-classification methods that are always applied to single-source scenario; finally, to solve the class imbalance problem, we design a balance mechanism which offsets the differences in sample size between the sets of sources and nonsources. Extensive experiments conducted on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that HFSD can handle problems mentioned above and outperforms than state-of-the-art algorithms significantly.},

  abstract     = {Due to the curse of dimensionality and the unknown sparsity of search spaces, evolutionary algorithms face immense challenges in approximating optimal solutions for widely studied sparse large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (SLMOPs). Most bilevel encoding scheme (BLES)-based algorithms primarily focus on exploring sparsity in the binary layer, neglecting the real layer. Moreover, the interactions between two layers may be disregarded in these algorithms, thus the latent gap between the two encoding scales could lead to evolutionary ambiguity and performance limitations. To tackle the above issues, this article proposes a novel BLES-based collaborative algorithm using cross-scale knowledge fusion for SLMOPs. The algorithm integrates dual grouping and dual dimension reduction techniques via two subpopulations in a coevolutionary manner. Additionally, the interaction strategy is designed for each technique, leveraging the binary layer to guide the real layer, thus facilitating sufficient cross-scale cooperation. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLMOPs and four real-world applications validate the proposed algorithm’s strong competitiveness in solving SLMOPs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The modeling and solution process involves the following: 1) formulating a mixed-integer programming (MILP) model for MPERA with demand priority (MPERA-DP), aiming to maximize utility considering the transportation cost, districting change, and penalty for unsatisfied demand and 2) incorporating the justifiable granularity principle (JGP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) into the brand-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm for initial districting and allocating decisions to improve the solution quality and calculation speed. The results of the experiments show that 1) the JGP-PSO-B&amp;P algorithm achieves superior efficiency in terms of optimality and convergence for large-scale cases. This algorithm could improve the optimality by 13.42% compared with that of the JGP-PSO algorithm, 13.15% compared with that of the B&amp;P algorithm, and 28.18% compared with that of the PSO algorithm, on average; 2) the MPERA-DP model with flexible districting policy outperforms flexible MPERA without demand priority, emergency resource allocation with rescheduling (ERAR) and fixed emergency resource allocation with demand priority (FERA-DP), improving the utility by 20.56%, 5.14% and 41.84%, respectively; and 3) the scheme efficiency is influenced by the desirable satisfaction deviation, and when set to 0.6, it allows for the optimization of both demand satisfaction and utility.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), environmental changes can be characterized as various dynamics. Faced with different dynamics, existing dynamic optimization algorithms (DOAs) are difficult to tackle, because they are incapable of learning in each environment to control the search. Besides, diversity loss is a critical issue in solving DOPs. Maintaining a high-diversity over dynamic environments is reasonable as it can address such an issue automatically. In this article, we propose a particle search control network (PSCN) to maintain a high-diversity over time and control two key search actions of each input individual, i.e., locating the local learning target and adjusting the local acceleration coefficient. Specifically, PSCN adequately considers the diversity to generate subpopulations located by hidden node centers, where each center is assessed by significance-based criteria and distance-based criteria. The former enable a small intrasubpopulation distance and a big search scope (subpopulation width) for each subpopulation, while the latter make each center distant from other existing centers. In each subpopulation, the best-found position is selected as the local learning target. In the output layer, PSCN determines the action of adjusting the local acceleration coefficient of each individual. Reinforcement learning is introduced to obtain the desired output of PSCN, enabling the network to control the search by learning in different iterations of each environment. The experimental results especially performance comparisons with eight state-of-the-art DOAs demonstrate that PSCN brings significant improvements in performance of solving DOPs.},

Considering that the internal feedback information from a neural network (NN) is low, a multilevel feedback NN is proposed. Combining an NN with a biofeedback mechanism increases the internal feedback information and improves the convergence accuracy of the NN. The multilevel feedback network is used in three internal networks of the intelligent MPC algorithm. In order to improve the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm, a biologically inspired central coordination module and operations research theory inspired priority factor module is incorporated within the HDP algorithm. The prediction accuracy and control speed of the algorithm for nonlinear time-varying systems is greatly improved without affecting the control accuracy. The stability and convergence of the intelligent MPC algorithm is demonstrated on test data. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed MPC algorithm is verified and compared against several traditional algorithms.},

Recent studies have found a new uncertainty measure for probabilities called “extropy” as a complementary dual function of classical Shannon entropy. In this article, the extropy measure of randomness is generalized to the case of information with epistemic uncertainty by means of a framework of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Specifically, a novel measure called plausibility extropy is proposed, which inherits the intriguing properties of original extropy. Moreover, the duality and complementarity between the proposed plausibility extropy and existing plausibility entropy are proved strictly, which constitutes an entropy-extropy combination for mass functions to measure the epistemic uncertainty. In addition, the maximum plausibility extropy is also studied in this article. Through comparing with existing extropy-like measures in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, the rationality of proposed plausibility extropy is further demonstrated.},

A mathematical model is first constructed to minimize the latest arrival time of coalition members, considering the capability requirements of missions, nonredundant agents in coalitions, etc. Then, incorporating the benefits in both the diversity of random search and the effectiveness of utilizing problem knowledge, a local-search-based heuristic is put forward to solve the CF problem. An initial solution is incrementally constructed by prioritizing agents with shorter movement times for missions with higher-remaining capability requirements. Additionally, two types of neighborhood search operators, namely, the tabu-based one-to-one swap and the destroy and repair operators, are proposed to search the solution space from two perspectives, i.e., “adjustment” and “reconstruction.” To solve the problem effectively and efficiently, the former excludes certain agent-exchange combinations that do not improve the current solution, while the latter consists of multiple heuristic rules extracted from the correlation among different model elements. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method surpasses several advanced methods across various scenarios regarding multiple factors, such as the number of agents, the number of missions, and the demand-supply ratio on capabilities.},

NIDS are often developed offline while they face auto-generated port scan infiltration attempts, resulting in a significant time lag from adversarial adaption to NIDS response. To address these challenges, we use hypergraphs (HGs) focused on Internet protocol (IP) addresses and destination ports to capture evolving patterns of port scan attacks. The derived set of HG-based metrics are then used to train an ensemble machine learning (ML)-based NIDS that allows for real-time adaption in monitoring and detecting port scanning activities, other types of attacks, and adversarial intrusions at high accuracy, precision and recall performances. This ML adapting NIDS was developed through the combination of 1) intrusion examples; 2) NIDS update rules; 3) attack threshold choices to trigger NIDS retraining requests; and 4) a production environment with no prior knowledge of the nature of network traffic. 40 scenarios were auto-generated to evaluate the ML ensemble NIDS comprising three tree-based models. The resulting ML ensemble NIDS was extended and evaluated with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Results show that under the model settings of an Update-ALL-NIDS rule (specifically retrain and update all the three models upon the same NIDS retraining request) the proposed ML ensemble NIDS evolved intelligently and produced the best results with nearly 100% detection performance throughout the simulation.},

However, the development of advanced boat reidentification (Boat Re-ID) algorithms necessitates the availability of large-scale Re-ID datasets for model training and evaluation. Inspired by scenarios engineering, this study proposes a new framework for automatically generating a realistic synthetic dataset for boat Re-ID investigation. The synthetic dataset contains 107 boat models and various visual conditions in 36 real backgrounds. The use of synthetic datasets enables the learning-based Re-ID algorithm’s performance to be quantitatively verificated under varying imaging conditions. Nonetheless, our experiments prove that synthetic datasets are inadequate to handle real-world challenges. Therefore, we present a domain adaptation approach that integrates both real and synthetic data to create trustworthy models. This approach employs a multistep training strategy, gradient reversal layer and novel loss functions to preserve the features from two distribution dataset domains. The results of the experiments demonstrate that 1) synthetic datasets can be employed to train boat Re-ID algorithms and quantitatively test the performance of these algorithms under diverse imaging conditions and 2) our approach utilizes the attributes of the two data domains (real and synthetic) to achieve exceptional performance in real-world applications.},

It is shown that for this problem simple and neat analytical globally optimal solutions exist. By using the derived globally optimal solutions repeatedly, this article second proposes a circulation design for eigenstructure assignment in a stabilizable linear system via state feedback with low closed-loop eigenvalue sensitivities. As a consequence, in those rounds of replacing a real open-loop eigenvalue of order 1, the sensitivity index of the assigned closed-loop eigenvalue can be globally minimized. In the case that all the open-loop eigenvalues to be replaced are real ones of order 1, the proposed circulation design not only turns out to be extremely simple and efficient, but also possesses good numerical reliability because it removes completely matrix inverse operations.

In response, this work introduces a pioneering data-driven SA framework, termed digital twin-based SA (DT-SA), aiming to bridge existing gaps between data and demands, and further to enhance SA capabilities within the complex EIoT landscape. First, we redefine the concept of digital twin (DT) within the EIoT context, aligning it with data-intensive scientific discovery paradigm (the Fourth Paradigm) so as to waken EIoT’s sleeping data; this contextual redefinition lays the cornerstone of our DT-SA framework for EIoT. Then, the framework is comprehensively explored through its four fundamental steps: digitalization, simulation, informatization, and intellectualization. These steps initiate a virtual ecosystem conducive to a continuously self-adaptive, self-learning, and self-evolving big model (BM), further contributing to the evolution and effectiveness of DT-SA in engineering. Our framework is characterized by the incorporation of system theory and Fourth Paradigm as guiding ideologies, DT as data engine, and BM as intelligence engine. This unique combination forms the backbone of our approach. This work extends beyond engineering, stepping into the domain of data science—DT-SA not only enhances management practices for EIoT users/operators, but also propels advancements in pattern analysis and machine intelligence (PAMI) within the intricate fabric of a complex system. Numerous real-world cases validate our DT-SA framework.},

To promote production continuity, multiple interchangeable task assignment schemes are required, each targeting one of the regular and PM scenarios. Yet previous studies have not solved the resulting two-sided assembly line balancing problem considering PM scenarios (TALBP-PM), and the domain knowledge deserves extraction. Hence, a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize cycle times and total task adjustment simultaneously, and a knowledge-assisted variable neighborhood search (KVNS) is customized. Specifically, a decoding mechanism with idle time reduction is proposed to achieve schemes with the shortest cycle times. A rule-based initialization relying on the externalization of implicit relations among unique attributes is designed to derive a high-quality initial solution. Supported by the critical station and task knowledge, objective-oriented neighborhood structures are developed to generate neighbor solutions with increasingly better objectives. Besides, a restart operator adaptive to multidomain knowledge is refined to escape from local optima. Computational results show that the knowledge assistance is effective, and KVNS is superior to other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics in achieving well-converged and -distributed Pareto fronts of TALBP-PM.},

  abstract     = {In industrial applications where computational resources are finite and data noises are prevalent, the representation power of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial. Traditional network structures often require a significant increase in the parameter amount to enhance the representation power, making it difficult to achieve effective representation under parameter amount constraints. In order to alleviate this problem, this work leverages the ordinary differential equation (ODE) interpretation of deep residual networks, elucidating the relationship between the fine-grained connectivity modes of blocks in DNNs and the representation power. We build a bridge from the order of numerical methods and the order of ODEs to the representation power of DNNs. Besides, we show that higher-order ODEs can be approximated by k-step methods incorporating trainable coefficients. Empirically, we validate our theoretical insights by demonstrating the superior representation power of our proposed network structures through enhanced performance on industrial tasks, such as surface defect detection, critical temperature prediction of superconductors, and image classification under noises. The proposed method provides a new approach to the design of network structures for robust and accurate DNNs, enhancing the representation power with a negligible number of additional parameters.

  abstract     = {In the era of Industry 5.0 and the emerging metaverses, this study proposes Meta-Services, a novel paradigm that evolves a traditional service system into a multistage ecosystem. In the proposed paradigm, we develop a parallel intelligence-based management framework that enables stakeholders to control and manage the complex dynamics of service delivery in the metaverse. The management framework involves the following three stages: 1) service systems in metaverses; 2) elementary parallel service systems; and 3) parallel intelligence empowered ecosystems. The third stage evolves from the first two stages by incorporating the approach of “designer in the loop,” contributing to more human-centered, adaptive, and resilient service systems. Moreover, a case study in the retail sector is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and show its practical potential.},

  abstract     = {Sampled-data systems (SDSs) have received extensive attention due to their wide application in industrial processes. However, for SDSs characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics, it is still a great challenge to achieve stable tracking control when they are affected by stochastic sampling. To deal with this situation, a data-based adaptive model predictive control (DAMPC) method is developed to stabilize the stochastic sampled-data complex nonlinear systems (SSDCNSs). First, an equivalent system with stochastic time-varying delay is constructed to describe SSDCNS. Then, the sampling interval variation of SSDCNS is equivalently converted into the stochastic time-varying delay, whose transfer probability can be gained by the activation frequencies of stochastic sampling intervals. Second, a fuzzy neural network (FNN)-based multistep predictive model with an adaptive prediction horizon (APH) is established. Then, APH is adaptively adjusted according to the stochastic time-varying delay and its transfer probability, and the necessary predictive information can be provided for the controller. Third, an optimal control problem (OCP) is solved to stabilize the SSDCNS. Especially, an attenuation learning rate (ALR) is designed for the controller to reduce excessive control increments. Then, the control action can be calculated to realize stable tracking control. Finally, the stability of the proposed scheme is analyzed in theory, and the effectiveness of the designed method is assessed by a numerical simulation system and an industrial application in the wastewater treatment process (WWTP).},

To address this problem, a data-knowledge-driven multiobjective integrated optimal control (DK-MIOC) method is proposed in this article. First, an integrated optimal control (IOC) framework is designed that integrates a cost function for both system performance and tracking error. Then, the feasibility of the controller can be considered simultaneously while solving for the optimal setpoints. Second, a data-knowledge-driven model is incorporated into this framework to predict future dynamics. Then, the performance indices can be accurately predicted even with insufficient data. Third, a collaborative optimization algorithm is implemented to determine setpoints and control laws. Consequently, the operational control performance of the nonlinear system is enhanced. Furthermore, the stability of the DK-MIOC strategy is also analyzed.

  abstract     = {Privacy security research is one of the most important issues for the cyber-physical systems, and opacity as an information flow property, provides a new perspective for studying privacy security in complex information interaction scenarios. In the context of the discrete event systems, vital privacy can be modeled as secret states and based on the available observations (i.e., the sequence of observable events), intruders would analyse whether something secret has occurred. In this article, three kinds of strong W-limited opacity, named strong W, $(W,M)$ , and $(W,\infty)$ opacity for the partially observed discrete event system are investigated based on the security quantification consideration. It is assumed that the vicious eavesdropper has a complete knowledge of given systems’ structure and analyses something secret by limited observable information. Meanwhile, in addition to the current and delayed information analysis, predictive information analysis is first added to the strong opacity setting. W denotes the limited observable information and $M~(\infty)$ represents the finite (infinite) predictability. Subsequently, a pivotal technique called labeled W-limited state estimator is constructed, based on which, verifications for the three kinds of strong W-limited opacity are accomplished with the help of secret-labeled states and secret-reaching states. The current work shows that the complexity is $O(2^{2|X|}(W+1)|\Sigma _{o}|)$ . Finally, the upper bounds of W and M are also discussed, and it is proved to be $|X|(2^{|X|}-1)$ and $2^{|X\backslash X_{S}|}-1$ . (X is the state set, $X_{S}$ is the secret state set, and $\Sigma _{o}$ denotes the observable events set.)},

Further, prescribed performance constraints are embedded within this architecture to achieve desired transient and steady-state performance along with added robustness to chattering. Hence, in comparison to prior studies, the proposed scheme facilitates a more robust control architecture with the added benefits of more stringent application of the input constraints and superior transient and steady-state performance. Simulation and experimental studies of trajectory tracking, including comparisons with leading alternative designs, are used to verify the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed scheme.},

The command-filter-based control design not only circumvents the computing complexity in the backstepping but also reduces the conservativeness of the assumption regarding the desired signal and the time-varying asymmetric constraints. Additionally, the nonlinear disturbance observer method (NDOM) is employed to effectively estimate unknown exogenous disturbances and enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the proposed finite-time command filter-based control method effectively ensures that all variables are bounded within a finite time.

Then, the optimal solution of FONSs optimal control under a performance constraint is obtained. It is proved that the optimal cost function and optimal control policy can be approximated gradually by the policy iteration. By using the backstepping control, RL, and identifier-actor-critic neural networks (NNs), the unknown dynamics functions are approximated and the approximate optimal controllers are obtained. A Lyapunov function based on optimality error is constructed, then the fractional-order update laws of NNs weights are designed to ensure that the weights converge to the optimum. Thus, the use of the gradient descent algorithm in the context of the fractional-order calculus to train the NNs is avoided.

Based on these captured correct execution paths, an execution path-oriented strategy is generated, which is nonintrusive, and can enforce it to follow one of its correct execution paths during each execution, thereby realizing its correct execution.

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems with deceptive constraints (DCMOPs) are a kind of complex optimization problems and have received some attention. For DCMOPs, the closer a solution is to the feasible region, the larger its constraint value. Moreover, multiple local infeasible regions will have different minimal constraint values according to their distances to feasible regions. Therefore, most of the existing algorithms are easy to fall into local regions, and even cannot find any feasible solution. To address DCMOPs, this article proposes a new evolutionary multitasking algorithm with a cooperative multistep mutation strategy. In this algorithm, the DCMOP is transformed into a multitasking optimization problem, in which the main task is the original DCMOP and the created auxiliary task aims to provide effective help for solving the main task. Specially, the designed cooperative multistep mutation strategy contains two contributions to solve deceptive constraints. First, a multistep mechanism is proposed, in which the individuals will use multiple different steps to generate the multiple offspring solutions along one direction, so as to expand search range to find feasible regions. Second, a cooperative mechanism between the two tasks is proposed, in which the main purpose is to provide effective and stable search directions. To be specific, an opposite solution generation method is utilized to generate the opposite solution of auxiliary population in the search space, and the direction from the auxiliary population to the main population will be formed. Combined with these two mechanisms, the proposed cooperative multistep mutation strategy can effectively improve the population diversity along the promising and stable search directions. In the experiments, the proposed algorithm is tested on the two benchmark DCMOPs, which contain objective space constraints and decision space constraints respectively. The results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over the latest compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Shortly, power distribution grids will incorporate large amounts of distributed energy resources and flexible loads, allowing the operation of a portion of the network in islanded mode to increase the reliability and resilience of the whole power system. A fully distributed robust model predictive control (MPC) strategy for voltage and frequency regulation in interconnected distribution grids is stated. Each grid node represents a collection of prosumers with a large active and reactive power regulation capacity. The advantages of this approach rely on the capability to afford any type of uncertainties, without making any assumption on the probability density function, on distributed generation and load nowcasting. We propose a two-stage architecture: at the first stage, an MPC approach, based on the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (dADMM), is performed, considering the data nowcasting; instead, the second stage (based on robust distributed team decision theory) takes as input the trajectory of the first stage to compensate the noise that affects the system. The developed architecture has been tested on a modified IEEE5 bus system, considering multiple loads and renewable generation.},

The robot steers by adjusting the position of an internal axially moving mass, rather than with the actuators commonly used in traditional underwater vehicles. Based on the dynamic model, an energy-efficient ETHCS framework, which includes three linear velocity observers and an event-triggered high-order backstepping heading controller, is established. The three linear state observers estimate the horizontal and angular velocities of the robot using depth and attitude angles measured by a depth sensor and an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). The controller is developed by using the dynamic surface control technique to avoid differentiating virtual control laws. A neural network is used to approximate recursive model uncertainties and disturbances. Relative threshold event-triggering conditions are designed to reduce the frequency of actuator action and the controller working time and to improve the energy-saving efficiency. The simulation and sea trial results show the effectiveness of the proposed control system.},

However, they may ignore correlation between pixels from an image to pursue better-denoising performance. Window Transformer can use long- and short-distance modeling to interact pixels to address mentioned problem. To make a tradeoff between distance modeling and denoising time, we propose a heterogeneous window Transformer (HWformer) for image denoising. HWformer first designs heterogeneous global windows to capture global context information for improving denoising effects. To build a bridge between long and short-distance modeling, global windows are horizontally and vertically shifted to facilitate diversified information without increasing denoising time. To prevent the information loss phenomenon of independent patches, sparse idea is guided a feed-forward network to extract local information of neighboring patches. The proposed HWformer only takes 30% of popular restoration Transformer in terms of denoising time. Its codes can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/HWformer .},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric turbulence can often introduce phase errors into a propagating light field, thus resulting in anisoplanatic and temporally varying blur and distortion of images. Restoring such images degraded by atmospheric turbulence is extremely ill-posed, due to multiple plausible solutions for a given input image. Most methods offer a deterministic estimation of clean images and require high-computational costs. To address these challenges, this article proposes a fast turbulence mitigation network (FTMNet). It is a lightweight model for atmospheric turbulence mitigation. Differing other methods, it does not employ a strategy for producing a single deterministic reconstruction. Instead, it leverages the Monte Carlo method to enhance restoration performance and produces a different and reasonable set of reconstructed images for a given input. As a result, FTMNet effectively mitigates atmospheric turbulence effect while maintaining low-inference time and computational resource requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that FTMNet shows high-inference speed, reaching 90 fps, and outperforms the state-of-the-art peers.},

  abstract     = {Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are promising for making behavioral decisions in autonomous vehicles (AVs), their low training efficiency and difficulty to adapt to untrained cases hinder their applications. Introducing a human role in the DRL paradigm could improve training efficiency by using human prior knowledge and overcome untrained cases in deployment by online human takeover. In this study, a novel value-based DRL algorithm that leverages human guidance to improve its performance is proposed for addressing high-level decision-making problems in autonomous driving. We develop a new learning objective for DRL to increase the value of the human policy over the undertrained DRL policy so that the DRL agent can be encouraged to mimic human behaviors and thereby utilizing human guidance more efficiently. Our method can autonomously evaluate the importance of different human guidance, which makes it more robust for variation of human performance. The proposed DRL algorithm was used to address a challenging multiobjective lane-change decision-making problem. We collected human guidance from a human-in-the-loop driving experiment and evaluated our method in a high-fidelity simulator. Results validated the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of training efficiency and optimality in the decision-making problem compared to the baselines of state-of-the-art existing methods. Results also revealed the favorable fine-tuning ability of the proposed algorithm, which is promising for addressing the long-tail issue in DRL-based autonomous driving. Our methodology does not introduce additional domain knowledge so that it can be seamlessly applied to other similar issues. The supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/Ec7WkqeLsB8 .},

In the field of autonomous driving systems, driving scenario data are important for the training and testing of critical modules. However, the corner scenario cases are usually rare and necessary to be extended. Existing methods cannot handle the interpretation and reasoning of the generation process well, which reduces the reliability and usability of the generated scenarios. With the rapid development of Foundation Models, especially the large language model (LLM), we can conduct scenario generation via more powerful tools. In this article, we propose LLMScenario, a novel LLM-driven scenario generation framework, which is composed of scenario prompt engineering, LLM scenario generation, and evaluation feedback tuning. The minimum scenario description specific to LLM is given by scenario analysis and ablation studies. We also appropriately design the score functions in terms of reality and rarity to evaluate the generated scenarios. The model performance is further enhanced through chain-of-thoughts and experiences. Different LLMs are also compared with our framework. Experimental results on naturalistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMScenario, which can provide solid support for scenario engineering in Industry 5.0.},

  abstract     = {The safety of different categories of road users comprising motorized vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists is one of the priorities of automated driving and smart infrastructure services. Three-dimensional (3-D) LiDAR-based object detection has been a promising approach to perceiving road users. Despite accurate 3-D geometry information, the point cloud from LiDAR is usually nonuniform, and learning the effective point cloud abstract representations for diverse road users remains challenging for 3-D object detection, particularly for small objects such as VRUs. For inclusive object detection (IDetect), we propose a general foundation convolution component, called geometry-aware convolution (GA Conv) toward a foundation feature extraction model, to serve as basic convolution operations of the neutral network for inclusive 3-D object detection. Further, the GA Conv operations are then utilized as the elementary feature extraction layers to build a novel elegant and pyramid network for IDetect. It learns the effective geometric-related features from the unstructured point cloud data by implicitly learning the distribution property and geometry-related features from different categories of road users in particular for VRUs. The proposed IDetect is comprehensively evaluated on the large-scale benchmark Waymo open datasets with all categories of road users. The qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate that IDetect can effectively consider the nonuniform distributed point clouds and learn the geometric features to assist the different categories of road user detection. In addition, the GA Conv has been integrated with other state-of-the-art neural networks and a performance boost for VRU detection has been demonstrated, showing the foundation functionality of the GA Conv and making it a general component in the future inclusive 3-D object detection foundation model.},

To address the issue of increased variance caused by the residual structure employed in previous works, this article introduces a distribution correction module, which effectively mitigates this problem. Furthermore, to achieve high-performance perception systems in intricate road scenarios, we put forth a multimodal perception fusion method in this study.

The issue of bias in Q-function value estimation in single-agent reinforcement learning has garnered a lot of interest and substantial study. Indeed, this challenge endures in multiagent reinforcement learning, primarily owing to the inclusion of maximization operations. The crux of the matter lies in the inability to seamlessly extrapolate single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to their multiagent counterparts. In this article, we introduce a more encompassing and straightforward principle: the notion of appropriate value correction. We suggest replacing the maximization operation with a monotonically nondecreasing function to obtain more accurate value estimates. We theoretically demonstrate that this operation effectively reduces the potential overestimation bias in the QMIX algorithm. Ultimately, our methodology, dubbed the SMIX algorithm—a fusion of the QMIX algorithm empowered by the Softmax operator, attains state-of-the-art outcomes across diverse multiagent cooperative tasks. This success extends to challenging domains such as StarCraft II, marking it as one of the most formidable games to date.},

  abstract     = {Accurate visual perception and comprehensive scene understanding are critical for the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Nevertheless, the efficacy of visual perception systems can be impaired by the intricacy of road scenes, and the existing scene understanding approach may be insufficient. Consequently, this study proposes an enhanced scene understanding model to achieve precise awareness of driving situations. Recognizing the limitations posed by the oversimplification of samples in current urban scene datasets, we selected critical frames from 336000 video frames, sourced from real-world driving environments, to assemble a more complex road scene (CRS) dataset. We integrated Residual Neural Network and pyramid scene parsing network architectures and refined them through class mapping and targeted network fine-tuning. Based on the segmentation outputs and the XGBoost algorithm, we identified the driving scenarios for the ego vehicle, enabling instantaneous driving situation analysis. The predictive model also evaluated the trajectory of interactive vehicles and estimated their kinematic states. Furthermore, we have conducted a thorough evaluation of scenario complexity, integrating the features described above. The findings indicate that our model achieves a segmentation accuracy of 78.8% in CRSs, with a twofold improvement in training efficiency. We also confirmed the effectiveness of the scene understanding approach through real-world road testing in China. This research provides insight into situation awareness within CRSs, thereby enhancing the visual perception capabilities of AVs. The implications of these results are substantial for their application in autonomous driving tests and advancing decision-making and control algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Since Manufacturing 4.0 faces various challenges, including the risks of data leakage and privacy violation, the struggle to meet the growing demand for personalization, and the limitations in harnessing human creativity, it has become crucial to embark on a transformation toward Manufacturing 5.0. To this end, we propose a DeFACT framework for parallel manufacturing and Manufacturing 5.0, which focuses on safe, efficient and personalized collaborative production. In DeFACT, different enterprises and parallel workers (i.e., digital, robotic and biological workers) are organized, coordinated and scheduled based on decentralized autonomous organizations and operations to promote mutual benefits among members, even in the context of low or zero trust. This contributes to providing customers with higher-quality personalized products and services while ensuring the confidentiality and safeguarding of data. Additionally, various advanced technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, scenarios engineering, and blockchain, are leveraged to achieve trustworthy and adaptable decision making, user-friendly human–machine interaction, and the federated control and management of parallel workers. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of DeFACT are experimentally validated through the design and implementation of three case studies.},

  abstract     = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) patrol inspection has become an efficient method to ensure the operation condition of transmission lines. The detection of key components with defects in transmission lines is a critical task in maintaining a power system’s stability. However, the complex inspection environment and the imbalance between the number of normal component samples and that of defect samples significantly affect the detection accuracy. In this article, we present a novel method for defect detection in UAV patrol images, based on a hierarchical convolutional vision transformer (HC-ViT) and a simple contrastive masked autoencoder (SC-MAE). The HC-ViT backbone integrates the advantages of vision transformer and convolution, while the SC-MAE is a self-supervised learning method that extracts useful features from normal samples. By introducing the normal features into the backbone, we enhance the performance of the defect detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, and show that it can leverage a large amount of unlabeled normal images, reducing the need for manual annotation. Our method offers a new way to exploit the potential features of patrol inspection images.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to extract semantic knowledge from limited object instances of novel categories within a target domain. Recent advances in FSOD focus on fine-tuning the base model based on a few objects via meta-learning or data augmentation. Despite their success, the majority of them are grounded with parametric readjustment to generalize on novel objects, which face considerable challenges in Industry 5.0, such as 1) a certain amount of fine-tuning time is required and 2) the parameters of the constructed model being unavailable due to the privilege protection, making the fine-tuning fail. Such constraints naturally limit its application in scenarios with real-time configuration requirements or within black-box settings. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we formalize a novel FSOD task, referred to as test-time few-shot detection (TIDE), where the model is un-tuned in the configuration procedure. To that end, we introduce an asymmetric architecture for learning a support-instance-guided dynamic category classifier. Further, a cross-attention module and a multiscale resizer are provided to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on multiple FSOD platforms reveal that the proposed TIDE significantly outperforms existing contemporary methods.

In this strategy, the robot can adapt and compensate its feedforward force and stiffness to interact with the unknown environment. In particular, a reference trajectory is generated through the admittance control to achieve a desired interaction level. To improve the interaction performance, a tracking error bound for both the transient and steady states is prespecified, and a controller is designed to ensure the tracking control performance. In the presence of unknown robot dynamics, neural networks are integrated into tracking controller to compensate uncertainties. The stability and convergence conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed by the Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated on the Baxter robot.},

With the development of sensor and computer technology, deep learning (DL)-based fault diagnosis methods have been substantially developed. However, the inability to reliably represent and quantify uncertainties associated with the diagnostic results greatly hinders their industrial applicability. In this article, an uncertainty-aware fault diagnosis framework based on the Bayesian DL is proposed considering uncertainty quantification and calibration. To achieve explainable representations of different types of uncertainties, aleatoric uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, and distributional uncertainty, which stem from the noise inherent in the observations, lack of knowledge, and domain shift, respectively, are jointly characterized for uncertainty quantification. Besides, to improve the quantification accuracy and obtain trustworthy diagnostic results to support subsequent maintenance, a novel calibration loss is proposed for the uncertainty calibration. The proposed method is applied to the two different bearing datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in providing both the accurate diagnostic results and calibrated uncertainty quantification.},

  abstract     = {Smart factories employ intelligent transportaton systems such as autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to support real-time adjusted production flows for agile and flexible production. While decentralized transportation task execution provides a scalable multirobot system (MRS) for a smart factory, new coordination challenges arise in implementing such a system. Transportation-MRS collaborates with production-MRS to accommodate just-in-time (JIT) production, leading to nonstationary transportation tasks that transportation-MRS must learn and adapt to. Also, decentralized operation on a shared shop floor means that one robot cannot factor in peer robots’ task execution planning, leading to competitive collisions. Meanwhile, predictive coordination with communication among multiple learning and adapting intelligent robots is still an open problem. On top of identifying the aforementioned challenges, this article first proposes a multifloor transportation graph model to discretize transportation task execution and allow real-time adjustment of transportation paths toward collision-free. We introduce a unique collaborative multi-intelligent robot system approach taking each robot as a cyber–physical agent with automated artificial intelligence (AI) workflow. First, it includes a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, where each robot predictively plans collision-avoidant paths. Second, we introduce a token-passing mechanism to resolve inevitable competitive collisions due to nonstationary tasks. The proposed approach innovatively uses the multifloor model as a domain model for planning. By allowing competitive collision to occur and resolve, a robot only needs to learn and adapt to uncertain parts of the environment—nonstationary tasks and peer robots’ paths. Computational experiments show that our approach is both sample-efficient and computationally efficient. The transportation-MRS quickly reaches near-optimal performance levels, which are empirically shown to scale with the number of robots involved.},

We also propose an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm characterized by a model-driven repair phase to solve this problem. The destruction phase adaptively selects a destruction operator to remove partial resource assignments and produces an incomplete reference solution. For the destroyed solution, the repair phase generates a reduced subproblem that optimizes only the destroyed parts while keeping the other parts fixed. Each subproblem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model and solved by a general-purpose solver to repair the destroyed solution. Computational experiments show that the approximation formulations can obtain tight lower and upper bounds for most problem instances. Moreover, our proposed ALNS algorithm is competitive with the solver for small instances and effectively solves large instances. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that our ALNS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature, and the proposed model-driven solution repair phase outperforms the traditional heuristic repair operators.},

Two reinforcement learning (RL) methods—policy iteration (PI) and Q-learning—are proposed to solve this problem. The latter can obtain the H $_{\infty }$ controller without system dynamics. In the field of RL control, most studies focus on infinite-horizon control and time-invariant systems, and few studies have investigated finite-horizon control or time-varying systems. In contrast to infinite-horizon H $_{\infty }$ tracking control, finite-horizon H $_{\infty }$ tracking control involves a time-varying value function. While this introduces challenges, it empowers the algorithm to effectively handle time-varying problems. Within the finite-horizon framework, the value function is bounded, allowing the removal of the discount factor, thereby enhancing control performance. Additionally, there is no longer a need for an admissible control law for initialization, providing the proposed algorithms with the combined advantages of both PI and value iteration (VI). Two simulation examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article mainly investigates the model design, field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, and prescribed-time fault-tolerant control of a fractional-order (FO) decoupled dual-mass micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) gyro with deferred constraints. First, the structure of such MEMS gyro is designed to eliminate the linear acceleration in the sensing direction and its mathematical model is built based on the Lagrange’s equation. The dynamical analysis shows that such gyro can generate unpredictable, random, and disorder motions under various FOs, stiffness cross the coupling coefficients and proof masses. The designed FPGA circuit further demonstrates the undesirable chaotic oscillations of such MEMS gyro and good hardware resources utilization, avoiding the time consuming and board redesign. Second, to better solve the problems of constraints, actuator faults, uncertainties, drive couplings, and chaotic oscillations, a dependent deferred-error function superimposed to a prescribed-time function is used to guarantee no violation of constraints after a finite time. Furthermore, a $\beta $ -cut type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) is employed to solve the uncertainty, and an FO hyperbolic tangent tracking differentiator (HTTD) is utilized to deal with the direct FO derivative and repeated derivative in the framework of the backstepping control. Then, a prescribed-time fault-tolerant control scheme of the FO decoupled dual-mass MEMS gyro is proposed under the actuator fault. Finally, the abundant simulation experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Leaderless rational individuals often lead the group into a resource decision dilemma in resource competition. Reducing the cost of resource competition while avoiding group decision dilemmas is a challenging task. Inspired by multiagent systems (MASs) and repeated games, we propose a decision-making reward discrimination (DRD) framework to address the resource competition dilemma of leaderless group formation. We aim to model the leaderless group’s resource gaming process using MAS and achieve optimal rewards for the group while minimizing conflict in resource competition. The proposed framework consists of three modules: 1) the decision-making module; 2) the reward module; and 3) the discriminative module. The decision-making module defines the agents and models the decision-making process, while the reward module calculates the group reward in each round using the reward matrix. The discriminative module compares the group reward with the target reward while providing the agent with environmental information. We verify the feasibility of the model through numerous experiments. The results show that agents adopt a revenge strategy to avoid resource competition dilemmas and achieve group reward optimality.},

The emphasis is on fuzzy-based uncertainty and inequality constraint. The uncertainty is time varying and bounded within a prescribed fuzzy set. For the inequality constraint, we creatively have it merge into constraint-following performance by a diffeomorphism technique. An adaptive robust control strategy is then proposed. Deterministic performance is guaranteed provided the control design parameters are within feasible regions. To further enhance the performance, we introduce a two-player Stackelberg game setting.

In brief, we design a novel global indicator that inherits the theoretical guarantees of a class of iterative reinforcement learning algorithms. By generating a tentative function, the global indicator can guide and communicate with parallel controllers to accelerate the learning process. Using two typical exploration policies, the novel parallel scheme can rapidly compress the neighborhood of the optimal cost function. Besides, two parallel algorithms based on value iteration and Q-learning are established to improve the data efficiency through different extensions.

This formulation allows for flexible energy arbitrage and additional monetary rewards while ensuring that the prosumers’ desired daily energy demand is met. Then, a scalable (linear with the number of prosumers and the number of learning samples), the decentralized privacy-preserving algorithm is proposed to find approximate equilibria with online sampling and learning of the prosumers’ cumulative best response, which finds applications beyond this energy game.

Therefore, it is interesting to theoretically analyse the impact of vaccination on the disease spreading. In this article, we propose a discrete-time epidemic-willingness dynamics model to analyse the influence of vaccine willingness on epidemic spreading. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the proportion of the infected population exponentially converges to zero. The explicit relationship between the trend of epidemic spreading and the willingness-based reproduction number is presented. Based on the real data from a survey conducted on a sample of Italian population, we employ the proposed epidemic-willingness dynamics model to reproduce the social phenomenon that increasing the willingness to vaccinate can reduce and delay the maximum proportion of infected communities. Additionally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed epidemic-willingness dynamics model by utilizing the real data of COVID-19 infections from 28 February to 31 May 2022 in Shanghai. It is shown that the higher the level of infection, the greater the willingness to vaccinate. Moreover, we find that the willingness-based reproduction number is not monotonically decreasing and differs from the classical reproduction number.},

  abstract     = {Sparse large-scale evolutionary multiobjective optimization has garnered substantial interest over the past years due to its significant practical implications. These optimization problems are characterized by a predominance of zero-valued decision variables in the Pareto optimal solutions. Most existing algorithms focus on exploiting the sparsity of solutions by starting with initializing all decision variables with a nonzero value. Opposite to the existing approaches, we propose to initialize all decision variables to zero, then progressively identify and optimize the nonzero ones. The proposed framework consists of two stages. In the first stage of evolutionary optimization, a clustering method is applied at a predefined period of generations to identify nonzero decision variables according to the statistics of each variable’s current and historical values. Once a new nonzero decision variable is identified, it is randomly initialized within one of the two intervals, one defined by its lower quartile and lower bound, and the other by its upper quartile and upper bound. In the second stage, the clustering method is also periodically employed to distinguish between zero and nonzero decision variables. Different to the first stage, the zero decision variables will be set to zero straight, and the nonzero decision variables will be mutated at a higher probability. The performance of the proposed framework is empirically examined against state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on both sparse and nonsparse benchmarks and real-world problems, demonstrating its superior performance on different classes of problems.},

Tailored to effectively address this problem, this study proposes an enhanced graph model that incorporates internal consensus and external stability. The best-worst method, incorporating comparative linguistic expressions, is devised to effectively elicit individual preferences over game states. To mitigate preference conflicts inherent to internal individuals within conflicting party concerning game states, a consensus reaching model minimizing preference information loss is introduced. By this way, collective preferences are obtained. Based on these, the concept of “game consensus” is proposed to manage the game conflicts and the diverse behaviors exhibited by conflicting party. Finally, a case study regarding price conflict within a dual-channel supply chain, accompanied by a comparative analysis, is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposal. Compared to existing graph model, the proposal effectively grapples with consensus issues and heterogeneous behaviors within conflicting parties, making it more valuable in practice.},

Different from the traditional control scheme, the supervisor derived by this work can not only observe the observable transitions, but also the quiescence information. First, a new structure named an extended basis reachability graph (EBRG) is introduced to describe the reachability space of an LPN without computing all reachable markings. Based on an EBRG, a basis observer is then excogitated to represent the behavior of an LPN. Some states in the basis observer are defined as bad states and control-induced deadlocks, which relates to the undesirable behavior of the plant. Finally, an algorithm is introduced to compute a supervisor based on the basis observer. The consideration of system quiescence provides extra information on the marking estimation of the closed-loop system such that certain disabled transitions are re-enabled. Consequently, the developed supervisor in this article is generally more permissive than those do not observe the quiescence.},

On the other hand, we consider the desired velocity information of the visual feature to improve the tracking accuracy and design an auxiliary parameter to estimate the inversion operation and address the singularity problem. On this basis, a neural dynamic controller (NDC) is developed, which possesses learning, estimation, and control capabilities.

  abstract     = {Conventional soft clustering algorithms perform well on linearly distributed features, but their performance degrades on nonlinearly distributed features in high-dimensional space. In this study, a novel soft clustering algorithm, the ambiguous kernel distance clustering (AKDC) algorithm, is presented. This algorithm is developed by applying ambiguous set theory and the Gaussian kernel function. The ambiguous set theory defines the ambiguities inherent in each feature with four membership values: 1) true; 2) false; 3) true-ambiguous; and 4) false-ambiguous. The degree of membership values here forms a low-dimensional feature space that is not linearly distributed. Therefore, these nonlinearly distributed membership values are mapped into a high-dimensional feature space using the Gaussian kernel function. This study focuses on performing cluster analysis of computerized tomography scans of COVID-19 (CTSC-19) cases using AKDC. COVID-19, recognized as one of the most life-threatening diseases of this century, is highly contagious, and early diagnosis may prevent one-to-one transmission. Extensive empirical studies have been conducted with different types of CTSC-19 to demonstrate its effectiveness against existing kernel-based clustering and nonkernel-based clustering algorithms, namely mercer kernel fuzzy c-mean (MKFCM), kernel generalized FCM (KGFCM), kernel intuitionistic fuzzy entropy c-means (KIFECMs), morphological reconstruction and membership filtering clustering (FRFCM), and intuitionistic FCM based on membership information transferring and similarity measurements (IFCM-MS). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the existing algorithms is evaluated using standard statistical metrics, such as dice index (DI), Jaccard index (JI), structural similarity index (SI), and correlation coefficient (CC). The empirical results show that AKDC is more effective than existing algorithms based on DI, JI, SI, and CC.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel system based on the simultaneous iterative reconstructive technique (SIRT) and multiagent deep reinforcement learning is proposed for detection of anomalous geological structures in coal mines. The system employs the SIRT optimization inversion method to construct a computational model for channel wave signal imaging. Then, the back projection technique (BPT) was introduced to the system. By utilizing the BPT algorithm to provide initial values for the SIRT, the channel wave signals can be prescreened, improving the ability of the SIRT algorithm to suppress model noise and enhancing its resolution. Furthermore, we employ multiagent reinforcement learning method for image feature classification of anomalous geological structures. Moreover, we conduct two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging of four types of changes and energy fluctuations. The results demonstrate a high degree of concordance between the computed channel wave results and the slowness of the measured channel wave signals. Experimental findings validate the exceptional computational accuracy of this novel system, with relative errors and coefficient of deviation both within 1%, surpassing traditional SIRT inversion methods, damped least-squares methods, conjugate gradient methods, and classical algebraic reconstruction methods. These discoveries demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of utilizing transmission tomography imaging technology for the detection of anomalous structures in coal seams, offering new perspectives for underground exploration in coal mines.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new adaptive neural control scheme with guaranteed performance for mechanical systems under dynamic uncertainties and uncertain initial conditions. Employing the novel time-varying neuron (TVN) approach and a shifting function, the control method developed in this article can systematically solve two crucial problems: one is how to construct a variable structure network to improve the approximation ability while the online tuning parameters do not increase with the number of neurons, and the other is how to achieve the predetermined tracking performance for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) mechanical systems under any bounded initial tracking errors. To approximate uncertain dynamics, the TVN approach is first presented to instruct the process of adding new neurons for better-learning capability, where the online updating parameters in the neural network (NN) unit are compressed by the vector projection technique, yielding an NN approximator with low-computational burden. By virtue of a shifting function, the uncertain initial tracking error is converted to zero such that a speed function with predetermined convergence performance can be efficiently employed to constrain the tracking trajectory without considering the initial condition. Moreover, to obviate the differentiation operation for the virtual stabilizing function, the dynamic surface technique is adopted to derive the presented control scheme for facilitating practical implementation. Finally, the effectiveness and benefits of the presented control are verified via theoretical analysis and a two-link manipulator.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a fully distributed inertial neurodynamic approach for sparse recovery. The approach is based on proximal operators and inertia items. It aims to solve the $L_{1}$ -norm minimization problem with consensus and linear observation constraints over directed communication networks. The proposed neurodynamic approach has the advantages of only requiring the communication network to be directed and weight-balanced, does not involve a central processing node and global parameters, which means that no single node can access the entire network and observe it at any time, so it is fully distributed. To effectively deal with the nonsmooth objective function, $L_{1}$ -norm, the proximal operator method is used here. For efficiently handling linear observation and consensus constraints, a primal-dual method is applied to the inertial dynamic system. With the aid of maximal monotone operator theory and Baillon-Haddad lemmas, it reveals that the trajectories of our approach can converge to consensus solution at the optimal solution, provided that the distributed parameters satisfy technical conditions. In addition, we aim to demonstrate the weak convergence of the trajectories in our proposed neurodynamic approach toward the zeros of the optimal operator in Hilbert space, using Opial’s lemma. Finally, comparative experiments on sparse signal and image recovery confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed neurodynamic approach.},

The designed $L_{-}$ functional observer is not only sensitive to fault but also robust against any form of unknown input.

  abstract     = {In social network group decision making (SN-GDM), overlapping communities are special community structures that can assist opinion interaction to reach group consensus. However, the specific mechanisms of how overlapping structures facilitate community interaction need to be further explored. In addition, the compromise behavior of decision makers (DMs) is conducive to group consensus, but it is usually fixed at the same value, and then it need further research the characteristic of the dynamics compromise limits. To this end, the overlapping community structures under DMs’ trust network is detected. Then, the effect of community overlap in social networks on community interaction is explored. Meanwhile, a limited compromise function is built based on prospect theory to describe the dynamic compromise behavior of communities. Hence, a dynamic compromise behavior driven bidirectional feedback mechanism with overlapping communities is proposed in the context of SN-GDM, and an illustrative example with comparative analysis is provided to testify the advantages of proposed method. It is proved that overlapping communities can improve the compromise willingness compared to nonoverlapping communities, indicating that overlapping communities can serve as a bridge to facilitate interaction, and the dynamic compromise behavior can more realistically describe the real behavior of DMs. In general terms, the proposed method provides a solution to the consensus reaching issue of SN-GDM from a new perspective. Specifically, it can be applied to real-life application scenarios, such as group recommendation to recommend acceptable solutions for social network group users.},

Truncated singular value decomposition is adopted to purify the data contaminated by external disturbances and measurement noises. Two RNNs are employed to cooperatively search for a global optimal solution, and the particle swarm optimization rule is used to reinitialize the RNNs upon the local convergence of the RNNs.

Subsequently, a set of intermediate variables is established within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimized backstepping to solve the problem of unknown control gains, which facilitates the implementation of optimal controllers. Furthermore, the designed actual optimal control law is transmitted through RETC, which provides two advanced advantages: 1) a resilient switching control protocol to avoid the impact of DoS attacks and 2) a flexible switching threshold event-triggered mechanism to conserve communication resources and balance system performance.

  abstract     = {Multiview spectral clustering, which stands out with its remarkable clustering performance, has drawn increasing research attention. Its core is properly weighing the contribution of different views and comprehensively utilizing multiview information in the clustering process. Although existing methods, like exponential decay and root loss, have achieved significant progress, they still have limitations in their weighting scheme, application generalization, and model efficiency. To handle these limitations, we propose a novel Similarity-Induced Weighted Consensus Laplacian matrix learning method for multiview clustering (MC), named SIWCL. This method has two distinctive features: 1) instead of conventional Laplacian matrix learning, SIWCL resorts to consensus Laplacian matrix learning as the MC framework for effectively exploiting complementary information from multiple views and 2) we argue that there could be outlier views that exhibit an uneven similarity distribution with other views, and equally treating them with other views can hurt model performance. Therefore, beyond consensus Laplacian matrix learning, SIWCL introduces a novel weighting strategy that adaptively assigns weights to views according to their consistency with other views based on the multiview similarity matrices. Notably, this novel method has only one hyperparameter and closed-form solutions, greatly improving the efficiency and generalization. Experiments show that the weights obtained by the proposed weighting strategy are correlated to the quality of the clustering structure. The comparisons between the proposed method and other state-of-the-art baseline methods over eight datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior clustering performance of SIWCL.},

In practical engineering, due to the complex multitooth meshing motions and variable working conditions resulting in gearboxes with multiple excitation sources, and the response signals exhibit amplitude modulation and frequency modulation characteristics, which makes it difficult for CNN to obtain the fault features from complex modulated signals. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a new deep multiscale weighted modulation network (DMWMN) for gearbox fault detection under variable working conditions. First, a new frequency-domain modulation spectrum is proposed as signal processing layer in DMWMN to demodulate the modulation features from complex vibration signals. Thereafter, multibranched structure with different DMWMN slice scales is utilized to obtain fault features. The frequency domain signal-to-noise ratio-based weighted fusion method is employed to optimize the weighted coefficients in DMWMN to enhance the fault feature components. Finally, a CNN is further employed to learn features from the demodulated signals in the DMWMN layer to identify for fault classification. Experimental results prove that the DMWMN has advantages over state-of-the-art algorithms for gearbox fault feature identification under variable working conditions.},

To overcome this restriction and circumvent the need to linearize the system, we propose a derivative-free UI sigma-point Kalman filter (SPKF-nUI), where the SPKF is interconnected with a general nonlinear UI estimator that can be implemented via nonlinear optimization and data-driven approaches. The nonlinear UI estimator uses the posterior state estimate, which is less susceptible to state prediction error. In addition, we introduce a joint sigma-point transformation scheme to incorporate both the state and UI uncertainties in the estimation of SPKF-nUI. An in-depth stochastic stability analysis proves that the proposed SPKF-nUI yields exponentially converging estimation error bounds under reasonable assumptions. Finally, two case studies are carried out on a simulation-based rigid robot and a physical soft robot, i.e., the robots made of soft materials with complex dynamics, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed filter on nonlinear dynamic systems. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPKF-nUI achieves the lowest state and UI estimation errors when compared to the existing nonlinear state-UI filters.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the FlexRay (FR) protocol-based dynamic event-triggered (DET) secure filtering problem with the high-rate communication (HRC) network for the interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy networked system. For fear of data collisions and preempting limited communication resources, a novel DET-FR (DETFR) protocol is adopted to schedule sensor nodes. Different sensors are employed for distinct protocols and data-holding strategies to reinforce the efficiency of network transmission. Moreover, considering the random occurrence of cyber attacks and fading measurements in the HRC channel, the attack parameters are represented by the Bernoulli process, and measurement attenuation coefficients are expressed by the random variables of equidistribution on a fixed interval. Based on this, to ensure that the error dynamics meet the disturbance attenuation level, several sufficient conditions are given. Subsequently, the DETFR protocol-based secure filtering algorithm is developed to acquire the fuzzy filter parameters. Eventually, the validity of our designed secure filtering algorithm is proved through two examples.},

In the traditional adaptive dynamic programming algorithms, policy improvement is typically reliant on the gradient information, according to the first order necessity condition. However, these methods encounter limitations when calculating the gradient information becomes infeasible or system dynamics is not differentiable. In response to this challenge, the evolutionary computation is harnessed by EGADP to search for a superior policy during policy improvement. Therefore, compared with the traditional methods, scenarios that gradient information is unavailable can effectively be handled by EGADP. Additionally, the convergence of the algorithm is proven to enhance the rigorousness of the developed method. Finally, the three simulation experiments with realistic physical backgrounds are conducted to comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the established method from different perspectives.},

  abstract     = {This work aims at improving the control performance of the iterative learning control through set-point learning along iteration direction. A double-layered learning control mechanism is designed for both the control input and the set-point, respectively. The learning control of the input is regarded as a local controller in the inner layer, and the learning control of the set-point is designed as an auxiliary controller in the outer layer whose design is a main challenge since no any priori knowledge is available to describe the relationship between the set-point and the control performance. To solve this issue, an ideal nonlinear nonaffine set-point learning optimization (SPLO) algorithm is designed by taking the set-point and the tracking error as the arguments. Then, an iterative dynamic linearization (iDL) is introduced to formulate the ideal SPLO algorithm as a linear parametric one whose unknown parameter is estimated by designing a parameter updating algorithm. Further, since a strongly nonlinear and nonaffine system is considered without any model information available, the iDL is also used to derive its equivalent linear data model which is then updated by the input and output data to make the linear parametric SPLO realizable. Finally, a double-layered iterative learning control (DLILC) is proposed under the data-driven framework for tracking an iteration-varying trajectory. Convergence analysis and extensive simulations are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented DLILC.},

  abstract     = {Given the scarcity of sufficient annotated data, using small sets of labeled samples under semi-supervision in biomedical imaging becomes necessary. Despite being highly successful, deep learning algorithms demand plenty of data to obtain significant performance. Complex data models make the usage of these methods costly. Selecting the correct model and tuning the hyperparameters of a model are also difficult jobs. Hence, a novel approach namely affinity propagation-based semi-supervised segmentation (APSS) is proposed. Here, affinity propagation clustering is modified and integrated with the advanced learning techniques that can efficiently use limited training data by discarding the completely exploited labeled data points. Moreover, a novel affinity calculation method is proposed considering both the Euclidean and geodesic distances to compute the distance between the two points on the histogram. This twofold contribution is tested using the three standard datasets (the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dermoscopic image dataset, the retinal fundus image dataset, and the liver tumor segmentation (LiTS) dataset). Results are compared with the three standard semi-supervised algorithms and four supervised algorithms. The effectiveness of the APSS approach in finding and exploiting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled datasets is demonstrated in terms of qualitative (subjective evaluation and visual inspection) and quantitative performance (objective evaluation and numerical measurements).},

By revealing the 3-D relation between the lead angle and reference LOS polynomials, the single parameter’s safe range is determined to create feasible LOS profiles that ensure the onboard sensor’s Field of View (FOV) is within its limit. The open-loop acceleration command is derived with time-only information, and the closed-loop command is constructed using the desired LOS angular acceleration profiles. Theoretical analysis proves that the actual LOS profiles perform the same as their desired ones. Moreover, the initial acceleration saturation is avoided, and the final acceleration and LOS rate are zero. The method does not involve the relative range detection, model linearization, switching logic, multiple design parameters, large scale optimization, and the all-covering numerical routine.

The nonlinear lateral dynamics of a six-wheel skid-steer vehicle is modeled using the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system with irregular fuzzy rules, in which more membership function information can be captured. Considering the high-frequency transmission mode used in vehicle motion systems due to high-precision control requirements, an event-triggered scheme with a dynamic threshold is proposed to ensure control accuracy while reducing the data transmission. Then, a flexible yaw control scheme is constructed in which two adjustable weighting factors are introduced to improve the flexibility of the fuzzy yaw controller. By combining the flexible yaw control scheme and dynamic event-triggered scheme, we design a set of event-triggered fuzzy yaw controllers that satisfy the finite-time stability of lateral motion tracking for six-wheel skid-steer vehicles. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by conducting the TruckSim-MATLAB joint simulation.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates optimization-based schemes aimed at achieving effective collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles. The study introduces three explicit formulations of collision constraints that can be applied universally to both general vehicles and obstacles regardless of whether they are represented by convex or nonconvex polygons. These formulations are devised by reformulating implicit vertex-edge constraints, exclusively designed to prevent collisions between any vertex and any edge, as explicit constraints through analytically characterizing modified signed distance functions (MSDFs), equilibrium functions, and binary variables, respectively. The proposed schemes can formulate the optimization-based planning problem involving collision avoidance as a nonlinear program (NLP), a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, and a mixed-integer NLP, which are readily addressed using off-the-shelf solvers. Furthermore, the research examines the sensitivity of the MSDFs, indicating that the formulation can exhibit numerical sensitivity to the sign. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed schemes is demonstrated in the context of an autonomous bus parallel parking in a confined bus stop with multiple corridors. The results illustrate that all the three schemes perform equally well in terms of identifying feasible solutions, while the scheme using MSDFs avoids adding dual variables to be optimized, exhibiting the added benefit of requiring lower computational resources compared to the state of the art.},

However, in practice, it is hard to obtain the camera motion parameters exactly. For instance, the exact camera velocity is always unavailable and instead only the roughly estimated one can be obtained. This introduces the significant difficulties to achieve the depth estimation with partially uncertain camera motion parameters. In this article, we consider the depth estimation problem for the perspective vision system in the case that the camera angular velocities are accurate, while partial camera linear velocities are contaminated by some disturbances. This problem is theoretically formulated and solved for the first time in this article by proposing a new depth observer in the presence of the partially uncertain camera linear velocities. Local exponential convergence of the depth and disturbance estimates is achieved in presence of the partially uncertain camera linear velocities such that the estimation errors of states and disturbances converge to zero for constant disturbances or to a small error bound for bound time-varying disturbances. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed observer.},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor manufacturing, cluster tools tend to integrate a vacuum module (VM), a loadlock module (LLM), and an equipment front-end module (EFEM). While scheduling techniques exist for cluster tools without EFEM, the collaboration among these modules introduces additional challenges for tools with EFEM. In such tools, LLM acting as a shared module plays a crucial role in operating a cluster tool. Moreover, modern fabs have adopted the practice of chamber cleaning after processing each wafer to eliminate chemical residue that may remain within chambers. This article addresses a cyclic scheduling problem of a single-arm cluster tool with EFEM, while considering chamber cleaning requirements. We propose a conflict-free loadlock (LL) state transformation sequence of One-in and One-out LLs to describe the transformations resulted from LL operations. We then present cooperative strategies for robots to access LLM during the state transformation. Based on these strategies, we derive closed-form algorithms to find feasible and optimal schedules in terms of tool cycle time, allowing for an analysis of the best-performing strategy combinations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the implementation of an observer-based logarithmic control scheme for physical human-robot interaction, which is a typical Lagrangian system. The novelty lies in using a switching term in the logarithmic sliding mode observer to describe the operator’s behavior without any sensors, and applying adaptive parameters in the logarithmic sliding mode controller (SMC) to practically stabilize reaching the sliding surface using chattering-free nonsingular reaching law in finite time. A reset mechanism is synthesized into the control system to enhance the transient response. The motion on the sliding surface is analyzed from the perspective of practical finite-time stability, from which both the convergence regions of the tracking and estimate errors can be determined. The numerical and experimental results verify the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed reset logarithmic SMC and observer for human-robot interaction compared to the existing linear SMC and terminal SMC. With regards to settling time and rising time, the superiority of transient performance in experimental results is coincident with the stability analysis.},

For the strictly stealthy attacks, it is proved that flipping the sign of the nominal innovation is always optimal under any given schedule in both holistic and one-step optimization designs, which significantly simplifies the collaborative design of attack schedules and matrices. For the $\delta $ -stealthy attacks, the analytical expression of the optimal attack matrices is derived by adopting the data isolation technique without the assumption required in the existing results that the output matrix is of full row rank. Since the constraint conditions for the dwell times which are employed in the related works are nonlinear such that the transformed 0–1 programming problem is difficult to solve, an equivalent condition is proposed in a linear form by taking advantage of the sliding window technique, based on which the optimal attack schedule is obtained.

Hence, the dynamic surface control scheme is introduced to resolve this problem. Unlike existing work requiring system functions to satisfy Lipschitz continuity condition, adaptive NN control is incorporated into the designed algorithm to relax the above constraint. What is more, the event-triggered mechanism is also used for parameter estimation to avoid waste of computing and communication resources.

In this article, considering nonlinear time-varying human disturbances, we propose a TDE-BVC feedback control method that performs biomimetic viscoelastic compliance (BVC) with transformer-based deformation estimator (TDE). The method provides human-exoskeleton with stable and dynamic walking capabilities. We developed a transformer-based end-to-end deformation estimation sequence network that simultaneously captures the mapping relationship between foot force/torque and exoskeleton deformation. Moreover, we integrated the BVC to eliminate the impact and external disturbances experienced by the human-exoskeleton, enabling it to closely follow a reference gait, and utilized Lyapunov’s theorem to prove its stability. The control strategy is independent of the parameters of the human exoskeleton. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, walking experiments were conducted on different subjects. Our results indicate that with only 6-axis force/torque sensors, the TDE-BVC controller could accurately estimate and compensate for the deformation of different human-exoskeletons in each control cycle $(p\lt 0.001)$ , with robustly stable and adaptive dynamic walking within a bounded control error.},

With that in mind, this article focuses on the study of flocking behavior for Cucker-Smale multiagent model over coopetition networks with communication delays. In this model, the cooperation/competition degree between agents is portrayed as a weight function with respect to communication distance, e.g., the closer (farther) the communication distance, the stronger (weaker) the cooperation/competition degree. With the help of analysis tools consisting of edge composites and substochastic matrices, the algebraic relationships between cooperation and competition degrees are established to ensure the emergence of flocking behavior. Moreover, mathematical expressions are given to show the effect of different communication delays on the agents’ final aggregation upper bound and convergence rate. In the end, the theoretical results are validated through computer simulations.},

Third, new low-conservative sufficient conditions for asymptotic convergence and stability are obtained, using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and the FO Razumikhin theorem. Further, order- and delay-dependent consensus protocol for the leader-follower OSL FOMASs is achieved, with design parameters being easily computed by solving LMI constraints. Finally, three simulation examples are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the new control scheme. The new LMI-based condition is less conservative, is applicable to both Lipschitz nonlinear FOMASs and linear FOMASs, and the control protocol is more universal compared to those proposed in the existing literature.},

In fact, the main opinion of the positive observer is to guarantee that all the estimates and also, the estimation error never become negative at any time. Unlike previous positive observers, this article focuses on them for the LPV positive system through four theorems. Based on the polytopic frame, the proposed PDPO estimates the state variables of positive LPV systems exactly and in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Consequently, it guarantees the closed-loop system’s stability and positivity. To verify the feasibility and applicability of the proposed theorems, simulation-based results of each theorem are provided for numerical plants, and also for real medical plant (the Thyroid hormone metabolism’ system).

  abstract     = {Nowadays, biochemical and biomedical laboratories, and pharmaceutical industries widely adopt high throughput screening (HTS) systems for the development of new drugs and detection of new viruses. Different from a flow shop in manufacturing systems, in operating an HTS system, microplates are often required to be processed multiple times by some devices, resulting in complex microplate flows. Such flows make the system deadlock-prone and very difficult to deal with. Also, consistency is essential for its operation, requiring a one-microplate cyclic schedule for its operation. Generally, the scheduling problem of such systems is NP-hard due to their combinatorial nature. Thus, scheduling an HTS system is challenging. Antibody detection is an important complement to the nucleic acid test for response to the coronavirus disease pandemic and is adopted in many laboratories, which can be implemented by the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) via an HTS system. This article focuses on the problem of scheduling an HTS for ELISA and explores the possibility of a polynomial algorithm for finding an optimal one-microplate cyclic schedule. To do so, we model the system via a type of Petri nets and develop an optimal deadlock avoidance policy. As a result, the optimal activity sequence can be simply obtained. With the obtained sequence, the scheduling problem is converted to a continuous optimization problem that can be solved by determining the robot waiting time at the devices. Then, a one-microplate cyclic schedule can be efficiently found by solving a small-sized linear programming (LP) problem. Moreover, it is shown that, for many cases, one can quickly get an optimal solution by simply setting the robot waiting time without solving an LP problem. Consequently, we successfully present a polynomial algorithm to get an optimal cyclic schedule and show that the addressed problem is polynomial-time solvable. A practical example is used to show its applications.},

First, for the ease of collaborative tasks, an unified model is obtained in the XY plane by transforming the dynamical models of UAVs and UGVs. Then, a fuzzy switching observer is designed to achieve unavailable state estimation during the attack zone. In particular, in virtue of the character of DoS attacks, a novel fixed-time stability theory is set up. On this foundation, a distributed fixed-time secure tracking control strategy is raised by utilizing the adaptive approach to effectively defend against DoS attacks. Notably, distinct from the existing works on finite-time stability for HMASs, the present method exhibits some brilliant features, such as fast response, high accuracy, and attack resistance. Additionally, rational proofs have substantiated that the designed control scheme can not only ensure the boundedness of each closed-loop signal but also guarantee the synchronization error converges to a predefined small neighborhood near the origin in a fixed time. Ultimately, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by a representative simulation.},

  abstract     = {Classical diffusion adaptive filtering algorithms are often designed to deal with unconstrained system identification. However, they are not suited to constrained system identification. This work develops a diffusion constrained adaptive filtering algorithm to address the above problem. We use the cost function based on the half-quadratic criterion (HQC) to enhance the robustness of the nodes against impulsive noise. We also utilize the strategy of data sharing between the neighboring nodes to promote the network convergence performance. To investigate the stochastic behavior, we further analyse the stability condition and the transient and steady-state performance of the proposed diffusion constrained HQC (DCHQC) algorithm under several commonly used statistical assumptions. Simulation results are given to show the advantages of DCHQC in the context of distributed constrained system identification and beamforming and to validate the theoretical expressions on the performance prediction.},

The proposed model is more generalized. Different from the use of the finite/fixed-time stability lemmas in the previous works, by constructing the unit ball and discussing the subordinate relationship between the states and the unit ball, the finite/fixed-time stability are analyzed in detail. This method can avoid the rough thinking that the state variables of the system start from greater than 1. Also, the control constraint is taken into account and a quantized controller is designed, which can not only help achieve the finite/fixed-time stability, but also can prevent the singularity when using the norm forms and chattering when using the sign function in the controllers. In addition, the energy consumptions generated by the quantized controller are estimated in FnT and fixed-time stability processes. The criteria show that the energy consumptions are relevant to the proportional delays, when the proportional coefficient is 1, the energy loss reaches the minimum value. Finally, numerical example and simulation are provided to verify the validity of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of modern transportation, automated electric vehicles (AEVs) assume a seminal role in realizing the vision of intelligent and electrified mobility. The advancement of AEVs hinges on the utilization of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices as indispensable components to propel their evolution. These devices not only amplify the operational capabilities of AEVs but also underpin their security in the face of escalating cyber threats. In this regard, this study proposes a novel IoT architectural paradigm, encompassing integration of model predictive control (MPC) and deep neural network (DNN) frameworks. The proposed architecture aims to enhance AEV performance, empowering them to counteract the disruptive impact of erroneous data intrusions that result from cyber breaches. To ensure the timely identification of potential threats without compromising privacy considerations, this study augments the framework to encompass trajectory prediction. This extension is achieved through dynamic programming (DP) to craft effective control strategies governing AEV motions, conjoined with DNNs adept in discerning deviations from projected behavioral norms within AEVs’ control signals. This cohesive symbiosis propels the expeditious detection of anomalies indicative of potential security breaches. As data privacy remains a paramount consideration, this work employs Homomorphic Encryption, enabling anomaly score computation on encrypted data, thereby upholding privacy standards. Various test scenarios are conducted to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed IoT architecture with MPC, DP, and DNN to improve the performance of the AEV. The results attest that the proposed approach can tackle cyberattacks and data loss effectively which enhances the production process and decision making.},

  abstract     = {Various federated transfer learning (FTL) methods have been proposed to address domain shift and safeguard data privacy in the field of fault diagnosis. However, the effectiveness of these methods entirely relies on the presumption that the source clients must be homogenous with the target client. Meanwhile, these methods also require that the testing target-domain data are available during the communication process. Considering that target-domain data are typically unseen and heterogenous with source clients, the traditional FTL-based diagnosis methods cannot meet the demand of high data utilization rate and real-time diagnosis in real engineering. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, a novel heterogeneous federated domain generalization network (HFDGN) is proposed to fill the gap in the heterogeneous multisource federated diagnosis. In the HFDGN, the heterogeneous FTL framework is first proposed to achieve the generalized fault diagnosis of a target client by obtaining the common representation mappings from heterogeneous source clients. Additionally, the disentangled domain adaptation (DDA) base model is designed to remove the negative effect caused by noise. This model can enhance the ability of domain confusion and extract the inherent fault-relevant features. The asynchronous unbalanced update paradigm is utilized to optimize the DDA base model. Experimental results on two heterogeneous federated transfer cases prove that HFDGN outperforms other well-known and advanced diagnosis methods.

Based on attack approximations as the output from the neural network, a resilient and efficient controller is designed to defend against the mixed-type of network attacks, in which several adaptive laws are proposed to estimate the involved neural network weights.

The main challenges encountered when deriving the cooperative optimal protocol are caused due to the conservatism of Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics, uncertainties, disturbances, and coupling of agents. Until now, the consensus optimal protocols for Lipschitz nonlinear agents are provided in the existing literature, which is conservative and has limited applications. To tackle these issues, a cooperative protocol is provided for intelligent nonlinear systems that are optimal for the performance index and robust against uncertainties and disturbances. The performance index of the optimal protocol depends on the Lipschitz nonlinearities is converted into linear parameter-varying (LPV) form. The LPV approach reduces the conservatism of the existing methods for Lipschitz nonlinearities that improves the scope of the design approach and is applicable to practical applications of nonlinear multiagents. The optimal solution is obtained by solving the algebraic Riccati equation. The proposed optimal scheme increases the region of the feasibility of the Lipschitz constant by extracting precise information about nonlinearities. Moreover, a robust cooperative optimal protocol is designed that has ensured optimal consensus for the nonlinear agents and eliminated the negative effects of parameter uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, the results are verified through a simulation example of multiple nonlinear robotic manipulators.},

A novel distributed set-membership performance index is provided by averaging over the ellipsoidal constraints of all the sensor nodes, and the local performance analysis method is employed to establish sufficient criteria that guarantee the existence of desired estimators whose parameters are then derived for every node by recursively optimizing certain ellipsoids in the sense of matrix trace.

With the rise of nano-scale integrated circuit design, the multilayer global routing problem has attracted considerable research interest during the past few years. In this article, a multilayer X-architecture global routing (ML-XGR) system based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), called FZU-Router, is proposed to solve the ML-XGR problem for the first time. FZU-Router contains a multilayer X-architecture integer linear programming (MX-ILP) model and a multilayer X-architecture PSO (MX-PSO) algorithm, which are presented to formulate and solve the ML-XGR problem, respectively. Moreover, four effective strategies are designed to enhance the efficiency of FZU-Router: 1) a strategy for generating new routing modes is proposed to strengthen the robustness of encoding strategy of MX-PSO; 2) a strategy for combining MX-PSO with maze routing is proposed to improve the routability; 3) a strategy for reducing the channel capacity is proposed to make better use of optimization ability of MX-PSO; and 4) a strategy for dynamic resource assignment is proposed to make better use of routing resources and shorten the running time. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks confirm that the proposed FZU-Router leads to fewer total overflow and shorter total wirelength compared with the state-of-the-art routers.},

  abstract     = {Edge perturbations (EPs) are often induced by disease-causing mutations, which include edge removal and edge sign switch. This article explores the robust stability of Boolean networks (BNs) with these two kinds of EPs. At first, both edge removal perturbation and edge sign switch perturbation are converted to multibit function perturbations (FPs). After that, the parameterized reachability matrix is constructed to verify the robust stability of BNs with multibit FP. As applications, several new criteria are established for the robust stability of BNs subject to edge removal perturbation and edge sign switch perturbation. Finally, the results are demonstrated by the Boolean models of p53 pathways network and Toll pathway of Drosophila signaling pathway network.},

The key of personalized search is to learn the representations of users’ interests from users’ search history. The state-of-the-art personalized search methods often encode group-level features of similar users to improve personalized search. However, existing group-level feature encoding methods are sensitive to noisy users, which are often contained in real-world search data. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to encode group features based on a topological data analysis technique, namely, persistent homology analysis. Such topological features are typically robust to noisy data, thus can improve the personalized search quality. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use topological features for improving personalized Web search. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-life datasets to evaluate the proposed approach; and the results show that our solution is significantly better than the state-of-the-art personalized search models in terms of several widely used precision measures.},

To further enhance AAS configuration efficiency, we propose model-based definition (MBD)-enhanced AAS (MBD-AAS) for generic production line design.

To achieve this goal, inverse graph model for conflict resolution is an effective way to make the state of interest an equilibrium by ascertaining the required preferences. However, specifying crisp cost or effort of changing preferences over states can be challenging for decision makers (DMs) and third parties. As a result, a new inverse preference optimization model using interval optimization is introduced into the graph model by considering the uncertain cost of preference adjustment. First, the preference adjustment cost with uncertainty is formulated using interval number. Then, pessimistic preference ordering and DMs’ degrees of risk tolerance are utilized to compare cost intervals. After that, an inverse preference optimization model with uncertain adjustment cost is established. Finally, an illustrative example of the bulk water export conflict in Canada is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The input quantization is addressed by using the nonlinear decomposition technique. A nonlinear filter with predefined time stability is constructed to decrease the computational complexity. Further, by introducing the designed predefined time filter into the backstepping recursive framework, a predefined time dynamic surface control algorithm is developed, in which the improved adding power integration technique is introduced to prevent control singularities. The Lyapunov theory demonstrates the predefined time stability of the closed-loop quantized nonlinear systems. By the developed control algorithm, the controlled system can effectively track the specified command signal.

With the multirate observer and edge-based DETM, we construct a fully distributed observer-based controller for each agent. Under this controller, the LFOC problem of uncertain heterogeneous MASs subject to the MCH cyber-attacks can be solved in a fully distributed manner, while ensuring the exclusion of the Zeno behaviors.

  abstract     = {This article presents a solution to the output-feedback control problem of dc-dc converters with unknown independent output loads. The available measurements are limited to the voltages across the capacitors and the input sources. A general lossless model of the converter is considered, which eliminates the need for knowledge of parasitic elements such as the input side parasitic resistance. However, this poses a challenge for observer-based design due to the lack of detectability. To address this challenge, a dynamic full-information controller is designed, taking into account the control signal saturation of the system. To handle the presence of parametric uncertainty in the output dynamics, a constructive filtered transformation is proposed to convert the dynamics into a proper adaptive observer form. By utilizing the immersion and invariance technique, a reduced-order filter is derived, leading to a reduced-order observer. The parametric convergence is achieved with a weaker condition compared to the usual persistency of excitation requirement for converters with a single unknown load. The dynamic controller is reinforced in conjunction with the observer to overcome the detectability obstacle and uniform global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The computation of filter dynamics is canceled in the control algorithm by redesigning the observer and updating the adaptation law with feedback from the regulation error. The performance of the proposed control algorithms is experimentally evaluated on a dc-dc Buck converter with unknown parasitic and output resistances.},

To compute bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) with complex time-varying relaxation matrix structures, the developed SSCO algorithm employs a more flexible switching-type optimization variable and an inner approximation strategy capable of linearizing all concave sections. As a result, a sequence of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained without introducing any additional constraint and with better approximation level than existing solving methods. The superiority of the proposed method includes two aspects: more relaxed solving conditions are gained by using the time-varying relaxation matrix technique to facilitate controller design; the proposed SSCO algorithm is of faster convergence rate, which means less computational time for practical implementation.

In addition, an improved impulse-time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional containing characteristics of IAs and time delays is designed, and it is demonstrated to be continuous along the FDSIS trajectories. Improved conditions are put forward in the form of strict linear matrix inequalities via congruent transformation technology, which can guarantee that the singular sliding-mode dynamics under IAs fulfills $H_{\infty }$ stochastic admissibilization.

A merging signal is constructed and then the closed-loop system is established to carry out stability analysis for asynchronous and synchronous switching cases within a unified framework. Then, based on the merging signal, a corresponding Lyapunov functional that includes a looped functional is constructed. This looped functional helps to reduce conservatism of the stability criterion. Finally, examples, including relevant discussions and comparisons, are shown to illustrate the efficacy of our developed results.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering (MVC) is a fundamental research topic in the field of machine learning and data mining, which has been developed rapidly and made significant progress recently. However, the current works tend to learn the individual representation of each view and then naviely merge or align them to achieve a shared representation of multiview data. By doing this, they often ignore the interference caused by the entanglement among multiple views, leading to the shared latent embedding cannot well model the correlation of all views. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel self-supervised adversarial learning-based view-common latent autoencoders for MVC, termed by multi-SSALvcAE. Specifically, the proposed method can effectively disentangle the unique and common information of each view by virtue of multiview adversarial latent autoencoders. And then only the common parts are fused to form the shared information, after being aligned deliberately on multiview semantic space. Experimental results show that our method achieved the promising results on several datasets, against the state-of-the-arts.},

However, there are difficulties in the fine control with proper stiffness of CCDMs due to their flexible structures and various configurations. This article proposes an analytical variable-stiffness method for the fine control of CCDMs. First, the stiffness model is established by taking into account key factors, including the middle elastic backbone, cable tensions, configurations, and external loads. Then, the stiffness mesh is generated based on the stiffness model, which visually represents changing trends of its stiffness. Simultaneously, the stiffness of CCDMs can be accurately adjusted by optimizing their configurations and cable tensions. Therefore, the fine control with high or low stiffness of CCDMs can be realized in practical applications. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the analytical variable-stiffness method of CCDMs. Results indicate that the average error of the stiffness model is 5.42%. It also confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method for achieving analytical variable-stiffness control of CCDMs. Furthermore, the proposed method is also applicable to cable-driven manipulators with similar structures.},

Then, under the condition that the switching topology is connected, by using the backstepping technique, a new Lyapunov function is introduced so that the multiple flexible manipulators system can ensure angle cooperative control and vibration suppression while not knowing the control direction. Moreover, the adaptive law is designed to handle compound disturbances consisting of the unknown dead zones, additive faults, and boundary disturbances.

A patient-hose blower-driven mechanical ventilator (MV) operated in pressure-controlled mode is examined with the proposed controller structure. The error between the desired airway pressure and the ventilator pressure is used as an input to the fuzzy type-2 controller. Another fuzzy input is the change in error. The output variables of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) of the fuzzy controller in the proposed control structure are the parameters of a PID controller. The ranges and points of a triangular-shaped fuzzy type-2 inference system are optimized for the ventilator model with a newly introduced optimizer named the human conception optimizer (HCO) algorithm. With the optimized fuzzy type-2 controller, the parameters of the PID controller are adjusted automatically during any external disturbance or in the presence of any parametric uncertainties in the system. The inherent features of handseling uncertainties of the fuzzy type-2 controller are verified with the PID controller for the ventilator model under different scenarios. With the proposed control scheme, the pressure tracking profile of the ventilator is improved in terms of response time, settling time, and overshoot as compared to the existing results.},

To address this issue, we formulate the state-observer and the subsystem as a two-player Stackelberg game framework, where the state-observer acts as the follower-player and the subsystem acts as the leader-player. Such a framework helps us to reveal the two-way interaction between the subobserver and the subsystem. Based on this, we design the optimal auxiliary input of the state-observer and the optimal subsystem controller. We implement the optimal policy pair using integral reinforcement learning (IRL) and adaptive critic learning, which provides a critic-only structure. We prove that the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium is reached and that the closed-loop signals are ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB).

By defining a weighted average state associated the topology structure, two types of impulsive protocols are proposed: 1) dynamical consensus and 2) static consensus. The form drives all the agents toward the weighted average state, while the latter ensures that each agent tends to an agreed position. Unlike the existing impulsive protocols exerting impulsive actions on all the state variables of the agents, the proposed impulsive protocols only regulate the agents’ velocity vectors in an impulsive fashion throughout the consensus process. The introducing of the timer-dependent weighted double Lyapunov functions plays a key role in consensus analysis, which is able to exploit the relationship among the discrete-time agent’s dynamics, the impulsive protocols, and the communication topology. Sufficient conditions are derived to design the gain matrices of the impulsive protocols, which are dependent on the current impulse interval. The numerical results show that the variable gain-based design approach can tolerate larger variation in impulse intervals for impulsive consensus.},

  abstract     = {Pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuators exhibit practical compliance and great payload-to-weight ratios when driving robotic exoskeletons. However, filling with highly compressed gas makes PAMs susceptible to sensor noises, which may degrade the state response and increase control efforts. In addition, most of the existing optimal controllers require linearized operations or complex network calculations. To this end, a supervised learning control method with preassigned-time performance is studied, which achieves satisfactory motion control of the compliant PAM robots. In particular, the utilized dynamic observer with time-varying gains significantly reduces the effect of observation noises, and enhances the state convergence speed by combining with the preassigned-time constraints. Simultaneously, the improved supervised learning algorithm further optimizes input air consumption, which only involves the iterative adjustment of network weights. In contrast to the literature, this article presents a new solution to minimize energy consumption of the compliant PAM robots, while ensuring that the output states converge within the preassigned time, independent of parameter design.

On this basis, a modified state observer is designed to estimate the unavailable states and unknown parameters of the HT-NARMAX model simultaneously. Then, by combining the command filter technique and event-triggered mechanism, a novel fixed-time adaptive event-triggered control (FAETC) strategy is proposed. In FAETC, the tracking differentiator with an unique acceleration function (UTD) is developed to mitigate the computation complexity problem, and the ETC is used to reduce the communication burden. Furthermore, to guarantee the system convergence, a new fixed-time stability criterion is set up by resorting to a scaling function. In view of this criterion, all signals in the closed-loop system can achieve the fixed-time convergence. Moreover, the tracking performance can be retained over a fixed time via the reported controller.

A distributed model-free observer is constructed for each follower to estimate the leaders’ dynamics and the output trajectories inside the convex hull formed by the leaders. Based on the designed observers, the optimal containment problem is formulated as an optimal tracking control issue. Then the discounted performance functions are introduced to obtain algebraic Riccati equations (AREs). And a model-free RL algorithm is developed to learn the AREs online. To implement this algorithm, we design a single critic neural network structure for each follower to approximate Q-function, and estimate optimal control policy and worst-case adversarial input policy. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Both the error range and the finite-iteration number can be designated beforehand by considering the efficiency and economy of the industrial processes. As a result, not only can the proposed DDFILC guarantee the desired product quality but also can reduce the operation cost. First, a linear data model (LDM) is constructed to reformulate the system dynamics that satisfies the Lipschitz continuity condition. Then, an iterative updating law of the DDFILC is developed for estimating the unknown parameter of the LDM. The proportional-differential type learning law used in the DDFILC has two iteration-time-varying learning gains, both of which are updated according to the linear matrix inequality conditions. Not only the finite-iteration convergence but also the iteratively asymptotic convergence can be shown mathematically by using the two-dimensional (2-D) system theory. The proposed DDFILC approach does not require an exact model and is robust to uncertainties. The simulation study verifies the results.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer rich knowledge from the annotated source domain to the unlabeled target domain with the same label space. One prevalent genre is the bi-discriminator domain adversarial network, which concurrently considers the decision boundaries of both domains during the domain alignment. While effective, methods within this genre still contend with accuracy agnosticism toward the target domain and overconfident estimation in the source domain. Consequently, these two limitations hinder the effectiveness of both decision boundaries. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel bi-discriminator domain adversarial neural network, denoted as BACG. Specifically, for accuracy awareness of the target domain, we initially devise an optimizable nearest neighbor algorithm for acquiring pseudo-labels of samples, followed by class-level gradient alignment between two domains. This approach explicitly incorporates the accuracy signal from the target domain. To alleviate overconfident estimation in the source domain, we adopt evidential learning theory and develop a multinomial Dirichlet hierarchical model to infer both the classification probability and uncertainty. This approach not only ensures optimal assumptions for the source domain but also guarantees high-quality domain alignment. Additionally, to lower the time overhead caused by pseudo-label assignment, we introduce a memory bank-based variant, namely, fast-BACG, which effectively accelerates the training process at the expense of a slight reduction in accuracy. Extensive experiments and thorough analysis on four benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.},

However, existing chaotic systems suffer from suboptimal parameters regarding chaotic indicators. In this study, a novel leader Pareto grey wolf optimizer (LP-GWO) is proposed for multiobjective (MO) design of 2D parametric hyperchaotic system (2D-PHS). The MO capability of LP-GWO is improved by integrating a LP solution within the Pareto optimal set. The effectiveness of LP-GWO is corroborated through a comparison with regular MO versions of grey wolf optimizer (GWO), artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, and differential evolution. Additionally, the validation extends to the exploration of LP-GWO’s performance across four variants of the 2D-PHS optimized by the compared algorithms. A 2D-PHS model with eight parameters is conceived and then optimized using LP-GWO by ensuring tradeoff between two objectives: Lyapunov exponent (LE) and Kolmogorov entropy (KE). A globally optimal design is chosen for freely improving the two objectives. The chaotic performance of 2D-PHS significantly outperforms existing systems in terms of precise chaos indicators. Therefore, the 2D-PHS has the best ergodicity and erraticity due to optimal parameters provided by LP-GWO.},

A disturbance observer is constructed for each UAV, including position subsystem (outer-loop) and attitude subsystem (inner-loop), to reduce the negative effects of UAVs with disturbances in complex flight environments. To avoid the potential internal collision among the multiple UAVs, a prescribed performance function that widens the initial value range of the consistency error is designed to keep the formation error within the specified range. Intermittent output signals generated by event-triggered control strategy of attitude subsystem are used to reduce sensors data transmission on each UAV, thereby saving energy and communication resources.

Some recent studies have explored using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve matching accuracy, but the computational load of existing learning-based systems hampers real-world applicability. This article presents significant contributions: 1) a novel stereo matching framework that greatly enhances accuracy on real-time embedded platforms and 2) a two-pronged approach combining a nonlearning-based algorithm and a lightweight super-resolution residual neural network (sRRNet). The nonlearning-based algorithm yields a low-resolution disparity map, while the lightweight sRRNet generates a high-resolution disparity map. Experimental results on benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a low matching error rate of 5.17% and a real-time processing speed of 51 fps using the embedded Jetson AGX GPU. The proposed method outperforms all existing real-time embedded systems.},

An encrypted LFC scheme is constructed by means of the homomorphism of Paillier cryptosystem, that is, the encrypted output does not need to be decrypted in cloud service. Considering that a bigger key size provides better privacy level, but will result in longer time delay, the tradeoff between privacy preserving level and control performance is analyzed by utilizing deterministic network calculus to evaluate the delay bound. Meanwhile, the decentralized characteristic of designed LFC scheme can avoid possible privacy leakage during the controller design procedure. Moreover, an optimization method is proposed for searching the suboptimal control gains. Finally, a simulation on a three-area power system is presented, in which 4 different key sizes from 256 to 2048 bits are tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Furthermore, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) with delay terms is proposed to investigate the exponential stability with $H_{\infty }$ performance on the dual-link LFC system. Finally, simulation results show that this development presents an improved frequency regulation performance.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the adaptive stabilization control of high-order strict-feedback systems (SFSs) with unknown control directions. It addresses the challenge of dealing with unknown control directions in the fully actuated theory. To overcome this challenge, the Nussbaum gain technique and tuning functions directly based on the high-order fully actuated system (FAS) method are proposed to deal with the unknown control directions and system uncertainties, while avoiding the phenomenon of overparameterization. Additionally, a relative threshold event-triggered strategy is utilized to effectively avoid continuous controller updates, which helps conserve network resources used for signal transmission. The proposed controller guarantees the convergence of all system state variables to zero and ensures that all signals within the closed-loop system remain bounded. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, a numerical simulation and a practical example using the Nomoto ship model are conducted. Overall, this study contributes to the FAS field by providing a solution for adaptive stabilization control in high-order SFSs with unknown control directions.},

To address this challenge, we develop a multimodal local-global NC system (MLG-NCS) that can capture local characteristics and exchange global cross-modal information sufficiently. Specifically, a high-density memristor crossbar array is prepared to perform efficient parallel in-memory operations, serving as the fundamental component of the proposed MLG-NCS. To facilitate understanding of the proposed MLG-NCS design, the local feature representation module, the global cross-modal interaction module, and the output module are designed. The experimental results show that the proposed system has advantages in classification accuracy (ranked top three), time consumption (approximately ten times speed up), and latency (about 1.2–15.3 times faster), enabling good inter-related tradeoffs between latency, efficiency, and accuracy. This study is expected to promote the revolution and development of next-generation computing system, which takes a firm step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).},

A new individual arrives at the group by the Poisson process, while new links are established in the network through either uniform connection or preferential attachment. Moreover, an existing individual has a limited lifespan before leaving the network. We determine stationary topological properties of these networks, including their size and mean degree. To address the effect of the birth-death evolution, we further study the information dynamics in the proposed network model from the random drift and natural selection perspective, based on assumptions of total-stochastic and fitness-driven evolution, respectively. In simulations, we analyze the fixation probability of individual information and find that means of new connections affect the random drift process but do not affect the natural selection process.},

First, by applying the temporal difference technique to the iterative procedure of off-policy RL, the iterative value function and the iterative policy input can be learned in real-time online. It is proven that the fitting error of neural network (NN) weights is exponentially convergent in each iteration. Second, a model-free Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (MF-HJBE) is deduced by taking the limit of the iterative procedure of off-policy RL. In this manner, it not only eliminates system dynamics in the classical HJBE, but also vanishes the iteration index. By applying temporal difference to the MF-HJBE, a real-time online tuning rule is designed to learn the optimal value function and the optimal policy input. It is proven that the fitting error of NN weights caused by the real-time online tuning rule is exponentially convergent. Note that the two online tuning rules, the iterative one and the real-time one, use only current and previous state data extracted from system trajectories. Meanwhile, it is proven using the Lyapunov’s direct method that the system solution is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proffered method.},

This fully benefits from the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that not only have plenty of advantages for solving computing problems in the real-time tracking control but also have the remarkable potential of parallel processing and nonlinear processing. However, there is a general lack of research on the applicability of DTRNN model to handle parallel robot. In addition, the precision is always an important point in real-time tracking control, and most of existing studies generally lack the elaborate researches on the precision analyses. In this article, the corresponding DTRNN model (i.e., general five-instant discretization (FID) formula DTRNN model) with parameter selection method is established. As one of the important theoretical contributions, the dominant term of truncation error of discretization formula and the conditions of maintaining precision of corresponding DTRNN model are proved from the mathematical view strictly. Besides, the influence of the selected parameter for the precision of such a DTRNN model is also analyzed. Finally, the above theoretical analyses are verified in the tracking control experiments of the Stewart platform, which is a widely used and representative parallel robot.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is a new problem-solving paradigm that uses model environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) to facilitate modeling. Task decomposition is widely adopted to reduce the difficulty of execution, resulting in multigroup collaboration problems. Multigroup role assignment (MGRA) has been proposed to solve the assignment of multiple groups. In many actual scenarios, there are dependencies between the decomposed subtasks, which is neglected by existing MGRA methods. Moreover, they disregard the fact that subtasks have diverse significance in the development of a project, which is of paramount importance to ensure the proper allocation of resources. To solve the complicated problem, the structured subtasks are formalized based on the emerging and promising RBC theory and E-CARGO model. Then, the assignment is abstracted into a complicated single-objective multiconstraint problem, named adaptive-equalized MGRA (AE-MGRA). In the formulated AE-MGRA problem, to improve the utilization of limited resources, the performance of each E-CARGO group needs to be equalized according to the corresponding subtask’s weight. As the optimal solution is difficult and time consuming to obtain, a tolerable deviation is utilized to achieve a near-optimal solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to sufficiently demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the proposed practical solution. In addition, the experimental results on static assignment and dynamic assignment further prove the effectiveness of the solution.},

  abstract     = {Designing distributed control systems (DCS) is challenging because we need to balance the application control performance with the real-time hardware resource costs. Compared to the abundance of automated tools for monolithic systems, managing the design and implementation of DCS still heavily relies on human expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a human-augmenting design tool that suggests and explores tradeoffs in co-optimizing controller simplification and multiprocessor distributed task scheduling with a simple dial. Our work creatively combines sparsity-based optimal controller simplification with task consolidation, to achieve an optimal control performance on the smallest distributed hardware footprint. Our unique task consolidator adapts to various real-time scheduling algorithms and allocates control tasks to the fewest nodes under the utilization bounds of the chosen real-time scheduler. To account for real-time guarantees when assigning the controller, we introduce an improved worst-case execution time (WCET) model based on a mixed Weibull distribution. This new WCET model provides state-of-the-art accuracy of WCET based upon fewer data samples, thus reducing design-time effort and improving run-time performance. With our tool, designers can virtually simulate the theoretical optimum, physically download it, or experimentally explore alternative tradeoffs between system cost and controller performance. In a real-world implementation, our tool reduced 60% of hardware costs by trading off merely 0.14% of control performance. By automating the “simplification – demux – WCET estimation – task consolidation” pipeline, our tool allows control engineers to balance control performance and system cost directly, speeding up manual distributed controller design by 16 times.},

A decentralized control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed in this article, which can solve the control and stability problem for nonlinear time-delay interconnected systems using past state data and interconnection information. First, the form of nonlinear interconnected systems with state delay is given. Based on such systems, the subsystems are reconstructed by adding the upper bound of the interconnection part to the cost function. New cost functions are constructed which include a series of Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations with Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) function, where the past state data and interconnection information are employed. Then, the control problem can be dealt with by solving the HJB equations. The HJB equations can be solved by the critic learning method based on ADP, where the critic neural networks (NNs) are applied to estimate the optimal cost function. The weights can be calculated by the gradient descent method, and the control law can be obtained. Subsequently, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved in the sense of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by a nonlinear time-delay interconnected system and two-stage chemical reactors.},

Furthermore, the result is extended to the output-based case based on the least square approach. In order to cope with the unknown leader system, an observer is put forward to estimate the leader’s state after obtaining the system matrices for the exosystem by utilizing the persistently exciting data. To further overcome the difficulties of the unknown dynamics of each follower, input-output relationship is constructed to infer the system matrices. Moreover, the solution to the unknown regulator equations is provided by solving the data-dependent matrix equations.

Specifically, for a given pair of tasks, we compute a cross-task similarity matrix that extracts cross-task consistent features bidirectionally. To integrate the complementary signals from different tasks, we fuse the cross-task consistent features with the corresponding task-specific features using an $1\times 1$ convolution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance gain of our method on two challenging datasets w.r.t different task sets, compared with seven approaches. Under the two-task setting, our method has achieved 1.63% and 8.32% improvements on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, respectively.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the privacy-preserving control issue for two-dimensional systems with probabilistic constraints. According to the exclusive or logical operation and the dynamic coding–decoding rule, a privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) is developed, under which the transmitted data is efficiently compressed and encrypted into a ciphertext with finite bits. A PPM-based controller is designed that simultaneously guarantees a prescribed probabilistic constraint, mean-square boundedness, and privacy performance. Mathematical techniques, including mathematical induction, Chebyshev inequality, and matrix analysis, are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the presence of the desired controller gains. Additionally, the privacy and secrecy performance of the PPM is analyzed and simulation examples are presented to showcase the efficacy of the proposed controller design method.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the finite-time fault estimation observer and controller design for switched random models subject to multiple time-varying delays. It is assumed that there exist actuator faults, model nonlinearities, external disturbances, and sensor faults in these systems. First, an observer is proposed to obtain the estimations of the system states, disturbances, as well as sensor and actuator faults. Compared with the existing results, the suggested observer estimates these sizes and shapes of states, exogenous disturbances, actuator, and sensor faults more accurately. This kind of unknown nonlinear dynamic can be approached by this generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model. Delay-dependent sufficient conditions of robust mean-square finite-time boundedness are obtained for the error system via a piecewise Lyapunov function. Observer matrices are obtained and finite-time fault estimation is realized. Second, we establish a novel controller based on fault estimation information. In addition, the piecewise function is developed to acquire delay-dependent adequate conditions of finite-time control. Controller matrices are obtained and finite-time fault-tolerant control can be achieved. At last, this validity of the method shown in this work is demonstrated via a practical simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Recently, recurrent neural networks have been extensively utilized to address a time-dependent system of linear equations (TDSLEs) with inequality systems. Nevertheless, these existing studies only limit the variable without considering constraints on its derivatives, which may be challenging to accomplish a given task in practical applications when additional constraints are introduced. Beyond that, the matrix pseudoinverse is performed, and non-negative slack variables are introduced in the solution process, which increases the model’s complexity and leads to a high computational burden. To remedy these deficiencies, this article makes improvements via proposing a novel recurrent neural dynamics (RND) model for solving the TDSLEs with constraints on the variable and its derivatives. Specifically, such a model neither needs to compute the pseudoinverse of a matrix nor to introduce non-negative slack variables, thereby enhancing its computational efficiency and accuracy. Corresponding theoretical analysis is provided to ensure its convergence performance. Finally, numerical results, comparisons with other models, and applications to single and multiple robots are provided, which substantiates the availability and meliority of the pseudoinverse-free RND model for disposing of the TDSLEs with constraints on the variable and its derivatives.},

Effort seeks to define an efficient multiobjective cost function for finding an optimal path in task space by minimizing the path length, and, meanwhile, maximizing orthogonality to the degenerate direction of the path. Since a robot manipulator by nature is a noncommensurate system, the unit dual quaternion is used to unify the pose representation and formulate the cost function of path length. Additionally, to justify the robot’s ability to maneuver, another cost evaluation of orthogonality is developed on the basis of the analytical Jacobian matrix decomposition. The optimized rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) is, then, applied to execute the synthesized cost function in planning a path for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) FANUC-M-20iA industrial robot. By comparing with two relevant path planning methods, simulation analysis results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed path planning approach in terms of path direction and joint change.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation can help unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) improve their plans to visit charging stations and avoid congestion, but can be hindered by privacy concerns. We propose a new, privacy preserving, joint routing, and charging scheduling framework which allows multiple cellular-connected UAVs to jointly optimize their routes and charging schedules in a decentralized fashion. The framework allows each UAV to minimize its energy usage and connectivity outage, maximize its recharged energy, ensure its timely arrival, and preserve its privacy concerning its trajectory and destination. The key idea is that we obfuscate probabilistically the destination of each UAV, and design a new noncooperative Bayesian game among the UAVs to find their best routes and charging schedules toward the obfuscated destinations. Another important aspect is that we prove the game is a potential Bayesian game with a pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the best response yielded with the Bellman-Ford algorithm. This new framework preserves the UAVs’ privacy in the sense that an UAV only shares the probability of its visit to a charging station at different times, and its best response is based on an obfuscated destination. Simulations demonstrate that the framework ensures timely arrivals with near-optimal routes and substantially lower complexity than a centralized routing scheme based on brute force.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to address the realistic path tracking control problem toward high-system performance for commercial autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with simultaneously guaranteeing the tracking accuracy, yaw and roll stability under limited vehicle network resources in global position system temporarily unavailable environments. In such conditions, the vehicle full state information and road topography might not be accessible in real time. To this end, this article proposes an effective adaptive event-trigger (AET)-based robust path tracking control strategy with introducing the reliable Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy state observer for practical implementation. First, the vehicle yaw and roll coupled dynamics is incorporated into the vehicle-road system model, with modeling the tire cornering stiffness uncertainty by the T-S fuzzy technique and resolving the system disturbances as unknown inputs. Then, the fuzzy observer structure is established with unmeasurable premise variables which are handled by norm-bound method. Next, a well-designed AET control framework is constructed to reduce the real-time network occupation rate and economize the communication bandwidth resources. Besides, the input constraint and rollover prevention are handled using the robust set invariance. After that, the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controller and observer are co-designed through solving the effective linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, the close-loop stability and $H\infty $ performance are ensured by means of the delay dependent Lyapunov-Krasovski method. Finally, the validity and superiority of the proposed control strategy have been verified by Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in different dynamic scenarios with high-fidelity full vehicle model.},

  abstract     = {Machine intelligence fault prediction (MIFP) is crucial for ensuring complex systems’ safe and reliable operation. While deep learning has become the mainstream tool for MIFP due to its excellent learning abilities, its interpretability is limited, and it struggles to learn frequencies, making it challenging to understand the physical knowledge of signals at the frequency level. Therefore, this article proposes a physically interpretable wavelet-guided network (WaveGNet) with deep frequency separation for MIFP, inspired by the sound theoretical basis and physical meaning of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). WaveGNet expands the feature learning space of CNN into the frequency domain, allowing for a better understanding of the physical insights behind the frequency level. Specifically, WaveGNet involves a derivable and learnable frequency learning layer (FL-Layer) consisting of a wavelet-driven frequency decomposition module and a convolution-driven feature learning module. Multiple DWT-driven FL-Layers are used in WaveGNet to achieve deep frequency decomposition and multiresolution frequency feature learning in a coarse-to-fine manner. The effectiveness of WaveGNet was evaluated in real high-speed train wheel wear monitoring and high-speed aviation bearing fault diagnosis cases. Experimental results showed that WaveGNet outperforms cutting-edge deep learning algorithms and has excellent fault diagnosis and prediction abilities. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the learning mechanism of wavelet-driven CNN from the frequency domain perspective was conducted.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the extrapolation error arising from offline reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm, existing methods typically make learned Q-functions over-conservative or enforce global policy constraints. In this article, we propose a dual behavior regularized offline deterministic Actor-Critic (DBRAC) by simultaneously performing behavior regularization on the coupling-iterative policy evaluation (PE) and policy improvement (PI) in the policy iteration process. In the PE phase, the difference between the Q-function and behavior value is first taken as the anti-exploration behavior value regularization term to drive the Q-function toward its true Q-value, which significantly reduces the conservatism of learned Q-function. In the PI phase, the estimated action variances of behavior policy in different states are then utilized for designing the weight and threshold of mild-local behavior cloning regularization term, which standardizes the local improvement potential of learned policy. Experiments on the well-known datasets for deep data-driven RL (D4RL) demonstrate that the DBRAC can quickly learn more competitive task-solving policies in various offline situations with different data qualities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art offline RL baselines.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world combinatorial optimization problems are defined on networks, such as road networks and social networks, etc. Due to the connectivity nature of networks, decision variables in such problems are usually coupled with each other, and the variables are also closely related to the characteristics of the local subnetwork to which they belong. These features pose new challenges to the design of cooperative coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the large-scale network-based optimization. To improve the scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness of CC, we propose a new approach called parallel cooperative coevolution with overlapping decomposition and local evaluation (CCOL) for large-scale network-based combinatorial optimization. First, CCOL devises the overlapping decomposition to divide a large-scale network-based problem into some overlapping subproblems with lower dimensions. Second, subproblems are optimized in parallel since they can be evaluated by defined local objectives without the context of other subproblems. Meanwhile, an overlapping cooperation strategy is employed to achieve consensus toward the global objective. Finally, as different subproblems may have different scales, a Huffman-tree-based resources assignment strategy is devised. This strategy is able to utilize computing resources in a better way and thus further improve the scalability of the algorithm. To better demonstrate the proposed CCOL, we implement a set-based particle swarm optimization CCOL (CCOL-SPSO) to solve the multidepot vehicle routing problem with time windows as an example. Experimental results in medium and large scale benchmark problems indicate that CCOL is efficient and promising.},

In this case, there are inevitably some “bad” estimations at the attribute level, reducing the performance of classification. This article proposes a mixed-type imputation method (MTI) to classify missing data under the theory of belief functions (TBF) via two quality matrices to address this problem. The proposed MTI method has the advantages of making estimations as close to the truth as possible at the attribute level while reducing the negative impact of possible bad estimations on the classification. Specifically, the first matrix used to impute missing values can characterize the different supports of multiple imputation methods for estimating various attributes. The other matrix used to perform the classification task can extract the reliabilities of estimations on the different classes. The validity has been demonstrated in the final decision support based on the TBF, famous for characterizing uncertainty and imprecision, for example, caused by missing values.},

Specifically, the CBF guarantees the controlled invariant property for considering the system dynamics. The proposed method samples the distance function and determines the safe set. Then, the CBF is synthesized based on the safe set by a scenario-based sum-of-square program. Unlike most existing linearization-based approaches, our method preserves the volume of the feasible space for planning without approximating the signed distance function, which helps find a solution in a cluttered environment. The control law is obtained by solving a real-time CBF-based quadratic program. Moreover, our method guarantees safety with the probabilistic result validated on a 7-DOF manipulator in real and virtual environments.

Three sequences of Bernoulli distributed random variables are utilized to model the packet dropouts over different communication channels. A decode-and-forward relay-based strategy is implemented to enhance the quality of communication by controlling the signal transmission in each sensor-to-estimator channel. The primary goal of this investigation is to create an appropriate state estimator for each node of the CDN, enabling the fulfillment of a specific $H_{\infty }$ performance requirement for the estimation error dynamics over a finite horizon. Through the use of stochastic analysis techniques and matrix operations, a preliminary sufficient condition is given to meet the finite-horizon $H_{\infty }$ performance requirement. The expected estimator gains are subsequently determined, which are defined in terms of the solutions to a series of recursive matrix inequalities.

Existing distributed strategies for Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking are inapplicable to our problem, due to the presence of high-order dynamics and/or inequality constraints. The coexistence of high-order dynamics and inequality constraints poses significant challenges for distributed strategy design and analysis, since these players’ actions cannot be directly controlled by their inputs while NE must satisfy the constraints. To ensure that the high-order players fulfill the MCG tasks autonomously, we propose a distributed strategy by employing state feedback, gradient descents, and primal–dual methods. Further, we prove the stabilization of high-order players to the NE through our strategy. Additionally, we apply our method to electricity market games (EMGs).

  abstract     = {In this article, an iterative cost-learning model predictive control (ICLMPC) is proposed for nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) in the presence of aperiodic sampling. The proposed ICLMPC is useful not only to guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with aperiodic sampling but also to improve control performance in the case of performing an iterative task. In the proposed method, the nonlinear system of NCSs is mathematically represented as an aperiodic sampled-data Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system. Based on this representation, the ICLMPC design is formulated in terms of a finite-horizon optimal control problem in which a new terminal cost function is considered. The terminal cost function is constructed by a Lyapunov function with a looped-functional and an iteratively minimized function (IMF). From the Lyapunov function with the looped-functional, it is possible to guarantee that the ICLMPC asymptotically stabilizes the aperiodic sampled-data T–S fuzzy system. To obtain an iteratively improved control performance, the IMF takes the minimized value among the integrals of the collected data at each iteration. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated by two practical examples in the simulation section.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) for a class of nonlinear impulsive hybrid systems with time-varying delay, adopting a creative approach that emphasizes the switching perspective. When both impulse and sliding mode control are involved in the time-delay system, ensuring the continuity of the sliding mode function (SMF) and achieving the reachability of system states become crucial challenges that need to be addressed. In view of this, a novel impulse-based SMF is developed such that the impulsive effect can be avoided on sliding surface, and the difficulty of its continuity is also settled at impulsive instants. By using the state augmented approach, the delay-dependent Lyapunov function with switched systems is formulated to guarantee robust stability of the given sliding mode dynamics. Meanwhile, the designed ASMC law is derived to achieve the finite reachability of switching surface for system states. It is shown that the proposed ASMC law offers a high degree of freedom for adjusting the constants in nonlinear assumptions. Finally, comparative studies are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate their practical applicability.},

A novel distributed algorithm is presented to assure both fast convergence and nonovershoot performance by the combination of an accelerated method and a gradient-based NE seeking algorithm. To be specific, an accelerated method (i.e., the heavy-ball method or Nesterov’s accelerated method) is introduced in the designed algorithm for the fast convergence of agents’ strategies to the NE. Moreover, a suitable switching mechanism is proposed to improve the transient performance by switching the distributed algorithm based on the accelerated method to the gradient-based algorithm. As a result, the presented distributed algorithm is modeled by a hybrid dynamical system (HDS). The semi-globally practical convergence is established by analyzing the stability of a parameterized HDS. An example of distributed energy resources is taken to verify the presented algorithm.},

Specifically, the internal model principle is employed to derive a cooperative regulation problem of DT systems, wherein no explicit solution to output regulation equations is needed for learning. Then, we introduce a convergence rate parameter to construct a group of auxiliary cooperative systems, based on which the zero-sum game in $H_{\infty }$ optimization is formulated. The data-efficient off-policy reinforcement learning and output-feedback technique are applied to solve the enhanced Bellman equations with a designated convergence rate. This results in an online optimal synchronization solution learning from only the input-output data along the system trajectories. It is shown that the proposed optimal synchronization protocol achieves asymptotic synchronization for the original systems with the consensus error converging to zero at a designated rate.

Slag-iron recognition is challenging due to the high temperature, intense radiation, and heavy dust in the casting field. Efficient and intelligent online slag-iron recognition is urgently needed in ironmaking enterprises. To this end, this article innovatively presents a vision-driven slag-iron recognition method based on multiscale neighborhood adaptive clustering (MNAC) to achieve continuous high-precision SIR measurement of molten iron flow. First, a shortwave infrared high-speed imaging (SWIHI) system is designed and deployed to capture high-definition molten iron flow images. Then, a multialgorithm fusion key frame and region of interest (ROI) acquisition strategy is proposed to achieve stable acquisition of molten iron flow boundaries and prevent the ROI from being occluded by dust and objects. Finally, a novel multiscale neighborhood slag-iron recognition strategy and an adaptive density peak clustering algorithm are presented to achieve high-precision slag-iron recognition through the kernel density estimation of the membership of a single pixel in multiple neighborhoods. Industrial experiments and applications indicate that the proposed method can achieve slag-iron recognition continuously and accurately to provide reliable SIR data for blast furnace experts.},

To solve this problem, decentralized temporal-difference (TD) learning is one of the most popular methods, which has been investigated in recent years. However, existing decentralized variants of TD learning often suffer from slow convergence due to the sensitive selection of learning rates. Inspired by the great success of adaptive gradient methods in the training of deep neural networks, this article proposes a decentralized adaptive TD $(\lambda )$ learning algorithm for general $\lambda $ with linear function approximation, referred to as D-AMSTD $(\boldsymbol {\lambda })$ , which can mitigate the selective sensitivity of learning rates. Furthermore, we establish the finite-time performance bounds of D-AMSTD $(\boldsymbol {\lambda })$ under the Markovian observation model. The theoretical results show that D-AMSTD $(\boldsymbol {\lambda })$ can linearly converge to an arbitrarily small size of neighborhood of the optimal weight. Finally, we verify the efficacy of D-AMSTD $(\boldsymbol {\lambda })$ through a variety of experiments. The results show that D-AMSTD $(\boldsymbol {\lambda })$ outperforms existing decentralized TD learning methods.},

We start with a linear subspace determined by the colored edges and show that the invariant kernel of this linear subspace is precisely consists of all the synchronous states. Moreover, this invariant kernel is characterized by a cluster of algebraic equations. Especially, for network described by a polynomial vector field, due to the property of Noetherian rings, this invariant kernel can be determined by a finite number of algebraic equations. Furthermore, the equivalence between network synchronization and the asymptotic behavior of the aforementioned invariant kernel are proved. Based on the colored edges and the invariant kennel, we decompose the original network twice, arriving at a three-layer network: the first two layers, referred to as the external part, can only synchronize to an equilibrium point, while the third layer, known as the internal part, possesses the same colored edges. For this three-layer network, we construct two Lyapunov-type functions for the external part and the internal part, respectively, to establish the synchronization criteria. In particular, our criteria involve linear matrix inequalities and polynomial inequalities of smaller scale, which can be solved by the existing semi-definite programming tools.

However, the unknown nonlinear dynamics and deception attacks will generate some uncertainties inevitably in the encoding–decoding, which may cause the quantizer saturation and then influence the consensus performance. Therefore, the impulsive consensus control problem of uncertain nonlinear MASs based on encoding–decoding under deception attacks is investigated in this article. To address the system uncertainty, an adaptive algorithm with neural networks is designed. Under the proposed estimator for each follower, the designed adaptive law for every follower only needs the information from its own sensor and estimator instead of the quantized information from its neighbors. Then a more general scenario of uncertain deception attack is considered, in which the uncertain deception attacks can occur in the both parts of hybrid impulsive control protocol. An attack observer is introduced to handle this more complex attack by compensating impacts of deception attacks. Next the sufficient conditions for secure consensus of MASs with limited bandwidth are derived. Moreover, although some uncertainties exist in the encoding–decoding, the quantizer saturation can be eliminated by adjusting the parameters of controller. Finally, the validity of given theorems is demonstrated by the simulation experiments.},

In the first phase, only objectives are considered, which can help the population to cross infeasible obstacles and to evolve toward the unconstrained Pareto front. Since the unconstrained Pareto front is in front of the feasible region in the objective space, the first phase can find some feasible solutions during the evolution. In the second phase, both objectives and constraints are considered. In this article, we also propose two transition conditions to judge whether the search should be switched from the first phase to the second phase, by making use of the candidates evaluated by the original objectives and constraints in the first phase. These two transition conditions aim at maintaining some high-quality feasible solutions when the first phase ends, which is able to motivate the population to converge toward the constrained Pareto front with good diversity in the second phase. Furthermore, in both phases, we design a new Pareto dominance relationship (called PDPD) by incorporating the probability distribution information derived from the Kriging models. PDPD is further generalized to handle constraints in expensive CMOPs, called Constrained PDPD (CPDPD), which provides high credibility for the comparison between two individuals with respect to both objectives and constraints. Finally, three benchmark test suites and a real-world application confirm the superiority of TEA.},

A sampled-data iterative dynamic linearization (SDIDL) method is devised to build the dynamic connection between input and output (I/O) data throughout different iterations. On this basis, the SDAILC method, including a sampled-data parameter estimation algorithm and a learning control law, is proposed by utilizing optimization-based design. In SDAILC, the sampling period is treated as a parameter to compensate for its influence on the control performance, and an error feedback is naturally involved, improving the robustness against uncertainties and the closed-loop stability of the plant. Notably, SDAILC is a data-driven approach independent of model information. The validity of SDAILC is proved mathematically and demonstrated by simulations.},

Different from the existing results, the nonlinearities of the systems are nonlinearly growing in unmeasurable states. A novel technical lemma is proposed to estimate the state trajectories between two successive sampling points. Then the new homogeneous reduced-order observer and sampled-data controller with genuinely nonlinear structures are constructed by using the sampled information of output. After choosing appropriate sampling period, the proposed SDC scheme can stabilize the nonlinear systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the results is demonstrated by using two simulation examples and the superiority of the proposed method is shown by comparing the control performance with the existing results.},

In this work, one convolutional neural network, named as Flashlight-Net model, is proposed for multiclass MI classification. Flashlight-Net model adopts modular design, in which channel fusion module and time domain module ensure the directions of feature extraction, while feature pool module reduces the loss of effective information. Given the multi-frequency nature of the brain, we combine three frequency bands and construct an ensemble Flashlight-Net model. During the model training, by means of transfer learning, pretraining and fine-tuning processes are designed to integrate training samples from multiple subjects. The experimental results on publicly available BCI Competition IV-2a dataset show that the proposed model can achieve good results on all nine subjects, with an average classification accuracy of 81.23% for four classes. All these demonstrate that the proposed Flashlight-Net model can effectively decode multi-channel and multiclass MI signals.},

This article addresses the problem of finding a cost-effective CRP (the CRP problem). First, we introduce a novel community state evolutionary model and, thereby, establish an optimal control model for the CRP problem (the CRP model). Second, based on the optimality system for the CRP model, we present an iterative algorithm for solving the CRP model (the CRP algorithm). Third, through extensive numerical experiments, we conclude that the CRP algorithm converges and the resulting CRP exhibits excellent cost benefit. Consequently, we recommend the resulting CRP to companies that embrace product co-creation. Next, we discuss how to implement the resulting CRP. Finally, we investigate the effect of some factors on the cost benefit of the resulting CRP.

  abstract     = {Palmprint and palm vein are emerging as unique biometric traits for identity authentication, each with its own advantages and limitations. Using these two traits jointly promises to enhance the discriminative and anti-spoofing capabilities. While existing research often combines these traits in parallel, such approaches lead to unnecessary increase in response time. Moreover, large-scale palm-based recognition, as a great potential task, raises higher requirements in accuracy and time efficiency. Nevertheless, few efforts have been dedicated to either data establishment or method investigation for this task. To this end, a large-scale palm-based multimodal dataset covering 20 000 palms is proposed, far larger than any of its kind. We also propose a hybrid fusion method to leverage these two diverse features. Our method employs a two-stage recognition process. First, a dual likelihood ratio test for coarse recognition is designed to assign palms into imposter certainty, genuine certainty or uncertainty classes. The coarse recognition narrows down the number of possible identities accurately using one trait, palm vein, consuming less recognition time. Then, in fine recognition, an adaptive weighted fusion of palmprint and palm vein is proposed to delicately rerecognize the uncertainty subsets that are in doubt in the coarse recognition, resulting in a more discriminative capacities. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method, showing improved recognition performance with high-time efficiency.},

This article proposes an adaptive output feedback backstepping self-triggered (ST) control scheme for uncertain nonlinear fractional order systems with unilateral full state constraints and partially immeasurable states. A stable reduced-order observer is constructed to estimate immeasurable constraint system states, while ensuring that state constraints are met. Considering that event-triggered strategy requires real-time monitoring of control signals to update measurement errors, a ST scheme is proposed to avoid this drawback. Simultaneously, a new nonlinear mapping is constructed to complete the unilateral state constraint problem while satisfying the convexity condition of mapping functions. The designed controller not only avoids the Zeno behavior but also guarantees the convergence of tracking errors and the boundedness of closed-loop system signals. Finally, comparative simulation and actual case are provided to verify the validity and practical value of the proposed control strategy.},

For the agents possessing sensitive state information that needs safeguarding, an output mask function is employed, which ensures that the true state value remains indiscernible to the other agents during the process of information interaction. However, the introduction of mask function increases the complexity of the cooperative control design for MASs, given the untrustworthiness of the received state information from other agents. To address this challenge, an adaptive backstepping-based control algorithm is proposed, relying on the masked states of neighboring agents. Simultaneously, a dynamic event-triggered control with the reset mechanism is introduced to save communication resources, in which the dynamic of the additional variable is determined by the preset conditions. Based on the proposed event-triggered privacy-preserving control method, it is ensured that the initial state value of each agent remains undisclosed, and the tracking errors can converge to a residual set around zero. Similar results are extendable to the privacy preservation containment control for MASs. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control method is validated through two illustrative examples.},

In this article, by taking into accounts of the coupling effect and cyber attacks, we dedicate to design an efficient synchronization control approach for discrete-time CNs. Given that the coupling among nodes in CNs inevitably introduces the internode data exchange, round robin (RR) protocol is adopted to prevent data collision caused by the limitation of communication resources. Moreover, a probabilistic interval model is employed to capture the characteristics of the coupling delay, i.e., the delay of the internode data transmission. The deception attacks launched on the multichannel-enabled communication network between controllers and actuators of nodes in CNs are also considered. Then, a synchronization error model is established to describe the concerned synchronization control problem. By defining appropriate Lyapunov–Krsasovskii function, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the envisioned synchronization error system are obtained, and the design method for controllers is proposed subsequently. Simulations are finally conducted to demonstrate the validity of the work.},

The issue is how to control the system states to converge to the origin quickly while not violating the output constraints. This article develops an adaptive stabilizing controller constituting a piecewise tangent-type barrier function and a series of non-negative integral functions with sign functions, which is bounded over the whole time horizon and ensures the fast convergence of the system states. The innovation is two-fold: a technical lemma is proposed for the first time to make the designed controller completely decoupled from the first state variable of the system. The proposed strategy can handle both constrained and unconstrained systems without reconstructing barrier functions associated with the output constraint. Finally, the stabilization of a liquid-level system is investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme.},

The integration of fractional adaptive backstepping control procedure and prescribed performance bound technique, which describes the convergence rate and largest overshoot of the output error, into a unitary framework can result in an enhanced control scheme with high precision. Based on Lyapunov analysis, it is theoretically demonstrated that under the proposed control scheme, all the closed-loop signals remain bounded and the output tracking error with respect to the reference signal, which is strictly confined within the specified performance bound for all time, will asymptotically converge to zero. Simulation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed fractional adaptive prescribed performance-based control strategy.},

Based on nonhomogeneous sojourn probabilities, a new switching law is presented to describe the dynamic behavior of the network topology, where the deterministic switching signal regulates the proper feedback sojourn probability information. Using historically transmitted packets, a novel memory-based DETP in the discrete-time domain was built simultaneously to alleviate energy consumption and improve system performance. On the basis of Lyapunov theory, the augmented dynamics are stochastically stable in the presence of a preset performance level.

In order to tackle the challenge posed by the unmeasurable first derivative of the sliding variable, a discontinuous observer with appropriately selected scaling gains is put forward to overcome the measurable lack. Through the interactive cooperation of the state-feedback SOSM controller and the discontinuous observer, an output-feedback SOSM controller is successfully designed without reliance upon the separation principle.

  abstract     = {The emergence of networked systems in various fields brings many complex distributed optimization problems, where multiple agents in the system need to optimize a global objective cooperatively when they only have local information. In this work, we take advantage of the intrinsic parallelism of evolutionary computation to address network-based distributed optimization. In the proposed multiagent co-evolutionary algorithm, each agent maintains a subpopulation in which individuals represent solutions to the problem. During optimization, agents perform local optimization on their subpopulations and negotiation through communication with their neighbors. In order to help agents optimize the global objective cooperatively, we design a penalty-based objective function for fitness evaluation, which constrains the subpopulation within a small and controllable range. Further, to make the penalty more targeted, a conflict detection method is proposed to examine whether agents are conflicting on a certain shared variable. Finally, in order to help agents negotiate a consensus solution when only the local objective function is known, we retrofit the processes of negotiating shared variables, namely, evaluation, competition, and sharing. The above approaches form a multiagent co-evolutionary framework, enabling agents to cooperatively optimize the global objective in a distributed manner. Empirical studies show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable solution quality with the holistic algorithm and better performance than existing gradient-free distributed algorithms on gradient-uncomputable problems.},

  abstract     = {Turbofan engine performance optimization is usually formulated as a single objective, closed-form optimization problem by employing a prior mechanism model with an additive, user-preference weight. However, in practical scenarios, the conventional single objective performance optimization may not satisfy the high-performance requirements. For instance, pursuing high-effective thrust will lead to high-turbine inlet temperature due to generating extra heat. Moreover, the system model may be inaccurate or even unavailable, mainly due to the degradation factor, manufacturing tolerance, or time-intensive experiments. Traditionally, the multiobjective optimization methods may require a certain amount of function evaluations, or the convergence properties may not be guaranteed explicitly. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, we formulate the performance optimization of turbofan engines as a multiobjective optimization problem and construct a gradient-free framework to deal with the issue of an inaccurate/unavailable turbofan engine model. Then, to ensure the safety requirement of the turbofan engine operating processes, a multiobjective optimization algorithm is proposed utilizing a gradient-free method, termed Hessian aware gradient estimation-based randomized search (HAGE-RS), and we analyze the corresponding convergence properties of the solved candidates. Finally, we illustrate the proposed algorithm on benchmarks and the performance optimization problem using real-world turbofan engine data under different operating conditions to show superior performance.},

Aiming at this problem, this article proposes an all-in-one framework for the design, simulation, and implementation of MASs via network, based on a triple-layer data structure that includes overall topology, entity, and physical device. Through the proposed framework, MASs could be designed together with graphic, then corresponding simulation and multitask codes generation could be attained based on the designed model. A simultaneous multiapplication launching for distributed entities could be completed with instant automatic deployment eventually. The entire process provides a unified scheme for construction, verification, and practice of various MAS projects. Using such scheme, users could prototype and deploy MASs quickly with convenient operation, which allows more time and focus to be dedicated to the design and exploration of the control system itself. The practicability of the proposed framework has been verified by typical cases, based on which a more general solution could be improved and applied in the future.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation, which aims to accurately identify each pixel, is a meaningful and challenging task. Recently, we witness a strong tendency to improve model efficiency in low-computing applications. However, most real-time methods ignore hierarchical features and context information to improve efficiency, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel system named hierarchical semantic-aware network (HSNet) to refine multilevel context information. HSNet mainly has the following two core modules: 1) hierarchical feature refinement module (HFRM) and 2) cross-scale pyramid fusion module (CPFM). By aggregating hierarchical feature maps, the proposed HFRM learns multilevel feature representation to recover spatial details. Afterward, the dual attention mechanism is developed to refine features from both channel and spatial levels, thereby alleviating the multilevel semantic gap. Meanwhile, the CPFM, which fuses local and global context information in a cross-scale manner, is proposed to enrich semantic information to improve accuracy. Furthermore, HSNet is carefully designed to improve the efficiency of the model by reusing shallow features and reducing channel capacity. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective and superior in segmentation accuracy and inference speed compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an asymmetric integral barrier Lyapunov function (AIBLF)-based control scheme is proposed for human–robot interaction (HRI), with which robot-aided human-compliant space-constrained muscle strength training can be achieved. First, an admittance model is exploited to generate compliant desired trajectory with the input of human–robot interaction torque. Then, on the basis of the super-twisting algorithm, a nonlinear observer is built to estimate and further compensate for the lumped disturbance applied to the robotic driving joint, including the active torque from human subject, the robotic model uncertainty, the friction, etc. Finally, an AIBLF-based controller involving nonlinear observer is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking issues in addition to the general constraint of training task space, in which the AIBLF strategy is utilized to establish an asymmetric-constrained training task space with adjustable boundary effects. This approach ensures that the training environment is tailored to accommodate individual needs and preferences, promoting a safer and more comfortable training experience. The convergence of all states and stability analysis for the closed-loop system are presented via the Lyapunov stability theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by a single-joint muscle strength training robot in various experiments, and it is worth noting that this method can be easily extended to other multijoint robotic systems with the demand of human compliance and space constraint.},

It shows that, the interevent times, under the designed mode-dependent event-triggered mechanism, have a uniform lower bound and then do not exhibit Zeno behavior. Further, using Lyapunov approach, some sufficient conditions for prescribed-time stability are obtained, where a relationship among triggering parameter, impulse strength, and prescribed time is established explicitly.

Generally, it is difficult to obtain the accurate processing time of jobs in advance due to various uncertainties in open shop scheduling problems arising from manufacturing and service systems. This work formulates a stochastic multiobjective hybrid open shop scheduling problem that consists of open shop and parallel-machine models. First, a multiobjective chance-constrained program is established to minimize total tardiness and energy consumption while meeting makespan requirements. Second, we newly develop a multiobjective framework integrating a brain storm optimizer and a simulation system to solve this problem. We combine population evolution to enhance exploration and external archive evolution to strengthen exploitation into the brain storm optimizer to seek for promising solutions. A simulation system is accordingly designed by using stochastic simulation and discrete-event simulation to assess the searched solutions.

However, the effectiveness of a single algorithm varies across different problem instances, necessitating considerable efforts in algorithm selection or configuration. This article aims to address the limitation by leveraging the complementary strengths of a group of algorithms and dynamically scheduling them throughout the optimization progress for specific problems. We propose a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic algorithm selection framework to accomplish this task. Our approach models the dynamic algorithm selection a Markov decision process, training an agent in a policy gradient manner to select the most suitable algorithm according to the features observed during the optimization process. To empower the agent with the necessary information, our framework incorporates a thoughtful design of landscape and algorithmic features. Meanwhile, we employ a sophisticated deep neural network model to infer the optimal action, ensuring informed algorithm selections. Additionally, an algorithm context restoration mechanism is embedded to facilitate smooth switching among different algorithms. These mechanisms together enable our framework to seamlessly select and switch algorithms in a dynamic online fashion. Notably, the proposed framework is simple and generic, offering potential improvements across a broad spectrum of evolutionary algorithms. As a proof-of-principle study, we apply this framework to a group of differential evolution algorithms. The experimental results showcase the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed framework, not only enhancing the overall optimization performance but also demonstrating favorable generalization ability across different problem classes.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a convex model-based reduced-order model (CMBROM) method for uncertain linear control systems, which ensures the accuracy of the reduced-order model with small samplings. Once the convex bounds of uncertainties are known, the coefficient matrices, input, and output in the uncertain state-space equation are quantified as convex model-based (CMB) parameters. A novel CMB state-space equation is constituted based on an order-extended matrix, which can solve the deterministic and uncertain parts of the state and output using the proposed solution method. The controllability and stability of the CMB state-space system have been proved. The conventional balance system is extended into a convex model format as an important fundamental process for order reduction, and the nominal and uncertain balanced coefficient matrices can be obtained using the transformation matrix. By solving the uncertain controllable and observability matrices using the CMB Lyapunov equation, a convex model perturbation-based singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed to estimate the uncertain Hankel singular values. Finally, the CMB order-truncated criterion is set using the CMB possibility.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the integral-type event-triggered stabilization problem for Tahaki–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems by employing the preassigned-interval looped function method. Herein, preassigned-interval looped function means that the positivity and symmetry on Lyapunov functions are removed in the inner preassigned intervals. The rest are saved. First, an integral-type trigger scheme is proposed to remember the evolution information of systems, which contributes to sampling the really necessary data packets. Then, a novel Lyapunov function is designed by using the integral of state information and preassigned intervals. In combination with some inequality techniques, continuous-time Lyapunov theory (CLT) and discrete-time Lyapunov theory (DLT), two sufficient conditions are developed to ensure the T–S fuzzy systems can be stabilized to the origin in the presence of an integral-type trigger scheme. Compared with some existing results, the advantages of the preassigned-interval looped function and trigger scheme are well analyzed. Finally, simulation results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme.},

OB is to make every subsystem control of backstepping as the optimized one so as to ensure the entire backstepping control being optimized. However, the original design of OB still needs to repeatedly calculate the derivative of virtual controls, as a result, it will inevitably cause the problem of “differential explosion.” In order to alleviate the phenomenon, the OB control is combined with the DS technique. Furthermore, OB control needs to conduct with reinforcement learning (RL) in every backstepping step, hence simplifying the algorithm of RL is very necessary and substantive for achieving the combination. In this work, because the optimized control derives both critic and actor training laws by utilizing a simple positive function instead of the square of approximation of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, it can obviously simplify the RL algorithm to compare with the traditional optimizing methods. Finally, the feasibility is illustrated via both theory and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that severely limits physical movements in everyday life. For individuals with CP, precise movement patterns are critical to improving their physical abilities. However, because of the time and expense involved, obtaining feedback from qualified rehabilitation professionals could be difficult. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal human action recognition (HAR) framework that integrates time-series data on skeletons and angles for upper body exercise for individuals with CP. Previous, studies typically used skeleton data as input to HAR. However, given the repetitive motion sequence, angles also are a crucial factor. In this study, we create video data of upper body exercises. Using the data, we estimate the skeleton using BlazePose, a human pose estimation (HPE) algorithm, and calculate the critical angles from the estimated skeletons. Our proposed framework incorporates graph-based models for skeletons and recurrent-based models for angles with an attention mechanism, allowing identification of important temporal information. It is shown that our framework performs better than unimodal HAR models. By reducing the costs associated with exercise feedback, we expect our approach to ultimately improve the physical health of individuals with CP.},

  abstract     = {Micron-range untethered, magnetic helical robots have great potential for biomedical applications due to their desirable performance with high flexibility and accuracy in unstructured and confined environments. However, at the microscale, time-varying uncertain disturbances in the environment and electromagnetic system greatly hinder helical microrobot tracking control performance. When a microrobot is replaced or even a derivative version with a slight helical body structure change is used for different tasks, the performance of the original control scheme remarkably decreases or even becomes ineffective. Here, we propose a data-driven optimal integrated controller (D 2-OIC) that realizes precise tracking and transfer control among a series of helical microrobots with derived structures in different situations. The control approach has a parallel structure with nonlinear feedforward and linear feedback controllers. The nonlinear feedforward controller inversely maps the relationship between the electromagnetic field state and the helical microrobot motion state, allowing the helical microrobot to quickly approach the desired motion state. The linear feedback controller effectively adjusts the controller parameters using the virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) method, thus eliminating any residual motion errors arising from nonlinear control. By retraining on newly acquired and collected cumulative data with assigned weights, the nonlinear feedforward controller is updated to achieve transfer control among various helical microrobot types. In the experiment, two helical microrobot types performed arbitrary path tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks with tracking errors consistently less than 4% of the microrobot body length, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method.},

To mitigate attack effects on the formation performance, a switching strategy for communication channels is designed. Besides, an adaptive secure control scheme is proposed with a distributed adaptive trajectory estimator and an adaptive tracking controller for each robot. In the estimator, damping and normalizing terms are introduced to alleviate attack effects on the system performance. Moreover, these terms can also remove the constraints on the lower bounded dwell time of switching topologies. By applying the backstepping technique, an adaptive tracking control scheme is proposed for robots with uncertainties to track estimator states. According to the proposed secure control scheme, a stability condition is provided, such that the boundedness of formation errors can be guaranteed under DoS attacks and arbitrary switching dwell time.

  abstract     = {Palmprint recognition has gained considerable attention in recent years, accompanied by significant progress. However, large-scale palmprint recognition, which holds great potential for extensive civilian applications like university access control, remains underexplored. In this work, we propose the CUHK-T dataset, the largest palmprint dataset to date, containing over 10k individuals’ palmprints. As the data volume expands, the heightened complexity, such as similar principal lines from different palms, necessitates a recognition method capable of extracting more discriminative features. Motivated by the rich palm lines distributed in palmprint, including not only nonintersecting, but also intersecting line segments, we model intersecting lines, investigate their properties, and propose a novel and explainable palmprint recognition method. The model treats the nonintersecting line segment as a special case, allowing for the extraction of orientation information from both types of line segments. In addition to the rich orientation information of the intersecting lines, the extracted feature accounts for the relative width of these lines. These advancements enable the extracted rich orientation code to be more discriminative and representative for palmprint. We then present a bitwise similarity measurement for efficiently and effectively comparing two rich orientation codes. Our extensive experiments and evaluations with popular palmprint recognition algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method on the large-scale dataset. These results also serve as a foundational baseline, facilitating the advancement of further research in the domain of large-scale palmprint recognition.},

We model point sets as graphs, transforming the registration problem into a graph isomorphism problem. This approach is enhanced with probabilistic linear programming heuristics to efficiently establish correspondences between point sets. Our method significantly improves robustness against common registration errors and does not require initial pose estimation, a notable advantage over existing algorithms. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including applications in intelligent vehicle mapping and localization, demonstrate superior performance in correspondence establishment and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under conditions of noise, outliers, and misalignment.},

In this article, we solve RCP for RBAC based on constraint enforcement and mathematical programming. We use Petri nets (PNs) to formalize RBAC. It is shown that each separation of duty constraint imposed on a PN modeling of RBAC can be enforced by a maximally permissive PN-based control structure. After implementing such control structure on the PN modeling of RBAC, we can obtain an admissible RBAC. We show that RCP of RBAC can be transformed into another problem, which determines whether each permission can be executed by a user in the admissible RBAC against the absence of some users.

  abstract     = {Intelligent control is a crucial technology for realizing Industry 5.0, which makes industrial engineering systems more efficient, robust, and resilient. It is noteworthy that uncertainties and disturbances will inevitably be detrimental to the control performances of Industry 5.0 engineering applications. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel super-twisting-like continuous extended state observer-based fixed-time composite learning fuzzy control scheme and apply it to a typical engineering system. Unlike conventional fixed-time adaptive fuzzy control methods that update parameters merely by closed-loop stability conditions, the proposed fixed-time control scheme utilizes both tracking errors and prediction errors to update parameters compositely, which achieves better-tracking performance and fuzzy approximation precision. First, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are developed to identify the unknown model functions in the Industry 5.0 engineering system. Second, to deal with the remaining approximation errors of the FLSs, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances, the novel super-twisting-like continuous extended state observers are designed to estimate these lumped disturbances. Third, the prediction errors that indicate the fuzzy approximation precision are constructed by developing fixed-time parallel estimators. Moreover, rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out to illustrate the fixed-time convergence of the entire closed-loop control system. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to a practical buck converter engineering system toward Industry 5.0, and comparative hardware experiments verified the advantages of the control scheme.},

  abstract     = {An optimal tracking control system using neural adaptive techniques is introduced for nonlinear systems subjected to time delay and inequality constraints, which is partially uncertain. The nonlinear inequality constraints and partial uncertain time delay of the state are considered in the discrete-time nonlinear system. By transforming the inequality constraint information into augmented system state variables, and using the precompensator method, an augmentation system that contains constraints and transformed controller information is obtained. The Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) can be used to deal with the partial uncertain state time delay. Subsequently, the optimal controller, the long-term cost function, the uncertain resistance, and system dynamics can be approximated by the action, critic, the disturbance, and the state estimation NNs, and suitable adaptive laws are obtained. Furthermore, the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the signals in the closed-loop control system can be obtained by the designed near-optimal controller. The inequality constraints are satisfied and the challenge arising from partial uncertain time delay has been successfully addressed, while a numerical simulation verification example is presented.},

First, a distributed control protocol is proposed by using low-gain technology to address the input saturation constraint. Then, an estimator is introduced to design a dynamic event-triggered communication protocol, which avoids continuous communication between agents. In addition, sufficient conditions for realizing bipartite security consensus are obtained under insecure communication networks with DoS attacks. Moreover, the dual-channel concept is considered to further save resources. An event-triggered controller protocol and a dynamic event-triggered communication protocol are designed in the communication channel and the controller–actuator channel, respectively. By considering an exponential threshold, the event-triggered controller protocol can operate stably when the control signal is minute. Thus, a novel dynamic event-triggered communication protocol is obtained to implement bipartite security consensus and exclude Zeno behavior. Finally, a practical example is presented to show the effectiveness of our design method.},

The Nussbaum gain technique is employed to deal with the unknown control direction. The nonlinear mapping is applied to ensure the satisfaction of the multiple constraints on state variables and remove feasibility conditions on virtual control signals. Double-layer constraint boundaries are incorporated into controller design process, the inside boundaries are utilized to cope with the multiple state constraints, and the outside boundaries are used into controller and adaptive law design.

To this end, we propose a utility decoupling method to reformulate the original game into an augmented game, which preserves the Nash equilibrium and weakly acyclic property, yet enjoys a utility coupling network the same as the communication network. In this way, a variety of full-information game-theoretic learning dynamics for the augmented game turns into partial-information Nash equilibrium seeking dynamics for the original game. We proceed to apply the developed utility decoupling method to formulate three types of distributed Nash equilibrium seeking dynamics, including distributed best-response dynamics, distributed fictitious play, and distributed regret matching for weakly acyclic games. In the last, a typical color assignment game is utilized to empirically illustrate the validity and effectiveness of our approach.},

This article first introduces a novel Lyapunov matrix-based complete-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), in which more comprehensive delay information is considered. An effective time delay compensation strategy in the framework of complete-type LKF is then designed, which leads to less conservativeness. The upper bounds of time-varying stuck fault and disturbance are estimated by the adaptive mechanism. Based on it, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed to compensate the effect of thruster faults, time delay, and disturbance. Furthermore, it is shown that the state errors of UMV converge asymptotically to zero.

The recently proposed tensor ring (TR) model has demonstrated superiority in solving the RTC problem. However, the methods using the TR model either require a preassigned TR rank or aggressively pursue the minimum TR rank, where the latter often leads to biased solutions in the presence of noise. To tackle these bottlenecks, a Bayesian robust TR decomposition (BRTR) method is proposed to give a more accurate solution for the RTC problem, which can avoid exquisite selection of the TR rank and penalty parameters. A variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm is developed to infer the probability distribution of posteriors. During the learning process, BRTR can prune off zero components of core tensors, resulting in automatic TR rank determination. Extensive experiments show that BRTR can achieve significantly improved performance than other state-of-the-art methods.},

A nonlinear state-dependent function (NSDF) is introduced to handle full-state constraints without requiring feasibility conditions imposed on virtual controls. To deal with the “explosion of complexity,” a novel filter is developed, which can also guarantee that the boundary errors asymptotically converge to zero. To cope with unknown VCCs, a Lyapunov function is developed based on the lower bounds of unknown VCCs skillfully. By introducing the Nussbaum function and a novel smooth function, the obstacle jointly caused by input constraint and actuator faults is circumvented well.

It first defines DMs’ initial bull’s-eye and consensus bull’s-eye, develops a multiobjective super conflict grey target negotiation consensus system, and constructs a multiobjective super conflict grey target negotiation consensus approach. Second, by making use of the theory and methods of grey target decision-making, grey relational analysis, super conflict, and group consensus, this article establishes a multiobjective super conflict grey target negotiation consensus approach for two situations: with or without any objective constraint. Third, by considering limited compromises and tolerance behaviors where DMs have compromise limits and cost-free thresholds toward the consensus bull’s-eye, we further optimize the consensus approach by employing parabolic utility functions in compromise intervals to reflect DMs’ risk-appetite attitude and then discussing how to reasonably allocate the consensus budgets based on tolerance intervals.

  abstract     = {This article aims to study intrusion attacks and then develop a novel cyberattack detection framework to detect cyberattacks at the network layer (e.g., brute password and flooding of transactions) of blockchain networks. Specifically, we first design and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., to generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and to implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, learn the knowledge from data using the Deep Belief Network, and then share the knowledge learned from its data with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid the risk of exposing local data’s privacy as well as excessive network overhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments clearly show that our proposed intrusion detection framework can achieve an accuracy of up to 98.6% in detecting attacks.},

  abstract     = {Liveness is among the most significant properties when Petri net (PN) models of automated systems are analyzed, which ensures systems’ deadlock-freeness. Traditionally, the liveness analysis methods based on reachability graphs (RGs) of PNs often suffer from state-space explosion problems. In this article, we propose a novel liveness-analysis method for PN based on maximally good-step graphs (MGs), namely, the reduced form of RGs, which can effectively alleviate such problems in liveness analysis. First, we introduce the concept of sound steps and establish an algorithm for assessing the soundness of an enabled step at the current marking from a practice point of view. Second, we propose a definition of maximal sound steps and construct an algorithm for calculating a maximal-sound-step set at each marking whose computational complexity grows polynomial with the number of places and transitions. Then, we introduce a definition for good steps and an algorithm for generating maximally good step graphs of PN; and discuss its computational complexity with respect to the net size and initial marking. Next, we for the first time answer how to evaluate the liveness of PN by using MGs. Experiments in diverse large-scale automated manufacturing systems demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces state space and time consumption in the liveness analysis of network systems.},

  abstract     = {Despite the significant progress in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the performance of UDA methods is still far inferior to that of the fully supervised ones. In practical scenarios, it is usually feasible to acquire labels on a small portion of the target data through active learning (AL), which aims to train an effective model with as few queried instances as possible. However, due to the domain shift, the instances selected by existing AL algorithms can be uninformative, redundant, or outlying. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely, clustering environment-aware learning (CEAL), for active domain adaptation (ADA). CEAL selects potentially the most valuable instances under domain shift by exploring the informativeness and representativeness of target samples in a clustering environment-aware manner. Specifically, for the informativeness, we not only leverage the knowledge of individual points but also their nearby neighbors, by measuring the proposed clustering environment aware informativeness score (CEAIS), thus ensuring that the selected samples are highly informative. For the representativeness, we design two schemes called point distance release (PDR) and informativeness score difference exclusion (ISDE) to guarantee the diversity and validity of the selected samples. Furthermore, we fully utilize the large amount of unlabeled data from target domain via pseudo labeling and adopt information maximization to improve the reliability of the target pseudo labels, thereby further improving the performance of the model. The effectiveness of our method is empirically verified on various benchmark datasets against recent state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The distributed SD control is equipped with logic processors, which can capture key information of DoS attacks, and the adaptive DC is conducive to relaxing some generally required constraint conditions. Second, a new property of a non-negative differentiable function is proposed, which is very helpful in solving the distributed SD control issue of multiple EL systems. Third, by setting up a $\textbf {W}$ -dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and utilizing the property of the non-negative differentiable function, new leaderless consensus results are derived for multiple EL systems with DoS attacks. The obtained leaderless consensus results are in the shape of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and can efficiently counter the influence of the DoS attacks. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the derived results is inspected by an MAS with multiple two-linked robot manipulators.},

  abstract     = {Hashing techniques have been extensively studied in cross-modal retrieval due to their advantages in high computational efficiency and low storage cost. However, existing methods unconsciously ignore the complementary information of multimodal data, thus failing to consider learning discriminative hash codes from the perspective of information complementarity while often involving time-consuming training overhead. To tackle the above issues, we propose an efficient discriminative hashing (EDH) with information complementarity consideration. Specifically, we reckon that multimodal features and their corresponding semantic labels describe heterogeneous data viewed from low- and high-level structures, which owns complementarity. To this end, low-level latent representation and high-level semantics representation are simply derived. Then, a joint learning strategy is formulated to simultaneously exploit the above two representations for generating discriminative hash codes, which is quite computationally efficient. Besides, EDH decomposes hash learning into two steps. To obtain powerful hash functions which are conductive to retrieval, a regularization term considering pairwise semantic similarity is introduced into hash functions learning. In addition, an efficient optimization algorithm is designed to solve the optimization problem in EDH. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our EDH in terms of retrieval performance and training efficiency.

A novel complex cooperative attacks model is first built. FDIA and RA, which appear randomly on the data communication channel from sensor to controller, are modeled in a unified framework through Bernoulli process. The state-dependent event-triggered control scheme (ETCS), which reduce the demand for network bandwidth, is adopted to update control signals. This article is to design an appropriate ETCS to make MAS reach consensus under FDIA and RA.

The tracking problem is transformed into a regulation problem by constructing a tracking error system. Furthermore, the implementation of the proposed algorithm employs an actor–critic structure, where the actor network represents the control policy and the critic network assesses its performance. Through the iterative interaction, the optimal policy is ultimately derived. The approach also leverages the parallel cross entropy optimization method (PCEOM) to acquire a reasonable initial control policy for PGADP, thereby accelerating the efficiency of the learning process. Convergence analysis of the algorithm is conducted by demonstrating that the generated $Q$ function constitutes a monotonically nonincreasing sequence.

The maximum correntropy (MC) recursive TFS, abbreviated as MRTFS, is first derived, where the smoothed estimate is obtained by fusing forward and backward filtering results step by step through maximizing the correntropy. Then, the information filtering form of the above MRTFS is proposed in order to loose the initial conditions of forward and backward filtering and enhance the structural conciseness of MRTFS. Considering that the fixed-point iteration is adopted to realize MC-based forward-time filtering, backward-time filtering, and two-filter fusion, its convergence is shown in the premise that the interested state vector is bounded and the kernel bandwidth of the correntropy is larger than a special threshold. Meanwhile, the computational complexity of MRTFS is analyzed, which is similar to that of extended Kalman-like TFS. An experiment of noncooperative target backtracking shows that estimation accuracy of the proposed method is superior to that of extended Kalman filter (EKF), TFS, Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother (RTS) and MC-based EKF/RTS, in terms of estimation confidence ellipses, different levels of kernel bandwidths and iterations.},

  abstract     = {Six-dimensional (6-D) object pose estimation plays a critical role in robotic grasp, which performs extensive usage in manufacturing. The current state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques primarily depend on matching keypoints. Typically, these methods establish a correspondence between 2-D keypoints in an image and the corresponding ones in a 3-D object model. And then they use the PnP-RANSAC algorithm to determine the 6-D pose of the object. However, this approach is not end-to-end trainable and may encounter difficulties when applied to scenarios necessitating differentiable poses. When employing a direct end-to-end regression method, the outcomes are often inferior. To tackle the mentioned problems, we present GR6D, which is a keypoint- and graph-convolution-based neural network for differentiable pose estimation based on RGB-D data. First, we propose a multiscale fusion method that utilizes convolution and graph convolution to exploit information contained in RGB and depth images. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based pose refinement module to further adjust features from RGB images and point clouds. We evaluate GR6D on three datasets: 1) LINEMOD; 2) occlusion LINEMOD; and 3) YCB-Video dataset, and it outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we apply GR6D to pose estimation and the robotic grasping task in the real world, manifesting superior performance.},

First, we present a novel zonotope-based interval estimator structure, in which the estimated interval bounds of each state component have design parameters independent of those of the other state components. Then, the widths of the jointly estimated intervals enclosing every state component are simultaneously minimized by solving parallel $L_{1}$ optimization problems via linear programming. Finally, a simulation study shows the effectiveness and higher accuracy of the proposed method compared with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {It is a very challenging problem that how to drive a group of agents with actuator faults and matched/mismatched disturbances to achieve collision-free formation maneuvers. Thus, a collision-free robust fault-tolerant formation maneuver control scheme based on leader–follower is studied. First, we plan safe formation trajectories by designing formation maneuver parameters. The continuous trajectories are generated by using polynomial interpolation technique and sent to leaders. Second, we design a robust fault-tolerant affine formation control algorithm for followers with faults and mismatched disturbances. Specifically, the backstepping approach based on “dynamic surface” is employed to tackle mismatched disturbances avoiding the derivatives of virtual control signals. Moreover, the adaptive fault-tolerant mechanism based on “projection operator” is adopted to cope with partial loss-of-effectiveness and bias actuator faults, and the potential singularity of controller gain is effectively avoided. Finally, the corresponding simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The existence and stability of equilibria are investigated based on Brouwer’s fixed point theorem and ${M}$ -matrix method. By means of a sign function on complex numbers, stability is confirmed using a new norm on the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts.

Different types of attacks are supposed to be encountered during the sensor data transmission via network. Both the impacts of the MRRP and the attacks are reflected in modeling the addressed system. The purpose of this article is to design an estimator capable of constraining the estimation error within an ellipsoidal region in the presence of noise interference, mixed delays, MRRP, and MIAs. Using recursive matrix inequality (RMI) techniques, sufficient conditions are derived for achieving the desired performance and the expected state estimator gains are derived by minimizing the constrained ellipsoid region. Ultimately, the efficacy of the developed estimate strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulation.},

In contrast to most existing PPC works where the control coefficients are known or unknown while constant, the proposed control method allows multiple unknown and time-varying coefficients with nonidentical directions to be dealt with. The technical difficulty in the stability analysis arising from the multiple unknown and nonidentical directions is circumvented by proving that the effects of multiple Nussbaum-type gains in a single Lyapunov inequality can be quantified according to a newly established lemma ( Lemma 2 ) regarding the enhanced Nussbaum functions. In addition, by resorting to a novel prescribed-time scaling function and an error transformation, it is proved that the current control method guarantees global prescribed performance in the sense that the output tracks the reference trajectory asymptotically with the tracking error converging into an arbitrarily predefined residual set at any rate of convergence within preset finite time irrespective of initial conditions and any design parameters, distinguishing itself from those semi-global results dependent on the initial conditions. The validity of the designed control scheme is confirmed by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.},

Therein, a Hankel extended dynamic mode decomposition (H-EDMD) algorithm is proposed to learn the finite-dimensional descriptions of the Koopman operator and the associated Koopman eigenspectrum. Moreover, the proposed H-EDMD even allows sparse sampling on the PTS systems, which is desirable in real industrial applications. Finally, extensive comparison experiments with a mainstream modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii model are conducted on an NTMDT Prima AFM to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed H-EDMD method.},

Driven by both economical benefit and efficiency, drone-truck combined deliveries are in demand. However, it is very challenging to handle the collaboration between trucks and drones. Existing methods for truck-only routing cannot be directly applied, since their solution representations and search operators cannot consider the drone-truck collaborations effectively. In this article, we model the system as traveling salesman problem with drones (TSP-Ds), and propose a new Memetic algorithm named MATSP-D for solving it. Specifically, we design a new drone-truck solution representation and develop new crossover and local search operators under the new representation, which can modify the drone services effectively. MATSP-D conducts exploration by crossover, and exploitation by a variable neighborhood search process. The experimental results show that the proposed MATSP-D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for most test instances, especially the large instances with more complex collaborations between the truck and drone. Further analysis verifies the effectiveness of the newly developed local search operators in searching for better-drone-truck collaborations.},

A simple but effective impulsive pinning controller strategy is designed to achieve exponentially outer synchronization on two CHNNs.

  abstract     = {We present differentiable predictive control (DPC), a method for offline learning of constrained neural control policies for nonlinear dynamical systems with performance guarantees. We show that the sensitivities of the parametric optimal control problem can be used to obtain direct policy gradients. Specifically, we employ automatic differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute the sensitivities of the model predictive control (MPC) objective function and constraints penalties. To guarantee safety upon deployment, we derive probabilistic guarantees on closed-loop stability and constraint satisfaction based on indicator functions and Hoeffding’s inequality. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method can learn neural control policies for various parametric optimal control tasks. In particular, we show that the proposed DPC method can stabilize systems with unstable dynamics, track time-varying references, and satisfy nonlinear state and input constraints. Our DPC method has practical time savings compared to alternative approaches for fast and memory-efficient controller design. Specifically, DPC does not depend on a supervisory controller as opposed to approximate MPC based on imitation learning. We demonstrate that, without losing performance, DPC is scalable with greatly reduced demands on memory and computation compared to implicit and explicit MPC while being more sample efficient than model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.},

A novel distributed event-triggered observer is devised to reconstruct the leader’s states within a finite time, and a Zeno-free dynamic triggering condition is put forward to schedule information transmission between neighboring UAVs. Unknown nonlinear dynamics are handled via radial basis function neural networks. By cleverly combining the presented observer and backstepping control techniques, a distributed FTC paradigm is constructed such that the estimated leader states can be tracked. Besides, finite-time performance functions are introduced to ensure that the tracking errors converge to the specified regions within a bounded time. It is shown by Lyapunov theory that all closed-loop signals are practically finite-time stable, and the FSPP restrictions are strictly obeyed. Finally, case studies are reported to corroborate the practical merits of the presented methodology.},

  abstract     = {When realizing multiagent optimal consensus control, it may encounter the situation that malicious agents transmit false information. Besides, due to the unreliability of information interaction and the uncertainty of the system itself, the agent may not fully know its own cost function. In this article, an improved Bayesian graphical game method is proposed to solve the optimal consensus problem of linear dynamical networks in the presence of false information. The agent’s probabilistic estimate of the uncertainty is named belief, and the update of probability estimate is named belief update. An information tradeoff principle is designed to solve the belief update problem in the presence of malicious neighbors. The principle can not only reduce the loss caused by false information but also force malicious agents to switch from deception to cooperation. On this basis, a new belief update method with information tradeoff principle is established. It is proved that this new belief update method has a faster convergence rate than the Bayesian belief update method when malicious neighbors exist. As an illustrative example, the graphical game solution is applied to the formation tracking control problem of a quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle swarm. Theoretical proof and simulation comparisons can illustrate the proposed method’s advantages.},

Two-dimensional (2-D) framework is used to combine historical batch data with current measurements. The ILC part uses run-to-run control with previous iteration data, and the MPC part uses real-time control with current sampled measurements. Real-time feedback-based MPC in the time axis and run-to-run ILC in the batch axis are combined to optimize the current inputs based on previous batch input-output data and real-time system measurements. Rather than achieving control objectives in a single batch, our design allows multiple batches to be executed successively. To establish the stability of the combined scheme, rigorous theoretical analysis is presented next. The combined scheme with improved performance is then validated through two illustrative numerical examples.},

For better-transient performance, a unified tunnel prescribed performance (TPP) is developed to provide strict and tight allowable set. By utilizing a scaling function, together with an error scaling function (ESF), and a more general error-dependent transformation function (ETF), we propose an event-triggered tracking control strategy leading to a solution for the underlying ECP with various initial conditions and asymmetric performance constraints. This control strategy is of significant simplicity, stemming from that only 1-bit signal is needed for each data transmission between controller and actuator. We also show that the tracking error (including the initial-constraint violation) is regulated into the prescribed region in a given time globally.

  abstract     = {Neurorobotic devices, such as prostheses, exoskeletons, and muscle stimulators, can partly restore motor functions in individuals with disabilities, such as stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and amputations and musculoskeletal impairments. These devices require information transfer from and to the nervous system by neurorobotic interfaces. However, current interfacing systems have limitations of low-spatial and temporal resolution, and lack robustness, with sensitivity to, e.g., fatigue and sensor displacement. Muscle scanning and imaging by ultrasound technology has emerged as a neurorobotic interface alternative to more conventional electrophysiological recordings. While muscle ultrasound detects movement of muscle fibers, and therefore does not directly detect neural information, the muscle fibers are activated by neurons in the spinal cord and therefore their motions mirror the neural code sent from the spinal cord to muscles. In this view, muscle imaging by ultrasound provides information on the neural activation underlying movement intent and execution. Here, we critically review the literature on ultrasound applied as a neurorobotic interface, focusing on technological progresses and current achievements, machine learning algorithms, and applications in both upper- and lower- limb robotics. This critical review reveals that ultrasound in the human-machine interface field has evolved from bulky hardware to miniaturized systems, from multichannel imaging to sparse channel sensing, from simple muscle morphological analysis to input signal for musculoskeletal models and machine learning, from unimodal sensing to multimodal fusion, and from conventional statistical learning to deep learning. For future advances, we recommend exploring high-precision ultrasound imaging technology, improving the wearability and ergonomics of systems and transducers, and developing user-friendly real-time human-machine interaction models.},

More precisely, the collector who faces disruption shares the customers’ location information with its rival to collect the used products. On the other hand, the manufacturer invests in the corporate social responsibility effort, which has bilateral effects on the forward and reverse flows. The products are sold through online and retail channels. The problem is first formulated in decentralized and centralized settings. Afterward, a coordination mechanism is developed to maximize profitability. The data from the case study is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed structures.

  abstract     = {This article studies a multiagile earth observation satellite system, in which a group of satellites provides observation services to acquire images of targets on the earth’s surface. In this system, the large-scale multiobjective task scheduling problem is studied by jointly optimizing the task assignment scheme and the observation window allocation to maximize the total profit of all executed tasks on all satellites and the loading balance among satellites. Note, however, that it is challenging to solve this problem since the task assignment scheme and the observation window allocation are tightly coupled. Therefore, a bilevel optimization problem is formulated, where the tasks are assigned at the upper level and the observation windows are allocated at the lower level. In this way, the observation windows are allocated based on the given task assignment scheme, thus decoupling the task assignment scheme and the observation window allocation. Furthermore, the observation windows can be allocated in parallel on different satellites to improve computational efficiency. Subsequently, a bilevel evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Specifically, at the upper level, an initialization strategy is devised to efficiently generate feasible task assignment schemes by constructing the candidate satellite set for each task, and then a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is adopted to optimize the task assignment schemes. In addition, at the lower level, for each task assignment scheme, a greedy strategy is proposed to allocate the observation windows to as many tasks as possible on each satellite and a local search method is suggested to further improve the observation window allocation. Experiments on a diverse set of instances involving up to 1000 tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits better or at least competitive performance against other compared algorithms on each instance.},

  abstract     = {As the simplest feature extraction, traditional hand-crafted transient-state features have been widely used in the area of electronic noses (e-noses). However, the influence of noise in the calculation of numerical differentiation leads to inaccuracy and instability in extracting these features. To tackle this issue, a novel numerical differentiation algorithm is proposed, which uses kernel-based regularization. The proposed method can provide accurate and stable transient-state features by directly estimating high-order derivatives from the noise-contaminated sensor’s reading. The feature representation is a prerequisite for the good performance of e-noses. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this performance in real applications can still be affected by other factors, such as sensor drift and the disturbance of nontarget odors. These issues can be addressed by applying a framework of domain adaptation and one-class classification. The proposed method and the adopted framework are verified in a field experiment, which identifies the odor of four targets and two disturbance whiskies measured by a self-designed e-nose system. The classification accuracy with traditional features is improved from $\mathbf {71.90\%}$ to $\mathbf {86.36\%}$ , showing the good potential of the proposed method for application in the area of e-noses.},

Further, with the aid of Lyapunov method, the convergence to global optimal solution of nonsmooth DRAP is obtained. To effectively alleviate the communication burden caused by frequent interactions, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed to drive the agents with free-initial state, while also ensuring the exclusion of Zeno behavior. Compared with existing algorithms for DRAP, the time-varying auxiliary function designed in distributed algorithms herein avoids the preemptive estimation of global parameters that may cause the failure of the distributed framework, including the global Lipschitz coefficients of objective functions and the eigenvalues of full Laplacian matrix.

However, identifying cost-effective BMP combinations for various locations is challenging, especially when using computationally expensive evaluation procedures like the Chesapeake Assessment Scenario Tool (CAST). This study presents a customized and hybrid evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithm aimed at enhancing the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed for two conflicting objectives: 1) cost of BMP implementation and 2) the amount of resulting nitrogen loading to streams. First, we present a surrogate model-based optimization approach and evaluate its accuracy and execution time against the CAST evaluation system. Then, we present a hybrid two-stage EMO procedure, which is initialized with solutions obtained from a point-based $\epsilon $ -constraint procedure and works with a repair operator to satisfy equality constraints. The hybrid EMO procedure yields a set of nondominated tradeoff solutions for problems with as few as 1012 variables (West Virginia’s Tucker County) to as large as 153818 variables (the whole state of West Virginia). Alternate tradeoff solutions provide a knowledge of different possible options and also importantly provide a flexible method of arriving at a single preferred solution for deployment. The EMO procedure is then integrated with CAST using recent RESTful API approaches, and interesting accuracy versus computational tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, a number of interesting insights of the scale-up optimization study reveal promising strategies to scale the application to multiple counties and the watershed level.},

  abstract     = {The key to enhancing machine intelligence is to make the machine learn how human beings perform tasks. In this article, the issue of finite-horizon inverse linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control is investigated for human behavior learning in a class of human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems. A novel finite-horizon inverse optimal control (FHIOC) approach is developed by integrating time-varying parameter identification and linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization techniques. The proposed approach covers three steps: by only using the system state measurement, 1) an offline identification method is developed to provide a batch least-squares estimation for the human time-varying feedback gain matrix; 2) a recursive least-squares adaptive law is proposed to online learn the human time-varying feedback gain in real time; and 3) the weighting matrices of the human cost function are recovered via the time-convexity and LMI optimization techniques with the learned time-varying feedback gain. Finally, the validity of the proposed methods is supported by a supplementary steering system of an intelligent vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor fabrication is regarded as one of the most complicated production processes with a high-mixed and uncertain production context, and it suffers from tool failures. Prognostics can predict the time when a process tool cannot perform its intended function. Therefore, preventive maintenance can be planned in time with the minimum impact on the production lines. Because most of the tool faults cannot be owed to the failure of a single component, it is challenging to model the system directly through mechanism analysis. Therefore, the development of failure prognostics in semiconductor manufacturing is somewhat impeded. Data-driven approaches are appropriate in this case, especially when the domain knowledge of the system under study is not comprehensive enough. This article attempts to propose a novel data-driven prognostic method integrated with the auto-associative regression and the Gaussian process to address the issue. This proposed method can extract the failure factors, establish the prognostic model and present the reliability of the model. On the basis of the built prognostic model, the failure tendency is predicted and the maintenance schedule can be determined. The validity and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated through a numerical example and a practical semiconductor manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed prognostic scheme can guide the frequency plan of preventive maintenance in the fabrication process and improve the productivity in semiconductor manufacturing.},

Motivated by the existence of certain partitioned regions that the system state cannot enter within one time step, an algorithm for calculating the reachable target regions for the system state is provided from the currently located region by allowing for bounded disturbance. Then, we analyze the stochastic stability with a desired disturbance-attenuation performance index for the resulting filtering error system (FES) by eliminating all the unreachable regions from target regions at the next time step. In contrast to traditional methods regardless of their unreachable regions, our results can reduce both the computational burden and the conservativeness of the analysis results. In addition, a PWA filter is designed, which excludes all the impossible target regions, such that the FES is stochastically stable, satisfying disturbance-attenuation performance with a lighter computational burden. The validity and advantages of our proposed filtering strategy are verified via a tunnel diode circuit.},

  abstract     = {Marking estimation is crucial in the area of discrete event systems. This paper proposes algorithms for addressing the problem of minimum initial markings (MuIMs) estimation in a known Petri net (PN) structure. The existence of unobservable transitions makes this problem challenging since the number of transition sequences consistent with an observed label sequence can potentially be infinite. It is assumed that only minimal explanations can fire before the firing of each observable transition (OT). We present the definition of minimal explanation places, which allows potential minimal explanations to fire before the firing of each OT to obtain more minimal initial markings. Since the number of initial markings may be infinite, we aim to obtain the initial markings that not only enable at least one transition sequence consistent with both the observed label sequence and the PN structure, but also exhibit the minimum total number of tokens (i.e., the minimum total number of tokens when summed over all places). After developing the algorithms, we also propose two heuristic methods to reduce the computational cost, resulting in a subset or an approximation of the final MuIMs. An illustrative example is provided to indicate how the proposed algorithms and heuristics can be utilized to reveal the minimum number of resources required which are indispensable at the initial state for the completion of a specified task sequence.},

However, the noise in image fusion has been a difficult issue and hard to handle. In this article, a variable-gain fixed-time convergent and robust zeroing neural network (VFCR-ZNN) model is proposed to figure out the image fusion problem and the corresponding quadratic programming (QP) problem. In contrast to the original zeroing neural network model, the VFCR-ZNN model adopts a novel fixed-time activation function and a useful variable-gain parameter, which allows the VFCR-ZNN model to converge faster in fixed-time and realize noise immunity under external disturbance. The detailed theory is provided to support this point. Different numerical QP comparative examples are carried out to effectively corroborate the rightness of the theoretical analyses and the excellence of the VFCR-ZNN model. Additionally, the quality of fused images acquired by the VFCR-ZNN model is higher compared to existing state-of-the-art models for image fusion. Furthermore, the VFCR-ZNN model is successfully utilized in the repetitive motion of six-link robot manipulator to demonstrate its significant practical implications.},

Finally, the simulation and comparison results confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the traditional backstepping controller in terms of safety and tracking performance.},

At the same time, combining the set-valued derivative with backstepping technique to achieve adaptive event control and neural networks are used to fit the unknown functions. The nonholonomic constraints of the system are removed by state-scale systematic design. Through transforming the event-triggering control system into a cascade network with two layers of subsystems, the stability of the entire system is proved based on the input-to-state stable small-gain theorem. The proof that Zeno phenomenon does not occur works in two ways: on the one hand, it ensures that the event trigger is effective; on the other hand, it ensures that there are limited jump discontinuities so that adaptive control can be carried out. Finally, the effectiveness of the adaptive event-triggering control method based on the small-gain theorem is verified by simulation.},

At kinematic level, to achieve a quantitative predetermined tracking performance without violating user-defined transient indices, a quantitative prescribed performance control (QPPC) scheme is devised, where the overshoot of the transient tracking response can be specified by a quantitative design relationship. To pursue a tradeoff between tracking accuracy and resource saving, a hybrid threshold-based event-triggered mechanism (HTETM) is designed and incorporated into the AUV controller design procedure. Additionally, a modified echo state neural network (MESNN) is employed for disturbance estimation, where intermittent system information produced by the HTETM is used for online learning, resulting in that both the communication data throughput between the controller and actuators and the online computational load can be diminished synchronously. Finally, a control law is devised at dynamic level to compensate for the triggered error induced by the aperiodic sampling of HTETM. Simulation results are provided and analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy with application to an omni directional intelligent navigator.},

Commanding based on their observation approach of the human operators makes them integral components of the network rather than simple providers of reference signals. This setup requires a new set of conditions distinct from the standard containment problem literature. Considering fixed-time delays in human reactions and information exchange between human operators and agents, it is shown that the containment problem is solved if the delayed closed-loop system is exponentially stable under the new set of conditions. Encompassing different graphs, system scales, and human parameters, we evaluate the largest delay without losing the closed-loop stability under various scenarios through numerical examples.

First, we develop a mathematical model for describing the addressed problems. The uncertain time is expressed by triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, four meta-heuristics are improved, and eight variants are developed, including artificial bee colony, genetic algorithm, teaching-learning-base optimization, and imperialist competitive algorithm. For improving initial solutions’ quality, two initialization strategies are developed. Six local search strategies are proposed for fine exploitation and a $Q$ -learning algorithm is used to choose the suitable strategies among them in the iterative process of the meta-heuristics. The states and actions of $Q$ -learning are defined according to the characteristic of the addressed problems. Finally, the proposed algorithms are tested for 57 instances with different scales.

  abstract     = {Identifying the transmission source based on network topology is of great significance for timely blocking migration from epidemic areas. To date, several sensor-based works have effectively focused on knowledge related to a single aspect, such as correlating the deterministic delay and observational delay or calculating the infection density. In this work, we study this problem from a new direction and develop a multi-attribute source estimator (MASE) and its extension Fuzzy-MASE. The proposed framework allows us to transform source localization into a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem, ensuring better flexibility and extensibility. In addition, we propose a novel method, i.e., source dimension which can be taken as a supplementary attribute to MASE or used as an independent estimator called source dimension estimator (SDE). Crucially, we also study a previously underappreciated yet vital issue—how to effectively manage the influence of noisy observation sources. To broaden the generality and applicability of our research, we examine arbitrary graph structures rather than any specific configurations. As part of our validation, we have simulated diffusion on networks of different scales. The experimental results demonstrate the strengths of our proposed method over other existing methods in localization accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Developing a distributed output feedback consensus tracking control scheme for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with interconnected dynamics and unmeasurable states holds significant practical importance. Current approaches to this challenge often rely on fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) or neural networks (NNs) for direct compensation of interconnected terms. However, these methods frequently result in incomplete compensation, posing obstacles to achieving true distributed control. In this study, the cyclic-small-gain condition is utilized to address the challenge of unknown interconnected dynamics. This approach effectively decouples the physical coupling among MASs, enabling the realization of distributed control. Further, direct compensation using the cyclic-small-gain condition introduces the potential singularity problem, which we effectively overcome by employing the inequality technique. Based on the presented control scheme, the existing control results for the MASs with interconnected dynamics are extended from stabilization control to trajectory tracking. As proved, the synchronization and observer errors eventually converge to a tunable zero region, enabling each agent to effectively track the leader. Additionally, the proposed control scheme employs a direct adaptive law design approach with a significantly reduced number of adaptive laws. Simulation results validate the theoretical scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the excellent capacity of feature representation and nonlinear mapping, deep learning with stacking deeply has aroused goer research interest in the field of intelligent fault diagnosis. However, under the case that mechanical failure signals, including gears, bearings, etc., essentially follow the excitation mechanism and modulation principle, an interpretable expression of deep learning architecture for intelligent diagnosis has been rarely discussed. Motivated by this issue, this study presents a novel interpretable multiplication convolution network (MCN), where three designed layers, including a feature separator, a feature extractor, and a classifier, are operated on spectrum samples input. Different from the conventional models, a series of multiplication filtering kernels (MFKs) are analytically designed to extract the differential modes from spectrum samples in an ex-ante interpretable way. The separated modes are stacked into a filtered mode map. A convolution layer is later used as the feature extractor to further abstract high-level feature representations. Finally, a dense decision layer is taken as the classifier for fault identification. Specially, to strengthen the sensing ability of MFKs, an anti-aliasing constraint is introduced to improve the information diversity of the separator. In essence, MCN operates in a novel framework collaborating signal processing with deep learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCN. Besides, feature map visualizations are further implemented to verify that the desired fault-sensitive modes in spectrum samples can be precisely mined, which provides the MCN with higher recognition accuracy and good ex-post interpretability. Benefiting from analytic kernel design, MCN has fewer model parameters as a lightweight efficient architecture, which shows enormous potential in the application of edge intelligent fault diagnosis.

  abstract     = {We investigate the distributed time-varying formation tracking of networked quadrotors with input saturation and moving obstacles. The quadrotors’ position and attitude models are subjected to unknown external disturbances. This study has two main contributions. First, we develop filter-based distributed desired profiles and extended state observers (ESOs) for state-transformed nonlinear quadrotors to achieve time-varying formation tracking without requiring the velocity and acceleration information of the leader, followers, and moving obstacles. This achievement holds even in the presence of input saturation. Second, the proposed approach guarantees collision avoidance with moving obstacles, including adjacent quadrotors and unknown objects, by using only the relative distance from the obstacle, irrespective of external disturbances. This is accomplished by designing error functions for avoiding moving obstacles and including auxiliary signals in the formation tracker design. Based on the distributed profiles and the signals estimated using the ESOs, we design a collision-free time-varying formation tracker. The Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to prove that all signals of the proposed closed-loop formation tracking system are bounded, and the tracking errors converge to an adjustable bound that includes the origin. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In order to circumvent such a serious challenge, by taking the samples during previous and current time periods as the source and target domains respectively and then using the proposed transfer learning strategy, the fast parametric and/or structural transfer LI-ESNs (i.e., PT-LI-ESN and PST-LI-ESN) are proposed in this study to keep LI-ESN’s reservoir capacity and fast training, and simultaneously enhance its accuracy for insufficient target domain. In particular, except for its dynamically increasing reservoir size in one-by-one way so as to improve its accuracy, PST-LI-ESN still features fast training without any successive calculation of the inverse matrices during transfer learning. Experimental results on a heap of datasets from three benchmark sources indicate the effectiveness of the proposed PT-LI-ESN and PST-LI-ESN as well.},

To this end, we propose a multiagent deterministic policy gradient (MADPG) method based on actor–critic (AC) networks to minimize the local cost ( $Q$ -function) by introducing the policy gradient technique, and its convergence and optimality are proven as well. In particular, we develop an optimized prioritized experience replay (PER) strategy that allows high-value samples to be selected with a higher probability, which enhance networks’ data utilization.

To solve this problem, a robust multimodal multiobjective particle swarm optimization (RMMPSO) is designed to alleviate slow convergence. There are three novelties in RMMPSO. First, a perturbation observer is proposed to detect perturbation in the fixed point of variance to evaluate the influences of disturbed recording position on convergence. Second, an adaptive adjustment mechanism, based on the perturbation observer, is designed to obtain reasonable search ranges and suppress the abnormal changes in convergence, so as to improve convergence performance. Third, a Lipschitz-based exploitation strategy is designed to search for reliable solutions, which reduces the optimal offset caused by uncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of RMMPSO is demonstrated in terms of multiobjective multimodal benchmark problems with uncertain components and wastewater treatment simulation platform. The results of experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMMPSO in solving data-driven MMOPs compared to state-of-the-art multimodal multiobjective algorithms.},

The MDM framework is incorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized stochastic search without communication for detecting and confirming stationary targets (fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely unknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a self-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate the search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of “which-sensor-to-use,” “when-to-switch-sensor,” and “how-to-search.” Based on the information gathered by sensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different levels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching, where the lower levels of search aim to localize a target (detection) and the highest level of a search exploit a target (confirmation). The performance of the MDM framework with two sensors having a low accuracy for detection and increased accuracy to confirm targets is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with six decentralized multi-UAV search algorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive-based searches). The results indicate that the MDM framework can efficiently detect and confirm targets in an unknown environment.},

By integrating a piecewise continuous function into each virtual control, the novel control signal can effectively avoid the singularity problem inherent in finite-time and fixed-time work. Compared with the previous constrained papers, we reconstruct the nonlinear MASs by introducing boundary performance functions into the NM method to release the initial-value conditions. Then, a command-filtered technique is provided to tackle the issue of the “explosion of complexity” stemming from iterative differentiation regarding the virtual controls, while a twice-transformation design technique is used to compensate for the filtered error. The adaptive controllers utilizing radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) can effectively address the effects of the unknown control gains and system uncertainties. The explored control strategies ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system converge into a compact set near zero within a practical finite/fixed time without violating the imposed constraints. Ultimately, the simulation outcomes on robotic systems illustrate the availability of the designed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {For consensus, one issue is that its various variants, such as group consensus, scaled consensus, and bipartite consensus, ought to be proposed as the expansion of research and applications. Another issue is that consensus should carry certain performance specifications, to meet some crucial demands, such as rapidity and safety. In this article, we investigate an integrated consensus (i.e., scaled plus bipartite consensus) with a prescribed convergence rate, for a class of uncertain nonlinear MASs. A funnel-based adaptive scheme is proposed for the scaled bipartite consensus. Specifically, a time-varying function is preselected to characterize the prescribed convergence rate. Utilizing this time-varying function and the relative states defined in the sense of the scaled bipartite consensus, a fully distributed protocol is designed. Therein, the funnel gains are critical ingredients to ensure the prescribed performance, since they would increase the control signal to be sufficiently large once the relative states approach the performance boundary. Particularly, the selected time-varying design function is added to act as a part of the control gain in the protocol, which is critical to forcing the ultimate convergence (to zero) of relative states. The proposed protocol is verified by a simulation example.},

The security of a control system is the ability to avoid intentional sabotage or accidental interference affecting its normal operation. For switched LPV systems, it contains both internal (scheduling variable and switching signal) and external (system output) information that needs to be protected, we adopt differential privacy to achieve its full privacy preserving. The resulting challenges are: 1) privacy design for three types of system signals and 2) dual asynchronization analysis under triple privacy noise.

Then, a defending resource allocation scheme is developed based on a two-stage Stackelberg game in order to optimize the overall defense capability of the CCSs with limited defending resource. In this two-stage Stackelberg game, the defender of the CCSs acts first and allocates the defending resource to secure the measurements of wireless sensors. With the knowledge of the defender’s strategy, the attacker then decides which target nodes to launch attacks on. The optimal resource allocation strategy is then designed in the sense of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, the defense problem under different attacking resource constraints is investigated.

  abstract     = {Model-based control plays an important role in batch process control. With more data collected online, real-time model updates using Gaussian process regression (GPR) are becoming increasingly practical for improving the performance of model-based control strategies. However, in batch processes, process configurations are often adjusted, which can be costly if a new model has to be identified from scratch each time. Although several GPR migration methods exist, they are primarily designed for static models and are not well-suited for dynamic system modeling for control purposes. Therefore, we propose a selective migration-based online GPR identification method that enables the dynamic model for batch process control to learn selectively from the previously identified old process model as needed. In our method, we present selective migration strategies for two types of GPR model parameters: 1) hyperparameters and 2) data points. Additionally, we provide a complete algorithm for online dynamic model identification. Beyond that, for data point parameters selective migration, we propose a fast migration dataset-seeking method for a smaller computational cost and a mixed integer programming migration dataset-seeking method for a smaller prediction loss. Theoretical analysis of the framework reveals the initial improvement and final convergence. Finally, we provide two illustrative numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promising capabilities for extracting informative and discriminative features from electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, several studies have reported that the feature selection process followed by feature extraction can be beneficial to achieve further performance improvement. Even though a recent work achieved promising results by using the single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to select task-relevant features in the temporal domain, it still failed to consider other significant features in the spatial-spectral domain. To overcome such limitations, we propose a cooperative multiagent RL-based framework (MARS) that performs feature selection in both the spatial–spectral and temporal domains simultaneously for a motor imagery (MI)-EEG classification task. In this framework, we enable our RL agents to collaborate with each other as a team to solve a complex multiobjective feature selection problem. Furthermore, we adopt a counterfactual advantage function to overcome the free-rider problem, which is associated with the credit assignment issue in multiagent cases. To assess the MARS framework, we conduct extensive experiments with two public MI datasets under subject-dependent and subject-independent scenarios and we apply the MARS to different backbone networks. The experimental results demonstrate that our MARS outperforms other competing methods in terms of mean accuracy and achieves statistically significant improvements.},

  abstract     = {Currently, an interval prediction model, lower and upper bounds estimation (LUBE) which constructs the prediction intervals (PIs) by using the double outputs of the neural network (NN) is growing popular. However, existing LUBE researches have two problems. One is that the applied NNs are flawed: feedforward NN (FNN) cannot map the dynamic relationship of data and recurrent NN (RNN) is computationally expensive. The other is that most LUBE models are built under a single-objective frame in which the uncertainty cannot be fully quantified. In this article, a novel wavelet NN (WNN) with direct input–output links (DLWNN) is proposed to obtain PIs in a multiobjective LUBE frame. Different from WNN, the proposed DLWNN adds the direct links from the input layer to output layer which can make full use of the information of time series data. Besides, a niched differential evolution nondominated fast sort genetic algorithm (NDENSGA) is proposed to optimize the prediction model, so as to achieve a balance between estimation accuracy and the average width of the PIs. NDENSGA modifies the traditional population renewal mechanism to increase population diversity and adopts a new elite selection strategy for obtaining more extensive and uniform solutions. The effectiveness of DLWNN and NDENSGA is evaluated through a series of experiments with real electricity load data sets. The results show that the proposed model has better performance than others in terms of convergence and diversity of obtained nondominated solutions.},

The transmission priority is determined in a dynamical way depending on the importance of missions. The aim of this article is to construct an optimal distributed Tobit Kalman filter (TKF) such that filter parameters are rigorously determined in the minimum mean squared error sense under the consideration of the bias, censoring and WTODP effects. Specifically, sparsity of the network topology is comprehensively considered by using the novel matrix simplification technique.

In this article, we present a novel adaptive control solution that allows the performance uniformness (with respect to the initial condition) and the transient behavior (with respect to error overshoot) to be addressed simultaneously under a unified framework. The key design steps and features include: 1) by constructing a nonlinear transformation based on the time-varying scaling function, the developed performance boundary is uniform to any initial condition; 2) the demanding condition on the initial values of full-state errors in the existing prescribed performance works is removed, allowing the designer more freedom to select design parameters and rendering the solution more user-friendly and less demanding in design and implementation; and 3) by making use of the minimum eigenvalues of the resultant diagonal matrix and imposing a critical negative feedback term in the control design, the stability of closed-loop system is ensured by the developed uniform control strategy.

  abstract     = {The security problem for a kind of switched nonlinear systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is addressed here with a novel event-triggered neural network (NN) adaptive control technique. The provided event-triggered control algorithm, compared to the current output feedback control schemes on continuous-time systems, not only conserves communication resources but also defends against DoS attacks throughout the system stabilization process. First, a novel adaptive NN switching observer is proposed by examining the stability of each subsystem in the sleep and active intervals of the attack, which makes the standard backstepping controller workable even in the DoS attacks scenario. Further, an event-triggered secure control strategy is established by creating a common coordinate transformation, which ensures the bound of all the signals in the resultant system under arbitrary switching and prevents the occurrence of Zeno behavior. A first-order filter is developed to fix the complexity explosion problem in backstepping design. Finally, a continuous stirred tank reactor example is presented to support the established method.},

  abstract     = {Due to limitations in large-area communication and computation, it can be challenging to apply centralized diagnosis and optimization control design approaches to cascaded systems. This work proposes a distributed diagnosis and optimization control approach, which is realized using data-driven techniques. Specifically, an adaptive observer-based subdiagnosis system design approach is proposed for cascaded systems using only the local input/output (I/O) data and the state estimations of adjacent subsystems. The state estimations from neighboring subsystems are treated as known inputs in the local subsystem. In the centralized design approach, the residual signals generated by all subsystem observers need to be sent to the central computing node to reconstruct controller parameters. The learning process of the local optimization controller only needs to be driven by the residual signals from local and adjacent subsystems, avoiding centralized calculation and reducing the computational burden of the central node. The learning process of the locally optimal controller only needs to be driven by residual signals from the local and neighboring subsystems. In the end, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed approach.},

The ETDAT algorithms aim to build control laws for heterogeneous agents to follow the average states of multiple time-varying input signals in event-triggered communication networks. The uncertain dynamics of agents and the event-triggered communication mechanisms make the design of distributed average tracking (DAT) protocols difficult. To achieve ETDAT for heterogeneous MASs with uncertain dynamics, we designed two kinds of ETDAT protocols. First, on the basis of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) technology and sampling measurements, we present a class of static-gain ETDAT algorithms. In comparison to conventional DAT, the proposed ETDAT algorithms not only solve the DAT problem of heterogeneous MASs but also greatly reduce the cost of network communication. Second, dynamic-gain ETDAT algorithms based on self-adaptive principles are presented to minimize network global information needs. The above two algorithms adopt boundary layer approximation methods and dynamic event-triggered strategies, which can further reduce the chattering phenomenon and event-triggered frequency.

The proposed strategy employs a special nondeterministic finite automaton, namely, a simplified verifier, obtained from the original LPN and a particular set of labels. Since we only need to silence sensors of some particular transitions rather than add or replace new sensors to transitions, it is more computationally efficient compared with other documented methods in the literature. In addition, we formulate and solve an integer linear programming problem to optimize a set of given mask labeling functions. Finally, an algorithm is constructed to calculate the minimum value of $K$ for a $K$ -diagnosable system with multiple faults under the mask labeling function.

Considering the data discarding problem of the WTOD protocol, a novel event-triggered compensation mechanism is proposed to compensate the measurement output processed by the WTOD protocol, thereby improving the filtering performance. Next, considering the nonlinear dynamics of the system and the unknown-but-bounded (UBB) noise interference, an NN-based set-membership filter is designed to solve the state estimation problem. In a unified set-membership framework, an neural-network (NN) weight adaptive tuning law and a state estimation algorithm are designed. Sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the adaptive NN parameters and the NN-based set-membership filter, and two optimization problems are put forward to seek the optimal NN parameters and filtering parameters that make the filter performance optimal. Finally, illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation mechanism and filtering algorithm.},

Different from the existing methods which always require the constraint boundaries to be continuous functions, the state constraints considered in this article are discontinuous (i.e., the state constraints occur only in some time periods and not in others), which can be found in many practical systems. By designing a novel stretch model-based nonlinear mapping function (NMF), the state constraints are dealt with directly, and the limitations that the virtual control function depends upon the feasibility condition (FC) and the tracking error depends upon the constraint boundaries in the conventional schemes are removed. Meanwhile, the proposed method is a unified one, which is also effective for HONSs with conventional continuous state constraints/ deferred state constraints/ funnel constraints or constraints-free without altering the control structure. Furthermore, by designing a newly time-varying scaling transformation function (STF), a more relaxed criterion for practical prescribed-time stable (PPTS) is given, based on which a newly PPTC algorithm is designed. The result shows that the proposed algorithm can preset the upper bound of the settling time, which does not depend upon the initial state of the system and control parameters, the limitations of singularity problem and excessive initial control input in existing methods are removed. Simulation examples verify the algorithm developed.},

  abstract     = {Steiner minimum tree (SMT) is an optimized model for solving the routing problem of a multipin net in very large-scale integrated circuits. As the appearance of various obstacles on chips, the obstacle-avoiding problem has attracted much attention in recent years. Meanwhile, since interconnect delay plays a major role in chip delay, timing analysis is another critical problem worthy of consideration when constructing an SMT. Furthermore, the introduction of the $\boldsymbol {X}$ -architecture allows for better utilization of routing resources. In this article, a timing-driven obstacle-avoiding X-architecture Steiner minimum tree algorithm with slack constraints (TD-OAXSMT-SC) is proposed to consider obstacle-avoiding, timing slack constraints, and $\boldsymbol {X}$ -architecture simultaneously for the first time. The TD-OAXSMT-SC algorithm consists of four major stages: 1) in the routing tree initialization stage, this article constructs an $\boldsymbol {X}$ -architecture Prim–Dijkstra spanning tree as the initial routing tree with minimum total delay; 2) in the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based routing tree iteration stage, a novel discrete PSO algorithm based on genetic operators is proposed to obtain a high-quality routing tree; 3) in the routing tree standardization stage, two effective standardization strategies are proposed to obtain a routing tree that satisfies both obstacle-avoiding and timing slack constraints; and 4) in the routing tree optimization stage, the connection of interconnected wires is optimized in a global manner, thus obtaining an optimized routing tree. Experimental results show that the proposed TD-OAXSMT-SC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in routing quality with slack constraints.},

A novel asynchronous filter is formulated under the constraint of saturation with the hope to improve filtering performance.

We generalize the concept of RTs and propose a new class of RTs, which are referred to as cost-limited one. In particular, a performance index can be specified for the system, and A set of initial states of the system’s evolutions that can reach the target set before the performance index grows to a given allowable cost is referred to as a cost-limited RT (CRT). Such an RT can be obtained by specifying the corresponding running cost function for the HJ equation. Different nonzero sub-LSs of the viscosity solution of the HJ equation at a certain time point can be used to characterize the CRTs with different allowable costs (or the RTs with different time horizons), thus reducing the storage space consumption.

  abstract     = {This article proposes the multiswarm cooperative information-driven search and divide and conquer mitigation control (MSCIDC) approach for faster detection and mitigation of forest fires by reducing the loss of biodiversity, nutrients, soil moisture, and other intangible benefits. A swarm is a cooperative group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying together to search and quench the fire areas effectively. The multiswarm cooperative information-driven search uses a two-stage search comprising cooperative information-driven exploration and exploitation for quick/accurate detection of fire locations. The search level is selected based on the thermal sensor information about the potential fire area. The dynamic nature of swarms acquired from global regulative repulsion and merging between swarms reduces the detection and mitigation time compared to the existing methods. The local attraction among the swarm members helps the nondetector members reach the fire location faster, and divide-and-conquer mitigation control ensures a nonoverlapping fire sector allocation for all members quenching the fire. The performance of the MSCIDC has been compared with different multi- UAV methods using a simulated pine forest environment. The Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that the MSCIDC reduces the average forest area burnt by 65% and mission time by 60% compared to the best case of the multi- UAV approaches, guaranteeing a faster and more successful mission.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting pedestrian trajectories in dynamic scenes remains a critical problem in various applications, such as autonomous driving and socially aware robots. Such forecasting is challenging due to human-human and human-object interactions and future uncertainties caused by human randomness. Generative model-based methods handle future uncertainties by sampling a latent variable. However, few studies explored the generation of the latent variable. In this work, we propose the trajectory predictor with pseudo Oracle (TPPO), which is a generative model-based trajectory predictor. The first pseudo oracle is pedestrians’ moving directions, and the second one is the latent variable estimated from ground truth trajectories. A social attention module is used to aggregate neighbors’ interactions based on the correlation between pedestrians’ moving directions and future trajectories. This correlation is inspired by the fact that pedestrians’ future trajectories are often influenced by pedestrians in front. A latent variable predictor is proposed to estimate latent variable distributions from observed and ground-truth trajectories. Moreover, the gap between these two distributions is minimized during training. Therefore, the latent variable predictor can estimate the latent variable from observed trajectories to approximate that estimated from ground-truth trajectories. We compare the performance of TPPO with related methods on several public datasets. Results demonstrate that TPPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods with low average and final displacement errors. The ablation study shows that the prediction performance will not dramatically decrease as sampling times decline during tests.},

By modeling the uncertainties from system parameters and disturbances with multiple probabilistic intervals whose probabilities sum to 1, multiple corresponding probabilistic intervals of control responses are approximately estimated through the system dynamics as the uncertainty propagation bridge. This not only mitigates the need for large sample data required by probabilistic methods for robust control, but also avoids the large error caused by the first-order Taylor expansion required by nonprobabilistic methods in the case of large radiuses of uncertain parameters. Considering the different characteristics of transient and steady-state phases, a prescribed performance threshold function is established for the concerned control response. Based on probabilistic intervals and threshold, the failure rate model and reliability model for the concerned control response are formulated. Further, an optimization problem for the reliable state feedback control with the terminal reliability constraint is formulated and solved by the simulated annealing algorithm. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the reliable state feedback control.},

  abstract     = {Stacking pseudoinverse learner (SP) is an ensemble learning technology, and its generalization performance greatly affects the effect of image classification. Currently, most SPs randomly initialize the input weight matrix in a random subspace without limiting the random initial values, resulting in unstable training results and a decrease in generalization performance; in addition, training all samples at once may cause the classifier redundant and also affect the generalization performance of the model. To efficiently address the above issues, we propose a new framework called progressive stacking pseudoinverse learner (PSP), which aims to enhance the generalization performance of SP via active learning (AL) in random subspaces. Specifically, on the one hand, a random feature SP (RFSP) model is proposed, which constrains the random subspace by initializing the input weight matrix into different random specific distributions to improve the generalization performance of SP. On the other hand, an AL progressive (ALP) model based on RFSP is proposed. By iteratively selecting useful samples to optimize the classification results, the training sample information is effectively used to progressively enhance the generalization performance of the model. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our proposed PSP algorithm achieves better performance in accuracy, precision, recall, and $F1$ score, and the results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used to learn high-quality representations (a.k.a. embeddings) from multiorder neighbors in recommendation tasks. However, many existing GCN-based methods learn user and item embeddings in the user–item interaction bipartite graph indistinguishably, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of the bipartite graph, i.e., users and items are two distinct types of entities. This article explores in depth the high-order connections for user and his (her) neighbor items. We propose an innovative model, neighbor item embedding-aware graph convolutional network (NIE-GCN). As opposed to previous GCN-based approaches, NIE-GCN employs a novel dual user aggregation (DUA) scheme and a neighbor-aware attention mechanism to construct user embeddings and distinguish the contribution of different neighbor nodes. In addition, we propagate information in an alternating manner to eliminate the effects of heterogeneity of user–item interaction bipartite graph. According to detailed experiments on three large-scale datasets, the proposed NIE-GCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the Top- $N$ recommendation task while reducing model parameters by about half. Further analyses show the effectiveness and rationality of DUA and neighbor-aware attention mechanism.},

In practice, due to the short of the important data, traditional detection models often fail to achieve good detection results. Therefore, this article proposes a novel pipeline attention integrating the long short-term memory (LSTM) to detect the leakage. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method divides the water supply network into several regions according to the leakage characteristics of pipelines. Then, the LSTM extracts dynamic time-varying hydraulic features of pipelines, and the pipeline attention extracts the dynamically changing features between pipelines. Finally, the Attention- LSTM model is used to detect the leak region of urban water supply systems. Compared with multilayer perceptron classifier, $K$ neighbors classifier, decision tree classifier, support vector machine classifier, multiscale fully convolutional network, one-dimensional multichannel convolution neural network, and variational autoencoder, the F1-Score of the Attention- LSTM is greatly improved, which are 116%, 120%, 254%, 180%, 21%, 26%, and 27%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed model can accurately detect the leakage of water supply network and effectively reduce the waste of resources.},

Therefore, it reduces the additional hyperparameter tuning work caused by the change in the structure of the algorithm.

To make the trained trajectories adapt to continuous and time-varying traffic flow, an online decision-making algorithm based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is presented to derive a time-optimal vehicle passing sequence, where a tree structure is built to efficiently express all possible cluster-dividing modes between vehicles. In addition, we propose a trajectory planning algorithm to regulate velocities of vehicles in the cooperative control area surrounding the intersection.

Besides, the unknown delayed input is handled skillfully by the union of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and proof by contradiction at the final step. Furthermore, the designed controller is simple in structure and inexpensive in calculation since it does not involve any approximation tools/estimation techniques and avoids iterative computation in backstepping-like methods. It is shown that all internal signals are globally ultimately uniformly bounded, and the tracking/virtual error converges to a preassigned arbitrarily small region at a certain predefined rate.

This article presents a comprehensive method of modeling and analyzing the longwall process in underground mining based on event data using process mining (PM4LMP). The method comprises four basic steps: 1) data gathering; 2) data preprocessing; 3) creation of event logs; and 4) PM tasks. In our method, we proposed, among all, case ID identification based on heuristics using context data and activity identification with supervised and unsupervised approaches, which provide complementary information about process execution. The method assumes an in-depth analysis of processes based on sensor data and knowledge gathered in IT systems, which can significantly improve the quality of information at managers’ disposal when making decisions regarding the mining process.},

The flexible beam causes significant vibration, which leads to user discomfort. This article proposes a solution to suppress the vibration by designing a performance constraint boundary to limit the vibration amplitude of the flexible beam in terms of transient and steady-state performance. The system model with uncertainties is approximated using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. Fixed-time methods are employed to further reduce vibration and enhance convergence rate. To minimize communication load, an event-triggered mechanism is integrated into the controller design. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through simulation tests and real-world experiments conducted using the Quanser smart structure.},

Then, by the proposed control protocol and inequality, two criteria for the consensus of the second-order delayed multiagent systems and its optimality under input saturation are derived successively.

First, the consensus-based static batch optimization and secure observer design problems are established, based on which the concepts of sparsity repairability and restricted eigenvalues under attacks are discussed.

First, to reduce the unnecessary network resources consumption, an adaptive dynamic event trigger (DET) strategy is introduced and is rigorously proven to be free of the Zeno behavior. Besides, an output-based state observer is designed to obtain the unmeasured system states. Furthermore, the fully distributed control scheme is developed, namely, only the neighboring information of agents is used to design the controller, the observer, and the event-triggered mechanism. By constructing a new Lyapunov function, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the $H_{\infty }$ containment control performance of MASs. Finally, a practical physical example is used to demonstrate that the designed control strategy can accomplish the containment control task and ensure the desired $H_{\infty }$ containment control performance simultaneously.},

The positive tension distribution (PTD) in CDPR is generally guaranteed using optimization-based methods, limiting their real-time applications due to the unpredictable worst-case computation time of such methods. In this study, we consider the PTD to be an integral part of the control system and introduce a computationally efficient control-based approach for generating positive tensions. This innovative approach offers several benefits for controlling redundant CDPRs. It significantly improves computation time compared to existing iterative methods, eliminates high sensitivity to kinematic uncertainties, and enhances trajectory tracking performance. Additionally, the proposed method keeps the robot on the boundary of the workspace when the trajectory exits the wrench-feasible workspace. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of CDPR dynamics as a nonaffine form, considering the tension of the cables as state variables. A robust unilateral constrained control structure is proposed using a third-order model, ensuring control efforts remain within a prescribed positive range. The computational efficiency of the method is investigated in a hyper-redundant CDPR and is compared with the conventional methods. It is also shown that for the desired trajectory out of the workspace, the proposed method keeps the robot at the boundary of the workspace while maintaining positive tensions.},

The primary objective of this article is to design a privacy-preserving accelerated consensus scheme to achieve a balance between supply and demand at the globally minimized cost while preserving the initial local demand information. By virtue of rigorous algebra manipulation and mathematical induction, a unified framework is established under which the convergence, the optimal convergence rate, and the optimality of the proposed DED algorithm are simultaneously analyzed, and the main results are extended to satisfy the privacy-preserving needs. Furthermore, the proposed privacy-preserving DED algorithm is shown to be resilient against both internal (honest-but-curious) and external eavesdroppers.

Although various linguistic additive consistency measurements have been proposed in the literature, the existing additive consistency measurements are usually directly proposed without a general definition with axiomatic design, and thus there is a lack of axiomatic comparisons among them. Moreover, the existing additive consistency measurements seldom consider the general case of personalized individual semantics (PIS) where a word has different numerical meanings to different people. In this study, we aim to develop a comparative study for the linguistic additive consistency measurements in the PIS context from an axiomatic perspective. Specifically, we first revisit the most widely used additive consistency measurements of simple linguistic preference relations (SLPRs) and hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) in the PIS context. Next, we present several rational axioms that the additive consistency measurements with PIS in SLPRs and HFLPRs should satisfy. Finally, we compare these additive consistency measurements by verifying the satisfaction of the proposed axioms. The results in this article show that the existing linguistic additive consistency measurements behave differently from the axiomatic perspective: they perform well in SLPRs but cannot satisfy all axioms in HFLPRs.},

In this study, we propose a dense hybrid attention (DHA) network for palmprint image super-resolution (SR) by recovering the clear palmprint-specific characteristics. The proposed DHA network first obtains the high-dimensional shallow representation via a single convolution layer, and then jointly learns the local and global palmprint-specific features via parallel convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based branches. Particularly, we develop two enhanced spatial and channel attention (CA) modules to adaptively emphasize the local position-specific characteristics of palmprints, such that the SR palmprint images can be well recovered with clear texture and edge characteristics. Experimental results on three publicly used palmprint databases clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed method for palmprint image SR.},

  abstract     = {Multitype satellite observation, including optical observation satellites, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, and electromagnetic satellites, has become an important direction in integrated satellite applications due to its ability to cope with various complex situations. In the multitype satellite observation scheduling problem (MTSOSP), the constraints involved in different types of satellites make the problem challenging. This article proposes a mixed-integer programming model and a generalized profit representation method in the model to effectively cope with the situation of multiple types of satellite observations. To obtain a suitable observation plan, a deep reinforcement learning-based genetic algorithm (DRL-GA) is proposed by combining the learning method and genetic algorithm. The DRL-GA adopts a solution generation method to obtain the initial population and assist with local search. In this method, a set of statistical indicators that consider resource utilization and task arrangement performance are regarded as states. By using deep neural networks to estimate the $Q$ value of each action, this method can determine the preferred order of task scheduling. An individual update strategy and an elite strategy are used to enhance the search performance of DRL-GA. Simulation results verify that DRL-GA can effectively solve the MTSOSP and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in several aspects. This work reveals the advantages of the proposed generalized model and scheduling method, which exhibit good scalability for various types of observation satellite scheduling problems.},

The purpose is to establish less conservative stability conditions for delayed neural networks. In order to achieve this goal, a time-varying Lyapunov functional method is proposed for stability analysis of delayed neural networks. The main feature of this method is to construct different Lyapunov functionals in different time-varying delay subintervals, which relaxes the restriction requirement of traditional Lyapunov functionals constructing a common Lyapunov functional in the whole delay interval. Based on the developed time-varying Lyapunov functional, some new stability conditions for delayed neural networks are obtained. Finally, two examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the derived stability conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a model-free optimal solution is proposed for the containment control problem of fully heterogeneous discrete-time multiagent systems, in which both leaders and followers have heterogeneous dynamics. In order to make followers converge to the convex combination of leaders predefined by the users using only the collected data, a distributed control framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) for completely heterogeneous multiagent systems is developed. On the basis of the difference between follower states and target states, a local discounted performance function without considering the input index is designed for each agent to obtain the local optimal controller. The advantage of the designed performance function is that the relationship between the gain matrix of the local optimal controller and the solution of the regulation equation can be established, thus avoiding the need to solve the output regulation equation explicitly. A model-free distributed adaptive observer is designed for each follower to replace the leaders’ states in optimal controller without the need to know the dynamics of leaders. Combining the optimal controller, model-free adaptive observer, and RL, the data-based optimal containment control algorithm for fully heterogeneous multiagent systems is designed and employed. Finally, numerical simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems (ICSs) are designed to operate for extended periods of time and can withstand extreme conditions. However, operators, engineers, and offices change over time, which can lead to outdated documentation and references. This can make it difficult to identify system components and their vulnerabilities, which can pose a security risk. In this article, we present an automated passive method for identifying system components based on network traffic structure and network message characteristics. The proposed approach considers both TCP/IP and Modbus, the two primary communication protocols in SCADA, to identify devices. The algorithm was implemented in Python and evaluated using water treatment SCADA data collected from the iTrust facility. Once the system devices have been identified, the algorithm queries the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases to identify each device’s known vulnerabilities. Using our research on automated attack graph generation and visualization (A2G2V) and strongly connected component induced min label cut (SCCiMLC), we can map device vulnerabilities to system-level attack graphs and identify the bare minimum of device vulnerabilities to mitigate in order to secure the entire system. The proposed technique has been demonstrated to be beneficial in identifying system components in SCADA and ICS systems to increase their security.},

A sufficient condition for mean-square input-to-state stability of the feedback control system is proposed utilizing a Lyapunov-type function dependent on both the mode and exponential decay rate, the S-procedure, as well as several stochastic analysis tools. Then, a two-stage approach, with which the required controller and observer gains and dynamic scaling factors can be determined successively, is developed. The scaling factors are constructed as piecewise functions, excluding the possibility of singularities involved in previous dynamic quantized control approaches. Under the zero initial condition, a greedy backtracking suboptimization algorithm is further put forward, offering an estimate of the minimum permissible upper bound of the mean-square closed-loop state for a bounded disturbance input, given a fixed exponential decay rate. Finally, a vertical lift aircraft model is applied to validate the proposed quantized observer-based control approach and suboptimization algorithm.},

Generally, full-state temperature measurement is required to achieve fault localization, which is impossible in applications. However, with the help of interpolation-based approximation, the required number of sensors decreases from infinity to only a few, which guarantees the usability of FLF. A comprehensive methodology framework, including the FLF design, residual evaluation in a distributed manner, and threshold computation, is introduced to guarantee reliable and robust performance in a real-time pattern.

Specifically, this work first gives a novel prediction mechanism that integrates wavelet decomposition, Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to realize workload prediction in each time interval. The time series of the workload is smoothed with an SG filter and further divided into several components with wavelet decomposition.

Under the backstepping and prescribed performance control (PPC) framework, a distributed event-trigger condition and an FT dynamic surface control (DSC) scheme are developed under directed topology.

Throughout the control process, the S2S communication is updated following the event-triggered mechanism; meanwhile, the data transmission is fully distributed, namely, no global information can be transmitted.

To this end, by making full use of the historical and current data, the data-training-based (DTB) observer is designed to obtain the interaction force at the side of the slave robot and then assist the human operator to choose a proper control mode. The presented architecture is hierarchically designed for data collection, data processing and physical regulation, involving the DTB observer and the fully distributed event-based (FDEB) estimator in a unified framework.

Meanwhile, it is independent of the graph’s scale and does not rely on any global information. Then, instead of the backstepping method and based on the constructed compensator, an output-dependent dynamic gain method is used to design the FD output feedback protocol avoiding the repeated derivatives of the nonlinearities. Based on a new lemma, it is proved that using the proposed FD protocol, global full states consensus stability can be guaranteed and the consensus error can converge to zero asymptotically. The proposed method can not only achieve the consensus in FD fashion but also extremely relax the conditions on nonlinearities which satisfy the local Lipschitz condition with a more general incremental rate containing output and compensator states information.

However, the use of multiple CHTs might cause more resource overhead. How to make reasonable resource allocation and cooperation among different CHTs is the issue that requires much more attention to improve the effectiveness of the ensemble of CHTs. Based on this consideration, we tried to handle the issue with adaptive resource allocation and population co-evolution for competition and cooperation among different CHTs. First, the competitive and cooperative evolutionary framework (CCEF) was proposed to construct multiple populations for CHTs. It assigns separate populations to each CHT and performs resource allocation based on success history records calculated by the performance of each CHT population. In addition, it promotes population co-evolution through parent recombination and offspring diffusion. Second, four CHTs with different types were chosen to compose a technique pool for the implementation of CCEF. Third, to obtain stronger search ability, we designed a heuristic and historical-based differential evolutionary operator (EO) embedded into CCEF. Experimental results on five COP benchmark suites (116 COPs in total) and 33 real-world COPs demonstrated that the proposed CCEF outperforms other advanced algorithms. The results revealed that CCEF can absorb the advantages of different CHTs and appropriately allocate resources to the more suitable CHTs.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this article is to develop an interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy controller scheme for analyzing the stability properties of nonlinear permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind turbine system (WTS) under external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. More specifically, an IT-2 fuzzy nonfragile sampled-data controller (FNSDC) scheme is presented to reduce the impact of controller uncertainties and save information processing resources. First, the dynamics of PMSG-based WTS are represented by an IT-2 fuzzy modeling technique due to the nonlinearities in the proposed wind turbine model. Second, a new Auxiliary Polynomial-Based Integral Inequality (APBII) is introduced to estimate the quadratic integral terms involving the sampling-related information. Also, a relaxed APBII (RAPBII) is proposed as a special case of APBII to provide extra flexibility. Meanwhile, a novel double-sided looped Lyapunov functional (DSLLF) is constructed to reduce model conservatism, which utilizes the full advantage of actual sampling pattern characteristics. The main challenge of the study is how to design the FNSDC to guarantee the asymptotic stability conditions under the maximal sampling-data period for the addressed WTS in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. For this purpose, by combing the DSLLF with the proposed integral inequalities, some less conservative sufficient criteria are derived in the context of the linear matrix inequalitys (LMIs) frameworks, and simultaneously, disturbance reduction is confirmed via an $H_{\infty }$ control theory. Finally, to prove the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed theoretical observations, the numerical simulations of PMGS-based WTS are validated numerically by considering the experimental range of parameter values. And then, a comparative example is also given to emphasize the superiority and relevance of the proposed method. In addition to comparing with the existing literature, a maximal sampling-data period can be able to attain by this method.},

  abstract     = {The output consensus or tracking problem for heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) under jointly observable condition (JOC) is investigated in the presence of unknown system matrix of the leader and unknown faults on communication link and actuator. Unlike the recent works, where neighbors of the leader have access to the state information of the leader, only part output information of the leader can be measured by its neighbors under JOC in this article. In addition, the system matrix of the leader only is known to neighbors of the leader. The problem of unknown leader’s state and unknown leader’s system matrix, unknown communication link faults (CLFs) is transformed into constructing the fully distributed state and system matrix observers by virtue of adaptive control technique and JOC. In light of the developed distributed observer, a distributed adaptive fault-tolerant controller against actuator faults is designed. Here, compared with the existing ideas, actuator faults of an agent will not affect the dynamics of its neighbors over the communication graph in this article. It is shown that the output of each follower asymptotically converges to the output of the leader. Finally, the developed control scheme is illustrated by a simulation example.},

This article is devoted to active FTC (AFTC) for full-state-constrained nonlinear systems with unknown mismatched disturbances and actuator IFs. By integrating fault diagnosis and controller design, a novel fault-diagnosis-based FTC strategy is proposed to compensate for the IF, and a sufficient condition is established for the fault detectability of the proposed scheme. Besides, the fault detection delay and estimation error, considered new external disturbances, are compensated adaptively along with the mismatched disturbances. The fault-tolerant controller is designed to guarantee that all signals in the system are bounded and the tracking error converges into a small neighborhood near the origin in finite time, without violating the predefined asymmetric time-varying constraints of the states. A numerical simulation example and an application to the active steering system (ASS) of vehicle chassis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed AFTC strategy.},

At the same time, distinct from the extant control studies for uncertain CPSs subject to malicious attacks which could only ensure the infinite-time or finite-time system performance, the presented control strategy owns the ability to assure the fixed-time system performance. Moreover, it has been theoretically substantiated that the developed control method can ensure that the output tracking error converges to a predefined slim region of the equilibrium point in fixed time, where both the regulation time and tracking precision degree are known beforehand and could be preconfigured by selecting the relative control design parameters suitably.

However, real-world demands, including enhanced safety performance, introduce considerable challenges to the present design of optimal controllers rooted in RL algorithms. A novel approach is introduced in this article for designing RL-based optimal controllers, employing a control barrier function (CBF) alongside a nonquadratic loss function related to the control signal. The aim is to enable the agent to learn the optimal controller in a secure and efficient manner. To tackle the instability issue in neural network training inherent to traditional RL-based controller design processes, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) technique is employed for initializing the controller network’s weights. A formal demonstration of the method’s optimality is presented. Numerical simulations validate the proposed approach, illustrating its capacity to effectively learn the optimal controller while adhering to the input and state constraints of the system.},

To accomplish this, first, a new fragmentation-based integral inequality (FBII) is proposed with a more accurate estimation. Additionally, considering a fractional coefficient within the range of $0 &amp;lt; \delta &amp;lt; 1$ , the sampling intervals are divided into four distinct nonuniform segments. These segments encompass the complete sampling details of the intervals: $[\xi _{\iota }, \xi _{\iota } + \delta \nu _{1}(\xi))$ , $[\xi _{\iota } + \delta \nu _{1}(\xi), \xi)$ , $[\xi, \xi + \delta \nu _{1}(\xi))$ , and $[\xi + \delta \nu _{1}(\xi), \xi _{\iota +1})$ . Simultaneously, a novel and improved looped-functional is formulated, incorporating both sampling information and transmission delay details. Subsequently, employing the devised FBII technique, specific sufficient conditions are established using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure asymptotic stability of the augmented closed-loop systems with respect to the $H_{\infty }$ -performance index $\psi $ in the presence of packet losses. Finally, numerical simulations of the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy-based PMSM and mass–spring model are presented, showcasing the effectiveness and superiority of the suggested methodology.},

  abstract     = {Image anomaly localization is a pivotal technique in industrial inspection, often manifesting as a supervised task where abundant normal samples coexist with rare abnormal samples. Existing supervised methods in this context are prone to overfitting, as they primarily encounter anomalies that represent only a fraction of the open-world anomalies. Conversely, unsupervised methods excel in performance, yet they disregard the essential biased knowledge pertaining to both seen and unseen anomalies within the open world. To bridge this gap and refine unsupervised methods for supervised applications, this study introduces a comprehensive framework called biased students (BiaS), mainly comprising a three-step strategy. This strategy encompasses biased knowledge generation, transfer, and fusion. Gls BiaS effectively segregates the vast anomaly space into two subsets: 1) unseen anomalies and 2) seen anomalies. Subsequently, it generates specialized biased knowledge for these subsets and transfers this knowledge to two distinct subnetworks. As a result, one subnetwork becomes adept at detecting unseen anomalies, while the other excels in localizing seen anomalies. To optimize their capabilities, BiaS synergistically fuses these subnetworks based on their expertise. Rigorous experimentation has empirically validated the effectiveness, generality, and scalability of BiaS, underscoring its potential to enhance unsupervised methods and effectively address the challenges of supervised anomaly localization.},

In traditional CAID, the number of players was fixed. Consequently, when new players joined, computing resources were wasted due to repeated refreshes during the dynamic update process. To address these issues, we first propose a CAID model with an incremental dynamic approach. This model reflects the dynamic changes in the number of players, aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. Second, we propose an incremental updating method to prevent unnecessary refreshes of the original players’ states. When the number of players, denoted as $N$ , increases, we update and expand the evolutionary dynamic model using incremental information. This allows for an incremental connection between the original and new players. We use a weighted adjacency matrix to represent the relationships among players. The incremental updating method then updates the state matrix and the adjacency matrix. Furthermore, an analysis based on the designed Lyapunov function is proposed to prove the convergence of the CAID with incremental dynamic. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In order to suppress the swing of slung load during the flight of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a new double closed-loop nonlinear control method Newton–Euler is proposed based on an energy function and the LaSalle’s invariance theorem. First, the forces of each part in the quadrotor-slung load system (QSLS) is analyzed separately, and the dynamics model of the QSLS is established by the Newton–Euler method. Then, an energy function is constructed based on the relative motion relationship between the UAV and the slung load, and a nonlinear position controller is designed based on the energy function to enable the UAV to suppress the swing angle of the slung load while moving to the desired position in three-dimensional space. The equilibrium point of the whole system is proved to be asymptotically stabilized by the Lyapunov technique and LaSalle’s invariance theorem. Finally, some comparisons are made with a nonlinear adaptive controller and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the controller proposed in this article. It is shown that for the QSLS, the proposed controller has faster convergence speed and better transient performance during the anti-swing control.},

  abstract     = {During the portfolio selection process, investors often have individual behavioral preferences that may be fuzzy, uncertain, and incomplete. For the first time, this article combines fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) with portfolio theory to study the portfolio selection problem faced by investors. First, we improve the relations between judgment elements and priority vectors in FPRs and develop a new definition of additively consistent FPRs under priority vectors. On the basis of this and Markowitz portfolio models, we then propose two portfolio models considering FPRs with unknown preference information and three types of portfolio models considering FPR with partially known preference information. We conduct a comparative analysis of these models and derive a flowchart of investment selection under different conditions. Finally, we use an empirical example to compare the results of all models and analyze their sensitivity to various parameters. The results demonstrate that increasing the distance threshold between judgment elements has a positive effect on the objective function of portfolio models considering FPRs, although this effect gradually becomes saturated. Additionally, the models proposed in this article exhibit high robustness to the consistency index of FPRs.},

Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective solution and is widely used in industrial processes. However, one limitation of MPC is that sufficient data are required to build accurate predictive models. To this end, this article proposes a knowledge-informed neural network MPC solution. First, a Hammerstein system structure knowledge extraction method based on sparse representation is proposed, which is able to extract system structure knowledge from a small amount of system operation data. Then, a knowledge-informed neural network model is designed, which combines the system structure knowledge to construct a neural network with a special structure, thus overcoming the problem of insufficient data during the model training. Finally, the knowledge-informed neural network model is embedded in the MPC framework, which can reduce the computational cost of rolling optimization while ensuring prediction performance. A numerical simulation and a pH neutralization process experiment are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Without any prior channel information, designing a highly adaptable resource allocation algorithm to cope with the fast time-varying environment is a very challenging issue. To address this issue, a hierarchical learning approach, which is combined with adversarial multiarmed bandit theory and outdated pilot-based feedback information, is proposed. The proposed learning approach can online optimize joint resource allocate strategy without any prior channel state information. Specifically, a hierarchical self-reflection learning structure is proposed to offer different learning manners and spaces for the actual played information and outdated feedback information, thereby balancing the exploitation and exploration to cope with the time-varying environment effectively. Further, an integration learning structure is proposed to alleviate the solving difficulty and policy explosion of joint multiple substrategies problem. The user can rapidly achieve a few superior strategies in low-dimension space, then efficiently search the expected optimal strategy in high-dimension space, as a result, the learning efficiency is significantly improved. The proposed algorithms show strong tolerance for delay and noncomplete information due to the elaborate learning structures. The superiority of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through numerical results.},

  abstract     = {A latent factor analysis (LFA) model can be efficiently built via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to address high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data generated by various big data-related applications. However, its performance depends hugely on its hyperparameters, which is conventionally decided through the grid-search that yields extremely high-computational costs. Particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based hyperparameter adaptation provides a potential solution to this severe problem, while it leads to accuracy loss due to the untimely convergence of the PSO algorithm. Moreover, existing PSO extensions mostly perplex the evolution scheme to make the hyperparameter adaptation time-consuming and computationally expensive. Aiming at implementing an accurate and adaptive LFA model, a pseudo gradient-adjusted PSO (PGA-PSO) algorithm with twofold ideas is proposed: 1) modeling the position transitions in a PSO algorithm as the pseudo gradients for optimizing each particle’s position and 2) incorporating the principle of adaptive moment estimation into the pseudo gradient estimation to make it consider previous pseudo gradient information for addressing the untimely issue. With it, a PGA-PSO-incorporated LFA (PPL) model is successfully constructed. The empirical studies on six HDI datasets demonstrate that owing to the efficient hyperparameter adaptation implemented by the proposed PGA-PSO algorithm, the obtained PPL model surpasses state-of-the-art LFA models in accuracy when predicting an HDI matrix’s missing data. Hence, it satisfies the scalability and efficiency demands emerging from practical applications.},

To enable $H_{\infty }$ performance analysis, an equivalent but analyzable stochastic framework is then derived by using matrix exponential computation. Subsequently, by law of total expectation, Kronecker product operation, and eigenvalue decomposition approach, we compute the expectation of a coupling term with significant nonlinearity and randomness. Based on this, a stabilization controller is constructed that ensures the resulting discrete stochastic system’s exponential mean-square stability with a prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance. Unlike the existing literature, the linear matrix inequalitys (LMIs) dimension derived in this article does not change along with the maximum number of consecutively lost packets, which prevents an LMI with high-computing complexity.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series classification (MTSC) based on deep learning (DL) has attracted increasingly more research attention. The performance of a DL-based MTSC algorithm is heavily dependent on the quality of the learned representations providing semantic information for downstream tasks, e.g., classification. Hence, a model’s representation learning ability is critical for enhancing its performance. This article proposes a densely knowledge-aware network (DKN) for MTSC. The DKN’s feature extractor consists of a residual multihead convolutional network (ResMulti) and a transformer-based network (Trans), called ResMulti-Trans. ResMulti has five residual multihead blocks for capturing the local patterns of data while Trans has three transformer blocks for extracting the global patterns of data. Besides, to enable dense mutual supervision between lower- and higher-level semantic information, this article adapts densely dual self-distillation (DDSD) for mining rich regularizations and relationships hidden in the data. Experimental results show that compared with 5 state-of-the-art self-distillation variants, the proposed DDSD obtains 13/4/13 in terms of “win”/“tie”/“lose” and gains the lowest-AVG_rank score. In particular, compared with pure ResMulti-Trans, DKN results in 20/1/9 regarding win/tie/lose. Last but not least, DKN overweighs 18 existing MTSC algorithms on 10 UEA2018 datasets and achieves the lowest-AVG_rank score.},

Second, a feed-forward inverse compensation control method (FICCM) is proposed to compensate for the nonlinear behaviors of the DEMIA, so as to preliminarily achieve its tracking control. Third, due to the fact that model uncertainties and external disturbances are inescapable in practical applications, a MRACM based on the established nominal model of the DEMIA is further presented to improve the tracking control performance. The stability of the entire control system is proved via the Lyapunov method. In the end, a series of tracking control experiments with different multifrequency expected trajectories are executed to illustrate the validity of the proposed control methods. The root-mean-square errors of all control experiment results are less than 2.8%, which reflects that the proposed MRACM is distinguished from a practical application perspective.},

To circumvent these obstacles, we construct a new fuzzy state estimator via intermittent false output and fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs), which, in conjunction with a new set of error surfaces employing the false and estimated state information, allows a novel observer-based resilient adaptive intermittent control strategy to be developed. The results of the proposed resilient adaptive output event-triggered control shown that the stabilization errors converge to a vicinity of the origin, and all the signals of the overall system remain bounded.

The work in this article focuses on creating a decision support system (DSS) for the hierarchical allocation of critical medical resources among different geographical locations. The methodology adopted in this article relies on the concept of noncooperative games and designs a single-stage, multiplayer game to allocate medical resources among the affected locations while considering them as the self-interested players of the game. All the players or the affected locations involved in the game are imposed by different penalties derived from a nonmonetary cost function. The solution of the resource allocation game is given by one of the Nash equilibria of the game chosen by using different selection methods.

To address these issues, this work introduces multidilation temporal and spatial dependence-based convolutional neural networks (MTSD) to explore spatio-temporal couplings by 1) learning hierarchical temporal relations within both continuous and interval data and 2) learning and selecting strong spatial dependencies between electrodes (their locations). MTSD captures 1) multidilation temporal relations in continuous and interval receptive fields by a parallel convolution module and 2) spatial dependencies between electrodes in stereoscopic 3-D EEG data by a constrained self-attention module with a copula-based variable dependence strength filter for visual discomfort assessment. Experiments compare five EEG-based deep networks and three MTSD variants. MTSD makes improvement in discriminating visual discomfort by capturing strong spatio-temporal couplings but uses significantly less computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Assembly lines of large-size products usually allow multiple workers to process tasks simultaneously on the same product. Meanwhile, due to the increasing demand of customized products, a diverse product mix with more product models and optional features is necessary. Although line balancing and model sequencing are interwoven, only the balancing problem of the mixed-model multi-manned assembly lines (MMALs) has been explored. In this study, a new mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed for balancing and sequencing of MMALs to minimize the number of workers, the number of stations, and the amount of utility work. An innovative approach based on Benders’ decomposition algorithm (BDA) is developed. Valid inequalities based on maximal cliques are generated to deal with the incompatible tasks which cannot be assigned to the same station to tighten and reduce the size of the formulation. An initial solution based on the greedy algorithm feeds the BDA to accelerate the convergence. Only one branch-and-search tree is built for the master problem to speed up the algorithm, and optimality cuts based on the subproblems are used as lazy cuts. The effectiveness of the proposed BDA is demonstrated by numerical results.},

Due to the presence of extremely small perturbation parameters, numerical issues will arise when applying conventional robust regulator design techniques to the regular system. To handle the problem, a continuous-time output-feedback controller adopting the forwarding design technique is proposed by combining the internal model approach with singularly perturbed theory. In this manner, the circumvention of numerical issues and the resolution of robustness problems can be achieved. Additionally, the sampling of the transmissions between the plant and the controller is taken into account, leading to the proposed implementation of a dynamic output-based event-triggered strategy. As a result, the output regulation property becomes practical. To avoid Zeno behavior, the implementation ensures the existence of a strictly positive minimum intertime for the triggering instant sequence. The validity of the results is demonstrated through the presentation of a numerical example.},

A neurodynamics-driven distributed optimization method is proposed to achieve safety-certified cooperative circumnavigation guided by multiple targets. Specifically, a cooperative circumnavigation guidance law based on a finite-time distributed observer is designed for surrounding multiple targets. Based on the geometric characteristics of multitarget circumnavigation, three collision-avoidance rules are formulated with respect to obstacles, targets, and ASVs; and three types of control barrier functions are derived to encode the coupled safety constraints into state constraints. A distributed command governor optimization problem is formulated to generate optimal commanded guidance signals within the globally coupled state constraints. To compute optimal commands in real time, multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are employed to solve a distributed optimization problem. An event-triggered communication scheme is designed for the communication among RNNs with reduced communication burden. A predictor-based fuzzy control law is designed to track safe velocity commands. The closed-loop system is proven to be input-to-state stable. Simulation results are elaborated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the safety-certified control method for ASVs to circumnavigate multiple targets with guaranteed safety.},

  abstract     = {An oversampling technique balances a dataset by increasing the number of minority samples. It is a common and effective method in imbalanced learning. However, most oversampling methods have randomness in generating minority samples, which would have negative impacts on the prediction performance of subsequent classifiers. This study treats the prediction made by classifiers as a black-box optimization problem. The optimization objective is to improve the classification accuracy of subsequent classifiers for minority samples. The solution of this optimization problem can be regarded as a minority sample that can be and added to the imbalanced dataset. The minority samples are iteratively generated by Bayesian optimization (BO). We determine two valuable intervals for each 1-D continuous variable feature. One is the interval with the densest minority samples. The other is that with the sparsest majority samples distributed among the minority samples. By adjusting the proportion of samples generated in the two areas, the presented algorithm can be flexibly applied to different datasets. In order to reduce the noise that may be caused by the exploration phase of BO, a sample selection procedure is carried out to eliminate the samples that are worse than those generated at the previous iteration. The samples generated in this way are based on the principle of improving the performance of the classifier, thus avoiding the negative effects of randomness. Experimental results via twenty open imbalanced datasets show that the proposed method obtains better results than existing state-of-the-art oversampling models, thus well advancing the important field of imbalanced learning.},

Meanwhile, the rigorous theoretical proofs along with stability analysis are given to prove the linear convergence of the Acc-DNGD-CC algorithm.

To cope with the problem of redundant data transmission, the information interaction between neighboring agents is determined by the up-front design triggering condition. Instead of the conventional static threshold parameter (TP) in the triggering condition, the TP in this article can be adjusted dynamically. This means that the update frequency of the controller can be further optimized. The imperfect matching phenomenon between premise variables about the fuzzy system and controller is also tackled. Moreover, in theory, the packet loss is modeled as a Markov process.

  abstract     = {In most interactive image generation tasks, given regions of interest (ROI) by users, the generated results are expected to have adequate diversities in appearance while maintaining correct and reasonable structures in original images. Such tasks become more challenging if only limited data is available. Recently proposed generative models complete training based on only one image. They pay much attention to the monolithic feature of the sample while ignoring the actual semantic information of different objects inside the sample. As a result, for ROI-based generation tasks, they may produce inappropriate samples with excessive randomicity and without maintaining the related objects’ correct structures. To address this issue, this work introduces a morphologic-structure-aware generative adversarial network named MOGAN that produces random samples with diverse appearances and reliable structures based on only one image. For training for ROI, we propose to utilize the data coming from the original image being augmented and bring in a novel module to transform such augmented data into knowledge containing both structures and appearances, thus enhancing the model’s comprehension of the sample. To learn the rest areas other than ROI, we employ binary masks to ensure the generation isolated from ROI. Finally, we set parallel and hierarchical branches of the mentioned learning process. Compared with other single image generative adversarial network schemes, our approach focuses on internal features, including the maintenance of rational structures and variation on appearance. Experiments confirm a better capacity of our model on ROI-based image generation tasks than its competitive peers.},

To provide an efficient and accurate controller for nonlinear dynamic processes, an event-based data-driven adaptive MPC (EDAMPC) scheme is proposed. First, a prediction model employing a self-organizing long short-term memory (SOLSTM) neural network is developed to obtain a compact model structure and improve the generalization ability. The structure of the SOLSTM neural network is constructed dynamically by integrating the activity and significance of the neurons. Second, an error-triggered online learning mechanism is developed to update model parameters adaptively based on prediction errors. The nonlinear process dynamics can be captured in the presence of process uncertainty. Third, an event-based control strategy is introduced to reduce communication and computation resources. The convergence of the SOLSTM neural network and the nominal stability of the EDAMPC scheme is analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the EDAMPC scheme are demonstrated via a numerical case and an industrial application.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates an event-triggered control for linear systems with process time-varying delays. An exponential absolute event-trigger (ET) is designed for reducing the data transmission burden of the communication network. The decay rate and the absolute threshold of the ET can be prior-specified, it provides a convenient method to regulate the event-triggering behaviors and the convergence rate of measurement error. Utilizing the available state information, a nonperiodical discrete-time feedback control is proposed. By an auxiliary exponential function, the constant Halanay equation is proved to be effective to the time-varying delayed system. A concise controller design method is presented in terms of low-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI). Significantly, the qualitative relationship between the maximal allowable bound of time delays with the minimal decay rate of the closed-loop system is presented. By the proposed ET-based control, the uniform ultimate bound (UUB) of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Given positive absolute threshold of the ET, the Zeno behavior can be thoroughly excluded. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The study of aperiodic sampling has witnessed enormous interest due to the ubiquitous presence of digital controllers in relevant application domains. Most existing aperiodic sampled-data control methods assume that the model of the system is known or obtainable, though it is unknown and unavailable in reality. The idealized assumption will limit the application of these methods. To address this problem, a data-driven model predictive control (DMPC) strategy is designed to stabilize the aperiodic sampled-data unknown nonlinear systems (ASUNSs). The main contributions of the proposed DMPC are threefold. First, a linearized polytopic approximation dynamic (LPAD), based on the local linear approximation, is constructed to approximate the dynamics of ASUNSs. Then, the aperiodic sampling information of ASUNS is able to be contained. Second, a data-driven model predictive controller is designed to solve the optimal steady-state problem and the optimal control problem (OCP) successively. Then, the desired output reference can be tracked online. Third, the stability of DMPC is analyzed in theory. Then, the corresponding stability conditions are given to ensure its successful applications. Finally, some experimental studies have been performed on the online control of a general unknown nonlinear system (GUNS) with aperiodic sampling and wastewater treatment process (WWTP) with aperiodic sampling to verify its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Objective: To combine medical knowledge and medical data to interpretably predict the risk of disease. Methods: We formulated the disease progression prediction task as a random walk along a knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we build a KG to record relationships between diseases and risk factors according to validated medical knowledge. Then, an object walks along the KG. It starts walking at a patient entity, which connects the KG based on the patient’s current diseases or risk factors and stops at a disease entity representing the predicted disease. The trajectory generated by the object represents an interpretable disease progression path of the given patient. The dynamics of the object are controlled by a policy-based reinforcement learning module, which is trained by electronic health records (EHRs). Experiments: We utilized three real-world EHR datasets to evaluate the performance of our model. In the disease progression prediction task, our model achieves 0.743, 0.639, and 0.643 in terms of macro area under the curve (AUC) in predicting 53 circulation system diseases in the three datasets, respectively. This performance is comparable to medical research’s commonly used machine learning models. In qualitative analysis, our clinical collaborator reviewed the disease progression paths generated by our model and advocated their interpretability and reliability. Conclusion: Experimental results validate the proposed model in interpretably evaluating and optimizing disease progression prediction. Significance: Our work contributes to leveraging the potential of medical knowledge and medical data jointly for interpretable prediction tasks.},

An integral sliding mode control method is developed to maintain the subsystem trajectories on the sliding mode surface, eliminate the effect of actuator failures, and obtain the sliding mode dynamics (SMDs). Then, the control problem is transformed into an optimal control (OC) problem for the nominal form of the SMDs by constructing a modified local value function. To obtain the event-triggered OC law, a critic-only structure is applied to approximate the local optimal value function of the nominal subsystem for solving the event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. An event-triggered ADP control method is developed to decrease the updating frequency of the OC law and to reduce the computational burden. In addition, an experience replay-based weight updating policy is presented to relax the persistence of excitation condition. Furthermore, we prove that the developed method can guarantee the closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable by using Lyapunov’s direct method.

An improved nonlinear filter is employed to avoid the “explosion of complexity” issue and realizes the convergence of filter errors within the PT. Additionally, the control singular issue is avoided by using L’Hospital’s rule.

With the help of the ELSS rule, the ELSS-type discretized Zhang neurodynamics (ELSS-DZNs) algorithm that develops from continuous Zhang neurodynamics (CZNs) model is proposed for tackling the FQP problem subject to linear equation (LE), while the inverse-free continuous hybrid gradient Zhang neurodynamics (IFCHGZNs) model, which combines the Getz–Marsden dynamic system (GMDS) model 2 for time-variant inverse computing (TVIC) and CZN model for tackling the time-variant QP (TVQP) problem subject to LE, develops the ELSS-type inverse-free discretized hybrid gradient Zhang neurodynamics (ELSS-IFDHGZN) algorithm for dealing with the FQP problem subject to LE. Theoretically, three theorems are presented to show the convergent properties of the proposed general CZN and IFCHGZN models by Lyapunov stability theory, while three theorems and five corollaries are presented to show the truncation error pattern of the ELSS-DZN and ELSS-IFDHGZN algorithms by using the stability and convergence theory of linear multistep formulas. Moreover, two numerical experiments are adopted to demonstrate the availability and convergent properties of the proposed general ELSS-DZN and ELSS-IFDHGZN algorithms.

This article proposes a new FIR filtering algorithm for MJLSs to address this problem. Under each mode, the variational inference approximates the posterior distribution as a product of Gaussian distribution and inverse gamma distribution by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence. A recursion is then derived over a predefined estimation horizon, where the influence of abandoning the measurements beyond the horizon is compensated. By setting the estimation horizon length as a fixed number, the recursion achieved becomes a new FIR filter for MJLSs, while a new suboptimal Bayesian estimator appears when the horizon length is determined as the full horizon. A Newtonian tracking example as well a three degree-of-freedom hover model is presented to demonstrate that the proposed FIR method has good immunity against unpredicted modeling uncertainties at the cost of extra computational resources and memories, and its full-horizon form does not show this feature and may lose to some exiting algorithms when the underlying model is accurate.},

  abstract     = {In the application of system identification, not only the output but also the input of the system may be corrupted by noise, which is often characterized by the errors-in-variables (EIV) model. To identify such systems, a gradient-descent total least-squares (GD-TLS) and a maximum total correntropy (MTC) algorithms were proposed. In some scenarios, the weight vector of the unknown system may be sparse, e.g., the echo path in acoustic echo cancelation (AEC). Employing TLS or MTC to estimate such systems may result in slow convergence rate, since they assign the same gain to the update of each weight and therefore cannot make use of the sparsity feature of the system to accelerate convergence. To address the above problem, this article proposes a uniform optimization model for deriving proportionate total adaptive filtering algorithms, and then two proportionate total adaptive filtering algorithms are developed, namely, the proportionate total normalized least mean square (PTNLMS) algorithm for Gaussian noise disturbance and the proportionate MTC (PMTC) algorithm for impulsive noise interference, which are both derived by utilizing the method of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, this article also makes a steady-state performance analysis of the two proposed algorithms. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of the two proposed algorithms and to test the accuracy of the theory on the steady-state performance analysis.},

Considering that data transmission networks between the system and filter will be subject to deception attacks and delays, a switching filter is designed by current states and modes as well as delayed states and modes. Since there are non-Markov jumps caused by the current mode and the delayed mode in the error dynamic systems, an extended state space method is employed to reconstruct it as switched error dynamic MJSs. By selecting multiple Lyapunov functionals, nonlinear sufficient conditions are given to ensure the finite-time boundedness and $H_{\infty }$ performance of the switched error dynamic MJSs. In order to deal with the derived nonlinear conditions without introducing conservatism, a combination of genetic algorithms and linear matrix inequality tools is used to solve filter gains.

An improved probabilistic roadmap (PRM*) algorithm is proposed, which eliminates the zig-zag paths around the path endpoints. The $K$ -distance PRM* $(K$ -DPRM*) provides a novel clustering metric for task allocation in an obstacle environment. An ant colony system-PRM* (ACS-PRM*) algorithm is proposed to solve the congestion avoidance traveling salesman problem (CATSP) by voyage optimization of multiobjective coverage. Additionally, the mapping relationship between the probability of environmental congestion and the velocity of robot is established and combined with the feedforward control method to improve the motion control of robots.

We introduce a concept called stability condition to continuous games, which includes the monotonicity condition as a special case. We prove that the stability condition is necessary and sufficient for convergence of gradient play. In detail, we show that, if the step size is fixed and within a given bound, the full-information and partial-information gradient play is guaranteed to converge to the Nash equilibrium in strongly stable games. If the step size is diminishing, then convergence of the gradient play can be obtained for strictly stable games.

  abstract     = {In this article, a decentralized optimal fault tolerant tracking control (DOFTTC) approach is proposed for unknown nonlinear interconnected systems (NISs) with partial loss of actuator effectiveness (PLOAE) through a two-level local observer structure. To begin with, the upper boundedness assumption of the interconnected term in traditional decentralized control methods is relaxed by replacing the actual states of the coupled subsystems with their desired ones. At the first level, a local neural network observer (LNNO) is established for the fault-free subsystem to get the local control coefficient matrix. At the second level, another LNNO is designed based on the LNNO developed at the first level to estimate the effectiveness factor (EF) for the faulty subsystem with PLOAE fault, thereby the safety and reliability of the subsystem are ensured. To achieve the trajectory tracking control, an augmented system is established by combining the tracking error dynamics and reference trajectory dynamics. To obtain the decentralized optimal tracking control (DOTC), an improved local cost function is designed for each subsystem, and then, a local adaptive critic mechanism with cooperative adaptive tuning laws is constructed to solve the local Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Hereafter, the DOFTTC can be derived with the assistance of DOTC and the EF estimation. Besides, the closed-loop NIS with asymptotic stability is analyzed via the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the developed DOFTTC approach.},

  abstract     = {A growing body of literature has proved that general type-2 fuzzy control systems (GT2 FCSs) are reliable, robust, and safe control systems against severe external disturbances, high levels of noise, and uncertainty that are inevitable in real-world applications. Further studies on the GT2 FCSs are therefore needed to provide new insights into these control systems, in particular over their stability and computational complexity problems. Unlike the existing works on stability analysis of GT2 FCSs in the time domain, the aim of this article is to assess the stability properties of these systems in the frequency domain through a novel intuitive method. Before delving into stability analysis, an initial step involves reducing computational complexity. This is achieved by introducing a streamlined version of the GT2 fuzzy controller (GT2 FC). This simplified architecture is constructed using a series of zSlices-based interval type-2 fuzzy-logic controls (zIT2 FLCs) situated at specific zLevels. Each zIT2 FLC is composed of two embedded type-1 fuzzy FLCs (T1 FLCs). The subsequent phase entails a methodical procedure for assessing stability based on the existence of limit cycles. The initial stage involves the linearization of the simplified GT2 FC through the derivation of its describing function (DF). Next, a combination of the parameter plane approach and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is leveraged. These techniques serve the purpose of pinpointing the regions corresponding to limit cycles and asymptotic stability with a focus on improving the stability boundary. Following this, the analysis shifts toward quantifying the system’s resilience in the face of uncertainty. Stability margins required to generate a limit cycle are calculated using stability equations. This step provides a measure of how robust the closed-loop system remains under varying degrees of uncertainty. Finally, three simulation examples are presented to justify the advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Current convolution neural network (CNN)-based multiperson pose estimators have achieved great progress, however, they pay no or less attention to “hard” samples, such as occluded keypoints, small and nearly invisible keypoints, and ambiguous keypoints. In this article, we explicitly deal with these “hard” samples by proposing a novel multiscale coarse-to-fine human pose estimation network (HM2PN), which includes two sequential subnetworks: CoarseNet and FineNet. CoarseNet conducts a coarse prediction to locate “simple” keypoints like hands and ankles with a multiscale fusion module, which is integrated with bottleneck, resulting in a novel module called multiscale bottleneck. The new module improves the multiscale representation ability of the network in a fine-grained level, while marginally reducing the computation cost because of group convolution. FineNet further infers “hard” keypoints and refines “simple” keypoints simultaneously with a hard keypoint mining loss. Distinct from the previous works, the proposed loss deals with “hard” keypoints differentially and prevents “simple” keypoints from dominating the computed gradients during training. Experiments on the COCO keypoint benchmark show that our approach achieves superior pose estimation performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Such malfunctioning sensors and actuators not only bring about additional modeling uncertainties but also literally pollute the original control influence gain matrix, making the underlying problem further complicated. By using the backstepping-like design procedure, we present an adaptive control solution with relaxed controllability conditions, capable of achieving asymptotic stabilization under severely twisted feedback information due to malicious attacks/sensor failures. Besides a primary actuator, we also propose a strategy to use additional actuators as the backup ones to enhance system survivability, where the actuator replacement automatically and seamlessly takes place from the primary actuator to a backup one, once a severe failure at the primary actuator is detected. Numerical simulation also confirms the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of multiview data sets, in which features of each sample are categorized into distinct groups, is increasingly important in the big data era. Successful multiview learning approaches have mechanisms to enforce consensus and/or complementarity among views. This article introduces a framework called the consensus and complementarity-based multiview latent space projection (MVLSP-2C) that enforces both principles simultaneously. Consensus is established by extracting and representing information shared by all views in a shared latent space, whereas complementarity among views is achieved by the representation in view-specific spaces. As the diversity of the multiview feature representation benefits classification performance, MVLSP-2C minimizes the similarity between the shared and view-specific representations, thereby improving diversity. The driving principle of MVLSP-2C is that the latent space representation is obtained by optimally projecting it to match the original feature space representation on a view-by-view basis. Unlike pairwise consensus methods that enforce consistency between two views, matching on a view-by-view basis allows extensions to settings with more than two views. A related and important advantage of this per-view matching design is that a class view can be readily incorporated to learn a supervised representation that facilitates subsequent classification. As the class view is added without an assumption on the exclusivity of classes, MVLSP-2C is equally applicable to multiclass single-label and multilabel classifications. MVLSP-2C further optimizes the integration of latent variables based on their correlation. Extensive experiments in multiclass and multiview image datasets show that MVLSP-2C produces more accurate classification results as compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Then the relation between convergence behaviors of all agents and those of Laplacian potentials can be disclosed, which makes it possible to solve the convergence issues of SOSNs from the viewpoint of the Lyapunov stability theory even though the weight-balanced condition is not satisfied. Furthermore, the proposed Laplacian potential can be leveraged to deal with the convergence problems of distributed averaging for SOSNs. It is shown that the signed-average consensus objective is reached under the structurally balanced signed digraphs by designing a distributed control protocol according to the proposed Laplacian potential.

Based on the fuzzy system, an integral sliding surface is proposed and the asymptotic convergence criterion for the overall system is derived with extended dissipation. Furthermore, an adaptive control law is provided to achieve the reachability of the assigned sliding surface and improve the attenuation ability to unknown curvature and exogenous disturbance. Finally, several scenarios with different path-following tasks are given in the simulations.

  abstract     = {The low enthusiasm for upstream and downstream pollution control is the main factor leading to poor water quality. Optimizing water pollution control strategies for multiple stakeholders/entities in river basins is challenging. Considering the dynamic change of water quality, we study the optimal decision of pollution control chain composed of upstream and downstream. We construct a stochastic differential game model of upstream and downstream efforts to determine the optimal pollution control strategy. The differential evolution algorithm is used to determine the quantity of virtual currencies issued, and the optimal control theory is employed to make decisions on pollution control efforts. We discuss the optimal-feedback equilibrium of watershed environmental quality for three scenarios: 1) no transaction; 2) downstream purchase currency; and 3) upstream purchase currency. As a result, introducing the “water quality–currency” market: 1) improves water quality, increases each entity’s pollution control efforts, and forms a mechanism between pollution control efforts and water quality; 2) increases entities’ welfare amid increasing volatility, enhancing their resistance to external interferences; and 3) enables the improvement of water and the increase of the entities’ profits to be realized at the same time in the downstream purchase scenario.},

  abstract     = {Infrared thermography is increasingly exploited to track mechanical degradation in a noncontact manner, readily available for further prognostics. Recently, wavelet networks have coalesced deep learning and wavelet transform (WT), expected to achieve data-driven and interpretable prognostics. However, traditional wavelet networks neither possess enough adaptability to extract degradation-related features nor sufficiently fuse learned wavelet coefficients. Thus, this article presents a spatiotemporal dynamic convolution-based wavelet network to handle the above difficulties in industry. First, a spatiotemporal dynamic convolution layer is presented to flexibly modulate kernels according to input samples and the multidimensional kernel space. Second, a learnable lifting scheme structure is constructed to perform signal-adapted WT while incorporating crucial properties to link the optimization of lifting filters and degradation-related feature learning. Finally, a bilinear feature fusion is implemented to jointly represent extracted wavelet energy across decomposition levels, facilitating synergistic optimization. The superiority of the proposed method is illustrated through infrared degradation image datasets.},

Given its inherent large-scale, sparse, and multimodal nature, the pursuit of the global optimal solution for MNSDP is inherently complex. In this research, we introduce a sophisticated mathematical model of the MNSDP, accommodating three distinct node types, each having disparate reliability prerequisites. We further unveil a benchmark test suite based on real-world scenarios, dubbed MNSDP-LIB. To further our innovations, we present the large-scale binary matrix-based differential evolution (LBMDE) algorithm. This novel algorithm adopts a binary-matrix-centric DE operator with an enhanced feasibility-centric environmental selection strategy. Empirical experiments accentuate the proficiency of LBMDE in addressing large-scale binary matrix optimization challenges.

Currently, many fault diagnosis methods for BPUs have been developed, and most of them are based on feature or image classification of indicator diagrams. However, low-quality monitoring data and the limited proportion of effective pixels in indicator diagram greatly restrict the performances of these methods. This article proposes an efficient two-step fault diagnosis method for BPUs. In the first step, to overcome the impact of low-quality monitoring data, a dynamic time warping-based matching method is proposed to extract the period of the data, and then a physical model driven method optimized by Bayesian gradient descent is proposed to reconstruct the data. In the second step, to overcome the impact of the limited proportion of effective pixels in indicator diagram, a parallel deep network is proposed which directly takes the time series of the displacement and the load of BPUs as the inputs. Extensive experiments on dataset from 45 real oil wells have shown that, the proposed method can achieve the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, meanwhile the computational load is only 5% of other deep learning-based methods.},

A generalized processing analysis method for dealing with the network with derivative coupling is first presented. To acquire suitable input intervals, a novel memory-based self-triggered impulsive controller is elaborately designed. Accordingly, the triggering moments are precisely determined, which take the average error states of a small fraction of monitoring moments into account. Sufficient conditions for the bipartite synchronization are eventually obtained by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem in conjunction with the parameter variation approach and definition of average impulsive interval. Since time-varying impulsive effects are considered, the definition of average impulsive gain is introduced in order to estimate the convergence rates and error bounds, respectively. The capability of derived mathematical deductions is ultimately demonstrated by numerical examples. Further, comparative experiments are given to show the superiority of performance within three event-based mechanisms.},

First, a nonlinear model predictive control-based planning method is presented with full consideration of tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance safety. Second, in order to improve the anti-interference ability, we derive a nonlinear path tracking control law by combining the backstepping technique with a nonlinear disturbance observer. More importantly, through hydrodynamic analysis of the bionic multimodal motions under flippers and flukes, a fuzzy-based nonlinear control allocation system is particularly adopted to convert calculated control forces into bionic motion parameters. Finally, extensive simulations and aquatic experiments are conducted, and the obtained results validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, providing a new idea to further ocean exploration.},

  abstract     = {Energy demand prediction can be obtained for different customer categories or geolocations, e.g., predicting the energy demand over different cities. Traditionally, these prediction tasks are solved independently without considering the common problem-solving knowledge sharing among them. However, addressing one task may help facilitate the training process or improve the prediction performance of another one via knowledge transfer. In this article, we propose a two-stage multitasking prediction (TS-MTP) framework to address the energy demand prediction problem over multiple locations, in which each task has a deep neural network (DNN) model as the predictor. TS-MTP includes single-tasking learning (STL) and multitasking learning (MTL) stages. The STL stage focuses on addressing each prediction task independently with a gradient descent-based optimization algorithm until the training accuracy cannot be improved, so that the optimal DNN structure parameters for each task can be achieved. In the MTL stage, for a specified target task, the knowledge, i.e., DNN connection weights and biases acquired in STL, is extracted and transferred from the source tasks and reused in the target task to help further improve its prediction accuracy. To decide the amount of knowledge to be reused, a coefficient is assigned to each source task, and particle swarm optimization is applied to obtain the optimal coefficients. The performance of TS-MTP is verified on several problem sets that are created from different step-ahead predictions. The superiority of TS-MTP is demonstrated in comparison to several state-of-the-art DNNs that are popular in the time-series prediction domain. The results show that TS-MTP can lead to a more than 35% accuracy improvement compared with the STL without knowledge transfer.},

  abstract     = {To combat cybercrimes and maintain financial security for the blockchain ecosystem, “know your customer” (KYC) is an essential and also challenging process due to the pseudonymity nature of blockchain technology. To unlock the potential of KYC on blockchain-based platforms like Ethereum, account labeling is a powerful means which can de-anonymize addresses by mining public transaction records. Existing studies on account labeling are mainly conducted via machine learning (ML) methods fed with hand-crafted features or graph neural networks based on the modeled transaction network. However, ML approaches based on hand-crafted features ignore the global interaction information between accounts, making it easy for criminals to evade detection. Moreover, the performance of traditional GCN methods when applied to Ethereum transaction network encounters limitations due to label sparsity, network heterophily, and large network size of the transaction network. In this article, we first analyze Ethereum accounts involved in typical businesses, in terms of both account and topological features. Then based on the analytical results, we propose a novel GCN method named know-your-customer graph convolutional network (KYC-GCN) which contains two key designs: 1) multihop aggregators and importance-based sampling are designed to tackle the dilemma between accuracy and efficiency. 2) GCN architecture is improved to explicitly capture local and more global information. Experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset show that the proposed KYC-GCN (90.2% accuracy, 86.2% Marco-F1) achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, and results on six benchmarks demonstrate that it yields great performance under homophily and heterophily.},

  abstract     = {The increasing spreading of small commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) presents serious threats for critical areas, such as airports, power plants, and governmental and military facilities. In fact, such UAVs can easily disturb or jam radio communications, collide with other flying objects, perform espionage activity, and carry offensive payloads, e.g., weapons or explosives. A central problem when designing surveillance solutions for the localization of unauthorized UAVs in critical areas is to decide how many triangulating sensors to use, and where to deploy them to optimize both coverage and cost effectiveness. In this article, we compute deployments of triangulating sensors for UAV localization, optimizing a given blend of metrics, namely: coverage under multiple sensing quality levels, cost-effectiveness, and fault-tolerance. We focus on large, complex three-dimensional (3-D) regions, which exhibit obstacles (e.g., buildings), varying terrain elevation, different coverage priorities, and constraints on possible sensors placement. Our novel approach relies on computational geometry and statistical model checking and enables the effective use of off-the-shelf AI-based black-box optimizers. Moreover, our method allows us to compute a closed-form, analytical representation of the region uncovered by a sensor deployment, which provides the means for rigorous, formal certification of the quality of the latter. We show the practical feasibility of our approach by computing optimal sensor deployments for UAV localization in two large, complex 3-D critical regions, the Rome Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport (FCO) and the Vienna International Center (VIC), using NOMAD as our state-of-the-art underlying optimization engine. Results show that we can compute optimal sensor deployments within a few hours on a standard workstation and within minutes on a small parallel infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {The brain possesses the remarkable ability to seamlessly integrate perception with decision making within a dynamically changing environment in a fault-tolerant, end-to-end manner. This extraordinary capability offers a compelling solution for brain-inspired intelligence, replete with the advantages of end-to-end decision making: robustness, high accuracy, real-time responsiveness, autonomous intelligence, and a high degree of biological plausibility. Neuromorphic computing stands as a promising avenue for brain-inspired intelligence through the harmonious co-design of algorithms and hardware, aimed at unlocking full potential. This article introduces a comprehensive neuromorphic computing framework for end-to-end intelligence. It introduces the quadruplet spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which serves as a cornerstone for perceptual to decision-making tasks. A fault-tolerant neuromorphic routing strategy is presented to fortify the framework’s robustness. Empirical results underscore its impressive attributes with high accuracy, robustness, fault tolerance, and minimal computational latency when orchestrating end-to-end decision-making alongside visual perception. This study marks a pioneering effort in unified, fault-tolerant neuromorphic framework engineered for brain-inspired end-to-end intelligent tasks, merging visual perception with adaptive decision making. Such an endeavor is profoundly meaningful, as it propels the development of artificial general intelligence, holding vast implications for the field’s advancement.},

  abstract     = {The policy gradient adaptive dynamic programming (PGADP) technique has gained recognition as an effective approach for optimizing the performance of nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, existing PGADP algorithms often demand a substantial volume of expensive or potentially risky interaction data with the system. Moreover, the utilization of neural networks in these algorithms can result in suboptimal learning efficiency and unstable training procedures. To address these challenges, a novel algorithm, referred to as OptNet-PGADP, has been introduced. This algorithm integrates an initially tailored control policy based on OptNet to tackle the optimization of control problems in discrete-time nonlinear systems. The OptNet-PGADP algorithm operates through a two-step process. Initially, the input–output trajectory of the system is computed using the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method. Subsequently, an initial admissible control policy is acquired through OptNet. This policy is iteratively enhanced using the PGADP algorithm to attain the optimal controller. The resulting closed-loop control policy can be readily deployed in real-time applications. The implementation of the algorithm employs OptNet for the actor network and integrates an experience replay mechanism to bolster the controller’s learning efficiency. Furthermore, a convergence and optimality analysis of the algorithm is included. Simulation and experimental results conducted on two nonlinear systems conclusively demonstrate that the approach outperforms traditional PGADP and NMPC algorithms. These findings underscore the efficacy of OptNet-PGADP in mitigating the constraints of current methods and achieving superior control performance for nonlinear systems.},

Such connectivity translates the ITSs into dynamical systems of socio-technical nature. Exploiting this socio-technical feature to our advantage, we propose a cyber-attack detection scheme for ITSs that focuses on cyber-attacks on freeway traffic infrastructure. The proposed scheme combines two parallel macroscopic traffic model-based partial differential equation (PDE) filters whose output residuals are compared to make decision on attack occurrences. One of the filters utilizes physical (vehicle/infrastructure) sensor data as feedback whereas the other utilizes social data from human users’ mobile devices as feedback. The Social Data-based Filter is aided by a fake data isolator and a social signal processor that translates the social information into usable feedback signals. Mathematical convergence properties are analyzed for the filters using Lyapunov’s stability theory. Finally, we validate our proposed scheme by presenting simulation results.},

Identifiability and reduced-order estimation of the IM from observation data are crucial for IM applications. Despite the tractability of IM analysis with its reduced-order representation, the identifiability and estimation of IM are challenging due to the tight coupling of both network and local level interactions. The limited identifiability studies in the literature only apply to homogeneous IMs and existing methods for IM estimation incur high-computational cost. In this article, we solve the identifiability problem by providing succinct if-and-only-if conditions for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous IMs. This is obtained through a structural analysis that establishes a novel connection between the high-order and low-order representations of the IMs. The identifiability analysis further leads to reduced-order parameter estimation algorithms of the homogeneous and heterogeneous IMs with reduced computation.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating edge and cloud computing with robotics provides extended options for robots to perform real-time sensing and actuation operations in various cyber–physical systems (CPSs), including smart farms. Such systems are prone to uncertain failures triggered by mechanical disruptions. Consequently, the overall system performance degrades, primarily when location-specific tasks are already assigned to a faulty robot and require immediate recovery. Using edge and cloud computing resources is not always feasible due to communication and latency constraints. Therefore, this article exclusively focuses on harnessing the mobility of robots to support the computation tasks affected by uncertain failures of previously assigned robots and ensure faster resiliency management by relocating active robots near task sources. The proposed mobility-as-a-resilience-service (MaaRS) is formulated using a Markov decision process (MDP). Later, an edge server proximal to the robots is trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to assign tasks among the robots. Specifically, a multiple deep $Q$ -network (MDQN)-based dynamic task allocation mechanism is proposed to converge to a solution exploring reward uncertainties with the best exploitation. Numerical evaluation using Python and TensorFlow validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to other benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The constrained-domination principle (CDP) is one of the most popular constraint-handling techniques (CHTs), since it is simple, nonparametric, and easily embedded in unconstrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). However, the CDP overly emphasizes the importance of feasibility, which may lead to the search getting stuck in some locally feasible regions or locally optimal, especially when encountering problems with discontinuous and/or narrow feasible regions. This article seeks to capitalize on the strengths of the CDP while overcoming its weaknesses. Accordingly, we propose a novel constrained MOEA (called MOEA/D-LCDP), in which the CDP is applied in a local manner. Unlike most CHTs that emphasize feasibility, which use the feasibility rule in the whole search space, the proposed localized CDP only adopts the CDP within the niche. That is, to maintain the diversity of the population, only solutions within the niche are compared based on the localized CDP. The niche radius is determined a priori by the acute angle between the current subproblem and its nearest subproblem. Additionally, a population-based status detection strategy is developed to allocate computing resources more rationally, and a diversity-enhanced CDP is designed to enhance the exploitation of the search. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark test suites with a total of 34 problems and three real-world applications demonstrate that MOEA/D-LCDP is very competitive with representative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Disassembly production lines that employ shared stations with multiple workers and robots are ideal for addressing obsolete products with complex structures and hazardous parts. In this study, a multiproduct multi-man–robot disassembly line balancing problem (MPMMR-DLBP) is developed and its mixed-integer programming model (MIPM) is established to minimize the number of stations, idle balancing index of operators (workers and robots), and the number of operators. In addition, a problem-oriented group evolutionary (POGE) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MPMMR-DLBP. The proposed POGE develops a new “1+3” encoding mode and a heuristic decoding strategy based on the shortest time to complete tasks to construct a one-to-one correspondence between encoding sequences and disassembly schemes. Moreover, a reassociation evolution operation (REO) and a mapping crossover operation (MCO) are designed to generate new solutions and allow the population to evolve to the global optimum. Subsequently, the correctness of MIPM and the performance of POGE are verified using two small-scale cases. Finally, an actual MPMMR-DLBP for the mixed disassembly of refrigerators, microwave ovens, and dishwashers is optimized by POGE. A comparison of the optimized results with the other three common algorithms shows that the POGE is superior in the large-scale MPMMR-DLBP, and multiple optimized disassembly schemes are provided for decision makers.},

  abstract     = {This article studies an operation optimization problem in a steelmaking process. Shortly before the tapping of molten steel from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), end-point control measures are applied to achieve the required final molten steel quality. While it is difficult to build an exact mathematical model for this process, the control inputs and the corresponding outputs are available by collecting production data. We build a data-driven model for the process. To optimize the control parameters, an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed using a probabilistic model comprising different distributions. A resampling mechanism is incorporated into the EDA to guide the new population to a broader and more promising area when the search becomes ineffective. To further enhance the solution quality, we add a local improvement to update the current best individual through simplified gravitational search and information learning. Experiments are conducted using real data from a BOF steelmaking process. The results show that the algorithm can help to achieve the specified molten steel quality. To evaluate the proposed algorithm as a general optimization algorithm, we test it on some complex benchmark functions. The results illustrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide range of problems.},

Meanwhile, the attack phenomena existing in feedback channels are modeled by considering both multiplicative and additive deception factors. Then, an ET mechanism without long-time dormancy behavior is proposed to reduce the calculation burden of the controller and save network communication resources. Rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed pure data-driven ET-MFAPC algorithm is given by employing the contraction mapping principle and it shows that the boundedness of tracking error in the mean-square sense can be guaranteed under the presented ET-MFAPC scheme.

  abstract     = {Multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (MMOPs) have attracted wide attention in recent years. This kind of problem is very challenging since they need to locate different Pareto-optimal solution sets (PSs) that correspond to the same Pareto front. To resolve it, this article proposes a novel multimodal multiobjective differential evolution (DE) algorithm with species conservation, which develops a new way of locating different PSs. Specifically, the proposed algorithm adopts species conservation to determine different PSs in known areas, while it uses a variant of DE as the basic optimizer to explore new areas. There are three operators in species conservation: 1) species division; 2) seed determination; and 3) seed conservation. Species division mainly partitions the joint population of parents and children into various species in the decision space for retaining different PSs. Seed determination selects superior solutions from each species as seeds that need to be kept in the next generation. Seed conservation is to ensure that all species seeds are retained in the new generation by substituting no promising solutions with them, thereby guarantee not missing some known areas that may contain different PSs. Besides, the DE variant is utilized to produce diverse solutions to find new areas in the decision space where PSs may exist. The comparative experiments with ten state-of-the-art algorithms have been performed on the CEC 2019 MMOPs test set and two real-world problems. The experimental results have verified that the proposed algorithm has a competitive performance for MMOPs.},

This can improve the control performance of the closed-loop system and save communication resources synchronously. Moreover, a dynamic ETC is designed to further increase the interevent times. Furthermore, in order to avoid the continuous monitoring of system status, the static and dynamic self-triggered control (STC) algorithms are also established. The Zeno phenomenon is avoided and the corresponding designable MIET is given in all established algorithms. Specifically, the designed control algorithms are extended to solve the corresponding semi-global stabilization problem. In some cases, the MIETs can be selected as an arbitrarily large bounded constant that has no relationship with system itself. Finally, applications to the spacecraft rendezvous control system verify the effectiveness of the designed algorithms.},

Second, by defining a compensation term to compensate the controller and utilizing the property of radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN), an RL-based direct adaptive control strategy is developed via a backstepping method to achieve optimal control, and the multigradient recursive (MGR) algorithm is employed to estimate the weight vector. Finally, the stability of the control system is guaranteed and all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) on the basis of the Lyapunov theory. In addition, a universal system transformation is first proposed which breaks through the limitations on the controller design for the discrete-time nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system by using the traditional method.

This article studies the order picking optimization problem in RMFS, which simultaneously decides the assignment of orders and racks to multiple picking stations. Although this problem has been widely studied in recent years, it is still very challenging for existing methods to solve large-scale instances effectively (e.g., more than 200 orders and 500 racks). To overcome this difficulty to meet the real-world needs, we propose a fulfillment-focused simultaneous assignment (FFSA) method. The proposed FFSA comprises two stages: 1) compression and 2) simultaneous assignment. The compression stage employs a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) strategy to establish a reduced set of critical racks that can fulfill the demand of all orders. In the simultaneous assignment stage, we develop a marginal-return-based assignment with candidate strategy (MRACS) to simultaneously assign orders and critical racks to picking stations. MRACS takes into account three fulfillment-focused measurements to depict the product supply relationship between the demand of orders and the inventory on critical racks. These measurements are further integrated into the effective heuristics with sufficient problem-specific knowledge to obtain a high-quality solution. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms representative algorithms on both synthetic data and large-scale real-world data.},

Thus, the multiagent systems can effectively avoid spatial constraints and safely pass through the constrained region. Aiming to achieve such control objectives, a formation tracking control strategy based on the leader-following framework is designed in this article. An adaptive formation scaling mechanism called orientational scaling is first designed. A time-varying matrix introduces real-time information about the formation shape and obstacles into the formation tracking controller. With the action of the controller, the formation can perform an orientational scaling action on its pattern according to the constraints of the external space during the tracking of a given trajectory. Besides, a spatial receding control mechanism is also designed to handle possible collisions in scaling transformations in multiagent systems, reducing the collision risk and improving movement efficiency. The stability conditions of the system are given by adopting the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed control strategy is illustrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article puts emphasis on the deterministic value-iteration-based $Q$ -learning (VIQL) algorithm with adjustable convergence speed, followed by the application verification on trajectory tracking for completely unknown nonaffine systems. It is worth emphasizing that, under the effect of learning rates, the convergence speed can be adjusted and the new convergence criterion of the VIQL framework is investigated. The merit of the adjustable VIQL scheme is that it can quicken the learning speed and decrease the number of iterations, thereby reducing the computation burden. To carry out the model-free VIQL algorithm, the offline data of system states and reference trajectories are collected to provide the reference control, the tracking error, and the tracking control, which promotes the parameter updating of the adjustable VIQL algorithm via the off-policy learning scheme. By this updating operation, the convergent optimal tracking policy can guarantee that arbitrary initial state tracks the desired trajectory and can completely obviate the terminal tracking error. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to indicate the validity of the designed tracking control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to focus on proposing the theoretical framework for investigating the stability properties of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) considering the stochastic disturbances and parameter uncertainties in the fractional domain. To do this, the aerodynamics of PMSM is chosen as stochastic disturbances, followed by the inherent parameter uncertainties in voltage equations. In addition, for the proposed nonlinear PMSM model, an equivalent linear submodels holding same dynamical properties of PMSM are derived through Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy approach. Besides, the derivative of white noise is considered with Hurst parameter known as fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and it holds the properties of conventional Brownian motion when Hurst parameter is chosen as 0.5. The Lyapunov stability theory is employed to derive the sufficient stability conditions that guarantee the global stable performance of the proposed fuzzy-based PMSM model. In this regard, instead of traditional Ito’s differential formula, the study utilizes Ito’s fractional differential formula to obtain the sufficient conditions. To validate the proposed approach, numerical experiments are performed by considering the experimental range of parameter values and the outcomes are illustrated through time-series, and phase-portraits.},

First, a control structure with positive and negative state feedbacks is constructed. Then, an IAE-based detection method for mechanical oscillations and disturbances is proposed according to the real-time motor speed response characteristic. The effect of different feedback coefficients on system performance is investigated, which can verify the effectiveness of the detection strategy and provide guidance for developing self-adjustment rules. Since in the state feedback structure, the suppression of oscillation is a negative feedback to the transmission torque, while the anti-disturbance is a positive feedback to the load torque, this article proposes a strategy for online automatic adjustment of compensation coefficients based on real-time detection results to effectively balance this contradiction. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed algorithm can automatically detect, autonomously judge and adjust the oscillations and disturbances of the servo system without any human intervention.},

Here, the Lyapunov-based and comparison-system-based approaches are constructed to achieve the iterative updates of impulse sequences with flexibility, especially the upper bound or average interval of impulsive periods is not restricted explicitly. In addition, several sufficient criteria for multigroup consensus of MASs with sensing and actuation delays are presented, where the correlation inequalities between trigger parameters, time delays, and control strengths are established to promote the co-design of impulsive controller and self-triggering algorithm. The Zeno behavior could be successfully eliminated. It is shown that the presented self-triggered schemes do not necessitate continuous or periodic event-detections and the interaction for neighboring agents works in an impulsive manner, which significantly saves the resource consumption of communication and control. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the asynchronous $\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ control problem for discrete-time hidden Markov jump systems (MJSs) with complex mode transition probabilities (C-TPs). The significance of this study can be revealed as follows. First, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to estimate the system mode, which cannot always be accurately detected in practical scenarios. Second, the TPs of the Markov process are commonly difficult to be precisely obtained in practical scenarios; hence, some TPs of the Markov process could be unknown or imprecise, resulting in the C-TPs circumstances. Particularly, when taking the HMM into consideration, the C-TPs can also appear in the conditional TPs of the joint process. Therefore, in this work, we consider that the C-TPs may simultaneously exist in both processes of the HMM, which is more practical for hidden MJSs. Additionally, the established results can cover some special cases, for instance, the cases in which C-TPs only exist in one of the processes or neither. The Markov and the joint processes of the HMM are separated by a mode separation strategy so that the C-TPs of them can be, respectively, addressed. Furthermore, only necessary conservatism in dealing with the C-TPs is further introduced. Specifically, when the TPs are perfectly known, the established results can be reduced to an existing result without increasing conservatism. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed results.},

In this article, we consider the security issue in the remote control system with a local controller under stealthy attacks. Under this framework, one controller is designed locally based on the limited measurements collected by a local sensor, and the other controller is designed remotely and is transmitted to the actuator through a wireless communication channel, which may suffer malicious attacks due to its openness. To defend attacks on remote control signal, the K–L divergence-based detector or $\chi ^{2}$ detector is often adopted. However, there may be attackers adopting stealthy attacks, which can bypass such detectors. Therefore, we analyze the existence of such attacks, and analytically characterize the worst-estimation performance degradation induced by the remote control signal attack. Further, we construct the optimal attack signal to achieve the upper bound on the estimation performance degradation. In addition, we also give countermeasures against such stealthy attacks.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the problem of dynamic event-triggered (DET) scaled consensus control for multi-agent systems (MASs) in reliable and unreliable networks. First, by introducing an auxiliary dynamic variable (ADV) obeying its own dynamics, a novel DET mechanism is designed. A nonzero exponentially decaying term is introduced in the DET scheme to enlarge the interval between two consecutive trigger instants. In reliable networks, the DET mechanism works with a set of fixed parameters for the nonzero exponentially decaying term. Second, by introducing a stochastic variable into the parameters to describe the uncertain denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a resilient DET mechanism is proposed. In unreliable networks, the resilient DET mechanism adjusts the set of parameters between two sets of values by detecting the launch of DoS attacks. Then, by choosing suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions (LKFs), some stability criteria are derived for scaled consensus of MASs both in reliable and unreliable networks. Based on the stability criteria expressed in matrix inequalities, a control design algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to calculate the control gains and event trigger parameters jointly. Finally, the effectiveness of the results is verified via a numerical example of multiple two-wheel mobile vehicles.},

However, understanding the theoretical properties of neural networks will helps to deliver the user-desired performance in such practical applications. In the literature, the fundamental analysis of a NN, such as stability analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis can be performed by modeling the neuronal activities as differential equations. Through differential equations, the rate at which information is transmitted can be experimented along with various significant factors, such as time-delays during data transmission, switching parameters with respect to time, random disturbances caused by interruption of data blocks. The present study focuses on fundamental analysis of neuronal activities through differential model. Besides, the factors, such as time-delays, exogenous disturbances, and Markovian-jumping parameter (MJP) that has an ability to degrade the stable performance of the neuronal model is incorporated in the model. Distinct to the previous studies in stochastic neural networks, the study address the synchronization problem of stochastic neural networks (SNNs) with fractional-derivative of Brownian motion and event-triggered control scheme. Theoretically, due to nonlinearties, the Lyapunov stability theory is employed to derive the sufficient stability conditions that ensure the stable performance of SNNs. In this regard, looped-Lyapunov functional candidate is considered and corresponding linear matrix inequalitys (LMIs) are derived. Technically, a model of two neurons, three neurons, and four neurons are considered with the given factors to validate the proposed theoretical conditions and controller performance and their results are picturised.},

On the one hand, it is shown that by virtue of SDS approach, the GES can still be achieved even all impulsive subsystems are unstable. On the other hand, it is shown that when the continuous dynamics of the subsystems are destabilizing, the impulse action may contribute to the stability as well as the SDS action if there is a lower restriction on the impulse frequency; when the continuous dynamics of the subsystems are stabilizing, under the help of SDS action, the destabilizing (disturbance) effect of impulses is allowed in the absence of frequent impulses.

Additionally, a novel looped-functional approach is introduced to reduce the initial constraint of the criterion. Then, the control algorithm’s performance is optimized by achieving a tighter upper bound on the integral term and applying quadratic scaling. To ensure stability and security under ACAs, a fuzzy memory sample-data controller (MSAC) is proposed. This controller leverages a machine learning algorithm to address the optimization problem of data sampling period selection, thereby minimizing resource usage and operating efficiently within the system’s limited bandwidth. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted using the dynamic equations of the inverted pendulum system (IPS) to validate the practicality of the proposed theoretical approach.},

  abstract     = {The liveness of Petri nets (PNs) means that every event can occur in any state, establishing a close relationship with the deadlock-free property of existing systems. Due to the problem of state space explosion and the infinite state space of unbounded PNs (UPNs), the time complexity and space complexity of the liveness decision are difficult to give accurate measures; at least, they are both NP-hard. Except for some particular subclasses of UPNs, there has not been an accurate method to decide the liveness of generalized UPNs. Thus, a liveness decision method from a machine learning perspective is proposed to predict probability values about UPNs’ liveness within a finite time. The method aims to learn the feature information on UPNs by deep neural networks and establish the mapping relationship between the UPNs and the liveness. First, the concept of approximating infinite space with finite states is applied to generate reachability graphs at different moments, following the firing rules of a UPN. Then, the graph convolutional network (GCN)-based reachability graph feature representation module and the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based UPN feature representation module are designed to map the reachability graphs at different moments into the low-dimensional feature space. And the feature vector that can characterize the UPN’s liveness is obtained to decide the liveness probabilistically. Finally, three datasets, including 50000 samples, are constructed. Based on these datasets and some case studies, the experimental results validate the method’s ability to make liveness decisions for UPNs, demonstrating its strong performance in terms of effectiveness and generalization.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a robust tracking control (RTC) problem based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is studied. A cost function based on the state error and derivative is used. A policy iteration (PI) algorithm that can converge is proposed to approximate the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) gradually, and the feasibility of the cost function is verified. Since there is no steady-state quadratic term $u^{T}\mathcal {R}u$ in the integrated part of the cost function, the boundedness of the cost function can be guaranteed without the discount factor. Unlike traditional ADP based on the discount cost function, it is theoretically proven that the error system can be asymptotically stable if the control input and cost function are iterated to optimal values. Because the error derivative is directly optimized, the excessive change of the error is suppressed. A critic neural network (NN) is used to approximate the optimal cost function. Considering the optimal gradient descent direction of the approximation error, an approximate optimal RTC algorithm without initial admissible input is derived. The difficulties of stability analysis caused by using the error derivative cost function are solved. The PI algorithm is proved to be converged and the error signal is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the algorithm is verified to be effective via simulation.},

However, the structural balance for a large-sized network is not easy to verify, and it is uncertain whether the gauge transformation is feasible for nonlinear networks. Without adopting the gauge transformation, this article considers finite/fixed-time bipartite controls of nonlinear neural networks (NNs) with cooperative and competitive interactions. A matrix $M$ in cooperative networks is extended to a general one in cooperative and competitive networks to design quadratic Lyapunov functions. On this basis, the finite/fixed-time bipartite synchronization criteria and adjustment times are obtained, which avoids adopting the gauge transformation in a nonlinear system. The negative cycle is found to have a very important effect on the dynamic behavior of NNs. Numerical examples validate the proposed bipartite controls of NNs in a signed graph.},

The results show that in the interactive evolution of opinion and action, when each agent can accurately estimate the opinions of other agents based on their actions in the final stage, all agents are stable agents. If the opinion leader exists, a consensus and unified action can be formed by all agents; otherwise, all agents can reach a consensus and unified action in the subnetwork.

With the only boundary input and faulty boundary measurement, it is rather challenging to estimate the accurate values of faults and state simultaneously. Therefore, most existing results only consider correct and healthy measurement for PDE systems. To this end, novel adaptation laws and an adaptive observer are designed in this work to provide exponential convergent joint fault-state estimation, where we design and leverage a set of novel filters.

  abstract     = {The black-box nature of deep reinforcement learning (RL) hinders them from real-world applications. Therefore, interpreting and explaining RL agents have been active research topics in recent years. Existing methods for post-hoc explanations usually adopt the action matching principle to enable an easy understanding of vision-based RL agents. In this article, it is argued that the commonly used action matching principle is more like an explanation of deep neural networks (DNNs) than the interpretation of RL agents. It may lead to irrelevant or misplaced feature attribution when different DNNs’ outputs lead to the same rewards or different rewards result from the same outputs. Therefore, we propose to consider rewards, the essential objective of RL agents, as the essential objective of interpreting RL agents as well. To ensure reward consistency during interpretable feature discovery, a novel framework (RL interpreting RL, denoted as RL-in-RL) is proposed to solve the gradient disconnection from actions to rewards. We verify and evaluate our method on the Atari 2600 games as well as Duckietown, a challenging self-driving car simulator environment. The results show that our method manages to keep reward (or return) consistency and achieves high-quality feature attribution. Further, a series of analytical experiments validate our assumption of the action matching principle’s limitations.},

  abstract     = {Distributed motion control is critical in multiple mobile robot systems (MMRSs). Current research usually focuses on either discrete approaches, which aim to deal with high-level collisions and deadlocks without considering the low-level motion commands, or continuous approaches, which can optimize low-level continuous commands to mobile robots but cannot deal with deadlocks efficiently. In this article, by combining discrete and continuous methods, we design a hybrid motion control method for MMRSs where each robot should move along a predefined path. First, each robot’s motion is modeled as a discrete transition system, based on which a real-time supervisory control policy is illustrated to avoid collisions and deadlocks. Second, according to the discrete decisions, the continuous speed at each discrete state is computed using model predictive control and sequential convex programming. The proposed hybrid approach brings two advantages. First, the discrete control component guarantees collision and deadlock avoidance and reduces the scale of the optimization problems. Second, continuous control optimizes the continuous speed in real time and fulfills other performance requirements like time and energy costs. To move in a fully distributed way, each robot needs to predict the motion of its neighbors by retrieving their immediately available information through communications. The simulation and real-world experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this article, an adversarial training-based deep supervised variational autoencoder (Adv-DSVAE) is proposed to enhance the performance of industrial soft sensor models. Specifically, a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE) is first designed to extract the quality-relevant feature representation. Then, a deep SVAE (DSVAE) model is constructed by stacking the hidden features extracted by SVAE, such that a high-level output-related feature representation can be captured. In this way, the missing data situation can be handled by the probabilistic latent feature representation extracted in DSVAE. To improve the robustness of a DSVAE-based soft sensor model, an adversarial training method is designed, in which adversarial examples are generated by adding perturbations to the last hidden feature of DSVAE, such that the model can perform well on both clean and perturbed feature representations. We further provide theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed Adv-DSVAE to guarantee its successful practical application. The ablation studies confirm that industrial quality prediction using the adversarial training strategy can ensure better robustness. Case studies on both the debutanizer column process and the real-world aluminum electrolysis process validate the superiority of Adv-DSVAE.},

The demand for real-time planning widely exists in robotics, numerical control manufacturing, and autonomous vehicle applications. Existing trajectory planning methods either compromise on time optimality to improve computational efficiency or suffer from at least linear time complexity, preventing the planning of long trajectories in real time. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a novel set invariant trajectory planning (SITP) method to address the problem of real-time time-optimal planning for continuous multiaxis trajectories under complete second-order kinodynamic constraints. First, a backup control strategy is synthesized to construct an implicit control invariant set (CIS). This set is designed so that a feasible control input always exists to keep the system within the defined kinodynamic bounds. Then, utilizing the principles of bang–bang control theory, the optimal control is sought within the CIS. A local greedy linear programming method is proposed to calculate the time-optimal trajectory at each control cycle. The proposed method is computationally efficient for even 1-kHz real-time applications and the planned results maintain strict global time optimality, which makes it promising in real-time planning scenarios of various automatic applications.},

Particularly, KTP is a discriminative predictor designed to reduce the feature and distribution divergences across distinct environments, which classifies high-quality solutions from a large number of randomly generated solutions in new environment. Moreover, KMS is a generative predictor by modeling the distribution of elitist solutions in last environment, which can sample superior solutions in new environment according to the dynamic change trends. In this way, the advantages of KTP and KMS strategies are combined to produce a superior initial population in new environment, which help to alleviate the negative transfer and resultantly enhance the overall performance of KTM-DMOEA.

  abstract     = {In this study, we elaborate on a realization of fuzzy clustering and the construction of fuzzy rule-based models on the basis of vertically partitioned datasets in a privacy-preserving federated learning approach. The main focus of the overall design process is to construct a family of information granules (clusters) and the corresponding fuzzy rules in the presence of a collection of vertically partitioned datasets without compromising data privacy. These datasets are composed of the same data but are described by different features, and due to security considerations, data cannot be shared. The vertical federated fuzzy clustering can be realized as an iterative optimization process composed of successive cycles: 1) computation (update) of the prototypes and partition matrices performed on the basis of local datasets and 2) an integration of the local sources of knowledge carried out on a central coordinator-server. The update of the partition matrices can be completed using a distance-based or gradient-based approach. The communication of findings between local clients and the coordinator-server is realized through exchanging partition matrices, which are more general than numeric data and can avoid leakage of data privacy. Fuzzy models are optimized in a similar manner through exchanging the gradients of the performance index computed with respect to the parameters between the clients and the global coordinator. The proposed mechanism exhibits significant originality since the realization of fuzzy modeling in a vertical federated learning environment has not been studied. Experimental studies show that the proposed federated clustering and fuzzy model design could effectively reveal the structure of the entire dataset and achieve high performance compared with the results obtained in a centralized manner.},

  abstract     = {Information entropy and its extended forms have been widely used in various rough sets to evaluate the uncertainty of a fuzzy relation or a fuzzy granularity. However, they are difficult to estimate the distinguishing information of feature subsets derived from multisource data. On the one hand, most of them only have a single granulation and cannot characterize and fuse the distinguishing information from multiple granularity levels. On the other hand, they generally lack the ability to resist noise. When the data is mingled with noise, the classification performance will be greatly affected. To overcome these problems, this article put forth some novel distinguishing indicators for fuzzy $\beta $ covering (FBC) decision systems. First, we discussed the granulation structure of FBC and introduced a new multigranulation distinguishing indicator. Second, some variants of the distinguishing indicator, i.e., multigranulation variable-precision conditional distinguishing indicator, multigranulation variable-precision joint distinguishing indicator, and multigranulation variable-precision mutual distinguishing indicator, are proposed to dynamically reflect the change of distinguishing information with respect to a given granulation structure. Finally, knowledge reduction is processed by the view of keeping the classification capacity, and a forward algorithm for feature subset selection with an optimistic variable-precision conditional distinguishing indicator is developed. Two kinds of numerical experiments are conducted on 12 benchmark datasets to examine the robustness and classification performance of the presented algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our method attains competitive classification performance compared with four popular dimensionality reduction algorithms and exhibits strong robustness when facing data noise.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to asynchronous networked filtering against sensor failures for a class of two-dimensional (2-D) Bernoulli jump systems. The purpose is to design a fault-tolerant reduced-order asynchronous (FTROA) filter that ensures asymptotic mean-square stability and $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ disturbance-attenuation performance for the resulting filtering error system, characterized by a bi-mode-jumping property. A hidden Bernoulli model is adopted to characterize asynchronous mode switching between the original 2-D system and the designed filter. A sufficient condition on the stability and $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ performance is proposed. Based on the condition, a method of the needed FTROA filter is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities by introducing an order-dependent slack matrix. Considering the calculation complexity, an alternative filter design is further presented by resorting to suitable matrix splittings and the projection theorem. Compared to the former, the latter is shown to be capable of significantly mitigating the computational burden while maintaining the desired performance. Finally, an actual example concerning the metal rolling process is provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented filter design methods.},

  abstract     = {Exploring dynamic patterns from complex and large-scale networks is a significant and challenging task in graph analysis. One of the most advanced solutions is dynamic graph representation learning, which embeds structural and temporal correlations into a representative vector for each node or subgraph. Existing models have made some successes, such as overcoming the problems of induction for unseen nodes and scalability for large-scale evolving networks. However, these models usually rely on crisp representation learning that is incapable of modeling feature fuzziness and capturing uncertainties in dynamic graphs. While real-world dynamic networks as complex systems always contain non-negligible but inestimable uncertainties in node/link attributes and network topology. These uncertainties may cause the learned representations from crisp models hard to precisely reflect network evolution. To address the issues, we propose a new dynamic graph representation learning model, called FuzzyDGL, which first incorporates fuzzy representation learning to handle the uncertainties in dynamic graphs. Through combining acrlong CDGRL with fuzzy logic, the FuzzyDGL digests both of their advantages. On the one hand, it has flexible model scalability and brilliant inductive capability. On the other hand, it can model feature fuzziness to reduce the impact of uncertainties in dynamic graphs, improving the quality of learned representations. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct two important tasks of network analysis, including link prediction and node classification, over eight real-world datasets. The experimental results show the strong competitiveness and generalization of the FuzzyDGL against a number of baseline models.},

Our research addresses the depiction of process roles using a multivariate probabilistic function. The main aim of this study is to develop a role engine for collaborative multirobot systems and optimize the behavior of the robots. The role engine is designed to assign suitable roles to each robot, generate approximately optimal process roles, update them on time, and identify instances of robot malfunction or trigger replanning when necessary. The environment considered is dynamic, involving obstacles and other agents. The role engine operates hybrid, with central initiation and decentralized action, and assigns unlabeled roles to agents. We employ the Gaussian process (GP) inference method to optimize process roles based on local constraints and constraints related to other agents. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes the environment’s skeleton to address initialization and feasibility evaluation challenges. We successfully demonstrated the proposed approach’s feasibility, and efficiency through simulation studies and real-world experiments involving diverse mobile robots.},

However, most current methods add multimodal features that are independently extracted from a given image into a reasoning model without considering their inter- and intra-relationships according to three modalities (i.e., scene texts, questions, and images). To this end, we propose a novel text-based visual question answering model, multimodal graph reasoning. Our model first extracts intramodality relationships by taking the representations from identical modalities as semantic graphs. Then, we present graph multihead self-attention, which boosts each graph representation through graph-by-graph aggregation to capture the intermodality relationship. It is a case of “so many heads, so many wits” in the sense that as more semantic graphs are involved in this process, each graph representation becomes more effective. Finally, these representations are reprojected, and we perform answer prediction with their outputs. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach realizes substantially better performance compared with other state-of-the-art models.},

On finite horizon, sufficient and necessary conditions are given for the solvability of the transformed indefinite LQ problem, and the exact optimal control and the optimal cost value are derived. Then, sufficient and necessary conditions are derived to guarantee that the transformed equivalent LQ problem for MJSs is definite, meanwhile, the unique optimal control and the non-negative optimal cost value are acquired.

The proposed 3D-VDWA includes three modules: 1) perception module; 2) motion planning module; and 3) soft wire avoidance module. The perception module is based on hue–saturation–value (HSV) range and depth information to detect and locate soft wires. The motion planning module is based on the method of the pseudo-inverse matrix to plan the path of the manipulator to the target position and orientation. The soft wire avoidance module is based on the Jacobian transpose method to dynamically avoid soft wire obstacles in the process of movement.

In this article, we propose a novel correctness analysis approach for CERPs. Given a CERP, this approach first decomposes it into a set of instance nets. Then, it excludes the invalid instance nets (each corresponds to an incomplete process instance) and adopts the stubborn set to check the structural correctness of each valid instance net without considering resource factors, as well as introduces a structure-based resource analysis (SRA) method to determine whether the resources in it are sufficient. Finally, it determines the correctness of the CERP by comparing the numbers of the correct instance nets and all valid instance nets. If the CERP is incorrect, it returns the correct instance nets, which capture the parts of the CERP that can be executed correctly. This approach is evaluated on an actual data set, and the comparison results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Coping with imbalanced data is a challenging task in practical classification problems. One of effective methods to solve imbalanced problems is to oversample the minority class. Gls SMOTE is a classical oversampling method. However, it exhibits two disadvantages, namely, a linear generation and overgeneralization. In this article, an improved synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) method, FE- SMOTE, is proposed based on the idea of the method of finite elements. FE- SMOTE not only overcomes the above two disadvantages of SMOTE but also can generate samples that are more in line with the density distribution of the original minority class than those generated by the existing SMOTE variants. The originality of the proposed method stems from constructing a simplex for every minority sample and then triangulating it to expand the region of synthetic samples from lines to space. A new definition of the relative size for triangular elements not only helps determine the number of synthetic samples but also weakens the adverse impact of outliers. Generated samples by FE- SMOTE can effectively reflect the local potential distribution structure arising around every minority sample. Compared with 16 commonly studied oversampling methods, FE- SMOTE produces promising results quantified in terms of $G$ -mean, AUC, $F$ -measure, and accuracy on 22 benchmark imbalanced datasets and the big dataset MNIST.},

Based on the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) controller and the two-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) controller, respectively, using the coprime factorization and Youla parameterization approach, the explicit expressions of the OTP limitation of the NCSs under the constraints of nonzero mean noise and packet dropouts are obtained. The results reveal that the intrinsic features of the plant and the communication parameters of the network channel will affect the OTP of the NCSs. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical results is verified by the simulation of a multi-input and multioutput plant and an inverted pendulum system.},

  abstract     = {The recursive general mixed-norm (RGMN) algorithm achieved excellent convergence performance in traditional unknown parameter identification application. However, it produces obvious estimation bias when dealing with the censored data collected from many practical scenarios. In this article, an RGMN algorithm for censored regression (CR-RGMN) is proposed for censored signal processing scenarios. The CR-RGMN algorithm utilizes a probit regression model to compensate for the sample bias caused by the sampling device. Then, a general form of the adaptive filter algorithm based on minimizing the convex mixture of $l_{a}$ and $l_{b}$ norms of the error is developed to identify the unknown parameter. The theoretical steady-state analysis in mean sense proves that the proposed CR-RGMN algorithm is unbiased, and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) is derived to predict the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. The computational complexities of the CR-RGMN and other algorithms are provided as well. Computer simulation results under robust parameter identification and channel equalization applications show that the proposed CR-RGMN algorithm achieves better performance in terms of convergence speed and steady-state MSD than the RGMN algorithm in censored data processing. And the theoretical analysis results are also verified.},

The Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (DSET) is a prevalent approach that has significant importance in managing the fusion tasks. However, existing fusion approaches have limitations in dealing with redundant information and computational complexity associated with the fusion procedure. Though conflict management has been thoroughly studied, other limitations have not been well addressed. In this article, we propose a novel approach for evidential multisource data fusion based on game-theoretic analysis. The introduction of the Shapley function considers the interaction effect of focal elements, mitigating the negative influence of redundant evidence. Additionally, the computational complexity of the fusion procedure is reduced to the same level as the approximate Bayesian update model. We provide a numerical example with conflicting and redundant evidence to show that the proposed approach outperforms current advanced weighted average-based fusion methods. Moreover, a simulation experiment demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying driver fatigue states based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals.},

  abstract     = {We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the joint goal (e.g., Should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent’s movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a “leaderless” joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other’s movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a “leader–follower” joint action. It shows that when one agent (“leader”) knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (“follower”) infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of “leaderless” and “leader–follower” joint actions observed in human–human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.},

A new online learning algorithm based on output feedback control of reachable set estimation is developed and the approximation error is bounded in an ellipsoidal reachable set. In order to dispel the effect of the approximation error of the CMAC, we develop a compensation controller by using the reachable set bounds. Controller gains and parameters of the learning algorithm are obtained via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The lack of a univocal definition for complexity is leading to a cacophony of different views and lexicons, limiting the collective ability to handle complexity effectively. This article aims to resolve this impasse by identifying or developing a useful and acceptable definition of complexity by focusing on how this term is used in practice, and hence determine which definition resonates with the broadest possible community. To understand how the term is being used, several popular complexity-definitions have been identified and de-constructed into component definitional elements. These elements are then compared to the descriptions of complexity in a range of key community documents to infer which definitions most align with the document authors usage of the complex term. The results indicate that new emergent definitions are far more popular than the established dictionary and complexity theory definitions, supporting previous surveys. These usage insights are then analyzed to develop a definition that can unify, as much as possible, the different complexity perspectives. The proposed definition establishes that complex(ity) is when relationships between elements are weaved together such that they are not fully comprehended, leading to insufficient certainty between cause and effect. This definition was tested at a series of international workshops and accepted as the most useful definition.},

Specifically, a global prescribed time function is proposed and an unconstrained variable is constructed to replace the constrained tracking error. Under this framework, an appealing feature of the designed controller is that the tracking error can converge to a specified range within a prescribed time and eventually converge to zero asymptotically starting from any initial conditions, where the prescribed time and accuracy can be directly given.

First, for state-constrained problems, the state transformation technique is applied to remove the restriction that the virtual control input needs to satisfy the “feasibility condition.” Second, to deal with dead zone, fixed-time compensation filters are introduced. Different from the existing compensating filters, the proposed filter can make the filter state converge faster to better eliminate the effect of dead zone by introducing higher-order terms of the filter state. To avoid the “explosion of complexity” problem inherent in backstepping, fast fixed-time filters (FFTFs) are developed. Unlike the existing first-order filters and fixed-time filters (FTFs), the proposed filters can achieve faster convergence of the filtering state. Unlike the existing dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM), the proposed improved DETM has larger event-triggered intervals (ETIs) and is more resource-saving, by adding two dynamic variables adjusted by historical triggered information. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme guarantees that: all states are within constraints, all closed-loop system signals are bounded, and tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin in a fixed time. Finally, a jerk circuit system verifies the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Besides, the individual’s reputation is taken into account and utilized to choose a suitable neighbor for the strategy updating of the individual. Within this model, we investigate the statistical number of individuals staying in different game states and the expected number fits well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transition rates between different game states, payoff parameters, the reputation mechanism, and different time scales of strategy updates on cooperative behavior, and our findings demonstrate that both the transition rates and reputation mechanism have a remarkable influence on the evolution of cooperation. Additionally, we examine the relationship between network size and cooperation frequency, providing valuable insights into the robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {Chemotherapy optimization based on mathematical models is a promising direction of personalized medicine. Personalizing, thus optimizing treatments, may have multiple advantages, from fewer side effects to lower costs. However, personalization is a complicated process in practice. We discuss a mathematical model of tumor growth and therapy optimization algorithms that can be used to personalize therapies. The therapy generation is based on the concept of keeping the drug level over a specified value. A mixed-effect model is used for parametric identification, and the doses are calculated using a two-compartment model for drug pharmacokinetics, and a nonlinear pharmacodynamics and tumor dynamics model. We propose personalized therapy generation algorithms for having a maximal effect and minimal effective doses. We handle inter- and intra-patient variability for the minimal effective dose therapy. Results from mouse experiments for the personalized therapy are discussed and the algorithms are compared to a generic protocol based on overall survival. The experimental results show that the introduced algorithms significantly increased the overall survival of the mice, demonstrating that by control engineering methods an efficient modality of cancer therapy may be possible.},

The optimization of multiple performance targets with multiactuators is intractable, which involves trajectory tracking and handling stability. Additionally, the optimization of tire friction usage remains a knotty problem. Therefore, this article develops a global chassis multiactuator integrated control framework, named by the chassis domain controller (CDC), to realize chassis global dynamics optimization for automated vehicles. Aiming at realizing more efficient, reliable, and flexible mobility, this framework defines each individual wheel to be fully adjustable and controllable to overcome the individual actuation limitation of traditional chassis structures. Global chassis dynamic modeling is formulated based on the analysis of distributed and controllable tire modules and vehicle dynamics motions. A game-theoretical control scheme is proposed to formulate chassis multiactuator integrated control, and the chassis global dynamics can be optimized by guaranteeing a Nash equilibrium for this game. Various experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method, and it suggests the CDC merits further studies to enhance the dynamics performance of automated vehicles in full situations.},

However, the state-of-the-art LA-based methods can select only the optimal action or optimal subset and cannot select an arbitrary target subset like selecting the best and worst actions or the ones in a given rank range. In order to solve the problem of selecting a given arbitrary subset of actions, this work proposes a novel pursuit learning scheme, called a discretized equal pursuit reward-inaction algorithm for arbitrary subset selection ( ${\text {DEP}_{RI}}$ -AS). The proposed scheme pursues the currently estimated arbitrary action subset and makes the probabilities of selecting each action in the subset equal, so as to increase the convergence speed. The proof of its $\epsilon $ -optimality property is presented. Simulation results of comparison experiments, parameter analysis, and a real-world application demonstrate its power in selecting a given subset of user-desired actions.},

It becomes more prominent in large-scale group decision making (LSGDM). Therefore, consensus discussion is necessary to make the final decision result represent all DMs’ opinions as much as possible. In this regard, this article analyzes the conflicts between individual and subgroup adjustments and between subgroup and group adjustments by the built models. Concerning intrasubgroup adjustment surplus and intersubgroup adjustment surplus, we regard them as cost allocation problems in cooperative games under the consensus constraint. Then, the two-stage Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment game (NBCAG) is introduced to make the allocation result as fair as possible. Meanwhile, the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment scheme for LSGDM is proposed. Considering the heterogeneity of DMs and subgroups, two-stage asymmetrical NBCAGs are further constructed. In light of these results, a new LSGDM method is proposed. Numerical and comparative analysis is also performed. This article offers the first LSGDM method that emphasizes the fairness and Pareto optimality of consensus adjustment by two-stage Nash-bargaining games.},

  abstract     = {Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning.},

The most frequently used T-norms for computing the firing strengths are product and minimum operators of which the former is often preferred because of its differentiability. However, for high-dimensional problems, the product T-norm suffers from the numeric underflow problem. Here, we primarily focus on addressing the problem that is associated with the use of the T-norms for designing high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). For the product T-norm, we construct an HDFIS named HDFIS-prod, which easily escapes from the numeric underflow problem. The main novelty is that we propose an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). For the minimum T-norm, an empirical observation led us to develop a mechanism that has the natural ability to deal with super high-dimensional problems, which results in another HDFIS named HDFIS-min. Both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min are tested on 18 datasets with feature dimensions varying from 1024 to 120450. The simulation results demonstrate that both of them have competitive performance on handling high-dimensional datasets.},

However, recent experiments have demonstrated that the performance of multitask learning depends on how to balance the relationship between different tasks. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed to adjust per-task gradient directions or design a more appropriate task reweighting scheme based on task-level statistics. In this article, we discuss how to boost the performance of multitask learning by using more fine-grained sample gradient information. To this end, we propose the concept of sample gradient similarity, which measures the agreement between the sample gradient for a task and the true gradient. Based on this concept, greater weight is assigned to more consistent tasks and more robust training samples to improve the training process of multitask learning. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on a series of challenging multitask datasets.},

A predictive sliding-mode control method is proposed to achieve the security coordination. In this method, a sliding variable for the improvement of the robustness of closed-loop systems is introduced to defend random deception attacks. Then, a Diophantine equation is applied to develop a prediction model in an incremental high-order fully actuated (IHOFA) form. Based on this model, multistep ahead predictions of sliding variables are established to realize the optimization of coordinated control performance and the defense of random deception attacks. By utilizing the Lyapunov function and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach, a necessary and sufficient condition is given to maintain the stability and consensus of closed-loop NHOFAMAs.

Specifically, an attack detection algorithm constructed based upon the acknowledgment (ACK) signal is provided to detect the sleeping and active intervals of DoS attacks. To reduce information transmission during the synchronization-seeking process, a new kind of Lyapunov function-based resilient event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is designed to modulate the information transmission between the master and slave systems. Then, an event-based impulsive controller is designed to achieve synchronization in the master–slave systems with event-triggered communication and communication delay between the event generator and the controller, where the impulsive control instants are produced by the resilient ETM rather than prescribed. Furthermore, a resilient sampled-data-based ETM and an event-based controller consisting of hybrid state feedback and impulsive controllers are developed. Under the proposed ETMs and controllers, some sufficient yet efficient criteria are derived to guarantee the master–slave synchronization of NNs. The influence of the attack parameters and triggering parameters on the synchronization performance is also discussed. Finally, two numerical examples and an application in image encryption and decryption based on the master–slave chaotic systems are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

NESO based on IT2FNN is designed to estimate the system states and total disturbance, and then realize the active compensation of the total disturbance including unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Then, the ASTW adopts a special segmented dynamic adaptive gain super-twisting control to offset the remaining uncertainty and estimation error, and further weaken the system chattering. Simulation and experimental verification prove the designed controller not only has higher current compensation accuracy but also has smaller system chattering, showing better steady state and dynamic performance than the existing methods.},

First, a novel resource-constrained attack model is proposed, in which there are only a finite number of attack instants within a fixed interval. Second, the evolution of the estimation error covariance under attacks is obtained, and the covariance at the ultimate instant of the attack interval is regarded as the attacker’s cost function. Moreover, a relaxed condition of the strict stealthiness, named Kullback–Leibler divergence, is employed to describe the attacker’s the stealthiness metric. Third, the one-time and holistic optimization problems of stealthy attacks are solved by exploiting the Lagrange multiplier method. Then the constrained optimal attack strategies are obtained to produce the largest ultimate estimation error covariance. Finally, two simulation cases are provided to confirm the correctness of the designed attack strategies.},

This article addresses the original disturbance decoupling problem of singular Boolean networks (SBNs) from a new point of view. The robust solvability of SBNs is discussed by the truth matrix of algebraic constraints first. In order to cope with the multiple solutions, an SBN with disturbances is equivalently transformed into a switched restricted Boolean network (BN). Then utilizing a new approach based on the reduced state transition matrix, the relationship between original disturbance decoupling and robust indistinguishability is revealed, which also builds a link with robust observability. By virtue of a parameter extraction mapping, a verifiable criterion is presented for original disturbance decoupling. Moreover, our approach is still applicable to BNs and of lower computational complexity than the existing results. Finally, illustrative examples are worked out to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

First, we introduce the linearly separable discriminant method to analyze the data structure characteristics. Second, we extend the circular linear CGMDH neural network model and propose a circular quadratic nonlinear CGMDH (QCGMDH) neural network model. Finally, according to the data structure characteristics and resampling technique, we adaptively select and train the most appropriate CGMDH neural network model from two types of CGMDH. To analyze the effectiveness of the constructed system, the experimental results of 16 real-valued classification data sets show both linearly separable discrimination and random oversampling technology can help to improve the classification performance. Further, to verify its customer classification performance, we conduct an empirical analysis on 14 real-valued customer classification data sets and find that its customer classification performance is significantly better than that of the other nine models and comparable to that of the circular QCGMDH neural network model.},

Meanwhile, the decentralized event-triggered control issue is transformed into a set of optimal control issues. Then, the execution of nominal subsystem is based on the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with an event-triggering condition which increases the algorithm efficiency. Moreover, we derive the associated event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation which arising in the discounted-cost optimal event-triggered control issues of nominal subsystems.

Later, the experience replay (ER) approach is introduced into a novel weight tuning mechanism, which converts the traditional persistence of excitation (PE) condition into an easy-checked rank condition. Theoretically, the stability of the system and the exclusion of Zeno behavior are demonstrated.

First, a data-driven-based multiple-input multiple-output model is established for the NOx emissions and the CE of the MSWI process based on Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy neural network. Second, an adaptive large-scale multiobjective competitive swarm optimization (ALMOCSO) algorithm is designed for solving the multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) of the MSWI process. A comprehensive evaluation system is proposed to complete the optimization foundation, and an adaptive scheme and multistrategy learning are proposed to improve the optimization effect of the ALMOCSO algorithm in solving complex MOPs. Then, a Pareto optimal set obtained from massive historical data is utilized as optimization reference to realize the dynamic multiobjective optimization for the NOx emissions and the CE of the MSWI process. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology for optimizing the MSWI process are confirmed by the experiments using the data collected from a real MSWI plant. The results indicate that the modeling accuracy is satisfactory, and the CE is improved over 10% and the reduction of the NOx emissions is achieved 15.58%.},

In this article, an HFS problem with learning effects and release dates is investigated from a practical application perspective. For large-scale instances, a dispatching rule-based heuristic is developed with theoretical performance guarantees by demonstrating the asymptotic optimality and the tight worst-case bound. For small-scale instances, a branch-and-boun3d algorithm is designed to obtain an exact solution. An elaborate branching scheme, an idle-time-based pruning rule, and a task-splitting-based lower bound effectively reduce the search space. For medium-scale instances, a hybrid shuffled frog-leaping algorithm combined with macro evolution and local intensification is presented to search for high-quality solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the developed algorithms against the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), as named by the World Health Organization (WHO), has spread to over 200 countries. The WHO has declared this disease as a worldwide public health emergency. One of the most difficult tasks in combating this epidemic is to identify and segregate the afflicted people. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) is the most common pathology test used to diagnose this infection. Studies show that the RT-PCR test has a low-positive rate and sometimes becomes ineffective in diagnosing infection. In some cases, computed tomography (CT) scans reveal acute pneumonia and pulmonary anomalies. Therefore, CT scans are used together with RT-PCR tests to confirm infected people. Existing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques require a large number of CT scans for training, which is a time-consuming process. Visual inspection shows that most CT scans of COVID-19 cases have broken, blurred, and ambiguous edges for infectious areas. Another major issue with these images is the heterogeneous intensity of the pixels, high noise, and low resolution. As a result of all these issues, the problem of effective edges/boundaries of various areas of CT scans of COVID-19 cases cannot be resolved by the current edge detection approach. Indeed, improper selection of edges can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of diseases through CT scans of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a diagnostic method in addition to the RT-PCR test that can extract useful information from the minimum number of chest CT scans of suspected COVID-19 cases. This study introduces a new ambiguous edge detection method (AEDM) for identifying the edges/boundaries of different regions in CT scans of COVID-19 cases. The proposed AEDM is developed on the basis of ambiguous set (AS) theory, which is highly efficient in processing ambiguous pixel information. For simulation purposes, various CT scans of COVID-19 cases are classified into three different categories: 1) low infection (LI); 2) moderate infection (MI); and 3) severe infection (SI). Empirical analysis shows that the proposed AEDM can effectively highlight the edges in CT scans of three different categories in comparison with other well-known edge detection methods.},

Many practical control systems are subject to the constraint of communication resources and input dead zone, which affects the system’s performance and even results in system instability. To handle the above problems, an extended radial basis function neural networks (ERBFNNs) adaptive event-triggered control method is developed to enable the online compensation of input dead zone and schedule the update of control signals. On this foundation, based on the fixed-time stability theorem, a practical fixed-time event-triggered controller is established by the backstepping technique. Technically, the controller can guarantee that the tracking error converges into a small and adjustable set in a fixed time under different initial states, and the boundary of convergence time is dependent on the adjustable design parameters. Meanwhile, all the closed-loop signals are bounded, the communication resources are saved, and the Zeno behavior is also avoided. Finally, some simulation examples are given to illustrate the validity of the presented strategy.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3-D) object recognition has achieved satisfied achievement in both academia and industry. However, most traditional 3-D object classification methods implicitly assume that there are abundant training data from a static distribution. To relax the assumption, we target on a more challenging and realistic setting: few-shot incremental 3-D object learning (FSI3DL), which intends to incrementally classify the new coming 3-D objects with few training data. In order to achieve this, two key challenges need to be concerned: 1) the catastrophic forgetting issue caused by incremental 3-D data with irregular and redundant topological structures and 2) the overfitting issue caused by few-shot training data. To address the first challenge, we use Laplacian spectral analysis based on 3-D meshes to design an embedding network that consists of super-vertex graph convolution (SVGC) module and topology-aware graph attention (TAGA) module. The SVGC is designed to construct the discriminative local topological characteristics for representing the irregular 3-D meshes better. The TAGA is designed to identify redundant topological characteristics. To address the second challenge, a fine-tuning strategy with model alignment regularization is investigated. Furthermore, an embedding space selection and fusion (ESSF) strategy is proposed in the inference phase to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting further. Combining SVGC, TAGA, and alignment regularization with ESSF strategy, a novel topology-aware graph convolution network (TopGCN) is proposed to address the FSI3DL. Experiments on representative 3-D classification datasets validate the superiority of TopGCN.},

Next, the complex explosion issue caused by the backstepping technique is effectively avoided based on command filtering feedback control. Compared with the standard backstepping technique, which has avoided the analytical computations of the derivatives of virtual control functions and has dramatically reduced the computational burden. Finally, an example of the one-link manipulator with motor dynamic systems is provided to verify the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {A solution concept (or stability definition) determines whether a state is stable for a decision-maker (DM) in a Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. An equilibrium according to that stability definition is a state stable for all DMs. Thus, stability definitions correspond to anticipated patterns of collective behavior in conflicts. This study focuses on a matrix method to identify stable states in a graph model with multiple DMs whose preferences are fuzzy relations, possibly incomplete. The four distinct approaches to incomplete fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) are integrated with five classical stability definitions to produce matrix representations of twenty incomplete fuzzy stability definitions. Behavioral analysis and knowledge of DMs’ IFPRs can then be applied to identify which stability definitions are consistent with desired equilibrium states. Matrix representations and behavior analysis are illustrated using a model of a real-world conflict—a demolition dispute in Jiangsu Province, China.},

In consideration of the RH mechanism of model predictive control (MPC), the approximate optimal control problem based on the HDP algorithm is transformed into a battery of subproblems. Then, the terminal state constraint related with the current prediction horizon is considered such that the terminal state is forced into the neighborhood of the system equilibrium point. In addition, the asymmetric control constraints are introduced to release the pressure of actuator saturation, so that the control input is well confined within the given constraint range. Meanwhile, relevant results of the stability proof are also displayed based on the Lyapunov approach. Finally, the constrained RH-HDP algorithm has been applied in two kinds of systems to verify its effectiveness. Comparative experiments with the traditional HDP algorithm have been carried out to verify the superiority of the present algorithm.},

First, based on the differential inclusion theory and Kakutani’s fixed point theorem, the periodicity of solutions is proved and sufficient criteria are derived. Second, fixed-time (FxT) stabilization is studied by designing a new control law with a unified steepness exponent, which is more simpler than the previous ones with two steepness exponents. Since the delays are nondifferentiable and unbounded, rather than constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, the FxT stabilization is analyzed and estimation of the settling-time (ST) is given through analyzing the state variables inside and outside the unit spherical area. The energy consumption is also estimated when the FxT stabilization is achieved under the designed controller. Third, given that smaller ST and lower energy consumption are usually preferred, the optimization problem is further considered. The optimal control parameters are selected based on the normalization approach and maximum principle. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated by a numerical example, where the delay function is composed of the Takagi function and the absolute value function.},

The designed distributed controller guarantees that the synchronization errors between followers and the leader are evolved within a prescribed range, meanwhile, states in the closed-loop system are bounded. Moreover, the results are independent of the initial values. In addition, by applying command-filtered technology, the complex derivation of virtual control in the traditional backstepping procedure is avoided, thus, the computational burden on each agent is greatly reduced. At the same time, the neighborhood information which is necessary for agent $i$ to construct its controller is minimized, i.e., only $x_{j1}$ and $x_{j2}$ are transmitted throughout the network. As a result, the communication burden of the network is reduced as well. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

An event-triggered controller (ETC) with mode-dependent random deception attacks is put forward such that the considered system realizes exponential stabilization almost surely (ES a.s.). The ETC is not only mode-dependent but also excludes Zeno behavior automatically with tunable parameters to adjust the event-triggering (ET) numbers according to practical needs. By using the ergodic theory and designing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, two criteria are set up to ensure the ES a.s. It is interesting to discover that the ETC is not necessary to control each mode to be stable and the dwell time of an unstable mode can be very large, which greatly reduces the conservatism and saves the control cost. Moreover, the weights of ET mechanism and control gains are obtained for all the switching modes by solving linear matrix inequalities.

An algorithm is provided to find the set of pinning subsystems.

Second, the equivalent condition for the SGBS to be stabilizable is obtained, meanwhile, the corresponding Stackelberg strategy and optimal index under this condition are given by REs. Different from the previous works, in the optimization process of the leader, we obtain the linear Stackelberg strategy based on state feedback by applying the matrix maximum principle.

For the sake of decreasing triggering rates and maintaining control performance, on the basis of the quantization range of the dynamic quantizer, a novel triggering condition is efficiently constructed. As such, sufficient conditions are attained to maintain the prescribed performance within the finite-time interval.

  abstract     = {It is well common for industrial processes to employ a hierarchical control structure involving a basic loop process and an operation loop process with two timescales. However, the control system suffers from another multirate challenge where control and sampling rates may differ even within a single loop. Additionally, the underlying complex mechanism of the operation loop further complicates the accurate modeling of its dynamics, especially in the presence of external unknown disturbances. This gives rise to the difficulty in obtaining desired control performance. To overcome these problems, this article develops a novel operational optimal tracking control method for a class of multirate systems subject to unknown disturbances. To this end, a lifting technique is integrated with a general model predictive controller for the basic loop process, aimed at handling the asynchronism phenomenon and achieving loop setpoint tracking control. Furthermore, a nonlinear disturbance observer is used for estimating the unknown external disturbance of the operation loop process. In this way, offset-free tracking control of the system, along with loop setpoints optimization, can be achieved using the policy iteration reinforcement learning algorithm. The convergence of the proposed method is analyzed and tangible improvements are verified by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has been getting increasing attention in robot learning, benefiting from its ability to avoid hazardous exploration and learn policies directly from precollected samples. Approximate policy iteration (API) is one of the most commonly investigated ORL approaches in robotics, due to its linear representation of policies, which makes it fairly transparent in both theoretical and engineering analysis. One open problem of API is how to design efficient and effective basis functions. The broad learning system (BLS) has been extensively studied in supervised and unsupervised learning in various applications. However, few investigations have been conducted on ORL. In this article, a novel incremental ORL approach with sparse broad critic approximation (BORL) is proposed with the advantages of BLS, which approximates the critic function in a linear manner with randomly projected sparse and compact features and dynamically expands its broad structure. The BORL is the first extension of API with BLS in the field of robotics and ORL. The approximation ability and convergence performance of BORL are also analyzed. Comprehensive simulation studies are then conducted on two benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed BORL can obtain comparable or better performance than conventional API methods without laborious hyperparameter fine-tuning work. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of BORL in practical robotic applications, a variable force tracking problem in robotic ultrasound scanning (RUSS) is investigated, and a learning-based adaptive impedance control (LAIC) algorithm is proposed based on BORL. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LAIC compared with conventional force tracking methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective optimization problems whose objectives have different evaluation costs are commonly seen in the real world. Such problems are now known as multiobjective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives (HE-MOPs). So far, however, only a few studies have been reported on addressing HE-MOPs, and most of them focus on biobjective problems with one fast objective and one slow objective. In this work, we aim to deal with HE-MOPs having more than two black-box and heterogeneous objectives. To this end, we develop a multiobjective Bayesian evolutionary optimization (BEO) approach to HE-MOPs that can alleviate search biases resulting from the different numbers of function evaluations allowed for the cheap and expensive objectives, which is achieved by designing a new acquisition function that penalizes the search bias toward the fast objectives, thereby achieving a balance between convergence and diversity. In addition, to make the best use of the different amounts of training data while avoiding increasing the computational cost, an ensemble consisting of two Gaussian processes is constructed for each cheap objective, one trained on the data collected before the Bayesian optimization starts, and the other on those evaluated during the BEO. Empirical studies on widely used multi-/many-objective benchmark problems whose objectives are assumed to be heterogeneously expensive demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find high-quality solutions for HE-MOPs compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Sparse optimization problems have been successfully applied to a wide range of research areas, and useful insights and elegant methods for proving the stability and convergence of neurodynamic algorithms have been yielded in previous work. This article develops several neurodynamic algorithms for sparse signal recovery by solving the $\ell _{1}$ regularization problem. First, in the framework of the locally competitive algorithm (LCA), modified LCA (MLCA) with finite-time convergence and MLCA with fixed-time convergence are designed. Then, the sliding-mode control (SMC) technique is introduced and modified, i.e., modified SMC (MSMC), which is combined with LCA to design MSMC-LCA with finite-time convergence and MSMC-LCA with fixed-time convergence. It is shown that the solutions of the proposed neurodynamic algorithms exist and are unique under the observation matrix satisfying restricted isometry property (RIP) condition, while finite-time or fixed-time convergence to the optimal points is shown via Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, combining the notions of finite-time stability (FTS) and fixed-time stability (FxTS), upper bounds on the convergence time of the proposed neurodynamic algorithms are given, and the convergence results obtained for the MLCA and MSMC-LCA with fixed-time convergence are shown to be independent of the initial conditions. Finally, simulation experiments of signal recovery and image recovery are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed neurodynamic algorithms.},

By lumping all the time-varying parameters and control coefficients into an augmented time-varying vector, and combining the congelation of variables approach, a robust adaptive controller, without the restriction of the persistent excitation (PE) conditions, is constructed for the systems with external disturbances to guarantee the boundedness of all closed-loop variables. Then, by proper transformation, a novel adaptive control scheme is developed to achieve asymptotic stability for strict-feedback nonlinear time-varying systems without external disturbances. In addition, a tracking control method is acquired from the proposed adaptive control method.

In addition, by partial factorization, inner–outer factorization, and the spectrum decomposition method, the performance expression under 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) controller has been obtained. The results show that the performance of ITDS is influenced not only by the inherent properties of system, including unstable zeros, time delay, nonminimum phase (NMP) zeros, and their directions in the given device but also by network factors, such as bandwidth, packet loss, and AGWN.

  abstract     = {Convolutional feature-based broad learning with long short-term memory (CBLSTM) is proposed to recognize multidimensional facial emotions in human–robot interaction. The CBLSTM model consists of convolution and pooling layers, broad learning (BL), and long- and short-term memory network. It aims to obtain the depth, width, and time scale information of facial emotion through three parts of the model, so as to realize multidimensional facial emotion recognition. CBLSTM adopts the structure of BL after processing was done at the convolution and pooling layer to replace the original random mapping method and extract features with more representation ability, which significantly reduces the computational time of the facial emotion recognition network. Moreover, we adopted incremental learning, which can quickly reconstruct the model without a complete retraining process. Experiments on three databases are developed, including CK+, MMI, and SFEW2.0 databases. The experimental results show that the proposed CBLSTM model using multidimensional information produces higher recognition accuracy than that without time scale information. It is 1.30% higher on the CK+ database and 1.06% higher on the MMI database. The computation time is 9.065 s, which is significantly shorter than the time reported for the convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, the proposed method obtains improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It improves the recognition rate by 3.97%, 1.77%, and 0.17% compared to that of CNN-SIPS, HOG-TOP, and CMACNN in the CK+ database, 5.17%, 5.14%, and 3.56% compared to TLMOS, ALAW, and DAUGN in the MMI database, and 7.08% and 2.98% compared to CNNVA and QCNN in the SFEW2.0 database.},

To deal with the impact of uncertainty on the system, the nominal system of the original system is adopted and the cost functions associated with each player are appropriately chosen to convert the robust regulation problem of multiplayer differential games into an optimal regulation problem. Furthermore, the purpose of combining the cost function relevant to each player with the CBF is to make the system states evolve in the safe area. Different from the classical actor–critic dual neural network (NN), each player only needs a critic NN to approach the corresponding cost function without the restriction of the initial stabilizing control. Combined with the Lyapunov stability theory, under the combined influence of random disturbances and state constraints, the state and critic NN weights of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, two simulation examples are used to verify the validity of the presented scheme.},

For latency or security reasons, compressed data may be processed at the edge, i.e., along the path from sensors to the cloud, for some purposes such as anomaly detection. However, the performance of a detector distinguishing between normal and anomalous behavior may be affected by the loss of information due to compression. We here analyze how lossy compression affects the performance of a generic anomaly detector. This relationship is formalized in terms of information-theoretic quantities. Within such a framework we leverage a Gaussian assumption to derive analytical results regarding the importance of white noise as a representative of both the average and asymptotic anomalies. Moreover, in an anomaly-agnostic scenario, we also show the existence of a level of compression for which an anomaly is undetectable though compression is not completely destructive. Numerical evidence confirms that the proposed information-theoretic quantities anticipate the performance of practical compressors and detectors in the case of Gaussian and non-Gaussian signals allowing an assessment of the tradeoff between compression and detection.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a velocity-free adaptive controller is proposed for the tracking control of servo mechanisms with friction compensation. A continuously differentiable friction model is employed to compensate for the dominant friction nonlinearity of servo mechanisms. Besides, a projection-type adaptive law is applied to handle parameter uncertainties in the system model. Since only the output position signal is directly measurable, an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) is constructed to estimate the indeterminate velocity state, which can also provide an estimation of unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, the dynamic gain switching of AESO can effectively suppress the peaking phenomenon at the motion beginning. Specifically, the parameter adaptation law utilizes the desired velocity state instead of the estimated value, avoiding the coupling problem between parameter and state estimation. The proposed control strategy theoretically demonstrates the transient performance and boundedness of the error in output tracking. Asymptotic stabilization of the system can also be implemented when only parameter uncertainty exists. Comparative experiments are conducted on a linear motor platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},
