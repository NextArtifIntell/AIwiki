@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Despite showcasing Braitenberg vehicles, this book provides a departure from the traditional work of Braitenberg (1984) in a number of important ways. Whereas Braitenberg relied on an anthropomorphized toy model that mimics complex behaviors, this work focuses on the geometry of dynamical pairwise physical interactions between agents. Hotton and Yoshimi’s approach focuses on open dynamical systems, which provides us with two state spaces to evaluate vehicle behavior: the agent state and the agent’s environmental state. The input–output relations of a Braitenberg vehicle pair demonstrate these open dynamics: The output of one vehicle is related to the input of the other vehicle. This produces not only a continuous feedback loop but also interactions that produce the fundamental elements of emergent behaviors seen in swarming and flocking models (Calvao &amp;amp; Brigatti, 2014). Phenomenologically, these are not social interactions per se but are related to the literature on coupled dynamical systems.Hotton and Yoshimi also advocate for minimal embodiment as a means to investigate pairwise vehicle interactions using simple interaction signals, such as avoidance rules. The agents themselves are not classical Braitenberg vehicles but disk-shaped bodies more amenable to the authors’ dynamical systems analysis. Their kinematics are characterized on a Euclidean plane, while the addition of propulsion systems and additional behavioral complexity provides a means to characterize vehicle behaviors in terms of differential equations and nonlinear delays. An internal model (or neurons and their connection weights) is implemented using Simbrain (Tosi &amp;amp; Yoshimi, 2016). Acting as an internal model for generating behavior, Simbrain enables additive neuronal networks in which the constituent neurons are specialized for specific behaviors. This is a special case of the connectionist paradigm and was underexplored in Braitenberg’s work. Motor neurons enable turning behaviors, neurons with a fixed action strength provide linear velocity control, and angular velocity neurons allow the agent to calculate differentials. These provide a mix of straightforward mechanical outputs (3-D space, 1-D time) and higher-level representations, enabling a rich repertoire of behaviors.Interactions are characterized in a phase space, and the resulting geometry both constrains the outcomes of these interactions and provides paths of least resistance characterized by six-dimensional geometries. This mathematical representation (external to the agents) yields an intrinsic symmetry along with transformation groups, which facilitates a dynamical systems analysis. Ultimately, the authors want to find the invariant set of dynamical systems where a set of interactions initializes and persistently resides within a constrained subspace of the system. Pairwise vehicle dynamics are explained in terms of two vehicles revolving around a common center point, which reduces the complexity of pairwise interactions to attracting and repelling sets. These sets provide a description of long-term behavior as single collections of potential orbits.Chapter 3 introduces us to dynamical systems theory, which builds over the course of the book. A lengthy discussion of methodology is necessary to make sense of the dynamical trajectories resulting from vehicle interactions. For example, as the vehicles wander in their quasi-periodic orbits, it can be hard to determine what constitutes a stable state. One way to understand dynamical states is via two key concepts: equivariance and conjugacy. These are equivalent points in a phase space that are shared by two agents. This space is characterized by attractor points and basins, which yield equilibrium behaviors. In this manner, chapter 4 introduces us to open dynamical systems for pairs of vehicles. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 provide densely presented information on relative equilibria, an instance of hydrostatic equilibrium where the vehicles interact under fixed conditions. Under relative equilibrium, there is a lack of forces acting on the vehicles at constant velocity. This yields a mechanically static set of interactions for various positions and headings. Although this is decidedly not in the spirit of the dynamical systems approach to cognitive science, it does allow us to delineate what behaviors are plausible and even probable owing to the constraints of embodiment and the internal model.The preliminaries of topology and complex systems provide tools for understanding how states can be extracted from behaviors that involve two vehicles rotating around a common center of mass. Not only do the authors provide us with mathematical rigor for this purpose but their approach is also consistent with the type of epicyclic motion that Raño (2010) observed among single Braitenberg vehicle behaviors. Returning to the dynamics of pairwise interactions, we discover that the connectivity of weight structures in the internal models of corresponding vehicles matters greatly. Two agents with concordant weights exhibit complex dynamics, whereas two agents with oppositional weights yield a whole new set of dynamics. This is reminiscent of the cross talk mechanisms that Braitenberg explored in his Type 2, 3, and 4 vehicles.The authors also make Braitenberg vehicle behaviors relevant to cybernetic approaches. Whereas dynamical systems provide information about behavioral and interaction states as they change over time, the role of cybernetic regulation also involves homeomorphism, or the mapping between the state space of two agents engaged in pairwise interaction. Implicitly, they also draw parallels between more dynamic photic inputs and agent–environment mappings by discussing W. Grey Walter’s tortoises (see Holland, 2003). This relationship between sensation and action supports the notion of perceptual control and reminds us that approaches to autonomous vehicles must consider collective behavior and embodiment.Chapter 8 ties together the lengthy discussion and exposition of dynamical systems analysis by making Braitenberg vehicle dynamics relevant to complexity theory and organismal models of simple behaviors. Though the authors recognize that their model is constrained, they propose that a billiard ball model of Braitenberg vehicles (where agents generate frictional forces) can lead to dissipative and spatially extended systems. This has ties to spiral waves in excitable media and soft active material systems. Chapter 8 also discusses how feedback in locomotory systems characterized using open dynamical systems is crucial to understanding the behaviors of motile cells, Ascidian larvae, and dragonfly pairs.This leaves us with a methodological innovation but three unresolved questions with respect to the study of embodied autonomous behavior:The formulation presented here is highly relevant to simple neuromechanical systems. As mentioned in the comparisons to animal models, the perception–action loop is not enough to characterize behavioral diversity. We must also consider if and how such systems synchronize their movement in ways that result in both collective behaviors and advanced social behaviors. There are alternatives to the model presented here. For example, we might utilize a more direct multiscale model: not only an excitable internal model for each agent (e.g., spiking neural networks) but also an excitable model of agents (e.g., Kuramoto oscillators). But of course, this type of model leaves out the role of embodiment.The model presented here introduces an interesting consequence in terms of embodied neural control. The C. elegans locomotor circuitry (Zhen &amp;amp; Samuel, 2015) involves a fixed set of cells that produces a consistent output. Yet this activity can be modulated by other neurons depending on chemosensory inputs, life-history stage, and perhaps even current mental state. If we move to larger connectomes, the function of specific neurons (in terms of their behavioral correlates) is even less clear. How do dynamical systems approaches fare in these cases? The dynamics of small connectomes (50–5,000 neurons) and photoreceptor inputs (Atanov et al., 2024) into an open dynamical systems Braitenberg vehicle paradigm might provide enlightenment.A number of interesting findings are relevant to the analysis of vehicle phenotypes but not fully explored in this book. Hotton (2004) has shown that epitrochoid and peritrochoid constructions act to constrain the shape of a vehicle body when a spherical body is in motion around a center of gravity. This not only influences vehicle behaviors but also is relevant to the relative growth of agents’ morphology, which is a key insight when the body/internal model phenotype is allowed to grow and develop (Dvoretskii et al., 2022).A point for further study involves determining the best approach for studying cognitive phenomena, where there has traditionally been a rivalry between dynamical systems, connectionist models, symbolic representations, and hybrid approaches (Beer, 2000). This book suggests that although dynamical approaches provide much insight into understanding complex behavioral states in a toy model, a complete answer really involves a hybrid approach. Indeed, Hotton and Yoshimi utilize dynamical, connectionist, and symbolic approaches throughout, although the focus is on dynamical systems methodology. Unlike the much-hyped deep learning techniques, the Braitenberg vehicle approach enables complex behaviors that provide insights into autonomous vehicle systems and animal behavior alike. For people deeply interested in dynamical systems theory and applications, this book is a treasure. Likewise, those interested in Braitenberg vehicles and toy models of neuromechanics will find this book highly useful. It is a worthy follow-up to Braitenberg’s original thought experiment and, though highly technical, poses a whole host of questions for 21st-century cognitive science.},

  abstract     = {This is a timely contribution for an anniversary year for ALife, giving a perspective on the past and present states of ALife of a foundational contributor whose works are essential texts for anyone coming into the area. Some cogent criticism of present failings—such as inconsistency in peer review; lack of awareness of previous work, leading to wasted repetition—leads to some clear recommendations for the ALife community to steer its future direction(s). Essentially, the recommendation is for ALife to grow up and become a mature science, with a shared body of knowledge that can be incrementally expanded through systematic research programs.This is an important perspective, shared by quite a few people, and cogently expressed. Of course, I must recommend it be accepted—even though I very fundamentally disagree with the diagnosis. Beer is hoping “to stimulate some necessary critical conversations”—OK!Here is an alternative perspective. Artificial Life is not a field of study with shared, well-defined goals, and it should not be. It is a loose-knit, ever-changing community, looking for new interdisciplinary connections between any of the multiple fields of biology and any of the multiple fields of technology that can lead to new research ideas and, we hope, new research programs. On this perspective, the role of Artificial Life forums (journals, conferences, workshops) is to encourage the conception (in a very biological metaphor) of such new ideas, with new cross-fertilization breaking out from old constraints. While many will be stillborn or die in infancy, those that do grow up to be adult sciences will either be subsumed within preexisting, established fields or form their own established fields obeying scientific norms—typically moving outside the ALife umbrella in doing so.Artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks, deep learning, genetic algorithms—they were each initially conceived in an ALife-like milieu; they grew up and survived as independent fields of research; they have left ALife behind. This, I suggest, is good and as it should be. Beer’s own research history, as he reports it, fits this pattern. He was inspired by attending the 1987 ALife workshop—a forum more for promiscuous, novel conceptions than for established, incremental science. For his computational neuroethology work, he found that journals other than Artificial Life offered better connections to more established science—fine from my perspective. Then, when he returned (2014 on) to illustrating issues in autopoiesis via Game of Life gliders, it is difficult to think of an appropriate place to publish—except, of course, in Artificial Life! From my perspective, he did just the right things and was well served by ALife.I could suggest that if Beer’s current recommendations had enforced his “adult scientific norms” on the 1987 workshop and the 2014 Artificial Life journal’s publishing criteria, he would quite possibly have been uninspired by the first and rejected as out of scope by the second. Yes, of course, we want adult, incremental science—but it does not have to be at the expense of the opportunities that Artificial Life forums allowed Beer and others in the past.Beer makes other specific criticisms that I acknowledge. Inconsistency in peer review is indeed a major issue. In part, this may be exacerbated by interdisciplinary crossovers putting reviewers out of their comfort zones; novel ideas can be mistaken for nonsense, and vice versa. I am in favor of making reviews public (whether named or anonymous) and advocate publication methods that support this, for example, the Open Peer Commentary format of the journal BBS (Behavioral and Brain Sciences) where a target article is published along with commentaries. Lack of historical awareness is an issue, though arguably, this matters less in the nascent stages of research than in later, “adult” stages. With the third stated problem of “lack of consistent progress toward any identifiable goal,” I can agree with the concern when stated thus. But I worry—and disagree—when just a couple of sentences later, this has subtly morphed into a shared goal, with an implication that it is impermissible for different groups to have different goals.To recap the perspective on Artificial Life I am suggesting, forums that support the conception of novel interdisciplinary research ideas have very different requirements from forums that support adult scientific fields. Both types of forum are desirable. Artificial Life has a rather good track record in providing the first type of forum, and any attempt to eliminate such a role should be firmly resisted. The successful spin-offs have indeed thrived as independent adults—but we still need ALife for the as-yet unborn.},

If thresholds are heterogeneous across a population of agents, then graded population level responses can emerge in a context in which individual responses are discrete and limited. In this article, I propose a threshold-based model for social learning of shared quality categories. This is then combined with the voting model of fuzzy categories to allow individuals to learn membership functions from their peers, which can then be used for decision-making, including ranking a set of available options. I use agent-based simulation experiments to investigate variants of this model and compare them to an individual learning benchmark when applied to the ranking problem. These results show that a threshold-based approach combined with category-based voting across a social network provides an effective social mechanism for ranking that exploits emergent vagueness.},

Numerical simulations show that excitable collective structures emerge in the form of dynamic networks, created by bursts of spatiotemporal activity (avalanches) at the edge of a synchronization phase transition. The spatiotemporal dynamics is portraited by a movie and quantified by time varying collective parameters, showing that the dynamic networks undergo a “life cycle,” made of self-creation, homeostasis, and self-destruction. The power spectra of the collective parameters show 1/ f power law tails. The statistical properties of the avalanches, evaluated in terms of size and duration, show power laws with characteristic exponents in agreement with those values experimentally found in the neural networks literature. The mechanism underlying avalanches is argued in terms of local-to-collective excitability.

Additionally, we examine the controller complexity, which can be seen in the context of the integrated information theory of consciousness. Applying this framework to an experimental setting with simulated agents allows us to analyze the interaction between an agent and its environment, as well as the complexity of its controller. Previous research revealed that a morphology adapted well to a task can substantially reduce the required complexity of the controller. In this work, we observe that the agents first have to understand the relevant dynamics of the environment to interact well with their surroundings. Hence an increased controller complexity can facilitate a better interaction between an agent’s body and its environment.},

  abstract     = {Engineering design optimization poses a significant challenge, usually requiring human expertise to discover superior solutions. Although various search techniques have been employed to generate diverse designs, their effectiveness is often limited by problem-specific parameter tuning, making them less generalizable and scalable. This article introduces a framework inspired by evolutionary and developmental (evo-devo) concepts, aiming to automate the evolution of structural engineering designs. In biological systems, evo-devo governs the growth of single-cell organisms into multicellular organisms through the use of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). GRNs are inherently complex and highly nonlinear, and this article explores the use of neural networks and genetic programming as artificial representations of GRNs to emulate such behaviors. To evolve a wide range of Pareto fronts for artificial GRNs, this article introduces a new technique, a real value–encoded neuroevolutionary method termed real-encoded NEAT (RNEAT). The performance of RNEAT is compared with that of two well-known evolutionary search techniques across different 2-D and 3-D problems. The experimental results demonstrate two key findings. First, the proposed framework effectively generates a population of GRNs that can produce diverse structures for both 2-D and 3-D problems. Second, the proposed RNEAT algorithm outperforms its competitors on more than 50% of the problems examined. These results validate the proof of concept underlying the proposed evo-devo-based engineering design evolution.},

  abstract     = {Modular robots are collections of simple embodied agents, the modules, that interact with each other to achieve complex behaviors. Each module may have a limited capability of perceiving the environment and performing actions; nevertheless, by behaving coordinately, and possibly by sharing information, modules can collectively perform complex actions. In principle, the greater the actuation, perception, and communication abilities of the single module are the more effective is the collection of modules. However, improved abilities also correspond to more complex controllers and, hence, larger search spaces when designing them by means of optimization. In this article, we analyze the impact of perception, actuation, and communication abilities on the possibility of obtaining good controllers for simulated modular robots, that is, controllers that allow the robots to exhibit collective intelligence. We consider the case of modular soft robots, where modules can contract, expand, attach, and detach from each other, and make them face two tasks (locomotion and piling), optimizing their controllers with evolutionary computation. We observe that limited abilities often do not prevent the robots from succeeding in the task, a finding that we explain with (a) the smaller search space corresponding to limited actuation, perception, and communication abilities, which makes the optimization easier, and (b) the fact that, for this kind of robot, morphological computation plays a significant role. Moreover, we discover that what matters more is the degree of collectivity the robots are required to exhibit when facing the task.},

However, neither gives a clear immediate selective advantage to the reproducing organism itself. This letter revisits the idea that sex emerged and is maintained because it enables a simple form of fitness landscape smoothing to explain why recombination evolved. Although recombination was originally included in the idea, as with the other explanations, no immediate benefit was identified. That a benefit exists if the dividing cell(s) form a simple colony of the resulting haploids for some time after reproduction is explored here and shown to further increase the benefits of the landscape smoothing process.},

  abstract     = {In closing Artificial Life’s 30th anniversary volume, we would like to take the opportunity to look ahead. Some readers may feel that the field’s emergent wandering is desirable. It has been interesting (and fun!) most of the time, and valuable some of the time. Who knows what may come of our field in the future? Maybe yet more novelty will emerge. If we wander like a flock of boids looking to our nearest neighbors, addressing the interests of connected practitioners, without oversight or planning, where are we all likely to end up? We may travel toward somewhere even more interesting. Or, like a glider on Conway’s grid, we may find ourselves reinvented, in very much the same state as we were 30 years ago, but somewhere new on a grid that has changed deeply around us. Given what we Artificial Life researchers know about successful search of immense spaces, neither pure exploitation nor pure exploration yields the best outcome. If we do want to find ourselves located somewhere important, we need to balance exploratory wandering with agreement on the functions we will use to assess the value of new places we discover: a quality–diversity approach.Most of us are guided by our intuition, by discussions with colleagues, by papers we read and seminars we attend. So we are not conducting a random walk or an aimless drift. But meta-level guidance of our field can still, potentially at least, aid us in shifting the field into a region where we want it to go. Some should wander off to explore in their own directions, ignoring trends and guides. That is an aspect of our field that many of us treasure. But if everybody does this all the time, we will remain a small, eccentric niche in a vast research web. The odds of our field having a centralized and substantial impact in this way seem low at best and negligible on average. If we adopt this approach for the next 30 years, we may continue to spin off valuable research while our core retains its diversity and its arguably “alternative” mind-set, exploring the unknown unknowns. This is potentially valuable. But it is not the only thing we should do.Meta-level guidance can be provided by workshop themes, calls for articles on special issues, textbooks, PhD supervisors advising cohorts of students, competitions that motivate researchers to tackle specific problems, and position papers like this editorial. So here goes.The Artificial Life journal should publish more translation research. We should publish work that applies the principles, understanding, and techniques of our discipline to tackle real, urgent, complex problems that impact human society and Earth’s other physical and ecological systems. Our field is full of diverse, well-read, well-educated, relatively privileged individuals. Many of us work at institutions that receive government funding derived from citizens’ taxes. We have a moral obligation to do something valuable. This is essential, especially now, to maintain fair and equitable processes of governance, access to health care and education, resource distribution, and environmental protection and sustainability under an unstable global sociopolitical situation and an increasingly unstable climate.For Artificial Life to publish such important work as this, we first need to receive it. We know the work is out there. Sometimes it is published in the discipline where the translational impact is most keenly felt, perhaps in robotics, ecology, social science, or epidemiology. Much, much more can be done. We would welcome articles on translational topics in Artificial Life where the links between real-world impacts and our field’s fundamentals can be explored. So, we encourage you to think about how you, your collaborators, and your students can tackle societal and environmental issues for everyone’s benefit without lining the pockets of multinational tech firms. So many deep problems need to be solved immediately. How can we justify turning our backs? We would love to receive, review, and publish your most impactful research in Artificial Life. Send it along!Of course, our views on where Artificial Life ought to go are just two of many. In this issue, Beer offers his personal reflections on Artificial Life’s past, and an opinion on the field’s potential directions, in “(A)Life as It Could Be.” Another of our long-term researchers, Harvey, holds views partly in opposition to those of Beer. He has expressed these in a “Comment on Randall D. Beer’s ‘A(Life) as It Could Be.’ ” We, like these authors, hope their contrasting texts stir up some debate.One of the strengths of the discipline is the wide range of knowledge and techniques that can be brought to bear on problems: ALife provides inspiration and tools both for rich construction media and for a wide range of design approaches. Several articles in this issue demonstrate that breadth of approach.Rusin and Medvet provide insight into one of the major themes of ALife, embodied intelligence as demonstrated in robots, in their article “How Perception, Actuation, and Communication Impact the Emergence of Collective Intelligence in Simulated Modular Robots.” They take an evolutionary approach to design, using modularity to restrict the design and optimization search spaces. Practical robots need to be simple to build but also highly functional; the authors show how these competing objectives may be achieved.Dubey et al. are also interested in optimal design of engineered structures, here using a case study of bridge trusses. In “Evolving Novel Gene Regulatory Networks for Structural Engineering Designs,” they apply an evo-devo approach as an improved way to automate the search for better structural engineering designs. They exploit many of the techniques of ALife—evo-devo, GRNs, neural networks, and genetic programming—to develop an approach applicable to both 2-D and 3-D structures.Continuing with the theme of embodied agent control, Langer and Ay present “Outsourcing Control Requires Control Complexity.” Here the focus is on one of the promised features of embodiment: the capability to outsource some complexity, through interactions between agent body and environment. The authors demonstrate that effective outsourcing still requires enough complexity in the controller to exploit the environmental capabilities.In his article “Emergence and Criticality in Spatiotemporal Synchronization: The Complementarity Model,” Scirè investigates the core ALife concepts of emergence and self-organization through the lens of core ALife tools, criticality and dissipative dynamical systems, here with N coupled 2-D oscillators. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the studied system exhibit a number of emergent properties, including a variety of power law–style avalanches. The author notes how these fundamental properties may have application in some origin of life theories.An important feature of translating from abstract models to the real world is to remember the noise and limited precision of the latter. Thresholding and fuzzy limits are a way to model such constraints. Lawry, in his article “Heterogeneous Thresholds, Social Ranking, and the Emergence of Vague Categories,” applies these ideas to social decision-making scenarios via learning fuzzy categories.In a submission close to Artificial Life’s central idea to shed light on biology via modeling, Bull provides “On Recombination.” His letter offers a potential explanation of the relationship between the evolution of sex, recombination via meiosis, and the fitness benefits for individuals gained due to the resultant smoothing of the fitness landscape that it generates.ALife researchers have long sought to understand, model, and potentially realize cognition by creating embodied agents. This interest predates the field’s formal inception, and Braitenberg’s (1984) Vehicles provided something of a cybernetics-originated prototype in this area, published well before the first conference in Artificial Life (Langton, 1989) and prior to the journal’s first issue, yet still influential today. In “New Directions (and Insights) in Braitenberg Vehicles and Cognitive Science,” Alicea reviews Hotton and Yoshimi’s recent book, The Open Dynamics of Braitenberg Vehicles, which takes that early work in a new direction.Following in this established line of inquiry, Adami, in “How Brains Perceive the World,” focuses, for the fourth installment of his five-essay series, on building a sense of timing and an attention mechanism in artificial brains.We hope that you enjoy this issue, and the next 30 volumes, of Artificial Life.},

  abstract     = {The goal of Artificial Life research, as articulated by Chris Langton, is “to contribute to theoretical biology by locating life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-could-be.” The study and pursuit of open-ended evolution in artificial evolutionary systems exemplify this goal. However, open-ended evolution research is hampered by two fundamental issues: the struggle to replicate open-endedness in an artificial evolutionary system and our assumption that we only have one system (genetic evolution) from which to draw inspiration. We argue not only that cultural evolution should be seen as another real-world example of an open-ended evolutionary system but that the unique qualities seen in cultural evolution provide us with a new perspective from which we can assess the fundamental properties of, and ask new questions about, open-ended evolutionary systems, especially with regard to evolved open-endedness and transitions from bounded to unbounded evolution. Here we provide an overview of culture as an evolutionary system, highlight the interesting case of human cultural evolution as an open-ended evolutionary system, and contextualize cultural evolution by developing a new framework of (evolved) open-ended evolution. We go on to provide a set of new questions that can be asked once we consider cultural evolution within the framework of open-ended evolution and introduce new insights that we may be able to gain about evolved open-endedness as a result of asking these questions.},

  abstract     = {We argue that attempting to quantify open-endedness misses the point: The nature of open-endedness is such that an open-ended system will eventually move outside its current model of behavior, and hence outside any measure based on that model. This presents a challenge for analyzing Artificial Life systems, leading us to conclude that the focus should be on understanding the mechanisms underlying open-endedness, not simply on attempting to quantify it. To demonstrate this, we apply several measures to eight long experimental runs of the spatial version of the Stringmol automata chemistry. These experiments were originally designed to examine the hypothesis that spatial structure provides a defense against parasites. The runs successfully show this defense, but also show a range of innovative, and possibly open-ended, behaviors involved in countering a parasitic arms race. Commencing with system-generic measures, we develop and use a variety of measures dedicated to analyzing some of these innovations. We argue that a process of analysis, starting with system-generic measures but going on to system-specific measures, will be needed wherever the phenomenon of open-endedness is involved.},

This article brings together five methods of analysis to form a procedure for testing for Tokyo Type 1 OEE. The procedure is presented as simply as possible, isolated from the complexities of any particular evolutionary system, and with a clear rationale for each step. In developing these steps, we also identify five key challenges in OEE. The last of these (achieving a higher order of complexity growth within a system exhibiting indefinitely scalable complexity) can be considered a grand challenge for Tokyo Type 1 OEE. Promising approaches to this grand challenge include also achieving one or both of Tokyo Types 2 and 3 OEE; this can be seen as one answer to why these other types of OEE are important, providing a unified view of OEE.},

In this article, we analyze the effect of the strength with which individuals react to the orientation of neighbors located in different sectors of their visual fields and the benefit that could be obtained by using control rules that are more elaborate than those normally used. Our results demonstrate that considering only neighbors located on the frontal side of the visual field permits an increase in the aggregation level of the swarm.

The second article is by Milano and Nolfi, on “Interaction Rules Supporting Effective Flocking Behavior.” They investigate using more complex interaction rules for the individual agents and the effect of field of view on flocking and aggregation behaviors. Somewhat counterintuitively, models with restricted sensory input from a restricted field of view are shown to aggregate more effectively than models with access to more sensory information.Following these, we include a series of articles forming a special issue on open-ended evolution (OEE), which presents work that either follows on from the fourth Workshop on OEE, held at the Artificial Life conference in Prague and online in 2021, or has been developed since then to build on the two previous special issues on OEE (Artificial Life, 25[1–2]).

The proposed method is achieved by incorporating empathy into active inference. We evaluated the proposed method regarding control of autonomous mobile robots in diverse situations. From the evaluation results, an agent controlled by the proposed method could behave more adaptively socially than an agent controlled by the standard active inference in the diverse situations. In the case of two agents, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved in a social way that reduced the other agent’s travel distance by 13.7% and increased the margin between the agents by 25.8%, even though it increased the agent’s travel distance by 8.2%.

  abstract     = {A domain-independent problem-solving system based on principles of Artificial Life is introduced. In this system, DIAS, the input and output dimensions of the domain are laid out in a spatial medium. A population of actors, each seeing only part of this medium, solves problems collectively in it. The process is independent of the domain and can be implemented through different kinds of actors. Through a set of experiments on various problem domains, DIAS is shown able to solve problems with different dimensionality and complexity, to require no hyperparameter tuning for new problems, and to exhibit lifelong learning, that is, to adapt rapidly to run-time changes in the problem domain, and to do it better than a standard, noncollective approach. DIAS therefore demonstrates a role for ALife in building scalable, general, and adaptive problem-solving systems.},

  abstract     = {Biological agents have bodies that are composed mostly of soft tissue. Researchers have resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related questions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun. Nevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose unique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Herein I propose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely, pressure-based soft agents (PSAs): spring-mass membranes containing a pressurized medium. Pressure endows the agents with structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents to assume a large gamut of shapes. PSAs actuate both locally, by changing the resting lengths of springs, and globally, by modulating global pressure. I optimize the controller of PSAs for a locomotion task on hilly terrain, an escape task from a cage, and an object manipulation task. The results suggest that PSAs are indeed effective at the tasks, especially those requiring a shape change. I envision PSAs as playing a role in modeling soft-bodied agents, such as soft robots and biological cells.},

Finally, we examine agents’ performance with partners whose neural controllers are different from their own and with decoy objects of fixed frequency and amplitude. Nonclonal performance varies and is not predicted by genotypic distance. Frequency-amplitude values that fool the focal agent do not include the agent’s own values. Altogether, our findings accentuate the importance of dynamical and nonclonal analyses for simulated sociality, emphasize the role of dialogue between artificial and human studies, and highlight the contributions of simulation studies to understanding social interactions.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with individuals moving in procession in real and artificial societies. A procession is a minimal form of society in which individual behavior is to go in a given direction and the organization is structured by the knowledge of the one ahead. This simple form of grouping is common in the living world, and, among humans, procession is a very circumscribed social activity whose origins are certainly very remote. This type of organization falls under microsociology , where the focus is on the study of direct interactions between individuals within small groups. In this article, we focus on the particular case of pine tree processionary caterpillars ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ). In the first part, we propose a formal definition of the concept of procession and compare field experiments conducted by entomologists with agent-based simulations to study real caterpillars’ processionaries as they are . In the second part, we explore the life of caterpillars as they could be . First, by extending the model beyond reality, we can explain why real processionary caterpillars behave as they do. Then we report on field experiments on the behavior of real caterpillars artificially forced to follow a circular procession; these experiments confirm that each caterpillar can either be the leader of the procession or follow the one in front of it. In the third part, by allowing variations in the speed of movement on an artificial circular procession, computational simulations allow us to observe the emergence of unexpected mobile spatial structures built from regular polygonal shapes where chaotic movements and well-ordered forms are intimately linked. This confirms once again that simple rules can have complex consequences.},

In particular, it investigates how the average magnitude of change per unit time and the persistence of the changes (and hence the resulting autocorrelation of the environmental time series) affect the change tolerances, population diversities, and extinction timescales that emerge. Although it is the change persistence (often discussed in terms of environmental noise color) that has received most attention in the recent literature, other factors, particularly the average change magnitude, interact with this and can be more important drivers of the adaptive strategies that emerge. Moreover, when running simulations, the choice of change representation and normalization can also affect the outcomes. Detailed simulations are presented that are designed to explore all these issues. They also reveal significant dependences on the associated mutation rates and the extent to which they can evolve, and they clarify how evolution often leads populations into strategies with higher risks of extinction. Overall, this study shows how modeling the effect of environmental change requires more care than may have previously been realized.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {In his book Model Systems in Biology: History, Philosophy, and Practical Concerns, Georg Striedter analyzes why and how researchers in biomedical science, a translational domain distinct from the knowledge-focused academic discipline(s) of biology, have come to adopt various animal species and in vitro cellular systems to serve as model systems in understanding and developing treatments for human diseases.Given the size and profile of the biopharmaceutical sector, we might assume that biomedical science is very successful. As a high-tech industry, it has been compared to the semiconductor industry, the exponential progress of which is underpinned by Moore’s law (the number of transistors per unit area has roughly doubled every 2 years since the 1970s). The stark reality is that (as a crude measure) the number of drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration per (adjusted) billion U.S. dollars of research investment has roughly halved every 5 years from the 1960s to 2010, an inverse trend that has been termed Eroom’s law (Scannell et al., 2012). Furthermore, the “alarmingly high failure rates” (p. 3) in moving from preclinical laboratory to clinical evaluation have been likened to the Valley of Death (Seyhan, 2019). Since 2010, innovations like novel therapeutic modalities (e.g., antibody- and RNA-based treatments) have brought notable successes (e.g., in specific cancers and viral infections); however, fundamental problems persist. So what is going on? Striedter’s book is an attempt to make some sense of this situation.Striedter distinguishes four interlinked crises that plague biomedical research: translatability, replicability, biological variation, and model selection.Potential therapeutics that appear promising in the laboratory using cells or animals (preclinical research) often do not translate to efficacy in humans (clinical research). As the costs ramp up considerably along this phased development pipeline, this failure in translation both is very expensive and raises other issues, such as the ethics of experimenting on animals in a highly inefficient process.Biopharma companies will try to replicate key preclinical research as a precursor to more costly downstream investment. However, Striedter reports replicability rates of typically 20%–25%, at the very best 50%, and, in some cases, at or close to zero. This situation is arguably worse than the more generally known replicability crises in other areas of science, such as the social sciences and psychology. The crisis prompted the then directors of the National Institutes of Health to declare that “the irreproducibility of significant numbers of biomedical-research publications demands immediate and substantive action” (Collins &amp;amp; Tabak, as cited therein, p. 7). Although this crisis is commonly attributed to poor experimental design and weak statistical treatments, Striedter digs deeper into foundational assumptions.There is a strong tendency for preclinical results from specific experimental contexts (e.g., cell/tissue, animal) to be broadly generalized to the prospective human patient in the clinic, who is considered generically, without regard to specific variation in biological sex, population, or environment (common proxies are age, ethnicity, etc.). Striedter attributes this mind-set to the successes of molecular biology and genetics in revealing broadly conserved principles of life.Given the lack of translation of preclinical research, surely it would be better to focus solely on clinical research on human subjects? Striedter suggests that the rate of drug discovery would likely not increase and that benefits, such as a reduction in the suffering of laboratory animals, would need to be offset against a prospective increase in human suffering—but it’s not a cogent argument. As it stands, regulatory bodies require preclinical research to support the evaluation of prospective drugs and their transition into clinical trials. Given this, researchers choose in vivo nonhuman animal or in vitro (including human cells/tissue) model systems that are presumed to be similar enough to capture the essentials of the disease condition in humans (essentially as proxy humans), while being experimentally tractable and cost-effective. Striedter argues that it is the presumption of similarity between preclinical model systems and humans that is the foundational issue contributing to the crises of translatability and replicability.Striedter discusses how biology’s notion of similarity is rooted in evolution and manifests in phylogenesis—the development and diversification of species through time. This branching process gives rise to a tree structure, whereby the distance (or dissimilarity) between a pair of species is defined as the time since their evolutionary divergence (from a common ancestor). However, species with rapid reproduction rates (a desirable characteristic of model systems) tend to diverge faster (and vice versa). For example,the relatively short generation time of rats and mice also explains why the primate genomes, overall, are more similar to those of cats, dogs, pigs, and cows than they are to rodent genomes, even though rodents are more closely related to primates than those other species. (p. 25).Notably, species-level similarity does not necessarily relate to the degree of similarity at the level of the constituent molecular components (DNA, proteins, etc.). The sequence (and/or structure) of genes or proteins can remain highly conserved across different divergent species (homology); however, and importantly, the function of homologous molecules may change in different contexts. Striedter wryly remarks, “Most biologists have learned to live with such exception-riddled rules” (p. 27).Striedter’s choice of model systems as a lens to examine the crises of biomedical research is astute. Model systems are the result of the interplay of several drivers: simplification (small[est] system that contains the relevant components/processes/disease), tractability (regeneration time, ease of manipulation, cost), and ethical concerns. Furthermore, model systems in biomedical research are regarded as experimental platforms, or even as instruments. As such, model systems are developed and regarded as standardized, that is, as free—as much as possible—from variation, an essential characteristic of biological systems (Montévil et al., 2016). Such standardization, it is argued, affords more consistent downstream results and is driven by the need for statistical significance of results, which is a prerequisite for publication/regulatory approval. Another driver for standardization of model systems (e.g., genetically “identical” organisms like OncoMouse) is the (as it turns out, poor) assumption that it facilitates the reproducibility of research results. Striedter generally supports standardization, while acknowledging that without some variation, studies are in danger of generating results that hold only under very specific conditions, thereby exacerbating the difficulties in translating the research.Striedter distinguishes two kinds of model systems: the abstract model and the material model. Abstract models are cursorily characterized (in four paragraphs; p. 18) in terms of conceptual models and (the deemed superior) mathematical models. The bulk of the book is concerned with the history of the two kinds of material models, in vivo (fruit fly, rats, mice, primates) and in vitro (microbes, cell/tissue culture, etc.). Additionally, there is a review of the use of model systems in tackling different types of diseases (infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) and the particular challenges of neurological disorders.Striedter provides a critical review of the crises in biomedical science through the lens of model systems, in terms of both their failures and their successes. Congruent with his comparative stance, Striedter reflexively offers multiple perspectives on the issues raised, from the pragmatic optimist to the anthropocentric nepotist to animal welfare.Concerning the latter, he states, “Few are willing to critique the choices of other biologists, perhaps because they worry about being associated with animal rights activists or exposing their colleagues to extremist attacks” (p. 2). In shaping a critique of the prevailing notions of biological similarity and its consequences, Striedter forges a sword that is capable of striking a blow at the very heart of biomedical research, yet its arcane presentation can make it hard to grasp, making it unlikely to be wielded effectively by nonspecialists. Striedter appears to leave it open to others, perhaps from different traditions, to temper and harden the argument. This is no polemic. Striedter’s stance is one of a reflective scientist, a critical friend, remaining inside the fold.In the preface, Striedter expresses a hope that the book “might help young scientists decide which model systems they should choose for their research” (p. viii) as well as to influence senior scientists. He reaches no firm conclusions, but he offers some recommendations as guidance to young scientists entering the field. These are framed (almost apologetically) as philosophical issues, hinting at weaknesses within the current paradigm; he offers no alternatives per se, just some areas for further attention. These include exhortations to know your system, standardize (within limits), learn from failures in the field, embrace diversity, and reckon with complexity (see later). Given the magnitude of the crises and the fundamental nature of some of the underlying issues, these recommendations seem like compass directions but not much of a map. On the relevance of a complexity perspective, Striedter is honest in asking and answering the question, “How should this insight influence the course and conduct of translational research? I do not know” (p. 203). In acknowledging the (re-)emergence of systems biology, and the increasing appreciation of biological complexity, Striedter both reinforces the distinction of biology and biomedical research and delimits his own expertise.In biomedical science, we have a huge sector of scientific-technological activity that is extremely inefficient, whose costs (even if only considered financially and not ethically) are enormous and whose development process is lengthy (think “a billion dollars, 10 years” per drug). If it were not for the huge financial rewards of success (“blockbuster drugs”) or government incentives and charity/philanthropic support (“orphan drugs/diseases”), it would be completely unviable (or unjustified).From a systemic perspective, which I anticipate to be familiar to many readers of the Artificial Life journal, the book can serve as a useful commentary on the limits of a substantially reductionist, mechanistic approach to intervention in complex systems. We see the general conception of disease as a mechanical fault to be addressed by the introduction of an external therapeutic entity (drug, biologic), rather than as a complex, dynamical, self-organizing, autopoietic system with intrinsic autonomy, embodying a meshwork of self-corrective processes; a drive to treat (or manipulate) biological entities as generic, suppressing and ignoring their intrinsic specificity; a low-dimensional intervention in a high-dimensional, feedback-driven dynamical system and the myriad ways in which the system might respond, which include (anticipated but unintended) side effects; a measure of similarity that focuses on properties of material entities and not on patterns of relationships and virtual processes that they might support; or a neglect of the importance of the relationship of the organism and its environment in mutually codetermining structure and modes of behavior.Much of systemic and complex systems thinking emerged out of biology (the study of living systems, not the academic domain), but it has, evidently, not overthrown the failing paradigm.Biomedical science as a translational domain, tied to commerce and regulation, both creates and is subject to external constraints, frictions, and feedback that give it an inertia (arguably) greater than even the parent academic discipline(s) of Biology. Things are changing in Biology, as evidenced by the emergence of contemporary systems biology over the last 25 years. These systemic movements are, as Striedter acknowledges, beginning to influence biomedical science. Yet, systems and complexity thinking situated within a discipline is likely to be informed and shaped by unexamined precepts that constitute the overarching paradigm. In this way, you may end up with a kind of “restricted complexity” (Morin, 2007). New results are emerging in biology that present deep challenges to core concepts that shape existing biological thinking (e.g., Levin, 2022). To make sense of these new findings, biology will need to draw on or develop new kinds of conceptual frameworks, abstractions, and tools, including those that have been developed in (speculative, exploratory) areas like ALife. This will represent an apposite dynamic closure in the network of diverse thought streams that will, one hopes, organize into a radically new and coherent biological mode of thinking, and perhaps a new biology, embracing a more “generalized complexity” (Morin, 2007).Similarity is fundamental, as it underpins the conceptual categories that make up our world and feed into the values that shape our actions in the world. The notion of similarity of biological entities has ramifications that shape the entire enterprise (theory, practice, ethics) of biomedical research (Harden, 2023), and Striedter does a service to his colleagues in raising it. This insight into a translational science, one that has the overt aim of acting toward a perceived good in the world, has deeper and wider resonances. A questioning of fundamental, and often unquestioned, precepts that shape science (or our thinking in general) is to be welcomed (Müller, 2016). It represents a step away from the prevailing objectivist stance of people as (external) observers of systems (out there), toward a recognition of people being situated within and observing systems that we co-construct (Von Foerster, 1984). This radical shift makes us responsible for our thoughts, concepts, and actions, which are inextricably linked to our values. We can’t get out of the game, so we can, at least, begin to acknowledge that there is one.},

  abstract     = {In the 30 plus years since the publication of Steven Levy’s Artificial Life, the field has developed extensively in many different directions. However, it is still very much worth reading the book that first brought this subject to the attention of a wider public. Not only did it increase understanding and awareness of ALife research but it was also arguably instrumental in defining the field in the first place, unifying a wide range of disparate research efforts under this heading. Its comprehensive account of the development of the field is an invaluable guide to students just starting out on ALife research and a useful summary for experienced researchers. Indeed, the multitude of familiar names that populate the pages sometimes makes it feel like a university reading list for a course in the subject, but with the additional benefit of providing engaging explanations of the research and discussions of its significance. The broadly historical approach that the author takes allows us to see the gradual emergence of the field through both the individuals and the institutions involved. Levy personalizes the story with memorable portraits of some of the characters—one is left with the impression that ALife research tends to attract mavericks!Early chapters on cellular automata (CAs) take us from von Neumann’s original idea of creating a self-replicating automaton, via Stanisław Ulam’s game-changing idea of representing this machine on a grid of cells, to John Conway’s Game of Life, Stephen Wolfram’s comprehensive cataloging of elementary CAs, and, finally, Langton’s tunable CAs and his realization of the importance of the “edge of chaos” region in dynamical systems. Although readers of this journal will of course be familiar with this history, it is enlivened with anecdotes of the process of discovery. Conway and his colleagues are described manually applying the rules of Life to black and white counters and shells laid out on (and spreading over the sides of) a common-room coffee table. The final fate of a famous “Methuselah” starting state, the R-Pentomino, is worked out over months of coffee breaks. Many less well-known early systems for self-replication are also outlined, including Roger Penrose’s set of wooden blocks that, when shaken together, can link up to create crystal-like configurations (it is well worth watching the YouTube video of this system in action).Lest the reader is ever in danger of thinking some of the research described is “merely” an amusing game, Levy frequently reminds us, through the impassioned voices of his subjects, of what is at stake: nothing less than the creation of new forms of life that would be, in Conway’s words, capable of “evolving, reproducing, squabbling over territory. Getting cleverer and cleverer. Writing learned Ph.D. theses” (p. 58).In contrast to von Neumann’s intricately designed universal constructor in a 29-state CA, Levy then introduces us to one of the major themes of ALife research, namely, self-organization and the spontaneous emergence of order. The significance of Stuart Kauffman’s work on random Boolean networks is thoroughly explained, as is the motivation behind the work: As Kauffman says, “I’ve always wanted the order one finds in the world not to be particular, peculiar, odd or contrived—I want to be, in the mathematician’s sense, generic. Typical. Natural. Fundamental. Inevitable. Godlike” (p. 128).Throughout the narrative, Levy works in a discussion of the aims of ALife, which fall into two broad categories: the “biological alchemy” of creating systems that are in some sense actually living and the simulation of life’s processes to help us understand life as it is, or as it could be (for instance, on other planets). Both aims shade into origins-of-life research: how does nonliving matter (or information) become organized into a system that can be said to be alive? In addition to these high-level aims, Levy highlights the practical contributions made by ALife research. The chapter on genetic algorithms (GAs) is full of examples of evolution-inspired approaches to solving real-world problems, as with David Goldberg’s early use of a GA to allocate gas pipeline flow. In an era when large-language models have arguably passed (or perhaps rendered obsolete) the Turing test, some people have argued that artificial intelligence (AI) making new scientific discoveries will be the mark of true intelligence. So it is good to be reminded that one of the first major achievements of Koza’s genetic programming approach more than 30 years ago was to rediscover the equations for Kepler’s third law of planetary motion from empirical data.There follow chapters on the importance of coevolution and open-endedness and the efforts to place artificial organisms in environments or ecosystems that could allow them to develop behaviors like the Red Queen phenomenon of runaway complexification in some direction and the Baldwin effect of evolving better learning abilities.A chapter on physical instantiations of Artificial Life research in the form of robots, and particularly swarm robots, is interesting not only for a discussion of a wide variety of systems but also in bringing to the fore one of the central tensions of ALife research. In the words of Patty Maes, an MIT roboticist, “do we want to be engineers and come up with systems that are useful, or do we want to study behaviours as a biological thing?” (p. 291). On one level, this can become a philosophical question, but on another level, it is highly relevant to the more prosaic necessity of securing funding.The field of ALife has developed in parallel to its sometimes more glamorous cousin AI but has probably benefited from being largely shielded from the cycles of hype and despair that have accompanied AI. Levy quotes Doyne Farmer as saying, “Right now it’s kind of nice that artificial life is underground, because it means we can keep a low profile and just do what we want” (p. 339). However, he goes on to express concern about the potential for exponential growth in the abilities of ALife systems, in a discussion very similar to current debates about the risks of AI. Nevertheless, ethical considerations about ALife must be framed rather differently from those about AI: The worry is not that an intelligent system designed to do one thing will do something we don’t want it to do—a truly living artificial system would not have human-imposed goals in the first place; its only aim would be the most basic aim of life—to stay alive and produce more of itself.The only frustration of the book is that so much progress has been made since its publication that the story inevitably feels incomplete. The chapters on CAs obviously don’t include exciting recent developments: from continuous CAs, such as Bert Chan’s Lenia, to neural CAs being trained to generate predefined patterns (work by Mordvintsev and others). There is no discussion of artificial chemistry, a subfield of ALife that perhaps brings the field full circle to von Neumann’s original (pre-CA) idea of self-replicating structures in a huge reservoir filled with the necessary raw materials. If the book were written today, it would probably also include large sections on “wet ALife” and the cross-fertilization of the field with biotechnology. Nevertheless, it remains an excellent introduction to the field, seamlessly combining discussion of the high-level concepts and their philosophical implications with detailed descriptions of specific pieces of research and the people behind them.},

In this contribution, a spatial model for gene regulatory networks is proposed that is biologically more realistic and incorporates an artificial chemistry to realize the interaction between regulatory proteins called the transcription factors and the regulatory sites of simulated genes. The result is a system that is quite robust while able to produce complex dynamics similar to what can be observed in nature. Here an analysis of the impact of the initial states of the system on the produced dynamics is performed, showing that such models are evolvable and can be directed toward producing desired protein dynamics.},

With a broad brush, we can divide technical approaches to solving AI problems into two camps: GOFAIstic (or computationally inspired) or cybernetic (or ALife inspired). The latter approach has enabled advances in deep learning and the astonishing AI advances we see today—bringing immense benefits but also societal risks. There is a similar divide, regrettably unrecognized, over the very way that such AI problems have been framed. To date, this has been overwhelmingly GOFAIstic, meaning that tools for humans to use have been developed; they have no agency or motivations of their own. We explore the implications of this for concerns about existential risk for humans of the “robots taking over.” The risks may be blamed exclusively on human users—the robots could not care less.},

At the beginning, cross-fertilization was so deep that the term genetic code was universally accepted for describing the meaning of triplets of mRNA (codons) as amino acids. However, today, such synergy has not taken advantage of the vertiginous advances in the two disciplines and presents more challenges than answers. These challenges not only are of great theoretical relevance but also represent unavoidable milestones for next-generation biology: from personalized genetic therapy and diagnosis to Artificial Life to the production of biologically active proteins. Moreover, the matter is intimately connected to a paradigm shift needed in theoretical biology, pioneered a long time ago, that requires combined contributions from disciplines well beyond the biological realm. The use of information as a conceptual metaphor needs to be turned into quantitative and predictive models that can be tested empirically and integrated in a unified view.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The field called Artificial Life (ALife) coalesced following a workshop organized by Chris Langton in September 1987 (Langton, 1988a). That meeting drew together work that had been largely carried out from the 1950s through to the 1980s. A few years later, Langton became the founding editor of this journal, Artificial Life, which started its life with Volume 1, Issue 1_2 in the (northern) winter of 1993/1994.1 This current issue therefore begins the 30th volume and 30th year of Artificial Life. We think this is a milestone worth celebrating!In the proceedings of that first workshop, Langton famously defined ALife as the study of “life as it could be,” of “possible life,” in contrast to biology’s study of “life as we know it to be” (on Earth). His stated aim was to derive “a truly general theoretical biology capable of making universal statements about life wherever it may be found and whatever it may be made of ” (Langton, 1988b, p. xvi).Central to ALife is a debate that has continued sporadically since the field’s formal inception. This explores what should be properly counted as living phenomena and what should not. As a field, ALife has sustained a diverse range of opinions on this topic and has simultaneously investigated even contradictory perspectives. As the field gained attention in the mid-1990s, this was partially responsible for criticism that ALife had a lack of focus, a looseness with metaphor and the use of terminology, and a lack of grounding in fundamental biology (Horgan, 1995; Smoliar, 1995). Such risks were explicitly preempted by Nils Aall Barricelli (1962) as he pioneered digital evolution in the 1950s and 1960s. Similar criticisms, however, have also been leveled at biology for failing to agree on the necessary and sufficient characteristics, hence a definition, of life itself. This is something considered even by Aristotle; countless books, including those by Schrödinger (1944), Monod (1971), Rosen (1991), and Morange (2008), have been written on the subject in the 2,300 years since that time. Hence it is hardly surprising that ALife, a relative newcomer to the debate, has struggled with the same issue, especially because it proposes to broaden biology’s definition, whatever that may be.Possibly as a result of ALife’s diversity, the field resembles more a tangled bramble of subdisciplines than some neat “Tree of Life” (Figure 1). Most of its current topics build directly on work published in the earliest workshop proceedings (Langton, 1988a; Langton et al., 1992) and the first double issue of this journal. Indeed, we recommend that newcomers to the discipline, and even more established members, (re-)read those early works. They reveal that the relationships between the topics were as tangled then as they are now. Arguably, this is because tight classification seems less interesting to the community as a whole than exploring links between fields; the nodes of this complex network are less important than its edges.We venture to claim that ALife is an outlet for the parts of ourselves that are “scientific misfits,” the parts that do not fit naturally into a single academic discipline. This does not undermine the field’s validity, the quality of its practitioners, or the rigor with which ALife research can be conducted; rather, it highlights a strength, namely, that we cherish the opportunity to be creative, to think outside the silos that today’s science can inflict regarding “value”: departmental foci and territorial stakes, government funding priorities, industry needs, financial reward, initiation of hot topics and trends, promotion paths, employment opportunities, and publication citation metrics. ALife is arguably not a straightforward way to meet such goals.We have found anecdotally during decades of ALife conferences, meetings, and email exchanges that a diversity of views and explorations is a key feature that maintains individuals’ interest in the ALife research community. As a community, we prize novelty, innovation, and open-endedness in approaches to our work as much as we prize them in the outcomes of our research. We have also been historically accepting of a wide range of opinions, have been willing to openly debate them, and have welcomed explorations made by hobbyists or professional academics in their spare time beyond that devoted to “serious” research in traditional and better-supported fields. As a result, ALife remains fresh and fun at 30 plus years, and attendance at an ALife conference can be as exciting as entering a new field, even for those of us who have been involved a long time.But, if the field is so diverse, does it have a common goal? Yes, and this does not seem to have changed much in the last 30 years, as the word cloud from 1993–1994 (Figure 1) illustrates. We would add, though, that it is not simply to study life as it could be using a diversity of approaches; it is also to design it, build it, play with it, and enjoy it from a variety of perspectives. The playful aspect has been criticized repeatedly, especially but not exclusively in the contexts of synthetic biology and cloning, where the manipulated media match those of natural biology. One criticism leveled at practitioners in this subdomain is a perceived need to “play God” (Douglas et al., 2013), usually a male one (throughout Helmreich, 1998), with Frankensteinian connotations of upsetting the natural order (Kember, 2003, p. 56). There may be some elements of this in ALife. But our (one male and one female) editors’ sense of the dominant engagement between world builder and worlds here is one of curiosity and wonder, rather than a drive for control or mastery. As pointed out in some accounts of the God-likeness of ALife world builders (Kember, 2003, p. 97), a lack of control is in fact frequently encountered; it may even be desirable (Brooks &amp;amp; Flynn, 1989; Kelly, 1994). Hence the sense of exploration and playfulness not only endures; arguably, it is fundamental.Playfulness is something we frequently see in submissions to the journal. In fact, we wish that some projects and submissions were less “tinkering” and better structured! We need our journal’s submissions to follow at least the main requirements of rigorous science, including well-stated hypotheses; clear context setting; reproducability; careful analysis; and detailed exploration of outcomes, benefits, and their implications. Yet even in the more formal submissions, playfulness and enjoyment need not be diminished; they underpin thoughtful and well-contextualized research in a collective and individual effort to (a) understand the aspects of biological, ecological, and societal systems that facilitate or generate interactions or behaviors typically understood to be characteristics of living systems and (b) replicate the interactions and behaviors of life in media other than those from which natural organisms are constructed.Ultimately, then, our journal’s scope remains more or less constant after 30 years. Studies of life’s behaviors and interactions realized through technology are always welcome. The media might change. There may remain long-standing disagreement in the community whether something is “really alive” (Pattee, 1988). There is sometimes a tendency even to ignore or set aside this question and delve recklessly into biological metaphors; we have been warned repeatedly. But all of this has been shown over the years to matter far less to our community than whether our novel study systems behave in ways we deem to be relevant and engaging.With the design of engaging systems a high priority, it is little wonder that ALife continues to be enthusiastically embraced and broad: compare Figure 2, a title-term plot (1993–2023), and Figure 1, a keyword cloud (1993–1994). Its topics have been surveyed before (Aguilar et al., 2014), even since the early days (Farmer &amp;amp; Belin, 1992), but here we attempt to manage ALife’s bramble of subdisciplines with a simple taxonomy and 30 years’ hindsight. We then discuss the articles published in this issue of the journal, before concluding with a discussion of some important ethical and practical concerns for future ALife technologies.Today’s interdisciplinary study of ALife covers a variety of aspects.2 Not all researchers in these areas would consider themselves to be studying ALife per se; nevertheless, here we describe a simple taxonomy of research topics in this context. As noted, these topics do not form a neat hierarchical tree but rather form a tangled meshwork of interconnected and interrelated aspects that encompass ALife activities. Our classification is not exhaustive. A complete and detailed scope would be short-lived, because the field shifts with changes in technology, understanding, and culture; its boundaries are ill defined, and as subareas mature, they may calve off, form new (sub-)disciplines; and acquire new names.This topic considers individual artificial entities that represent or behave like artificial organisms. It can be roughly broken down into three areas: wet, robotic, and virtual ALife (Bedau, 2003; Farmer &amp;amp; Belin, 1992).Wet ALife covers artificial entities made from “wet” chemicals and their reactions. Examples include chemical systems like motile droplets (Čejková et al., 2017); minimal protocells constructed either bottom-up, from biochemical components, or top-down, by stripping out nonvital components from natural cells (Rasmussen et al., 2009); and natural organisms modified by synthetic biology techniques, such as gene engineering (Hanczyc, 2020).Robotic ALife covers artificial entities engineered from “dry” components. The robot bodies may be “hard,” mostly rigid, stiff mechanical components with relatively few degrees of freedom, or “soft,” mostly pliable, elastic components with very many degrees of freedom (Lee et al., 2017; Yasa et al., 2023). The “brains” of these systems are often some form of neural controller implemented in a standard computer. The area includes evolutionary robotics, especially when allowing body and brain to coevolve (Doncieux et al., 2015; Nolfi &amp;amp; Floreano, 2000); swarm robotics, a population of homogeneous or heterogeneous robots cooperating to achieve a task, from nano-scale to macro-scale systems (Schranz et al., 2020); and cognitive robotics, focusing on the intelligence, learning, and adaptation of robots (Cangelosi &amp;amp; Asada, 2022).Virtual ALife covers artificial entities that exist in a virtual environment as software running on a computer or over a network of computers. The research goal is for these entities to actually live, not to be mere simulations of life (Pattee, 1988). What this means, and whether it is possible, has been a subject of some philosophical debate, especially in the early days of ALife. Life is a dynamic process; “life is a verb, not a noun” (Gilman, 1904, chap. X). Does that process need to be physically realized in carbon-based chemistry, or can it be realized in different material substrates undergoing different physical processes—or can it even be virtual? Does the matter matter? The computational viewpoint tends to say that it does not (Langton, 1986; Ray, 1992); the biological viewpoint tends to disagree (Maturana &amp;amp; Varela, 1980; Morange, 2008; Rosen, 1991). Pattee (1988) explored criteria for realizations of virtual life.Some of the issues around virtual ALife are sidestepped by simulated ALife, which makes no claims about the simulation being alive, and by embodied ALife, which focuses on embodiment and situatedness as necessary components of a living entity (Clark, 1997); a form of embodiment may be possible even in virtual systems (Stepney, 2007). Consideration of embodied ALife includes aspects of growth, morphogenesis, and development (Doursat et al., 2012) and more generally of self-construction, self-assembly, and autopoiesis (McMullin, 2004; Varela et al., 1974).In addition to these subclassifications of the material (physical or virtual) of organism bodies, the informational and computational aspects of the various structures and processes are also essential facets of the whole living system. From the information content in a genome, through its extraction and translation in developmental processes, to whole-organism and population behaviors and evolution, and on to intelligence, all have an essential computational aspect (Stepney, 2023).Any and all of the aforementioned subareas can be merged, for example, in evolutionary swarm robotics (Bredeche et al., 2018). Biomolecular nanoswarms (Hauert &amp;amp; Bhatia, 2014) might be classified at the intersection of wet and swarm ALife, given the individuals’ wet biomolecular bodies and swarm robotic collective behaviors. Morphogenesis can result from self-organizing swarm behavior (Slavkov et al., 2018). These examples demonstrate the tangled nature of the discipline—something that is true for all parts of our taxonomy, not only for artificial organisms.Natural organisms do not, and cannot, live in complete isolation. They exist as populations and live in ecosystems. Several species of organism, including some primates and insects, live in structured societies. This branch of ALife studies collections of interacting artificial entities; its themes overlap significantly with artificial organisms (section 2.1).Populations of organisms undergoing reproduction with inheritance and variation in the context of differential selection experience Darwinian evolution. Evolutionary algorithms (De Jong, 2005) use simple analogies of these concepts to search for optimal values of extrinsic fitness measures; their use can often have unexpected and surprising results (Lehman et al., 2020). However, natural evolution is much more complex, in terms of genome complexity, population sizes, numbers of generations, reproductive strategies from horizontal gene transfer to sexual selection, gene regulation, the role of development and epigenetics, interactions between multiple coevolving populations, and intrinsically defined fitness. These more natural features of evolution are the domain of ALife evolutionary studies, as examples of recent publications in the journal indicate, including the articles by Cussat-Blanc et al. (2018), Liard et al. (2020), Veenstra et al. (2020), and Bull (2021).Populations also exhibit emergent group behaviors, such as collective movements in schools, flocks, or swarms (Reynolds, 1987) and eusocial insect nest construction (Theraulaz &amp;amp; Bonabeau, 1999). Study of biological processes like these can help drive developments in swarm robotics; simulations can help demonstrate how these group behaviors can emerge from only local interactions, without centralized control.Organisms live in ecosystems, comprising populations of their own species, other species, and an environment of abiotic entities and processes, all of which provide niches, of different ways of making a living, that can themselves appear, disappear, and evolve (Kampis &amp;amp; Gulyás, 2008; Luo et al., 2018). This extra layer of complexity allows different species to interact and affect each other’s evolution, through predation and food webs (Lindgren &amp;amp; Nordahl, 1994), cooperative and competitive coevolution, symbiosis (Vostinar &amp;amp; Ofria, 2018), and parasitism (Hickinbotham et al., 2021). Additionally, as complexity increases, the ecosystem can facilitate social and cultural interactions (Marriott et al., 2018). Predation, cooperation, and culture all involve interaction, which leads to studies of sensing, communication, and language (Yamauchi &amp;amp; Hashimoto, 2010).Evolution and ecology are also fundamental to biology. Where ALife study systems can differ from natural ones is in their ability to allow researchers to shift parameters far from naturally occurring values (Dorin et al., 2008). Exploration of the possibilities this provides can help us to determine what features are necessary for life and what are merely contingent features and frozen accidents of the single instance of natural life that we have to examine. ALife can not only “replay the tape” (Gould, 1989) of past life; it can design and play tapes very different from those that have been, or could be, run on Earth, helping to clarify and extract life’s essential properties. ALife uses two main techniques to do so. Simulated and virtual worlds provide a facility to examine the dynamics of complex evolutionary and ecological systems. Theoretical techniques, including complex dynamical systems, feedback networks, systems theory, and cybernetics, can provide powerful general models of life, and tools to help us understand them, by providing generalizable results.One property natural life has is its “endless forms most beautiful ” (Darwin, 1872, p. 463), the apparently boundless diversity of natural organisms and their ways of making a living. The study of this phenomenon comes under the heading of open-ended evolution (Packard et al., 2019a, 2019b; Taylor et al., 2016), or open-endedness in general (Banzhaf et al., 2016). For understanding how open-endedness got started within Earth’s evolving populations of organisms, there is the question of the origin of life (Cardoso et al., 2020): Is it possible for systems to “evolve” prior to being living? How? Following this, what do transitions from prelife, via protolife, to full life look like? Once living entities exist, how do processes of speciation occur? Moreover, how do major transitions in evolution (Maynard Smith &amp;amp; Szathmáry, 1995), which involve the emergence of new levels of complexity and organization, occur, and is there a limit to the number of levels that can emerge? Does this involve meta-evolution, the evolvability and evolution of evolvability and evolution (Payne &amp;amp; Wagner, 2019)?Open-endedness may be considered in the context of social and cultural systems, as well as physical systems. So studies of processes for creativity and novelty generation (Boden, 1990; Saunders &amp;amp; Bown, 2015), of variation, technological innovation (Buchanan et al., 2011), and transformation, also fall into this category of ALife research.One main activity in this area is the use of a variety of generative systems to build demonstrator simulations of purportedly open-ended systems. These include cellular automata (Beer, 2014; Langton, 1986; Wolfram, 1984), generative grammars (Giavitto et al., 2002; Prusinkiewicz &amp;amp; Lindenmayer, 1990), artificial chemistries (Banzhaf &amp;amp; Yamamoto, 2015), and automata chemistries like Tierra (Ray, 1992), Polyworld (Yaeger, 1994), Avida (Adami &amp;amp; Brown, 1994), and Stringmol (Hickinbotham et al., 2011). A parallel strand of activities attempts to define and quantify open-endedness, to detect its presence or absence in such simulations and in physical systems (Dolson et al., 2019; Stepney &amp;amp; Hickinbotham, 2023).There is a rich prehistory to the field now labeled “Artificial Life.” Individuals from diverse cultures have mimicked and replicated organisms’ appearances and behaviors using many media and technologies (see examples collected by Arnold et al., 2001; Bazopoulou-Kyrkanidou, 2001). Concepts like life, scientific enquiry, and artistic practice remain fluid today and are certainly not universal or constant throughout history. We cannot therefore automatically ascribe to our predecessors from different times or cultures the same goals or motivations as we have. However, the construction of an automaton, an engineered humanoid, has a particularly long-lived and widespread history, including in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, 11th-century China, medieval Persia, Renaissance Italy, and 18th-century France (Al-binkamāt, 1976; Bedini, 1964; Berryman, 2003; Chapuis &amp;amp; Droz, 1958; Gao, 2000; Price, 1964). These capture our attention today as they did the attention of inventors and writers who documented them at the time, in whatever location and conditions they lived and whatever the reasons for the automaton’s creation. Hence some authors have created histories of ALife that predate the naming of the field by assembling and studying work that has touched on those themes we now place under its banner. Others have assembled contemporary ALife work conducted since the field’s labeling, into surveys and analyses adopting a variety of perspectives (Aguilar et al., 2014; Levy, 1992; Riskin, 2003, 2007; Taylor &amp;amp; Dorin, 2020). These histories help set the context for today’s work, and remind us of the fluidity of the concepts to which we may otherwise be tempted to cling.Some ALife researchers ask what might be termed the “big” questions. Foremost of these is, What is life? (Bedau, 2007). Natural life is physical in nature; there is no “vital spark” or nonphysical “life force.” However, living systems appear to be qualitatively different from nonliving systems. One goal of ALife is to define life in a way that is not dependent on potentially contingent properties of natural terrestrial life but that would apply to all the endless possible forms of life and to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for it (Bartlett &amp;amp; Wong, 2020; Bedau, 2007).Other discussion topics within ALife, all touched on in various other sections of this taxomony, explore relationships between intelligence and life; whether embodiment is essential or just helpful for life; the meaning of autonomy; the concepts of emergence and supervenience; the role of observers in defining boundaries and therefore living systems; how to explain collections of organisms, such as colonies, societies, and organizations; the grounding and generation of language; what it means for an organism to sense or perceive its environment; the relationship between biology, machines, and computation; whether biological evolution is in fact open-ended, as well as what open-ended means and how to measure it; and the relationship between open-endedness, novelty, creativity, and evolution. ALife is a highly fertile breeding ground for debate!The moral and ethical issues of modifying and creating living physical and virtual organisms are also under consideration (Douglas et al., 2013; Witkowski &amp;amp; Schwitzgebel, 2022). Others consider these issues, as well as the environmental and societal impacts of lifelike systems, especially if they interact directly with ecosystems and human societies (Eldridge, 2021; Sayama, 2021). The Artificial Life conference series now includes a recurring track on “ALife and Society” that we hope will continue. We editors welcome submissions to the journal on ALife, society, and the environment. These have not been received nearly as often as we would like.Although traditional academic articles and software are a common way to voice opinions and debate issues related to ALife, this field in particular has spawned a healthy body of inquiries into the relationships between biology, society, and technology through art. ALife artworks may draw for inspiration on historical artifacts sometimes considered as part of the prehistory of the field, but they also draw on more recent work from the 20th century in cybernetics and computer art (Reichardt, 1968) and specifically from ALife’s themes (Dorin, 2015; Ohlenschlöger, 2012; Whitelaw, 2004; Wu et al., 2024). In addition, ALife’s basic techniques, such as interactive evolutionary algorithms, virtual ecosystems, and cellular automata, have found many applications in computer graphics and electronic media art, without the art necessarily focusing explicitly on ALife’s themes. Many ALife processes were used for generating patterns and images before their association with ALife was formed. For example, Lindenmeyer’s L-Systems for plant modeling and Reynolds’s flocking boids are now staples of our field that were first applied as computer graphics techniques. Reaction-diffusion models were, of course, originally conceived by Turing (1952) to explain biological pattern formation.As just outlined in the case of computer graphics, ALife research often requires and designs unique tools and repurposes existing tools for new contexts. Many ALife studies develop and use virtual worlds. These may be specific to ALife, but their software might rest on general-purpose, agent-based frameworks or even on computer game worlds. As with any science, analysis tools (statistics, genealogies, metrics, etc.) are needed, and tools for visualizing complex results are helpful in priming relevant intuitions. Some ALife research tool kits have been developed to educate the general public and the next generation of ALife researchers, especially through interactive websites and e-books.ALife has its own technological and industrial applications; synthetic biology (engineering natural organisms) is a prominent one, but there are also many potential applications of evolutionary algorithms that seek novelty for generative design. In general, our simulation tools can model many complex real-world phenomena and help us tackle societal and environmental problems. They can also be used to manufacture software, hardware, and wetware that mimics the behavior of living organisms. There are many possibilities for ALife systems to interact with biological, ecological, or societal systems. This is potentially valuable but has serious risks and requires careful consideration of ethics.Tools and techniques are well developed, but applications beyond our field are relatively few and far between compared to (for a current example) the application of large-language models, computer vision, and deep-learning tools. Exceptions include work already noted as falling under the ALife conference “ALife for social / environmental good” activity. But sometimes when things go well, the applications spin off into other domains, such as synthetic biology, land management, epidemiological modeling, urban planning, generative industrial design, or evolutionary algorithms, and we may lose sight of them. ALife is growing tendrils into other fields that help to make our work relevant, even if, as a community, we do not always get the credit.For this anniversary issue, 30(1), we invited submission of articles related to the history, philosophy, and open questions of ALife and have also selected other submissions that fit our celebratory theme. We anticipate publishing further articles relevant to the anniversary throughout the coming year.Cartwright et al., in their article “Information, Coding, and Biological Function: The Dynamics of Life,” provide a perspective on the need for incorporating information theory in understanding and explaining biological processes, and its place in synthetic biology. This demonstrates the need for interdisciplinarity in ALife: computational and information-theoretic concepts combined with biological processes.Garbus and Pollack, in “Emergent Resource Exchange and Tolerated Theft Behavior Using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning,” present a multiagent model whereby agents playing a bartering game can use reinforcement learning to build cooperation without the need for direct communication. This demonstrates the use of simulation models to investigate the emergence of complex behaviors from apparently simple scenarios.Harvey, in “Motivations for Artificial Intelligence, for Deep Learning, for ALife: Mortality and Existential Risk,” takes us on a historical, philosophical, and personal journey considering artificial intelligence, contrasting the symbolic “GOFAI” approaches and the more biologically inspired “cybernetic” and neural network advances relevant to an Artificial Life perspective. Deep ethical issues are involved, but maybe not the most popularized ones.Miralavy and Banzhaf, in “A Spatial Artificial Chemistry Implementation of a Gene Regulatory Network Aimed at Generating Protein Concentration Dynamics,” present an abstract model of a gene regulatory network and examine the resulting complex dynamics. This provides a model that can potentially contribute to evolving biological protein synthesis and equally to understanding complex dynamics that could be incorporated into an artificial system.Taylor presents “An Afterword to Rise of the Self-Replicators,” adding information on further contributors to the history of self-replicating and evolving robots originally presented by Taylor and Dorin (2020). This adds further material from the 19th and early 20th centuries to the deep and long history of the subject.Wu et al., in “A Survey of Recent Practice of Artificial Life in Visual Art,” review and categorize recent artworks about or inspired by ALife. Art is a topic well represented at the ALife conferences, but less so in the journal, and so we welcome its appearance here.We finish this anniversary issue with two book reviews. The first, by Waldegrave, revisits Levy’s popular science book Artificial Life: The Quest for a New Creation from 30 years ago. The second, by Caves, reviews Striedter’s 2022 book Model Systems in Biology: History, Philosophy, and Practical Concerns from an ALife perspective.How can we ensure that our research makes positive contributions to society broadly, and to our environment, over the next 30 years? This has not been a commonly stated intention of researchers in ALife over the previous 30 years. How do we avoid fiddling while the world burns? Or worse still, how do we avoid building technological systems that directly interact with physical, biological, ecological, and social systems to their detriment?To begin with, researchers in ALife would do well to avoid the age-old issue of policy failing to keep pace with technology, innovation, and change. As Rick Deckard says,3 “replicants are like any other machine. They’re either a benefit or a hazard. If they’re a benefit, it’s not my problem.” Our technologies have, without a doubt, many benefits, but we also face many hazards. We have long known that the climate is changing due to technological combustion of fossil fuels. We have known that humans are destroying Earth’s ecosystems more directly, too, via mining, the increased pace of land clearing for industrial agriculture, and urbanization. We have known since the 1960s that our use of chemical pesticides damages the environment, that agricultural chemical runoff pollutes waterways and oceans, and that trawlers and dragnets are overexploiting fisheries. We have witnessed how technology has forced changes in the job market through the industrial revolutions. And in all of these situations, governments and policymakers have, in general, been slow and ineffective at tackling the complex problems new technologies have generated or facilitated. Even where opportunities existed, often (but not always; McCulloch, 2003) policy and action have failed to keep pace with change. In some cases, change has been perceived to be problematic; for example, vested interests have assisted governments and industries in maintaining the status quo regarding fossil fuel production. In other cases, legislation may appear to be hasty, rather than considered, and inconsistent across countries, for example, the use of genetically modified food.One fresh issue close to artificial life is what to do about the problems of artificial intelligence, specifically large-language models like ChatGPT and image generators like MidJourney. These systems are widely recognized to be misappropriating the creative work of visual artists and writers; they further undermine the credibility of online media that aim to tell something approximating “truth”; they are powerful weapons for spreading misinformation and customized propaganda and in their consequent influences on public opinion and decision-making. And they aren’t done yet.Artificial Life could follow the reactive policy path of artificial intelligence. We could wait until we have built a physical system capable of self-reproduction, of autonomous goal setting and achievement, and only then scramble to regulate its application and mitigate its impacts. Given past history, in our opinion, this is most likely to cause real problems. The application of swarm robotics, one interest of ALife research, to autonomous armed military drones is an example of a research outcome we feel is ultimately problematic and should have been preemptively regulated. Autonomous military drones in general ought to be regulated, and some countries are calling for this to occur (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2023).Rather than following the usual reactive approach, ALife should do something that sets us apart as a field. Applications of ALife for societal and environmental good, as noted earlier, are a step in the right direction. Indeed, real-world application of ALife systems to engage with natural ecosystems and societies to better manage and sustain them is a natural yet underexplored aspect of our field.Working toward positive outcomes, while laudable, is insufficient, however. We should also be establishing policies and frameworks for the proper creation and management of artificial living systems to avoid dangerous or unethical research avenues and applications. It is better to be prepared, because ALife’s emerging technology has consequences potentially more profound than anything humans have yet manufactured. An underlying principle at least to “do no harm” is desirable. But in practice, this is not a simple goal to achieve: We must balance harms and benefits between different social, cultural, and political groups and their needs, desires, agendas, and beliefs. And we have to weigh human harms and benefits alongside environmental harms and benefits; we have to weigh the needs of individuals versus those of communities and other groups. This is nothing new: It is the bread and butter of policy development. Perhaps we as researchers accustomed to dealing with complex dynamical and social systems are ideally situated to make inroads here, if we were to extend our field to actively engage policymakers. We are yet to do so.What are we waiting for? This is a future the ALife community should actively construct, well before the next 30 years elapse. Then, at 60 years, we would really be able to celebrate our achievements!},
