  abstract     = {Among the myriad of complications associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), impairments in social behaviors and cognition have emerged as a significant area of concern. Animal models of social behavior are necessary to explore the underlying brain mechanisms contributing to chronic social impairments following brain injury. Here, we utilize large-scale brain recordings of local field potentials to identify neural signatures linked with social preference deficits following frontal brain injury. We used a controlled cortical impact model of TBI to create a severe bilateral injury centered on the prefrontal cortex. Behavior (social preference and locomotion) and brain activity (power and coherence) during a three-chamber social preference task were compared between sham and injured animals. Sham rats preferred to spend time with a social conspecific over an inanimate object. An analysis of local field oscillations showed that social preference was associated with a significant increase in coherence in gamma frequency band across widespread brain regions in these animals. Animals with a frontal TBI showed a significant reduction in this social preference, visiting an inanimate object more frequently and for more time. Reflecting these changes in social behavior, these animals also showed a significant reduction in gamma frequency (25–60 Hz) coherence associated with social preference. Our results indicate that disturbance in the gamma band network is associated with reduced social preference following frontal TBI. Importantly, the deficits we observed are network-wide, extending far beyond the focal site of injury. Our study identifies a potential neural signature of social preference that could be manipulated to improve social behaviors and may have translational relevance.},

  abstract     = {The growing availability of large-scale neuroimaging datasets and user-friendly machine learning tools has led to a recent surge in studies that use fMRI data to predict psychological or behavioral variables. Many such studies classify fMRI data on the basis of static features, but fewer try to leverage brain dynamics for classification. Here, we pilot a generative, dynamical approach for classifying resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. By fitting separate hidden Markov models to the classes in our training data and assigning class labels to test data based on their likelihood under those models, we are able to take advantage of dynamical patterns in the data without confronting the statistical limitations of some other dynamical approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate that hidden Markov models are able to successfully perform within-subject classification on the MyConnectome dataset solely on the basis of transition probabilities among their hidden states. On the other hand, individual Human Connectome Project subjects cannot be identified on the basis of hidden state transition probabilities alone—although a vector autoregressive model does achieve high performance. These results demonstrate a dynamical classification approach for rsfMRI data that shows promising performance, particularly for within-subject classification, and has the potential to afford greater interpretability than other approaches. Neuroimaging researchers have made substantial progress in using brain data to predict psychological and behavioral variables, like personality, cognitive abilities, and neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. In general, however, these prediction approaches do not take account of how brain activity changes over time. In this study, we use hidden Markov models, a simple and generic model for dynamic processes, to perform brain-based prediction. We show that hidden Markov models can successfully distinguish whether a single individual had eaten and consumed caffeine before his brain scan. These models also show some promise for “fingerprinting,” or identifying individuals solely on the basis of their brain scans. This study demonstrates that hidden Markov models are a promising tool for neuroimaging-based prediction.},

  abstract     = {Different whole-brain computational models have been recently developed to investigate hypotheses related to brain mechanisms. Among these, the Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) model is particularly attractive, combining a biophysically realistic model that is scaled up via a mean-field approach and multimodal imaging data. However, an important barrier to the widespread usage of the DMF model is that current implementations are computationally expensive, supporting only simulations on brain parcellations that consider less than 100 brain regions. Here, we introduce an efficient and accessible implementation of the DMF model: the FastDMF. By leveraging analytical and numerical advances—including a novel estimation of the feedback inhibition control parameter and a Bayesian optimization algorithm—the FastDMF circumvents various computational bottlenecks of previous implementations, improving interpretability, performance, and memory use. Furthermore, these advances allow the FastDMF to increase the number of simulated regions by one order of magnitude, as confirmed by the good fit to fMRI data parcellated at 90 and 1,000 regions. These advances open the way to the widespread use of biophysically grounded whole-brain models for investigating the interplay between anatomy, function, and brain dynamics and to identify mechanistic explanations of recent results obtained from fine-grained neuroimaging recordings.},

  abstract     = {Networks in the parietal and premotor cortices enable essential human abilities regarding motor processing, including attention and tool use. Even though our knowledge on its topography has steadily increased, a detailed picture of hemisphere-specific integrating pathways is still lacking. With the help of multishell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, probabilistic tractography, and the Graph Theory Analysis, we investigated connectivity patterns between frontal premotor and posterior parietal brain areas in healthy individuals. With a two-stage node characterization approach, we defined the network role of precisely mapped cortical regions from the Julich-Brain atlas. We found evidence for a third, left-sided, medio-dorsal subpathway in a successively graded dorsal stream, referencing more specialized motor processing on the left. Supplementary motor areas had a strongly lateralized connectivity to either left dorsal or right ventral parietal domains, representing an action-attention dichotomy between hemispheres. The left sulcal parietal regions primarily coupled with areas 44 and 45, mirrored by the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) on the right, a structural lateralization we termed as “Broca’s-IFJ switch.” We were able to deepen knowledge on gyral and sulcal pathways as well as domain-specific contributions in parieto-premotor networks. Our study sheds new light on the complex lateralization of cortical routes for motor activity in the human brain. Human motor abilities are processed via specialized yet intertwined pathways in the parietal and premotor cortex. These can be parcellated into networks of brain areas, sharing connection patterns that differ between hemispheres. We differentiated a set of graded pathways, connecting definable network hubs. The well-known Dorsal Stream for visuomotor transformation appears to be left-dominantly divisible into three distinct substreams, providing more anatomical detail about its specialization into visual and semantic segments. Supplementary motor areas show lateralized couplings with left dorsal and right ventral parietal areas, respectively, while left-sided AIPS connectivity to area 44/45 is mirrored by right-sided intersulcal links to the inferior frontal sulcus, both deepening our understanding of incorporated multi-task faculties like attention and speech.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. Structures affected in MS include the corpus callosum, connecting the hemispheres. Studies have shown that in mammalian brains, structural connectivity is organized according to a conservation principle, an inverse relationship between intra- and interhemispheric connectivity. The aim of this study was to replicate this conservation principle in subjects with MS and to explore how the disease interacts with it. A multicentric dataset has been analyzed including 513 people with MS and 208 healthy controls from seven different centers. Structural connectivity was quantified through various connectivity measures, and graph analysis was used to study the behavior of intra- and interhemispheric connectivity. The association between the intra- and the interhemispheric connectivity showed a similar strength for healthy controls ( r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001) and people with MS ( r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.001). Intrahemispheric connectivity was associated with white matter fraction ( r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.0001), lesion volume ( r = −0.44, p &lt; 0.0001), and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( r = 0.25, p &lt; 0.0001). Results show that this conservation principle seems to hold for people with MS. These findings support the hypothesis that interhemispheric connectivity decreases at higher cognitive decline and disability levels, while intrahemispheric connectivity increases to maintain the balance. In our study, we investigated how multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the central nervous system, impacts brain connectivity and the conservation principle of connectivity in the brain across hemispheres. By analyzing data from 513 MS patients and 208 healthy individuals, we examined if this conservation principle holds and how it changes due to MS. Our findings revealed that both MS patients and healthy individuals exhibit a similar balance between connections within each hemisphere and between hemispheres. We also observed that as cognitive impairment and disability in MS patients increase, interhemispheric connectivity decreases while intrahemispheric connectivity compensates. This suggests that the brain attempts to maintain balance despite the disease’s progression, highlighting the adaptability of neural connectivity during the course of MS.},

  abstract     = {Memories are thought to use coding schemes that dynamically adjust their representational structure to maximize both persistence and efficiency. However, the nature of these coding scheme adjustments and their impact on the temporal evolution of memory after initial encoding is unclear. Here, we introduce the Segregation-to-Integration Transformation (SIT) model, a network formalization that offers a unified account of how the representational structure of a memory is transformed over time. The SIT model asserts that memories initially adopt a highly modular or segregated network structure, functioning as an optimal storage buffer by balancing protection from disruptions and accommodating substantial information. Over time, a repeated combination of neural network reactivations involving activation spreading and synaptic plasticity transforms the initial modular structure into an integrated memory form, facilitating intercommunity spreading and fostering generalization. The SIT model identifies a nonlinear or inverted U-shaped function in memory evolution where memories are most susceptible to changing their representation. This time window, located early during the transformation, is a consequence of the memory’s structural configuration, where the activation diffusion across the network is maximized. The Segregation-to-Integration Transformation (SIT) model provides a framework for memory transformation based on changes in the neural network properties. SIT posits that memories shift from highly modular to less modular network forms over time, driven by neural reactivations, activation spread, and plasticity rules. The SIT model identified a critical period, shortly after memory formation, where reactivations can induce significant structural modifications. As repeated reactivation passes, the network becomes more stable and integrated, becoming more resistant to change, thus preserving the core information while reducing the likelihood of distortion or loss.},

  abstract     = {We examined how thalamocortical connectivity structure reflects children’s reading performance. Diffusion-weighted MRI at 3 T and a series of reading measures were collected from 64 children (33 girls) ages 8–14 years with and without dyslexia. The topological properties of the left and right thalamus were computed based on the whole-brain white matter network and a hub-attached reading network, and were correlated with scores on several tests of children’s reading and reading-related abilities. Significant correlations between topological metrics of the left thalamus and reading scores were observed only in the hub-attached reading network. Local efficiency was negatively correlated with rapid automatized naming. Transmission cost was positively correlated with phonemic decoding, and this correlation was independent of network efficiency scores; follow-up analyses further demonstrated that this effect was specific to the pulvinar and mediodorsal nuclei of the left thalamus. We validated these results using an independent dataset and demonstrated that that the relationship between thalamic connectivity and phonemic decoding was specifically robust. Overall, the results highlight the role of the left thalamus and thalamocortical network in understanding the neurocognitive bases of skilled reading and dyslexia in children. The thalamus is increasingly considered a key component of the brain’s reading network, although its precise role is less well understood. Here, we apply a network neuroscience approach to understanding how the thalamus is embedded into the reading network by examining how its wiring pattern is associated with different component aspects of reading skills in children. Using a connectome framework, we show that a local efficiency metric of the left thalamus is negatively correlated with rapid automatized naming, while its transmission cost measure is positively correlated with phonemic decoding. Connections between temporal areas of cortex and two thalamic nuclei, the pulvinar and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, were also negatively correlated with phonemic decoding. Our result thus provides clearer specificity about how the thalamus supports reading by coordinating communications across reading network areas.},

  abstract     = {We generated asynchronous functional networks (aFNs) using a novel method called optimal causation entropy and compared aFN topology with the correlation-based synchronous functional networks (sFNs), which are commonly used in network neuroscience studies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series from 212 participants of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence study were used to generate aFNs and sFNs. As a demonstration of how aFNs and sFNs can be used in tandem, we used multivariate mixed effects models to determine whether age interacted with node efficiency to influence connection probabilities in the two networks. After adjusting for differences in network density, aFNs had higher global efficiency but lower local efficiency than the sFNs. In the aFNs, nodes with the highest outgoing global efficiency tended to be in the brainstem and orbitofrontal cortex. aFN nodes with the highest incoming global efficiency tended to be members of the default mode network in sFNs. Age interacted with node global efficiency in aFNs and node local efficiency in sFNs to influence connection probability. We conclude that the sFN and aFN both offer information about functional brain connectivity that the other type of network does not. In recent years, the network neuroscience field has increasingly grown toward the study of “dynamic” networks, which depict second-to-second changes in functional connectivity. However, it is unclear how the brain is able to self-direct shifts between distinct states of connectivity. Prior investigation of information dynamics in complex systems suggests that these shifts may be governed by underlying asynchronous relationships between brain regions. For the first time, this work applies a novel methodology to generate asynchronous functional brain networks from fMRI data. The topology of these asynchronous networks is contrasted with the topology of the synchronous correlation-based networks, which currently dominate the network neuroscience literature. Finally, asynchronous networks are shown to yield novel information about brain connectivity that is not captured by synchronous networks alone.},

  abstract     = {Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high-temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a methodology to overcome these problems called filter average short-term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, a long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of visual short-term memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyze the transient high-temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy event-related potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyze an activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance. Filter average short-term (FAST) connectivity is an EEG analysis method that enhances detection of dynamic functional connectivity changes during cognitive events like event-related potentials, effectively handling EEG noise and maximizing temporal resolution. It reduces the required trial numbers for reliable analysis, particularly beneficial for studying tasks such as working memory. FAST connectivity complements traditional methods by focusing on temporal connectivity patterns, showing superior performance in simulations compared with standard measures. Applied to Alzheimer’s datasets, it identifies significant differences in brain activity during visual short-term memory tasks, highlighting its potential for understanding neurological conditions.},

Current research suggests that there may be no single “correct” parcellation and that the human brain is intrinsically a multiresolution entity. In this work, we propose the Continuous Structural Connectivitity-based, Nested (CoCoNest) family of parcellations—a fully data-driven, multiresolution family of parcellations derived from structural connectome data. The CoCoNest family is created using agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering and error-complexity pruning, which strikes a balance between the complexity of each parcellation and how well it preserves patterns in vertex-level, high-resolution connectivity data. We draw on a comprehensive battery of internal and external evaluation metrics to show that the CoCoNest family is competitive with or outperforms widely used parcellations in the literature. Additionally, we show how the CoCoNest family can serve as an exploratory tool for researchers to investigate the multiresolution organization of the structural connectome. In this work, we derive a family of structural connectivity-based parcellations, called the CoCoNest family, based on a continuous representation of structural connectivity. This family is created using agglomerative clustering to grow a fully binary tree and then error-complexity pruning to greedily derive subtrees that balance complexity and goodness of fit. The CoCoNest family is evaluated with a comprehensive collection of internal and external evaluation metrics across two independent datasets and compared with widely used parcellations. Our results show that members of the CoCoNest family are competitive with other parcellations and often achieve superior performance. We show that the CoCoNest family can serve as an exploratory tool for investigations into the multiscale nature of the structural connectome.},

  abstract     = {Most of the recent work in psychedelic neuroscience has been done using noninvasive neuroimaging, with data recorded from the brains of adult volunteers under the influence of a variety of drugs. While these data provide holistic insights into the effects of psychedelics on whole-brain dynamics, the effects of psychedelics on the mesoscale dynamics of neuronal circuits remain much less explored. Here, we report the effects of the serotonergic psychedelic N,N-diproptyltryptamine (DPT) on information-processing dynamics in a sample of in vitro organotypic cultures of cortical tissue from postnatal rats. Three hours of spontaneous activity were recorded: an hour of predrug control, an hour of exposure to 10- μ M DPT solution, and a final hour of washout, once again under control conditions. We found that DPT reversibly alters information dynamics in multiple ways: First, the DPT condition was associated with a higher entropy of spontaneous firing activity and reduced the amount of time information was stored in individual neurons. Second, DPT also reduced the reversibility of neural activity, increasing the entropy produced and suggesting a drive away from equilibrium. Third, DPT altered the structure of neuronal circuits, decreasing the overall information flow coming into each neuron, but increasing the number of weak connections, creating a dynamic that combines elements of integration and disintegration. Finally, DPT decreased the higher order statistical synergy present in sets of three neurons. Collectively, these results paint a complex picture of how psychedelics regulate information processing in mesoscale neuronal networks in cortical tissue. Implications for existing hypotheses of psychedelic action, such as the entropic brain hypothesis, are discussed. In the last two decades, there has been an explosion of interest in the neural substrates of the psychedelic experience. Almost all of this work has focused on human neuroimaging with modalities like fMRI, EEG, MEG, and so forth. These approaches provide a coarse, whole-brain perspective on psychedelic drug action but miss the fine-scale changes in neuron-level firing. This study uses in vitro recordings of organotypic cultures to explore how the serotonergic psychedelic N,N-diproptyltryptamine alters information-processing dynamics in networks of a few hundreds neurons. We find robust alterations to information dynamics, including changes to the global connectivity patterns suggestive of a changing integration/segregation balance. These results should inform future work on the neurobiological basis of psychedelic drug actions.},

  abstract     = {The neurodegenerative progression of Parkinson’s disease affects brain structure and function and, concomitantly, alters the topological properties of brain networks. The network alteration accompanied by motor impairment and the duration of the disease has not yet been clearly demonstrated in the disease progression. In this study, we aim to resolve this problem with a modeling approach using the reduced Jansen-Rit model applied to large-scale brain networks derived from cross-sectional MRI data. Optimizing whole-brain simulation models allows us to discover brain networks showing unexplored relationships with clinical variables. We observe that the simulated brain networks exhibit significant differences between healthy controls ( n = 51) and patients with Parkinson’s disease ( n = 60) and strongly correlate with disease severity and disease duration of the patients. Moreover, the modeling results outperform the empirical brain networks in these clinical measures. Consequently, this study demonstrates that utilizing the simulated brain networks provides an enhanced view of network alterations in the progression of motor impairment and identifies potential biomarkers for clinical indices. Understanding the progression of neurodegenerative diseases is of extreme importance in medicine. We utilize biophysical whole-brain models to describe how the brain networks change in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We demonstrate clear correlations between the severity of motor impairment and the properties of the simulated brain networks, which are not prominent in empirical brain networks. Furthermore, we show that healthy participants exhibit a pronounced adaptation of network efficiencies in response to varying parameters of the model, while such an adaptation process is suppressed in PD patients with higher disease severity and duration. Our findings suggest a potential model-based biomarker for classification and clinical evaluation of progressive PD using cross-sectional clinical MRI data.},

  abstract     = {Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a slowly propagating wave of transient cellular depolarization, is a reliable cortical response to various brain insults (stroke, trauma, seizures) and underlying mechanism of migraine aura. Little is known about CSD effects on brain network activity. Using undirected (mutual information, MI) and directed (transfer entropy, TE) measures, we studied the dynamics of cross-hemispheric connectivity associated with the development of unilateral CSD in freely behaving rats and the involvement of inhibitory transmission in mechanisms of the coupling changes. We show that the development of CSD in the cortex of one hemisphere is followed by the transient loss of undirected functional connectivity (MI) between ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions. The post-CSD functional disconnection of the hemispheres was accompanied by an increase in driving force from an unaffected contralateral cortex to an affected one (TE). Mild cortical disinhibition produced by pretreatment with an inhibitory receptor blocking agent (penthylenetetrazole) did not affect CSD but attenuated (MI) or eliminated (TE) the CSD-induced connectivity changes. The effects of CSD on functional connectivity in awake rodents were similar at the individual and group levels, suggesting that the described connectivity response may be a promising network biomarker of CSD occurrence in patients. Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a wave of transient cellular depolarization, is a universal brain response to acute insults and an underlying mechanism of migraine aura. Here, we studied the effects of a single unilateral CSD induced in awake animals on cross-hemispheric functional connectivity. CSD was followed by a reversible loss of undirected functional connectivity between the affected and unaffected cortices. The post-CSD disconnection was accompanied by an increased driving force from the unaffected cortex to the affected one. The CSD-induced changes in undirected and directed connectivity were attenuated or abolished by a pharmacological blockade of intracortical inhibition. Thus, transient unilateral disfunction rapidly activates network mechanisms of inhibitory restraint from the intact to the dysfunctional hemisphere, indicating a remarkable functional flexibility of awake brain networks.},

Previously, tools from topological data analysis, especially Mapper, have been successfully used to mine brain activity dynamics at the highest spatiotemporal resolutions. Even though it is a relatively established tool within the field of topological data analysis, Mapper results are highly impacted by parameter selection. Given that noninvasive human neuroimaging data (e.g., from fMRI) is typically fraught with artifacts and no gold standards exist regarding “true” state transitions, we argue for a thorough examination of Mapper parameter choices to better reveal their impact. Using synthetic data (with known transition structure) and real fMRI data, we explore a variety of parameter choices for each Mapper step, thereby providing guidance and heuristics for the field. We also release our parameter exploration toolbox as a software package to make it easier for scientists to investigate and apply Mapper to any dataset.},

  abstract     = {State-dependent neural correlations can be understood from a neural coding framework. Noise correlations—trial-to-trial or moment-to-moment covariability—can be interpreted only if the underlying signal correlation—similarity of task selectivity between pairs of neural units—is known. Despite many investigations in local spiking circuits, it remains unclear how this coding framework applies to large-scale brain networks. Here, we investigated relationships between large-scale noise correlations and signal correlations in a multitask human fMRI dataset. We found that task-state noise correlation changes (e.g., functional connectivity) did not typically change in the same direction as their underlying signal correlation (e.g., tuning similarity of two regions). Crucially, noise correlations that changed in the opposite direction as their signal correlation (i.e., anti-aligned correlations) improved information coding of these brain regions. In contrast, noise correlations that changed in the same direction (aligned noise correlations) as their signal correlation did not. Interestingly, these aligned noise correlations were primarily correlation increases, suggesting that most functional correlation increases across fMRI networks actually degrade information coding. These findings illustrate that state-dependent noise correlations shape information coding of functional brain networks, with interpretation of correlation changes requiring knowledge of underlying signal correlations. We leveraged insights from the neural coding theory to interpret large-scale patterns of correlated activity across many cognitive tasks in human fMRI. We characterized the signal correlation (i.e., task tuning similarity between regions), the noise correlation (i.e., functional connectivity), and the change in noise correlation by task engagement. Following neural coding theory, we parsed noise correlation changes into components that are aligned with the signal correlation, which degrade information coding across regions, versus those that are anti-aligned, which enhance information coding. Anti-alignment of noise correlation changes with the correlation minimizes the amount of interference between the two brain regions. Together, these findings provide a task information coding perspective to interpret task-state correlation changes in human functional brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Memory is a complex brain process that requires coordinated activities in a large-scale brain network. However, the relationship between coordinated brain network activities and memory-related behavior is not well understood. In this study, we investigated this issue by suppressing the activity in the dorsal hippocampus (dHP) using chemogenetics and measuring the corresponding changes in brain-wide resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and memory behavior in awake rats. We identified an extended brain network contributing to the performance in a spatial memory related task. Our results were cross-validated using two different chemogenetic actuators, clozapine (CLZ) and clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). This study provides a brain network interpretation of memory performance, indicating that memory is associated with coordinated brain-wide neural activities. Successful memory processes require coordinated activity in a large-scale brain network, extending beyond a few key, well-known brain regions like the hippocampus. However, the specific brain regions involved and how they orchestrate their activity that is pertinent to memory processing remain unclear. Our study, using a chemogenetics-rsfMRI-behavior approach in awake rats, elucidates a comprehensive framework of the extended memory-associated network. This knowledge offers a broader interpretation of memory processes, enhancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms behind memory function, particularly from a network perspective.},

  abstract     = {Several recent studies have optimized deep neural networks to learn high-dimensional relationships linking structural and functional connectivity across the human connectome. However, the extent to which these models recapitulate individual-specific characteristics of resting-state functional brain networks remains unclear. A core concern relates to whether current individual predictions outperform simple benchmarks such as group averages and null conditions. Here, we consider two measures to statistically evaluate whether functional connectivity predictions capture individual effects. We revisit our previously published functional connectivity predictions for 1,000 healthy adults and provide multiple lines of evidence supporting that our predictions successfully capture subtle individual-specific variation in connectivity. While predicted individual effects are statistically significant and outperform several benchmarks, we find that effect sizes are small (i.e., 8%–11% improvement relative to group-average benchmarks). As such, initial expectations about individual prediction performance expressed by us and others may require moderation. We conclude that individual predictions can significantly outperform appropriate benchmark conditions and we provide several recommendations for future studies in this area. Future studies should statistically assess the individual prediction performance of their models using one of the measures and benchmarks provided here. Functional and structural brain networks share considerable overlap in network architecture. However, it remains debated whether deep neural networks can be trained to predict an individual&#39;s functional brain network from their structural connectome. We demonstrate that individual variability in functional brain connectivity can be successfully predicted from an individual&#39;s connectome, although prediction performance is modest when benchmarked against appropriate null models. We provide recommendations for future studies aiming to evaluate such predictions, specifically considering the impact of Riemann geometry, adjustments for cross-validation induced dependence and standardization. Accurate prediction models will enable extrapolation of functional networks for individuals without empirically acquired functional MRI data or noisy data. They may also facilitate digital simulations of the potential functional consequences arising from pathological changes in the connectome.},

  abstract     = {Hub regions in the brain, recognized for their roles in ensuring efficient information transfer, are vulnerable to pathological alterations in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Computational simulations and animal experiments have hinted at the theory of activity-dependent degeneration as the cause of this hub vulnerability. However, two critical issues remain unresolved. First, past research has not clearly distinguished between two scenarios: hub regions facing a higher risk of connectivity disruption (targeted attack) and all regions having an equal risk (random attack). Second, human studies offering support for activity-dependent explanations remain scarce. We refined the hub disruption index to demonstrate a hub disruption pattern in functional connectivity in autosomal dominant AD that aligned with targeted attacks. This hub disruption is detectable even in preclinical stages, 12 years before the expected symptom onset and is amplified alongside symptomatic progression. Moreover, hub disruption was primarily tied to regional differences in global connectivity and sequentially followed changes observed in amyloid-beta positron emission tomography cortical markers, consistent with the activity-dependent degeneration explanation. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of brain network organization in neurodegenerative diseases and could be instrumental in refining diagnostic and targeted therapeutic strategies for AD in the future. Our research introduces a refined hub disruption index that reveals early and progressive targeted connectivity impairments in brain regions central to information transfer in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Detectable up to 12 years before clinical symptoms, selective functional connectivity impairments were higher at high global connectivity regions, preceding changes in amyloid-beta positron emission tomography markers. This supports the concept of activity-dependent degeneration and underscores the vulnerability of hub regions to neurodegenerative processes. Our findings enhance the understanding of the brain’s network organization in AD and offer significant potential for improving early diagnosis and developing precise therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the differences between functional and structural human brain connectivity has been a focus of an extensive amount of neuroscience research. We employ a novel approach using the multinomial stochastic block model (MSBM) to explicitly extract components that characterize prominent differences across graphs. We analyze structural and functional connectomes derived from high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI and fMRI scans of 250 Human Connectome Project subjects, analyzed at group connectivity level across 50 subjects. The inferred brain partitions revealed consistent, spatially homogeneous clustering patterns across inferred resolutions demonstrating the MSBM’s reliability in identifying brain areas with prominent structure-function differences. Prominent differences in low-resolution brain maps ( K = {3, 4} clusters) were attributed to weak functional connectivity in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, while higher resolution results ( K ≥ 25) revealed stronger interhemispheric functional than structural connectivity. Our findings emphasize significant differences in high-resolution functional and structural connectomes, revealing challenges in extracting meaningful connectivity measurements from both modalities, including tracking fibers through the corpus callosum and attenuated functional connectivity in anterior temporal lobe fMRI data, which we attribute to increased noise levels. The MSBM emerges as a valuable tool for understanding differences across graphs, with potential future applications and avenues beyond the current focus on characterizing modality-specific distinctions in connectomics data. We present a probabilistic framework, the multinomial stochastic block model (MSBM), to discover prominent differences between structural and functional high-resolution networks derived from diffusion-weighted MRI and fMRI scans from 250 Human Connectome Project subjects. By varying the number of clusters, the MSBM reveals at different levels of resolution the most prominent differences in how brain regions are functionally and structurally connected. Synthetic experiments and consistent brain map patterns extracted in real high-resolution connectomes highlight the MSBM’s ability to identify brain areas with prominent structure-function differences. This includes prominent differences in the connectivity of the anterior temporal lobes as well as interhemispheric connectivity, which we attribute mainly to the specific technical and methodological limitations of the functional and structural modality, respectively.},

  abstract     = {There are a growing number of neuroimaging studies motivating joint structural and functional brain connectivity. The brain connectivity of different modalities provides an insight into brain functional organization by leveraging complementary information, especially for brain disorders such as schizophrenia. In this paper, we propose a multimodal independent component analysis (ICA) model that utilizes information from both structural and functional brain connectivity guided by spatial maps to estimate intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Structural connectivity is estimated through whole-brain tractography on diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), while functional connectivity is derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The proposed structural-functional connectivity and spatially constrained ICA (sfCICA) model estimates ICNs at the subject level using a multiobjective optimization framework. We evaluated our model using synthetic and real datasets (including dMRI and rs-fMRI from 149 schizophrenia patients and 162 controls). Multimodal ICNs revealed enhanced functional coupling between ICNs with higher structural connectivity, improved modularity, and network distinction, particularly in schizophrenia. Statistical analysis of group differences showed more significant differences in the proposed model compared with the unimodal model. In summary, the sfCICA model showed benefits from being jointly informed by structural and functional connectivity. These findings suggest advantages in simultaneously learning effectively and enhancing connectivity estimates using structural connectivity. The brain can be modeled as distinct functional networks, interacting with each other to construct an integrated system. Each network, named intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) is associated with a specific brain function. Neuroimaging studies increasingly explore combined structural and functional brain connectivity networks to identify ICNs, offering valuable insights into brain organization. This paper introduces a multimodal independent component analysis (ICA) model, structural-functional connectivity and spatially constrained ICA (sfCICA), which uses both structural (diffusion-weighted MRI) and functional (resting-state functional MRI) connectivity information guided by spatial maps to estimate ICNs. The proposed model reveals improved functional coupling, modularity, and network distinction, especially in schizophrenia. Statistical analysis shows more significant group differences compared with unimodal models.

  abstract     = {Connectome generative models, otherwise known as generative network models, provide insight into the wiring principles underpinning brain network organization. While these models can approximate numerous statistical properties of empirical networks, they typically fail to explicitly characterize an important contributor to brain organization—axonal growth. Emulating the chemoaffinity-guided axonal growth, we provide a novel generative model in which axons dynamically steer the direction of propagation based on distance-dependent chemoattractive forces acting on their growth cones. This simple dynamic growth mechanism, despite being solely geometry-dependent, is shown to generate axonal fiber bundles with brain-like geometry and features of complex network architecture consistent with the human brain, including lognormally distributed connectivity weights, scale-free nodal degrees, small-worldness, and modularity. We demonstrate that our model parameters can be fitted to individual connectomes, enabling connectome dimensionality reduction and comparison of parameters between groups. Our work offers an opportunity to bridge studies of axon guidance and connectome development, providing new avenues for understanding neural development from a computational perspective. Generative models of the human connectome provide insight into principles driving brain network development. However, current models do not capture axonal outgrowth, which is crucial to the formation of neural circuits. We develop a novel generative connectome model featuring dynamic axonal outgrowth, revealing the contribution of microscopic axonal guidance to the network topology and axonal geometry of macroscopic connectomes. Simple axonal outgrowth rules representing continuous chemoaffinity gradients are shown to generate complex, brain-like topologies and realistic axonal fascicle architectures. Our model is sufficiently sensitive to capture subtle interindividual differences in axonal outgrowth between healthy adults. Our results are significant because they reveal core principles that may give rise to both complex brain networks and brain-like axonal bundles, unifying neurogenesis across scales.},

  abstract     = {The atypical static brain functions related to the executive control network (ECN), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN) in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been widely reported. However, their transient functions in ASD are not clear. We aim to identify transient network states (TNSs) using coactivation pattern (CAP) analysis to characterize the age-related atypical transient functions in ASD. CAP analysis was performed on a resting-state fMRI dataset (78 ASD and 78 healthy control (CON) juveniles, 54 ASD and 54 CON adults). Six TNSs were divided into the DMN-TNSs, ECN-TNSs, and SN-TNSs. The DMN-TNSs were major states with the highest stability and proportion, and the ECN-TNSs and SN-TNSs were minor states. Age-related abnormalities on spatial stability and TNS proportion were found in ASD. The spatial stability of DMN-TNSs was found increasing with age in CON, but was not found in ASD. A lower proportion of DMN-TNSs was found in ASD compared with CON of the same age, and ASD juveniles had a higher proportion of SN-TNSs while ASD adults had a higher proportion of ECN-TNSs. The abnormalities on spatial stability and TNS proportion were related to social deficits. Our results provided new evidence for atypical transient brain functions in people with ASD. This article reveals the age-related atypical transient brain functions in autistic people. The default mode network dominates major states during rest, while the executive control network and salience network dominates minor states. Major states have more a stable coactivation patterns and higher proportion than minor states. The spatial stability would increase with age in healthy controls but not in autistic people. Meanwhile, autistic people spend less time on major states but more time on minor states. In addition, the unstable transient states and imbalanced activation proportion of brain networks are correlated with the social deficits. Although this work is limited by that single scanning data of only involving male participants with normal intelligence, it provides new transient aspect for atypical brain function in autistic people.},

  abstract     = {Striatum, the input stage of the basal ganglia, is important for sensory-motor integration, initiation and selection of behavior, as well as reward learning. Striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from mainly cortex and thalamus. In rodents, the striatal projection neurons (SPNs), giving rise to the direct and the indirect pathway (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively), account for 95% of the neurons, and the remaining 5% are GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. Interneuron axon terminals as well as local dSPN and iSPN axon collaterals form an intricate striatal network. Following chronic dopamine depletion as in Parkinson’s disease (PD), both morphological and electrophysiological striatal neuronal features have been shown to be altered in rodent models. Our goal with this in silico study is twofold: (a) to predict and quantify how the intrastriatal network connectivity structure becomes altered as a consequence of the morphological changes reported at the single-neuron level and (b) to investigate how the effective glutamatergic drive to the SPNs would need to be altered to account for the activity level seen in SPNs during PD. In summary, we predict that the richness of the connectivity motifs in the striatal network is significantly decreased during PD while, at the same time, a substantial enhancement of the effective glutamatergic drive to striatum is present. This in silico study predicts the impact that the single-cell neuronal morphological alterations will have on the striatal microcircuit connectivity. We find that the richness in the topological striatal motifs is significantly reduced in Parkinson’s disease (PD), highlighting that just measuring the pairwise connectivity between neurons gives an incomplete description of network connectivity. Moreover, we predict how the resulting electrophysiological changes of striatal projection neuron excitability together with their reduced number of dendritic branches affect their response to the glutamatergic drive from the cortex and thalamus. We find that the effective glutamatergic drive is likely significantly increased in PD, in accordance with the hyperglutamatergic hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Connectomes’ topological organization can be quantified using graph theory. Here, we investigated brain networks in higher dimensional spaces defined by up to 10 graph theoretic nodal properties. These properties assign a score to nodes, reflecting their meaning in the network. Using 100 healthy unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project, we generated various connectomes (structural/functional, binary/weighted). We observed that nodal properties are correlated (i.e., they carry similar information) at whole-brain and subnetwork level. We conducted an exploratory machine learning analysis to test whether high-dimensional network information differs between sensory and association areas. Brain regions of sensory and association networks were classified with an 80–86% accuracy in a 10-dimensional (10D) space. We observed the largest gain in machine learning accuracy going from a 2D to 3D space, with a plateauing accuracy toward 10D space, and nonlinear Gaussian kernels outperformed linear kernels. Finally, we quantified the Euclidean distance between nodes in a 10D graph space. The multidimensional Euclidean distance was highest across subjects in the default mode network (in structural networks) and frontoparietal and temporal lobe areas (in functional networks). To conclude, we propose a new framework for quantifying network features in high-dimensional spaces that may reveal new network properties of the brain. Nodal properties are of particular importance when investigating patterns in brain networks. Nodal information is usually studied by comparing a few nodal measurements (up to three), resulting in analyses in three-dimensional spaces, at maximum. We offer a new framework to extend these approaches by defining new, up to 10-dimensional, mathematical spaces, called graph spaces, built using up to 10 nodal properties. We show that correlations between nodal properties express differences regarding connectome models (structural/functional, binary/weighted) and brain subnetworks. We provide early application and quantification of machine learning in graph spaces of dimensions 2 to 10, as well as a quantification of single brain regions, and global connectome, Euclidean distance in a 10-dimensional graph space. This provides new tools to quantify network features in high-dimensional spaces.},

  abstract     = {A fine-grained understanding of dynamics in cortical networks is crucial to unpacking brain function. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) gives rise to time series recordings of the activity of different brain regions, which are aperiodic and lack a base frequency. Cyclicity analysis, a novel technique robust under time reparametrizations, is effective in recovering the temporal ordering of such time series, collectively considered components of a multidimensional trajectory. Here, we extend this analytical method for characterizing the dynamic interaction between distant brain regions and apply it to the data from the Human Connectome Project. Our analysis detected cortical traveling waves of activity propagating along a spatial axis, resembling cortical hierarchical organization with consistent lead-lag relationships between specific brain regions in resting-state scans. In fMRI scans involving tasks, we observed short bursts of task-modulated strong temporal ordering that dominate overall lead-lag relationships between pairs of regions in the brain that align temporally with stimuli from the tasks. Our results suggest a possible role played by waves of excitation sweeping through brain regions that underlie emergent cognitive functions. While brain network studies initially used correlated signals from brain regions to infer their network structure, recent efforts have focused on the dynamic aspects of such networks. This study extends the cyclicity analysis (CA) method—a technique developed for aperiodic time series analysis—to the Human Connectome Project. Notably, CA makes no assumptions about the statistics of the data and works despite possibly nonlinear changes to the timeline of the observations. Using CA, we provide evidence for (a) the propagation of an ultraslow brain wave in the resting state and (b) the detection of directed activity between brain regions that fluctuate in the presence of tasks and stimuli, without relying on frequency domain or correlation-based analysis—a novel contribution to existing literature.},

However, connectome dynamics at fast (&gt;1 Hz) timescales highly relevant to cognition are poorly understood due to the dominance of inherently slow fMRI in connectome studies. Here, we investigated the behavioral significance of rapid electrophysiological connectome dynamics using source-localized EEG connectomes during resting state ( N = 926, 473 females). We focused on dynamic connectome features pertinent to individual differences, specifically those with established heritability: Fractional Occupancy (i.e., the overall duration spent in each recurrent connectome state) in beta and gamma bands and Transition Probability (i.e., the frequency of state switches) in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Canonical correlation analysis found a significant relationship between the heritable phenotypes of subsecond connectome dynamics and cognition. Specifically, principal components of Transition Probabilities in alpha (followed by theta and gamma bands) and a cognitive factor representing visuospatial processing (followed by verbal and auditory working memory) most notably contributed to the relationship. We conclude that rapid connectome state transitions shape individuals’ cognitive abilities and traits. Such subsecond connectome dynamics may inform about behavioral function and dysfunction and serve as endophenotypes for cognitive abilities. This study investigates the behavioral significance of rapid electrophysiological connectome dynamics features with established heritability. The heritable phenotypes that describe the duration (Fractional Occupancy) and frequency of connectome state switches (Transition Probability) were obtained using hidden Markov model on source-localized EEG data at rest. Using the canonical correlation analysis approach, we found that connectome state transitions unfolding at multiple speeds (e.g., alpha, theta, and gamma) collectively contribute to shape cognitive abilities.},

While infraslow (&lt;0.1 Hz) connectome dynamics have been extensively studied with fMRI, rapid dynamics highly relevant for cognition are poorly understood. Here, we asked whether rapid electrophysiological connectome dynamics constitute subject-specific brain traits and to what extent they are under genetic influence. Using source-localized EEG connectomes during resting state ( N = 928, 473 females), we quantified the heritability of multivariate (multistate) features describing temporal or spatial characteristics of connectome dynamics. States switched rapidly every ∼60–500 ms. Temporal features were heritable, particularly Fractional Occupancy (in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands) and Transition Probability (in theta, alpha, and gamma bands), representing the duration spent in each state and the frequency of state switches, respectively. Genetic effects explained a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance of these features: Fractional Occupancy in beta (44.3%) and gamma (39.8%) bands and Transition Probability in theta (38.4%), alpha (63.3%), beta (22.6%), and gamma (40%) bands. However, we found no evidence for the heritability of dynamic spatial features, specifically states’ Modularity and connectivity pattern. We conclude that genetic effects shape individuals’ connectome dynamics at rapid timescales, specifically states’ overall occurrence and sequencing. In this study, we investigate the genetic influence on rapid electrophysiological connectome dynamics. Using hidden Markov model on source-localized EEG data at rest, we obtained measures describing temporal trajectories and time-varying spatial characteristics of connectome states. Applying two heritability assessment methods to these multivariate, time-varying connectome dynamics features, we discovered that the duration (Fractional Occupancy) and frequency of state switches (Transition Probability) were heritable, particularly in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands.

Here, we map integration and segregation to order and disorder states from the Ising model in physics to calculate state probabilities, P int and P seg , from functional MRI data. We find that integration decreases and segregation increases with age across three databases. Changes are consistent with weakened connection strength among regions rather than topological connectivity based on structural and diffusion MRI data. The integration-segregation framework succinctly captures the trade-off that brains face between seamless function (more integration) in light of energetic constrains (more segregation). Despite its ubiquitous use in the field, there is no consensus on its definition with various graph theoretical properties being proposed. Here, we define the two states based on the underlying mechanism of neuronal coupling strength to provide a physical foundation for the framework. We find that younger adults’ brains are close to perfectly balanced between integration and segregation, while older adults’ brains veer off toward random signaling.},

We investigated the effects of TUS in macaques using a recent metric, the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient, which quantifies different kinds of neural information processing. We analyzed this high-order quantity on the fMRI data after TUS in two targets: the supplementary motor area (SMA-TUS) and the frontal polar cortex (FPC-TUS). The TUS produced specific changes at the limbic network at FPC-TUS and the motor network at SMA-TUS and altered the sensorimotor, temporal, and frontal networks in both targets, mostly consistent across macaques. Moreover, there was a reduction in the structural and functional coupling after both stimulations. Finally, the TUS changed the intrinsic high-order network topology, decreasing the modular organization of the redundancy at SMA-TUS and increasing the synergistic integration at FPC-TUS. This article aims to elucidate how the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) could reorganize the brain as measured by the computation of redundancy and synergy. Our results showed that the TUS produced target-specific changes in the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient distribution at the limbic network at the frontal polar cortex (FPC-TUS) and the motor network at the supplementary motor area (SMA-TUS) and alterations in common, independent of the target, on the sensorimotor, temporal, and frontal networks.

  abstract     = {The study of large-scale brain connectivity is increasingly adopting unsupervised approaches that derive low-dimensional spatial representations from high-dimensional connectomes, referred to as gradient analysis. When translating this approach to study interindividual variations in connectivity, one technical issue pertains to the selection of an appropriate group-level template to which individual gradients are aligned. Here, we compared different group-level template construction strategies using functional and structural connectome data from neurotypical controls and individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to identify between-group differences. We studied multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Initiative II and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We designed six template construction strategies that varied in whether (1) they included typical controls in addition to ASD; or (2) they mapped from one dataset onto another. We found that aligning a combined subject template of the ASD and control subjects from the ABIDE Initiative onto the HCP template exhibited the most pronounced effect size. This strategy showed robust identification of ASD-related brain regions for both functional and structural gradients across different study settings. Replicating the findings on focal epilepsy demonstrated the generalizability of our approach. Our findings will contribute to improving gradient-based connectivity research. Gradient-based connectivity analysis provides a compact understanding of complex connectivity patterns across the brain. One issue of the gradient analysis is to choose an appropriate group-level template in which individual gradients are aligned. Here, we assessed six different strategies for constructing group-level gradient templates, including those based on combined data from individuals with psychiatric conditions and control subjects, and data from an independent dataset of young, healthy adults. The choice of template significantly influences the outcomes of gradient analyses, with templates combining data from both groups or aligning to a high-quality independent dataset, providing more balanced results. This study emphasizes the importance of template selection in brain connectivity studies, contributing to more reliable gradient analyses.},

  abstract     = {Identifying directed network models for multivariate time series is a ubiquitous problem in data science. Granger causality measure (GCM) and conditional GCM (cGCM) are widely used methods for identifying directed connections between time series. Both GCM and cGCM have frequency-domain formulations to characterize the dependence of time series in the spectral domain. However, the original methods were developed using a heuristic approach without rigorous theoretical explanations. To overcome the limitation, the minimum-entropy (ME) estimation approach was introduced in our previous work ( Ning &amp; Rathi, 2018 ) to generalize GCM and cGCM with more rigorous frequency-domain formulations. In this work, this information-theoretic framework is further generalized with three formulations for conditional causality analysis using techniques in control theory, such as state-space representations and spectral factorizations. The three conditional causal measures are developed based on different ME estimation procedures that are motivated by equivalent formulations of the classical minimum mean squared error estimation method. The relationship between the three formulations of conditional causality measures is analyzed theoretically. Their performance is evaluated using simulations and real neuroimaging data to analyze brain networks. The results show that the proposed methods provide more accurate network structures than the original approach. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for causal inference in brain networks using time series measurements based on the principle of minimum-entropy regression. Three types of conditional causality measures are derived based on varying formulations of minimum-entropy regressions. The standard time-domain conditional Granger causality measure is formulated as a special case but with a different expression of the frequency-domain measure. The methods were evaluated using simulations and real resting-state functional MRI data of human brains and compared with standard Granger causality measures and directed transfer functions. Two new formulations of minimum-entropy-based causality measures showed better performance than other methods. The algorithms developed from this work may provide new insights to understand information flow in brain networks.},

  abstract     = {This study challenges the traditional focus on zero-lag statistics in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) research. Instead, it advocates for considering time-lag interactions to unveil the directionality and asymmetries of the brain hierarchy. Effective connectivity (EC), the state matrix in dynamical causal modeling (DCM), is a commonly used metric for studying dynamical properties and causal interactions within a linear state-space system description. Here, we focused on how time-lag statistics are incorporated within the framework of DCM resulting in an asymmetric EC matrix. Our approach involves decomposing the EC matrix, revealing a steady-state differential cross-covariance matrix that is responsible for modeling information flow and introducing time-irreversibility. Specifically, the system’s dynamics, influenced by the off-diagonal part of the differential covariance, exhibit a curl steady-state flow component that breaks detailed balance and diverges the dynamics from equilibrium. Our empirical findings indicate that the EC matrix’s outgoing strengths correlate with the flow described by the differential cross covariance, while incoming strengths are primarily driven by zero-lag covariance, emphasizing conditional independence over directionality. Modeling large-scale brain dynamics offers insight into the main principles of brain self-organization. In particular, the identification of traces of nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics also at the mascroscale level has been recently linked to the presence of intrinsic brain networks. Quantifying these aspects is generally limited by numerical difficulties. However, for resting-state BOLD data, a linear stochastic state-space model has demonstrated efficacy, simplifying analysis. Specifically, the asymmetric structure of effective connectivity, that is, the state interaction matrix, directly reflects nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics and time-irreversibility. By disentangling this asymmetry, we quantified departure from equilibrium and discerned primary directions of information propagation, identifying brain regions as sources or sinks.},

  abstract     = {In response to a growing interest in refining brain connectivity assessments, this study focuses on integrating white matter fiber-specific microstructural properties into structural connectomes. Spanning ages 8–19 years in a developmental sample, it explores age-related patterns of microstructure-informed network properties at both local and global scales. First, the diffusion-weighted signal fraction associated with each tractography-reconstructed streamline was constructed. Subsequently, the convex optimization modeling for microstructure-informed tractography (COMMIT) approach was employed to generate microstructure-informed connectomes from diffusion MRI data. To complete the investigation, network characteristics within eight functionally defined networks (visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, fronto-parietal, default mode, and subcortical networks) were evaluated. The findings underscore a consistent increase in global efficiency across child and adolescent development within the visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks ( p &lt; 0.005). Additionally, mean strength exhibits an upward trend in the somatomotor and visual networks ( p &lt; 0.001). Notably, nodes within the dorsal and ventral visual pathways manifest substantial age-dependent changes in local efficiency, aligning with existing evidence of extended maturation in these pathways. The outcomes strongly support the notion of a prolonged developmental trajectory for visual association cortices. This study contributes valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of microstructure-informed brain connectivity throughout different developmental stages. There is a growing interest in incorporating biologically relevant white matter properties into the analysis of brain networks to obtain a more quantitative assessment of brain connectivity. In a developmental sample aged 8–19 years, we studied age-related patterns of local and global network properties. We generated microstructure-informed connectomes using diffusion MRI data, and computed network characteristics in eight functionally defined networks (visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, fronto-parietal, default mode, and subcortical networks). The findings reveal that throughout child and adolescent development, global efficiency increases in the visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks, and mean strength increases in the somatomotor and visual networks. Nodes belonging to the dorsal and ventral visual pathways demonstrate the largest age-dependence in local efficiency, supporting previous evidence of protracted maturation of dorsal and ventral visual pathways. The results provide compelling evidence that there is a prolonged development of visual association cortices.},

  abstract     = {Current treatments of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have limited efficacy in alleviating freezing of gait (FoG). In this context, concomitant deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach. However, the mechanisms underlying this approach are unknown. While the current rationale relies on network-based hypotheses of intensified disinhibition of brainstem locomotor areas to facilitate the release of gait motor programs, it is still unclear how simultaneous high-frequency DBS in two interconnected basal ganglia nuclei affects large-scale cortico-subcortical network activity. Here, we use a basic model of neural excitation, the susceptible-excited-refractory (SER) model, to compare effects of different stimulation modes of the network underlying FoG based on the mouse brain connectivity atlas. We develop a network-based computational framework to compare subcortical DBS targets through exhaustive analysis of the brain attractor dynamics in the healthy, PD, and DBS states. We show that combined STN+SNr DBS outperforms STN DBS in terms of the normalization of spike propagation flow in the FoG network. The framework aims to move toward a mechanistic understanding of the network effects of DBS and may be applicable to further perturbation-based therapies of brain disorders. Parkinson’s disease patients with freezing of gait (FoG) may be treated by deep brain stimulation, which produces effects mediated by brain networks. Currently, the approach of combined DBS of the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata is investigated for being particularly beneficial for patients with axial symptoms, but the exact mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here, we present a network-based computational framework using a basic excitable model that enables us to simulate the complete activity patterns of the brain network involved in FoG. These simulations reveal network mechanisms underlying STN+SNr DBS and its efficacy in alleviating FoG. The proposed framework can capture the influence of the DBS target sites on cortico-subcortical networks and help to identify suitable stimulation targets.},

  abstract     = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies most commonly use cluster-based inference to detect local changes in brain activity. Insufficient statistical power and disproportionate false-positive rates reportedly hinder optimal inference. We propose a structural connectivity–guided clustering framework, called topological cluster statistic (TCS), that enhances sensitivity by leveraging white matter anatomical connectivity information. TCS harnesses multimodal information from diffusion tractography and functional imaging to improve task fMRI activation inference. Compared to conventional approaches, TCS consistently improves power over a wide range of effects. This improvement results in a 10%–50% increase in local sensitivity with the greatest gains for medium-sized effects. TCS additionally enables inspection of underlying anatomical networks and thus uncovers knowledge regarding the anatomical underpinnings of brain activation. This novel approach is made available in the PALM software to facilitate usability. Given the increasing recognition that activation reflects widespread, coordinated processes, TCS provides a way to integrate the known structure underlying widespread activations into neuroimaging analyses moving forward. Neuroimaging studies often encounter challenges in reliable inference of statistical maps due to limited statistical power. This article introduces TCS, a novel method that integrates anatomical connectivity data from diffusion tractography into cluster-based inference techniques. Our findings demonstrate that TCS enhances statistical power, improves the detection of spatially disjoint localized activations, and identifies the underlying network linking distant inferred active regions. By elucidating the coordinated network supporting inferred effects, TCS enables data-driven interpretation of inference results. The availability of TCS as a publicly accessible tool offers a promising avenue for future neuroimaging research to leverage anatomical connectivity for enhanced inference and interpretation.},

  abstract     = {Generalized epileptic attacks, which exhibit widespread disruption of brain activity, are characterized by recurrent, spontaneous, and synchronized bursts of neural activity that self-initiate and self-terminate through critical transitions. Here we utilize the general framework of explosive synchronization (ES) from complex systems science to study the role of network structure and resource dynamics in the generation and propagation of seizures. We show that a combination of resource constraint and adaptive coupling in a Kuramoto network oscillator model can reliably generate seizure-like synchronization activity across different network topologies, including a biologically derived mesoscale mouse brain network. The model, coupled with a novel algorithm for tracking seizure propagation, provides mechanistic insight into the dynamics of transition to the synchronized state and its dependence on resources; and identifies key brain areas that may be involved in the initiation and spatial propagation of the seizure. The model, though minimal, efficiently recapitulates several experimental and theoretical predictions from more complex models and makes novel experimentally testable predictions. Understanding seizure dynamics at the whole-brain level is crucial for controlling abnormal hypersynchronous activity. Currently, complete brain coverage recordings are lacking in both patients and animal models. We employ network science tools to investigate epileptic seizure-like synchronization in a mouse whole-brain network, leveraging network structure and supported dynamics as the basis for seizure evolution. Our results align with experimental findings, suggesting that seizure activity initiates in the cortico-thalamic circuit. Importantly, our novel analysis identifies key nodes, primarily in the cortex, driving this hypersynchronous activity. Our findings highlight the network structure&#39;s role in shaping seizure dynamics, and the techniques developed here could enhance our ability to control generalized seizures when combined with patient-specific data.},

  abstract     = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations have provided a view of the default network (DN) as composed of a specific set of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical regions. This spatial topography is typically defined with reference to an influential network parcellation scheme that designated the DN as one of seven large-scale networks ( Yeo et al., 2011 ). However, the precise functional organization of the DN is still under debate, with studies arguing for varying subnetwork configurations and the inclusion of subcortical regions. In this vein, the so-called limbic network—defined as a distinct large-scale network comprising the bilateral temporal poles, ventral anterior temporal lobes, and orbitofrontal cortex—is of particular interest. A large multi-modal and multi-species literature on the anatomical, functional, and cognitive properties of these regions suggests a close relationship to the DN. Notably, these regions have poor signal quality with conventional fMRI acquisition, likely obscuring their network affiliation in most studies. Here, we leverage a multi-echo fMRI dataset with high temporal signal-to-noise and whole-brain coverage, including orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions, to examine the large-scale network resting-state functional connectivity of these regions and assess their associations with the DN. Consistent with our hypotheses, our results support the inclusion of the majority of the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortex as part of the DN and reveal significant heterogeneity in their functional connectivity. We observed that left-lateralized regions within the temporal poles and ventral anterior temporal lobes, as well as medial orbitofrontal regions, exhibited the greatest resting-state functional connectivity with the DN, with heterogeneity across DN subnetworks. Overall, our findings suggest that, rather than being a functionally distinct network, the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions comprise part of a larger, extended default network. The precise functional organization of the default network is still under debate. Limitations in temporal signal-to-noise of functional MRI BOLD signal data may have restricted estimations of the topography of the default network. The “limbic network,” defined as a distinct large-scale network comprising bilateral anterior temporal and orbitofrontal cortex, has been affiliated with the default network in nonhuman animal tractography and task-based fMRI studies in humans. We leverage a multi-echo fMRI dataset with high temporal signal-to-noise and whole-brain coverage to examine the large-scale network resting-state functional connectivity of these regions and assess their associations with the default network. Our results support the inclusion of anterior temporal and orbitofrontal cortex as part of the default network.

We took this research a step further to investigate whether the underlying structural connections, measured in vivo using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), show a similar shift to support cognitive ability. We analyzed the structural connectivity streamline probability (representing the probability of connection between regions) and nodal efficiency and local efficiency regional graph theory metrics to determine whether age and cognitive ability are related to structural network differences. We found that the relationship between structural connectivity and cognitive ability with age was nuanced, with some differences with age that were associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, but other reorganizations that were associated with spared cognitive ability. These positive changes included strengthened local intrahemispheric connectivity and increased nodal efficiency of the ventral occipital-temporal stream, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus for older adults, and widespread local efficiency primarily for middle-aged individuals.

  abstract     = {Mind-wandering is a frequent, daily mental activity, experienced in unique ways in each person. Yet neuroimaging evidence relating mind-wandering to brain activity, for example in the default mode network (DMN), has relied on population- rather than individual-based inferences owing to limited within-person sampling. Here, three densely sampled individuals each reported hundreds of mind-wandering episodes while undergoing multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found reliable associations between mind-wandering and DMN activation when estimating brain networks within individuals using precision functional mapping. However, the timing of spontaneous DMN activity relative to subjective reports, and the networks beyond DMN that were activated and deactivated during mind-wandering, were distinct across individuals. Connectome-based predictive modeling further revealed idiosyncratic, whole-brain functional connectivity patterns that consistently predicted mind-wandering within individuals but did not fully generalize across individuals. Predictive models of mind-wandering and attention that were derived from larger-scale neuroimaging datasets largely failed when applied to densely sampled individuals, further highlighting the need for personalized models. Our work offers novel evidence for both conserved and variable neural representations of self-reported mind-wandering in different individuals. The previously unrecognized interindividual variations reported here underscore the broader scientific value and potential clinical utility of idiographic approaches to brain-experience associations. While everyone experiences that their mind “wanders” throughout daily life, the content and form of inner experience is different in different people. In this study, we found that brain activity representing mind-wandering is different in each person, reflecting unique mental experiences. While people consistently engaged the brain’s default mode network (DMN) during mind-wandering, there were inconsistencies in the way that the DMN was engaged and in the other networks throughout the brain that were engaged. Our study highlights that personalized approaches, which require that individuals are sampled more densely than is common in current practice, enable accurate insights into relationships between brain activity and inner experience.},

  abstract     = {Emotion perception is essential to affective and cognitive development which involves distributed brain circuits. Emotion identification skills emerge in infancy and continue to develop throughout childhood and adolescence. Understanding the development of the brain’s emotion circuitry may help us explain the emotional changes during adolescence. In this work, we aim to deepen our understanding of emotion-related functional connectivity (FC) from association to causation. We proposed a Bayesian incorporated linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (BiLiNGAM), which incorporated association model into the estimation pipeline. Simulation results indicated stable and accurate performance over various settings, especially when the sample size was small. We used fMRI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) to validate the approach. It included 855 individuals aged 8–22 years who were divided into five different adolescent stages. Our network analysis revealed the development of emotion-related intra- and intermodular connectivity and pinpointed several emotion-related hubs. We further categorized the hubs into two types: in-hubs and out-hubs, as the center of receiving and distributing information, respectively. In addition, several unique developmental hub structures and group-specific patterns were discovered. Our findings help provide a directed FC template of brain network organization underlying emotion processing during adolescence. Our study introduces a novel method for analyzing directed graphs across multiple groups and demonstrates its effectiveness through a series of simulation studies. This method is applied to investigate the development of directed functional connectivity for emotion processing across diverse adolescent periods. Our findings unveil a notable increase in interfunctional connectivity with age, specifically involved with the executive control and memory retrieval, indicating the maturation of emotion processing function. Additionally, significant development of intraconnectivity in the subcortical areas emerges in early adolescence, whereas development of cerebellum emerges in the very end of adolescence. These insights offer valuable contributions to our understanding of the dynamic neural processes underlying emotion regulation during adolescence.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized to identify brain connectivity biomarkers linked to behavioral and clinical outcomes. However, research often prioritizes prediction accuracy at the expense of biological interpretability, and inconsistent implementation of ML methods may hinder model accuracy. To address this, our paper introduces a network-level enrichment approach, which integrates brain system organization in the context of connectome-wide statistical analysis to reveal network-level links between brain connectivity and behavior. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we used linear support vector regression (LSVR) models to examine the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity networks and chronological age. We compared network-level associations based on raw LSVR weights to those produced from the forward and inverse models. Results indicated that not accounting for shared family variance inflated prediction performance, the k-best feature selection via Pearson correlation reduced accuracy and reliability, and raw LSVR model weights produced network-level associations that deviated from the significant brain systems identified by forward and inverse models. Our findings offer crucial insights for applying machine learning to neuroimaging data, emphasizing the value of network enrichment for biological interpretation.},

  abstract     = {Representing data using time-resolved networks is valuable for analyzing functional data of the human brain. One commonly used method for constructing time-resolved networks from data is sliding window Pearson correlation (SWPC). One major limitation of SWPC is that it applies a high-pass filter to the activity time series. Therefore, if we select a short window (desirable to estimate rapid changes in connectivity), we will remove important low-frequency information. Here, we propose an approach based on single sideband modulation (SSB) in communication theory. This allows us to select shorter windows to capture rapid changes in the time-resolved functional network connectivity (trFNC). We use simulation and real resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to demonstrate the superior performance of SSB+SWPC compared to SWPC. We also compare the recurring trFNC patterns between individuals with the first episode of psychosis (FEP) and typical controls (TC) and show that FEPs stay more in states that show weaker connectivity across the whole brain. A result exclusive to SSB+SWPC is that TCs stay more in a state with negative connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions. Based on all the results, we argue that SSB+SWPC is more sensitive for capturing temporal variation in trFNC.},

  abstract     = {Learning new motor skills through training, also termed motor learning, is central for everyday life. Current training strategies recommend intensive task-repetitions aimed at inducing local activation of motor areas, associated with changes in oscillation amplitudes (“event-related power”) during training. More recently, another neural mechanism was suggested to influence motor learning: modulation of functional connectivity (FC), that is, how much spatially separated brain regions communicate with each other before and during training. The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of these two neural processing types on motor learning. We measured EEG before, during, and after a finger-tapping task (FTT) in 20 healthy subjects. The results showed that training gain, long-term expertise (i.e., average motor performance), and consolidation were all predicted by whole-brain alpha- and beta-band FC at motor areas, striatum, and mediotemporal lobe (MTL). Local power changes during training did not predict any dependent variable. Thus, network dynamics seem more crucial than local activity for motor sequence learning, and training techniques should attempt to facilitate network interactions rather than local cortical activation. Both, local and network processing mechanisms support motor sequence learning. The aim of the present study was to compare the impact of these two processing types on motor learning. We measured EEG before, during, and after a finger-tapping task (FTT) in 20 healthy subjects. The results showed that only network dynamics, measured with functional connectivity, could predict learning, long-term expertise, and consolidation. Conversely, local activity, measured with event-related power decrease, did not predict any dependent measure. Specifically, network interactions of the primary motor area, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe correlated with learning performance. Therefore, network dynamics seem more crucial than local activity for motor sequence learning and training techniques should facilitate network interactions rather than local cortical activation.},

  abstract     = {Promising evidence has suggested potential links between mind-wandering and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Yet, older adults with diagnosable neurocognitive disorders show reduced meta-awareness, thus questioning the validity of probe-assessed mind-wandering in older adults. In prior work, we employed response time variability as an objective, albeit indirect, marker of mind-wandering to identify patterns of functional connectivity that predicted mind-wandering. In the current study, we evaluated the association of this connectome-based, mind-wandering model with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) p-tau/A β 42 ratio in 289 older adults from the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). Moreover, we examined if this model was similarly associated with individual differences in composite measures of global cognition, episodic memory, and executive functioning. Edges from the high response time variability model were significantly associated with CSF p-tau/A β ratio. Furthermore, connectivity strength within edges associated with high response time variability was negatively associated with global cognition and episodic memory functioning. This study provides the first empirical support for a link between an objective neuromarker of mind-wandering and AD pathophysiology. Given the observed association between mind-wandering and cognitive functioning in older adults, interventions targeted at reducing mind-wandering, particularly before the onset of AD pathogenesis, may make a significant contribution to the prevention of AD-related cognitive decline. Response time variability is considered an objective, albeit indirect, marker of mind-wandering. In this study, we applied a previously-derived connectome-based model of response time variability to resting-state data obtained from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative. The network strength of the high response time variability model was correlated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based ratiometric measure of amyloid and tau pathology. Additionally, our results demonstrated that the network strength in the high response time variability model was also linked with global cognition and episodic memory. This study provides the first empirical support for the association between a neuromarker of response time variability—an indirect marker of mind-wandering—and AD pathophysiology.},

  abstract     = {Patients presenting with drug-resistant epilepsy are eligible for surgery aiming to remove the regions involved in the production of seizure activities, the so-called epileptogenic zone network (EZN). Thus the accurate estimation of the EZN is crucial. Data-driven, personalized virtual brain models derived from patient-specific anatomical and functional data are used in Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) to estimate the EZN via optimization methods from Bayesian inference. The Bayesian inference approach used in previous VEP integrates priors, based on the features of stereotactic-electroencephalography (SEEG) seizures’ recordings. Here, we propose new priors, based on quantitative 23 Na-MRI. The 23 Na-MRI data were acquired at 7T and provided several features characterizing the sodium signal decay. The hypothesis is that the sodium features are biomarkers of neuronal excitability related to the EZN and will add additional information to VEP estimation. In this paper, we first proposed the mapping from 23 Na-MRI features to predict the EZN via a machine learning approach. Then, we exploited these predictions as priors in the VEP pipeline. The statistical results demonstrated that compared with the results from current VEP, the result from VEP based on 23 Na-MRI prior has better balanced accuracy, and the similar weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall. For the first time quantitative 23 Na-MRI were used as prior information to improve estimation of epileptogenic network (EZN) using VEP pipeline, a personalized whole-brain network modeling from patient’s specific data. The prior information of EZN can be derived from 23 Na-MRI features using logistic regression predictions. The 23 Na-MRI priors inferred EZNs has a better balanced accuracy than the previously used priors or the no-prior condition.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous retinal wave activity shaping the visual system is a complex neurodevelopmental phenomenon. Retinal ganglion cells are the hubs through which activity diverges throughout the visual system. We consider how these divergent hubs emerge, using an adaptively rewiring neural network model. Adaptive rewiring models show in a principled way how brains could achieve their complex topologies. Modular small-world structures with rich-club effects and circuits of convergent-divergent units emerge as networks evolve, driven by their own spontaneous activity. Arbitrary nodes of an initially random model network were designated as retinal ganglion cells. They were intermittently exposed to the retinal waveform, as the network evolved through adaptive rewiring. A significant proportion of these nodes developed into divergent hubs within the characteristic complex network architecture. The proportion depends parametrically on the wave incidence rate. Higher rates increase the likelihood of hub formation, while increasing the potential of ganglion cell death. In addition, direct neighbors of designated ganglion cells differentiate like amacrine cells. The divergence observed in ganglion cells resulted in enhanced convergence downstream, suggesting that retinal waves control the formation of convergence in the lateral geniculate nuclei. We conclude that retinal waves stochastically control the distribution of converging and diverging activity in evolving complex networks. Retinal waves consist of spontaneous neural activity that propagates across the retina during neural development. We simulate the intermittent spread of retinal waveforms originating from a designated node in an adaptively rewiring neural network model. Adaptive rewiring models simulate, in a highly abstracted manner, how brains may achieve their complex topologies during development. This way, we aim to uncover basic principles of neural maturation in the visual system. Namely, we seek to shed light onto how retinal waves might be responsible for the differentiation of immature neurons into specific cell types (e.g., retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells) and how these waves shape the connectivity structure in the visual system.},

  abstract     = {One way to increase the statistical power and generalizability of neuroimaging studies is to collect data at multiple sites or merge multiple cohorts. However, this usually comes with site-related biases due to the heterogeneity of scanners and acquisition parameters, negatively impacting sensitivity. Brain structural connectomes are not an exception: Being derived from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images, structural connectivity is impacted by differences in imaging protocol. Beyond minimizing acquisition parameter differences, removing bias with postprocessing is essential. In this work we create, from the exhaustive Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, a resampled dataset of different b -values and spatial resolutions, modeling a cohort scanned across multiple sites. After demonstrating the statistical impact of acquisition parameters on connectivity, we propose a linear regression with explicit modeling of b -value and spatial resolution, and validate its performance on separate datasets. We show that b -value and spatial resolution affect connectivity in different ways and that acquisition bias can be reduced using a linear regression informed by the acquisition parameters while retaining interindividual differences and hence boosting fingerprinting performance. We also demonstrate the generative potential of our model, and its generalization capability in an independent dataset reflective of typical acquisition practices in clinical settings. One of the main roadblocks to using multisite neuroimaging data is the effect of acquisition bias due to the heterogeneity of acquisition parameters associated with various sites. This can negatively impact the sensitivity of machine learning models employed in neuroscience. Thus, it is extremely important to model the effect of this bias. In this work, we address this issue at the level of brain structural connectivity, an important biomarker for various brain disorders. We propose a simple linear regression model to minimize this effect using high-quality data from the Human Connectome Project, and show its generalizability to a clinical dataset.},

This required revision of some of the figures and text throughout the manuscript. In the paper, we performed quantitative analysis on the first 20 epochs of the eyes-closed, resting-state MEG recording of each subject. Relative theta power, permutation entropy, and inverted joint permutation entropy values were estimated for each epoch separately. Inadvertently, the values were not averaged over epochs per person prior to group statistics, inflating the effective degrees of freedom. As a result, the significance of some of the regional results was overestimated. This error was discovered in a re-analysis of the data and is corrected in the revised manuscript.While the error does not alter the fundamental message of our paper, in particular the classification results reported in Figure 6 and Table 2, it does impact certain reported results. Specifically, the figures and text illustrating regional differences between the SCD and MCI groups. While the direction of effects remains unchanged, the number of regions showing significant group-differences decreases in several instances.The following is a list of changes made to the main manuscript:- Figures 3–5 have been modified to indicate the correct standard error of the mean and significance levels.- The Results subsections ‘JPEinv’, ‘PE’ and ‘Relative theta power’ were modified to reflect the updated findings.- The Discussion subsection previously titled ‘Lower Theta and Alpha JPEinv in MCI’, is now titled ‘Lower Theta JPEinv in MCI’.- Discussion subsections ‘Lower Theta JPEinv in MCI’, ‘Higher Theta PE in MCI’, ‘The Role of Parameters in Entropy Computations’ and ‘Limitations’ were modified to describe the updated findings.The list of changes made to the Supporting Information:- Figures S1–S5 have been modified to indicate the correct standard error of the mean and significance levels.- Supporting Information sections ‘Embedding dimension: n’ and ‘Time-delay: tau’ were modified to reflect the updated findings.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have explored functional and effective neural networks in animal models; however, the dynamics of information propagation among functional modules under cognitive control remain largely unknown. Here, we addressed the issue using transfer entropy and graph theory methods on mesoscopic neural activities recorded in the dorsal premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys. We focused our study on the decision time of a Stop-signal task, looking for patterns in the network configuration that could influence motor plan maturation when the Stop signal is provided. When comparing trials with successful inhibition to those with generated movement, the nodes of the network resulted organized into four clusters, hierarchically arranged, and distinctly involved in information transfer. Interestingly, the hierarchies and the strength of information transmission between clusters varied throughout the task, distinguishing between generated movements and canceled ones and corresponding to measurable levels of network complexity. Our results suggest a putative mechanism for motor inhibition in premotor cortex: a topological reshuffle of the information exchanged among ensembles of neurons. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of information transfer among functionally identified neural modules during cognitive motor control. Our focus was on mesoscopic neural activities in the dorsal premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys engaged in a Stop-signal task. Leveraging multivariate transfer entropy and graph theory, we uncovered insights on how behavioral control shapes the topology of information transmission in a local brain network. Task phases modulated the strength and hierarchy of information exchange between modules, revealing the nuanced interplay between neural populations during generated and canceled movements. Notably, during successful inhibition, the network displayed a distinctive configuration, unveiling a novel mechanism for motor inhibition in the premotor cortex: a topological reshuffle of information among neuronal ensembles.},

  abstract     = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares correlation (PLS) detect linear associations between two data matrices by computing latent variables (LVs) having maximal correlation (CCA) or covariance (PLS). This study compared the similarity and generalizability of CCA- and PLS-derived brain-behavior relationships. Data were accessed from the baseline Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset ( N &gt; 9,000, 9–11 years). The brain matrix consisted of cortical thickness estimates from the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Two phenotypic scales were examined separately as the behavioral matrix; the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) subscale scores and NIH Toolbox performance scores. Resampling methods were used to assess significance and generalizability of LVs. LV 1 for the CBCL brain relationships was found to be significant, yet not consistently stable or reproducible, across CCA and PLS models (singular value: CCA = .13, PLS = .39, p &lt; .001). LV 1 for the NIH brain relationships showed similar relationships between CCA and PLS and was found to be stable and reproducible (singular value: CCA = .21, PLS = .43, p &lt; .001). The current study suggests that stability and reproducibility of brain-behavior relationships identified by CCA and PLS are influenced by the statistical characteristics of the phenotypic measure used when applied to a large population-based pediatric sample. Clinical neuroscience research is going through a translational crisis largely due to the challenges of producing meaningful and generalizable results. Two critical limitations within clinical neuroscience research are the use of univariate statistics and between-study methodological variation. Univariate statistics may not be sensitive enough to detect complex relationships between several variables, and methodological variation poses challenges to the generalizability of the results. We compared two widely used multivariate statistical approaches, canonical correlations analysis (CCA) and partial least squares correlation (PLS), to determine the generalizability and stability of their solutions. We show that the properties of the measures inputted into the analysis likely play a more substantial role in the generalizability and stability of results compared to the specific approach applied (i.e., CCA or PLS).},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying brain–heart interactions. Methodological advancements have been proposed to investigate how the brain and the heart communicate, leading to new insights into some neural functions. However, most frameworks look at the interaction of only one brain region with heartbeat dynamics, overlooking that the brain has functional networks that change dynamically in response to internal and external demands. We propose a new framework for assessing the functional interplay between cortical networks and cardiac dynamics from noninvasive electrophysiological recordings. We focused on fluctuating network metrics obtained from connectivity matrices of EEG data. Specifically, we quantified the coupling between cardiac sympathetic–vagal activity and brain network metrics of clustering, efficiency, assortativity, and modularity. We validate our proposal using open-source datasets: one that involves emotion elicitation in healthy individuals, and another with resting-state data from patients with Parkinson’s disease. Our results suggest that the connection between cortical network segregation and cardiac dynamics may offer valuable insights into the affective state of healthy participants, and alterations in the network physiology of Parkinson’s disease. By considering multiple network properties, this framework may offer a more comprehensive understanding of brain–heart interactions. Our findings hold promise in the development of biomarkers for diagnostic and cognitive/motor function evaluation.},

  abstract     = {This study delves into functional brain-heart interplay (BHI) dynamics during interictal periods before and after seizure events in focal epilepsy. Our analysis focuses on elucidating the causal interaction between cortical and autonomic nervous system (ANS) oscillations, employing electroencephalography and heart rate variability series. The dataset for this investigation comprises 47 seizure events from 14 independent subjects, obtained from the publicly available Siena Dataset. Our findings reveal an impaired brain-heart axis especially in the heart-to-brain functional direction. This is particularly evident in bottom-up oscillations originating from sympathovagal activity during the transition between preictal and postictal periods. These results indicate a pivotal role of the ANS in epilepsy dynamics. Notably, the brain-to-heart information flow targeting cardiac oscillations in the low-frequency band does not display significant changes. However, there are noteworthy changes in cortical oscillations, primarily originating in central regions, influencing heartbeat oscillations in the high-frequency band. Our study conceptualizes seizures as a state of hyperexcitability and a network disease affecting both cortical and peripheral neural dynamics. Our results pave the way for a deeper understanding of BHI in epilepsy, which holds promise for the development of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches also based on bodily neural activity for individuals living with epilepsy. This study focuses on brain-heart interplay (BHI) during pre- and postictal periods surrounding seizures. Employing multichannel EEG and heart rate variability data from subjects with focal epilepsy, our analysis reveals a disrupted brain-heart axis dynamic, particularly in the heart-to-brain direction. Notably, sympathovagal activity alterations during preictal to postictal transitions underscore the autonomic nervous system’s pivotal role in epilepsy dynamics. While brain-to-heart information flow targeting low-frequency band cardiac oscillations remains stable, significant changes occur in cortical oscillations, predominantly in central regions, influencing high-frequeny-band heartbeat oscillations, that is, vagal activity. Viewing seizures as states of hyperexcitability and confirming focal epilepsy as a network disease affecting both central and peripheral neural dynamics, our study enhances understanding of BHI in epilepsy. These findings offer potential for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches grounded in bodily neural activity for individuals with epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {Contemplative neuroscience has increasingly explored meditation using neuroimaging. However, the brain mechanisms underlying meditation remain elusive. Here, we implemented a mechanistic framework to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of expert meditators during meditation and rest, and controls during rest. We first applied a model-free approach by defining a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space for each condition, consisting of different probabilities of occurrence from a repertoire of dynamic patterns. Moreover, we implemented a model-based approach by adjusting the PMS of each condition to a whole-brain model, which enabled us to explore in silico perturbations to transition from resting-state to meditation and vice versa. Consequently, we assessed the sensitivity of different brain areas regarding their perturbability and their mechanistic local-global effects. Overall, our work reveals distinct whole-brain dynamics in meditation compared to rest, and how transitions can be induced with localized artificial perturbations. It motivates future work regarding meditation as a practice in health and as a potential therapy for brain disorders. Our work explores brain dynamics in a group of expert meditators and controls. First, we characterized meditation and rest with a repertoire of brain patterns, each with its distinct probability of occurrence. Then, we generated whole-brain models of each condition, which enabled us to artificially perturb the systems to induce transitions between rest and meditation. Our results open new avenues in meditation research as a practice in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Discrete neural states are associated with reaching movements across the fronto-parietal network. Here, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) applied to spiking activity of the somato-motor parietal area PE revealed a sequence of states similar to those of the contiguous visuomotor areas PEc and V6A. Using a coupled clustering and decoding approach, we proved that these neural states carried spatiotemporal information regarding behaviour in all three posterior parietal areas. However, comparing decoding accuracy, PE was less informative than V6A and PEc. In addition, V6A outperformed PEc in target inference, indicating functional differences among the parietal areas. To check the consistency of these differences, we used both a supervised and an unsupervised variant of the HMM, and compared its performance with two more common classifiers, Support Vector Machine and Long-Short Term Memory. The differences in decoding between areas were invariant to the algorithm used, still showing the dissimilarities found with HMM, thus indicating that these dissimilarities are intrinsic in the information encoded by parietal neurons. These results highlight that, when decoding from the parietal cortex, for example, in brain machine interface implementations, attention should be paid in selecting the most suitable source of neural signals, given the great heterogeneity of this cortical sector. Applying HMMs to spiking activity recorded from the somato-motor parietal area PE revealed discrete neural states related to reaching movements. These states were extremely similar to those present in the neighbouring visuomotor areas PEc and V6A. Our decoding approach showed that these states conveyed spatiotemporal behaviour information across all three posterior parietal areas. However, decoding accuracy was lower in PE compared to V6A and PEc, with V6A excelling in target inference. These differences held true even when changing the decoding algorithm, indicating intrinsic dissimilarities in information encoding by parietal different areas. These findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate neural signal sources in applications such as brain machine interfaces and pave the way for further investigation of the nontrivial diversity within the parietal cortex.},

  abstract     = {Whole-brain functional connectivity networks (connectomes) have been characterized at different scales in humans using EEG and fMRI. Multimodal epileptic networks have also been investigated, but the relationship between EEG and fMRI defined networks on a whole-brain scale is unclear. A unified multimodal connectome description, mapping healthy and pathological networks would close this knowledge gap. Here, we characterize the spatial correlation between the EEG and fMRI connectomes in right and left temporal lobe epilepsy (rTLE/lTLE). From two centers, we acquired resting-state concurrent EEG-fMRI of 35 healthy controls and 34 TLE patients. EEG-fMRI data was projected into the Desikan brain atlas, and functional connectomes from both modalities were correlated. EEG and fMRI connectomes were moderately correlated. This correlation was increased in rTLE when compared to controls for EEG-delta/theta/alpha/beta. Conversely, multimodal correlation in lTLE was decreased in respect to controls for EEG-beta. While the alteration was global in rTLE, in lTLE it was locally linked to the default mode network. The increased multimodal correlation in rTLE and decreased correlation in lTLE suggests a modality-specific lateralized differential reorganization in TLE, which needs to be considered when comparing results from different modalities. Each modality provides distinct information, highlighting the benefit of multimodal assessment in epilepsy. The relationship between resting-state hemodynamic (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) connectivity has been investigated in healthy subjects, but this relationship is unknown in patients with left and right temporal lobe epilepsies (l/rTLE). Does the magnitude of the relationship differ between healthy subjects and patients? What role does the laterality of the epileptic focus play? What are the spatial contributions to this relationship? Here we use concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings of 65 subjects from two centers (35 controls, 34 TLE patients), to assess the correlation between EEG and fMRI connectivity. For all datasets, frequency-specific changes in cross-modal correlation were seen in lTLE and rTLE. EEG and fMRI connectivities do not measure perfectly overlapping brain networks and provide distinct information on brain networks altered in TLE, highlighting the benefit of multimodal assessment to inform about normal and pathological brain function.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy surgery is the treatment of choice for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, but up to 50% of patients continue to have seizures one year after the resection. In order to aid presurgical planning and predict postsurgical outcome on a patient-by-patient basis, we developed a framework of individualized computational models that combines epidemic spreading with patient-specific connectivity and epileptogeneity maps: the Epidemic Spreading Seizure and Epilepsy Surgery framework (ESSES). ESSES parameters were fitted in a retrospective study ( N = 15) to reproduce invasive electroencephalography (iEEG)-recorded seizures. ESSES reproduced the iEEG-recorded seizures, and significantly better so for patients with good (seizure-free, SF) than bad (nonseizure-free, NSF) outcome. We illustrate here the clinical applicability of ESSES with a pseudo-prospective study ( N = 34) with a blind setting (to the resection strategy and surgical outcome) that emulated presurgical conditions. By setting the model parameters in the retrospective study, ESSES could be applied also to patients without iEEG data. ESSES could predict the chances of good outcome after any resection by finding patient-specific model-based optimal resection strategies, which we found to be smaller for SF than NSF patients, suggesting an intrinsic difference in the network organization or presurgical evaluation results of NSF patients. The actual surgical plan overlapped more with the model-based optimal resection, and had a larger effect in decreasing modeled seizure propagation, for SF patients than for NSF patients. Overall, ESSES could correctly predict 75% of NSF and 80.8% of SF cases pseudo-prospectively. Our results show that individualised computational models may inform surgical planning by suggesting alternative resections and providing information on the likelihood of a good outcome after a proposed resection. This is the first time that such a model is validated with a fully independent cohort and without the need for iEEG recordings. Individualized computational models of epilepsy surgery capture some of the key aspects of seizure propagation and the resective surgery. It is to be established whether this information can be integrated during the presurgical evaluation of the patient to improve surgical planning and the chances of a good surgical outcome. Here we address this question with a pseudo-prospective study that applies a computational framework of seizure propagation and epilepsy surgery—the ESSES framework—in a pseudo-prospective study mimicking the presurgical conditions. We found that within this pseudo-prospective setting, ESSES could correctly predict 75% of NSF and 80.8% of SF cases. This finding suggests the potential of individualised computational models to inform surgical planning by suggesting alternative resections and providing information on the likelihood of a good outcome after a proposed resection.},

  abstract     = {Computational studies in network neuroscience build models of communication dynamics in the connectome that help us understand the structure-function relationships of the brain. In these models, the dynamics of cortical signal transmission in brain networks are approximated with simple propagation strategies such as random walks and shortest path routing. Furthermore, the signal transmission dynamics in brain networks can be associated with the switching architectures of engineered communication systems (e.g., message switching and packet switching). However, it has been unclear how propagation strategies and switching architectures are related in models of brain network communication. Here, we investigate the effects of the difference between packet switching and message switching (i.e., whether signals are packetized or not) on the transmission completion time of propagation strategies when simulating signal propagation in mammalian brain networks. The results show that packetization in the connectome with hubs increases the time of the random walk strategy and does not change that of the shortest path strategy, but decreases that of more plausible strategies for brain networks that balance between communication speed and information requirements. This finding suggests an advantage of packet-switched communication in the connectome and provides new insights into modeling the communication dynamics in brain networks. Communication dynamics in brain networks have been modeled with various approximations to signaling in the connectome. These approximations differ in their assumptions about propagation strategies (random walks, shortest path routing) and switching architectures (message switching, packet switching); however, their relationships in brain network communication models have been unclear so far. Here, we link them by investigating how the difference between packet and message switching (whether signals are packetized or not) affects the transmission completion time of propagation strategies in communication simulations in the connectome. We find that packetization selectively reduces the time of physiologically plausible strategies for the connectome that balance communication speed and information requirements. This study sheds light on the utility of packet switching for modeling efficient communication in brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Functional brain networks have preserved architectures in rest and task; nevertheless, previous work consistently demonstrated task-related brain functional reorganization. Efficient rest-to-task functional network reconfiguration is associated with better cognition in young adults. However, aging and cognitive load effects, as well as contributions of intra- and internetwork reconfiguration, remain unclear. We assessed age-related and load-dependent effects on global and network-specific functional reconfiguration between rest and a spatial working memory (SWM) task in young and older adults, then investigated associations between functional reconfiguration and SWM across loads and age groups. Overall, global and network-level functional reconfiguration between rest and task increased with age and load. Importantly, more efficient functional reconfiguration associated with better performance across age groups. However, older adults relied more on internetwork reconfiguration of higher cognitive and task-relevant networks. These reflect the consistent importance of efficient network updating despite recruitment of additional functional networks to offset reduction in neural resources and a change in brain functional topology in older adults. Our findings generalize the association between efficient functional reconfiguration and cognition to aging and demonstrate distinct brain functional reconfiguration patterns associated with SWM in aging, highlighting the importance of combining rest and task measures to study aging cognition. Brain networks identified by functional connectivity (FC) have preserved architectures from rest to task and across task demands. Higher similarity, implying more efficient network reconfiguration, was associated with better cognition and task performance in young adults. To examine how it may be influenced by aging, we compared whole-brain and network-level FC similarities between resting-state and spatial working memory fMRI in young and older adults. At whole-brain level and higher order cognitive networks, older adults evidenced less efficient network reconfiguration from rest to task than young adults. Importantly, more efficient reconfiguration was associated with better accuracy. This relationship relied more on internetwork connections in older adults. Despite reduced neural resources compared to young, maintaining efficient network updating still contributes to better cognition at older age.},

  abstract     = {Brain dynamics can be modeled as a temporal brain network starting from the activity of different brain regions in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. When validating hypotheses about temporal networks, it is important to use an appropriate statistical null model that shares some features with the treated empirical data. The purpose of this work is to contribute to the theory of temporal null models for brain networks by introducing the random temporal hyperbolic (RTH) graph model, an extension of the random hyperbolic (RH) graph, known in the study of complex networks for its ability to reproduce crucial properties of real-world networks. We focus on temporal small-worldness which, in the static case, has been extensively studied in real-world complex networks and has been linked to the ability of brain networks to efficiently exchange information. We compare the RTH graph model with standard null models for temporal networks and show it is the null model that best reproduces the small-worldness of resting brain activity. This ability to reproduce fundamental features of real brain networks, while adding only a single parameter compared with classical models, suggests that the RTH graph model is a promising tool for validating hypotheses about temporal brain networks. We show that the random temporal hyperbolic (RTH) graph is a suitable null model for testing hypotheses about brain dynamics, after comparing it with the current state of the art and two other geometric null models. The static version of this theoretical model captures properties of various real-world networks, and its temporal version exhibits the temporal small-world property, for which we propose a new proper temporal definition. In particular, we show that the model best reproduces the temporal small-worldness measured in the empirical temporal network extracted from fMRI signals.},

  abstract     = {After publication of our paper Reconfigurations in brain networks upon awakening from slow wave sleep: Interventions and implications in neural communication, we noticed an error in our condition labels that required some revision of figures and text and some new interpretations throughout the manuscript. The error was a consequence of the double-blind nature of the original experimentation which contained two interventions: (1) a blue-enriched light intervention, as originally mentioned; and (2) an olfactory odorant condition. In review of previous analyses and presentations of the data, there was a time when non-descriptive labels (e.g., “A”, “B”) were accidentally swapped, indicating the wrong intervention label. This label was then subsequently propagated throughout the analysis and into the manuscript. This error was discovered in a re-analysis of the data and is corrected in the revised manuscript.While this error does not change the overall novel understanding of the ‘sleep inertia’ state as well as ‘interventions’ generally, there are several points in the manuscript where some interpretation of the light and odorant interventions required some additional text or some minor changes. We have edited our interpretation of the data relative to the odorant and added the correct light data for completion, finding that the olfactory stimulus (peppermint) appeared to alleviate neural consequences of sleep inertia where blue-enriched light did not, at least within a narrow band of EEG oscillations (i.e., delta). While not the primary finding of the manuscript, we now conclude the manuscript with a short discussion on potential mechanisms to this interesting finding.The following is a more detailed list of changes made to the main manuscript:The intervention initially discussed as polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light is now correctly identified as peppermint odorant. Throughout the manuscript, this identification has been corrected. A subscript “O” is used for the odorant intervention which is now used instead of “L” in Figures 2 and 3.For transparency, the details of both the interventions are now added to the paper in the Materials and Methods section; and the Results section is modified to include that no significant effect of the light intervention was observed on sleep inertia signatures. In this regard, the Results subsection previously titled “Polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light exposure at awakening attenuates neural network changes associated with sleep inertia in the delta band” is now titled “Exposure to an odorant at awakening attenuates neural network changes associated with sleep inertia in the delta band”. The Results subsection previously titled “Sleep inertia is characterized by a global reduction in clustering and region-specific rescue with light” is now titled “Sleep inertia is characterized by a global reduction in clustering and region-specific rescue with an odorant intervention”.We discovered that while the condition labeling of intervention for neural data was swapped, it remained correctly identified for the behavioral data. Therefore, we repeated the analysis comparing our neural metrics and behavioral measures. We did not observe any relationship between PVT outcomes and neural metrics with the correct labeling of conditions. We observed that the global power within the beta band was negatively correlated with the subjective measurement of sleepiness (KSS) (R = −0.7, p = .017). Please see the Supporting Information Figure S9 for these results. To incorporate these new findings, the Results subsection previously titled “Subjective sleepiness and behavioral performance are associated with changes in small-worldness” is now titled “Subjective sleepiness, behavioral performance, and neural metrics”.Within this same context as above, the Discussion subsection titled “Small-worldness is altered during sleep inertia” has been modified to remove any discussion relating small-worldness and behavioral features that was included in the previous version.The Discussion subsection previously titled “Polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched serves as an intervention to mitigate neural effects of sleep inertia” is now titled “An odorant serves as an intervention to mitigate neural effects of sleep inertia”. To explain the new findings regarding peppermint odorant intervention, new text and citations have been added to this section.As we did not observe the effect of the light intervention on sleep inertia, in the Discussion subsection titled “Methodological Considerations and Limitations”, the text discussing the potential limitations of our interpretation of the effect of light intervention is now removed.The list of changes made to the Supporting Information:Figures S2–S8 have been modified to indicate correct intervention, i.e., odorant, by changing the subscript from L to O where applicable.Figure S9 has been replaced with new behavioral findings as discussed in the main paper and described above.},

  abstract     = {Childhood maltreatment may adversely affect brain development and consequently influence behavioral, emotional, and psychological patterns during adulthood. In this study, we propose an analytical pipeline for modeling the altered topological structure of brain white matter in maltreated and typically developing children. We perform topological data analysis (TDA) to assess the alteration in the global topology of the brain white matter structural covariance network among children. We use persistent homology, an algebraic technique in TDA, to analyze topological features in the brain covariance networks constructed from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We develop a novel framework for statistical inference based on the Wasserstein distance to assess the significance of the observed topological differences. Using these methods in comparing maltreated children with a typically developing control group, we find that maltreatment may increase homogeneity in white matter structures and thus induce higher correlations in the structural covariance; this is reflected in the topological profile. Our findings strongly suggest that TDA can be a valuable framework to model altered topological structures of the brain. The MATLAB codes and processed data used in this study can be found at https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/maltreated . We employ topological data analysis (TDA) to investigate altered topological structures in the white matter of children who have experienced maltreatment. Persistent homology in TDA is utilized to quantify topological differences between typically developing children and those subjected to maltreatment, using magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data. The Wasserstein distance is computed between topological features to assess disparities in brain networks. Our findings demonstrate that persistent homology effectively characterizes the altered dynamics of white matter in children who have suffered maltreatment.},

  abstract     = {It is commonplace in neuroscience to assume that if two tasks activate the same brain areas in the same way, then they are recruiting the same underlying networks. Yet computational theory has shown that the same pattern of activity can emerge from many different underlying network representations. Here we evaluated whether similarity in activation necessarily implies similarity in network architecture by comparing region-wise activation patterns and functional correlation profiles from a large sample of healthy subjects ( N = 242). Participants performed two executive control tasks known to recruit nearly identical brain areas, the color-word Stroop task and the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). Using a measure of instantaneous functional correlations, based on edge time series, we estimated the task-related networks that differed between incongruent and congruent conditions. We found that the two tasks were much more different in their network profiles than in their evoked activity patterns at different analytical levels, as well as for a wide range of methodological pipelines. Our results reject the notion that having the same activation patterns means two tasks engage the same underlying representations, suggesting that task representations should be independently evaluated at both node and edge (connectivity) levels. As a dynamical system, the brain can encode information at the module (e.g., brain regions) or the network level (e.g., connections between brain regions). This means that two tasks can produce the same pattern of activation, but differ in their network profile. Here we tested this using two tasks with largely similar cognitive requirements. Despite producing nearly identical macroscopic activation patterns, the two tasks produced different functional network profiles. These findings confirm prior theoretical work that similarity in task activation does not imply the same similarity in underlying network states.},

  abstract     = {Imaging genetics studies with large samples have identified many genes associated with brain functions and structures, but little is known about genes associated with brain functional and structural network properties. The current genome-wide association study examined graph theory measures of brain structural and functional networks with 497 healthy Chinese participants (17–28 years). Four genes ( TGFB3 , LGI1 , TSPAN18 , and FAM155A ) were identified to be significantly associated with functional network global efficiency, and two ( NLRP6 and ICE2 ) with structural network global efficiency. Meta-analysis of structural and functional brain network property confirmed the four functional-related genes and revealed two more ( RBFOX1 and WWOX ). They were reported to be significantly associated with regional brain structural or functional measurements in the UK Biobank project; and showed differential gene expression level between low and high structure–function coupling regions according to Allen Human Brain Atlas gene expression data. Taken together, our results suggest that brain structural and functional networks had shared and unique genetic bases, consistent with the notion of many-to-many structure–function coupling of the brain. Genome-wide association studies on brain were often conducted with regional measurements of the brain (e.g., regional volume, thickness) rather than whole-brain properties. Here we associated whole genome to whole-brain structural and functional network properties (global efficiency, local efficiency, small-worldness), and identified four genes ( TGFB3 , LGI1 , TSPAN18 , and FAM155A ) associated with functional brain network and two genes ( NLRP6 and ICE2 ) with structural network. Two more genes ( RBFOX1 and WWOX ) were identified by meta-analysis.

  abstract     = {Recently, in the past decade, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), very high-frequency oscillations (VHFOs), and ultra-fast oscillations (UFOs) were reported in epileptic patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, to this day, the physiological origin of these events has yet to be understood. Our study establishes a mathematical framework based on bifurcation theory for investigating the occurrence of VHFOs and UFOs in depth EEG signals of patients with focal epilepsy, focusing on the potential role of reduced connection strength between neurons in an epileptic focus. We demonstrate that synchronization of a weakly coupled network can generate very and ultra high-frequency signals detectable by nearby microelectrodes. In particular, we show that a bistability region enables the persistence of phase-shift synchronized clusters of neurons. This phenomenon is observed for different hippocampal neuron models, including Morris–Lecar, Destexhe–Paré, and an interneuron model. The mechanism seems to be robust for small coupling, and it also persists with random noise affecting the external current. Our findings suggest that weakened neuronal connections could contribute to the production of oscillations with frequencies above 1000 Hz, which could advance our understanding of epilepsy pathology and potentially improve treatment strategies. However, further exploration of various coupling types and complex network models is needed. We have built a mathematical framework to examine how a reduced neuronal coupling within an epileptic focus could lead to very high-frequency (VHFOs) and ultra-fast oscillations (UFOs) in depth EEG signals. By analyzing weakly coupled neurons, we found a bistability synchronization region where in-phase and anti-phase synchrony persist. These dynamics can be detected as very high-frequency EEG signals. The principle of weak coupling aligns with the disturbances in neuronal connections often observed in epilepsy; moreover, VHFOs are important markers of epileptogenicity. Our findings point to the potential significance of weakened neuronal connections in producing VHFOs and UFOs related to focal epilepsy. This could enhance our understanding of brain disorders. We emphasize the need for further investigations of weakly coupled neurons.},

  abstract     = {High-altitude hypoxia triggers brain function changes reminiscent of those in healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease, compromising cognition and executive functions. Our study sought to validate high-altitude hypoxia as a model for assessing brain activity disruptions akin to aging. We collected EEG data from 16 healthy volunteers during acute high-altitude hypoxia (at 4,000 masl) and at sea level, focusing on relative changes in power and aperiodic slope of the EEG spectrum due to hypoxia. Additionally, we examined functional connectivity using wPLI, and functional segregation and integration using graph theory tools. High altitude led to slower brain oscillations, that is, increased δ and reduced α power, and flattened the 1/f aperiodic slope, indicating higher electrophysiological noise, akin to healthy aging. Notably, functional integration strengthened in the θ band, exhibiting unique topographical patterns at the subnetwork level, including increased frontocentral and reduced occipitoparietal integration. Moreover, we discovered significant correlations between subjects’ age, 1/f slope, θ band integration, and observed robust effects of hypoxia after adjusting for age. Our findings shed light on how reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes influence brain activity patterns resembling those in neurodegenerative disorders and aging, making high-altitude hypoxia a promising model for comprehending the brain in health and disease. Exposure to high-altitude hypoxia, with reduced oxygen levels, can replicate brain function changes akin to aging and Alzheimer’s disease. In our work, we propose high-altitude hypoxia as a possible reversible model of human brain aging. We gathered EEG data at high altitude and sea level, investigating the impact of hypoxia on brainwave patterns and connectivity. Our findings revealed that high-altitude exposure led to slower and noisier brain oscillations and produced altered brain connectivity, resembling some remarkable changes seen in the aging process. Intriguingly, these changes were linked to age, even when hypoxia’s effects were considered. Our research unveils how high-altitude conditions emulate brain patterns associated with aging and neurodegenerative conditions, providing valuable insights into the understanding of both normal and impaired brain function.},

  abstract     = {The zona incerta (ZI) is a subthalamic structure that has been implicated in locomotion, fear, and anxiety. Recently interest has grown in its therapeutic efficacy in deep brain stimulation in movement disorders. This efficacy might be due to the ZI’s functional projections to the other brain regions. Notwithstanding some evidence of anatomical connections between the ZI and the inferior olive (IO) and the pontine nuclei (PN), how the ZI modulates the neuronal activity in these regions remains to be determined. We first tested this by monitoring responses of single neurons in the PN and IO to optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing ZI axons in wild-type mice, using an in vivo awake preparation. Stimulation of short, single pulses and trains of stimuli at 20 Hz elicited rapid responses in the majority of recorded cells in the PN and IO. Furthermore, the excitatory response of PN neurons scaled with the strength of ZI activation. Next, we used in vitro electrophysiology to study synaptic transmission at ZI-IO synapses. Optogenetic activation of ZI axons evoked a strong excitatory postsynaptic response in IO neurons, which remained robust with repeated stimulation at 20 Hz. Overall, our results demonstrate a functional connection within ZI-PN and ZI-IO pathways. We have demonstrated that zona incerta (ZI) neurons are capable of communicating effectively with the neurons in the two major types of precerebellar nuclei: the pontine nucleus and the inferior olive. The two circuits revealed by our research might play a critical role in tremor-related movement disorders by engaging the cerebellar network. Furthermore, these circuits could explain why deep brain stimulation of the ZI is effective for patients with tremor-related motor disorders.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach for the reconstruction of functional networks representing brain dynamics based on the idea that the coparticipation of two brain regions in a common cognitive task should result in a drop in their identifiability, or in the uniqueness of their dynamics. This identifiability is estimated through the score obtained by deep learning models in supervised classification tasks and therefore requires no a priori assumptions about the nature of such coparticipation. The method is tested on EEG recordings obtained from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease patients, and matched healthy volunteers, for eyes-open and eyes-closed resting–state conditions, and the resulting functional networks are analysed through standard topological metrics. Both groups of patients are characterised by a reduction in the identifiability of the corresponding EEG signals, and by differences in the patterns that support such identifiability. Resulting functional networks are similar, but not identical to those reconstructed by using a correlation metric. Differences between control subjects and patients can be observed in network metrics like the clustering coefficient and the assortativity in different frequency bands. Differences are also observed between eyes open and closed conditions, especially for Parkinson’s disease patients. Functional networks are becoming a standard tool in neuroscience, thanks to their ability to extract the interactions between brain regions and representing them as simple mathematical objects. Many metrics for reconstructing these networks have so far been proposed, based on different assumptions about how those interactions manifest in the recorded data, and consequently depicting a limited part of the picture. We here introduce a more general approach, based on the idea that brain regions should have a unique dynamic, which becomes more similar when they coparticipate in a cognitive task, and on the quantification of such uniqueness through deep learning models.},

  abstract     = {Neural variability is thought to facilitate survival through flexible adaptation to changing environmental demands. In humans, such capacity for flexible adaptation may manifest as fluid reasoning, inhibition of automatic responses, and mental set-switching—skills falling under the broad domain of executive functions that fluctuate over the life span. Neural variability can be quantified via the BOLD signal in resting-state fMRI. Variability of large-scale brain networks is posited to underpin complex cognitive activities requiring interactions between multiple brain regions. Few studies have examined the extent to which network-level brain signal variability across the life span maps onto high-level processes under the umbrella of executive functions. The present study leveraged a large publicly available neuroimaging dataset to investigate the relationship between signal variability and executive functions across the life span. Associations between brain signal variability and executive functions shifted as a function of age. Limbic-specific variability was consistently associated with greater performance across subcomponents of executive functions. Associations between executive function subcomponents and network-level variability of the default mode and central executive networks, as well as whole-brain variability, varied across the life span. Findings suggest that brain signal variability may help to explain to age-related differences in executive functions across the life span. Traditionally, regional variability in brain signals has been viewed as a source of noise in human neuroimaging research. Our study demonstrates that brain signal variability may contain meaningful information related to psychological processes. We demonstrate that brain signal variability, particularly whole-brain variability, may serve as a reliable indicator of cognitive functions across the life span. Global variability and network-level variability play differing roles in supporting executive functions. Findings suggest that brain signal variability serves as a meaningful indicator of development and cognitive aging.},

  abstract     = {The emerging neuroscientific frontier of brain fingerprinting has recently established that human functional connectomes (FCs) exhibit fingerprint-like idiosyncratic features, which map onto heterogeneously distributed behavioral traits. Here, we harness brain-fingerprinting tools to extract FC features that predict subjective drug experience induced by the psychedelic psilocybin. Specifically, in neuroimaging data of healthy volunteers under the acute influence of psilocybin or a placebo, we show that, post psilocybin administration, FCs become more idiosyncratic owing to greater intersubject dissimilarity. Moreover, whereas in placebo subjects idiosyncratic features are primarily found in the frontoparietal network, in psilocybin subjects they concentrate in the default mode network (DMN). Crucially, isolating the latter revealed an FC pattern that predicts subjective psilocybin experience and is characterized by reduced within-DMN and DMN-limbic connectivity, as well as increased connectivity between the DMN and attentional systems. Overall, these results contribute to bridging the gap between psilocybin-mediated effects on brain and behavior, while demonstrating the value of a brain-fingerprinting approach to pharmacological neuroimaging. The trending field of brain fingerprinting focuses on characterizing fingerprint-like idiosyncratic features of human functional connectomes (FCs), which have been shown to predict heterogeneously distributed behavioral traits. Here, we apply brain-fingerprinting methods to fMRI data from subjects who were administered the psychedelic psilocybin or a placebo. We find that, compared with the placebo condition, subjects under acute psilocybin effects exhibited more idiosyncratic FCs, with idiosyncratic features being largely concentrated in the default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, we isolated an idiosyncratic FC pattern that predicted reports of subjective psilocybin experiences. This pattern was characterized by altered DMN connectivity, specifically by reduced within-DMN and DMN-limbic connectivity, and increased connectivity between the DMN and attentional systems.

  abstract     = {We present a didactic introduction to spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a Bayesian state-space modeling approach used to infer effective connectivity from noninvasive neuroimaging data. Spectral DCM is currently the most widely applied DCM variant for resting-state functional MRI analysis. Our aim is to explain its technical foundations to an audience with limited expertise in state-space modeling and spectral data analysis. Particular attention will be paid to cross-spectral density, which is the most distinctive feature of spectral DCM and is closely related to functional connectivity, as measured by (zero-lag) Pearson correlations. In fact, the model parameters estimated by spectral DCM are those that best reproduce the cross-correlations between all measurements—at all time lags—including the zero-lag correlations that are usually interpreted as functional connectivity. We derive the functional connectivity matrix from the model equations and show how changing a single effective connectivity parameter can affect all pairwise correlations. To complicate matters, the pairs of brain regions showing the largest changes in functional connectivity do not necessarily coincide with those presenting the largest changes in effective connectivity. We discuss the implications and conclude with a comprehensive summary of the assumptions and limitations of spectral DCM.},

  abstract     = {It has been previously shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with reductions in metastability in large-scale networks in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI). However, little is known about how TBI affects the local level of synchronization and how this evolves during the recovery trajectory. Here, we applied a novel turbulent dynamics framework to investigate whole-brain dynamics using an rsfMRI dataset from a cohort of moderate to severe TBI patients and healthy controls (HCs). We first examined how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between HCs and TBI patients at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. We found a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI, with the largest change at 6 months post-injury. Next, we built a Hopf whole-brain model with coupled oscillators and conducted in silico perturbations to investigate the mechanistic principles underlying the reduced turbulent dynamics found in the empirical data. A simulated attack was used to account for the effect of focal lesions. This revealed a shift to lower coupling parameters in the TBI dataset and, critically, decreased susceptibility and information-encoding capability. These findings confirm the potential of the turbulent framework to characterize longitudinal changes in whole-brain dynamics and in the reactivity to external perturbations after TBI. Significant advances in nonlinear dynamics and computational modeling have opened up the possibility of studying how whole-brain dynamics may be impacted by traumatic brain injury (TBI). One hypothesis is that whole-brain dynamics may show differential spatiotemporal patterns during the recovery trajectory. We used a novel turbulence framework to examine how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between healthy controls and TBI patients at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. This framework revealed a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI differentially affecting long distances, with the largest change at 6 months post-injury. The alterations observed at network level, however, showed a certain degree of recovery after 1 year. In addition, the Hopf whole-brain model demonstrated decreased susceptibility and information-encoding capability after TBI. The clinical implications of this work are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Despite a five order of magnitude range in size, the brains of mammals share many anatomical and functional characteristics that translate into cortical network commonalities. Here we develop a machine learning framework to quantify the degree of predictability of the weighted interareal cortical matrix. Partial network connectivity data were obtained with retrograde tract-tracing experiments generated with a consistent methodology, supplemented by projection length measurements in a nonhuman primate (macaque) and a rodent (mouse). We show that there is a significant level of predictability embedded in the interareal cortical networks of both species. At the binary level, links are predictable with an area under the ROC curve of at least 0.8 for the macaque. Weighted medium and strong links are predictable with an 85%–90% accuracy (mouse) and 70%–80% (macaque), whereas weak links are not predictable in either species. These observations reinforce earlier observations that the formation and evolution of the cortical network at the mesoscale is, to a large extent, rule based. Using the methodology presented here, we performed imputations on all area pairs, generating samples for the complete interareal network in both species. These are necessary for comparative studies of the connectome with minimal bias, both within and across species. Revealed by tract-tracing datasets, communication between the functional areas of the cortex operates via a complex, dense, and weighted network of physical connections with little apparent regularity. Although there are studies showing the existence of nonrandom topological features, their extent has not been clear. Employing a machine learning–based approach, which efficiently extracts structural models from such datasets, here we show that there is a significant amount of regularity embedded in the mammalian connectome. This regularity allows predicting interareal connections and their weights with good accuracy and can be used to infer properties of experimentally untested connections. The structural models are well learned even with small training sets, without overfitting, suggesting the existence of a low-dimensional, universal mechanism for mesoscale cortical network formation and evolution.},

  abstract     = {Brain function does not emerge from isolated activity, but rather from the interactions and exchanges between neural elements that form a network known as the connectome. The human connectome consists of structural and functional aspects. The structural connectome (SC) represents the anatomical connections, and the functional connectome represents the resulting dynamics that emerge from this arrangement of structures. As there are different ways of weighting these connections, it is important to consider how such different approaches impact study conclusions. Here, we propose that different weighted connectomes result in varied network properties, and while neither superior the other, selection might affect interpretation and conclusions in different study cases. We present three different weighting models, namely, number of streamlines (NOS), fractional anisotropy (FA), and axon diameter distribution (ADD), to demonstrate these differences. The later, is extracted using recently published AxSI method and is first compared to commonly used weighting methods. Moreover, we explore the functional relevance of each weighted SC, using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. By analyzing intelligence-related data, we develop a predictive model for cognitive performance based on graph properties and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) toolbox. Results demonstrate that the ADD SC, combined with a functional subnetwork model, outperforms other models in estimating cognitive performance. This study compares different approaches of weighting connections in the human brain structural connectome. The three chosen methods for weighting are based on diffusion MRI data and include the number of streamlines, FA index, and axon diameter distribution, which is measured using the recently published AxSI method. We examine local and global properties of the different resulted weighted graphs and discuss how they varied from each other. Lastly, we use each of the weighting connectomes to predict cognitive performance by using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set.},

  abstract     = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a popular method used to investigate brain function. Stimulation over the motor cortex evokes muscle contractions known as motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and also high-frequency volleys of electrical activity measured in the cervical spinal cord. The physiological mechanisms of these experimentally derived responses remain unclear, but it is thought that the connections between circuits of excitatory and inhibitory neurons play a vital role. Using a spiking neural network model of the motor cortex, we explained the generation of waves of activity, so called ‘I-waves’, following cortical stimulation. The model reproduces a number of experimentally known responses including direction of TMS, increased inhibition, and changes in strength. Using populations of thousands of neurons in a model of cortical circuitry we showed that the cortex generated transient oscillatory responses without any tuning, and that neuron parameters such as refractory period and delays influenced the pattern and timing of those oscillations. By comparing our network with simpler, previously proposed circuits, we explored the contributions of specific connections and found that recurrent inhibitory connections are vital in producing later waves that significantly impact the production of motor evoked potentials in downstream muscles ( Thickbroom, 2011 ). This model builds on previous work to increase our understanding of how complex circuitry of the cortex is involved in the generation of I-waves. This work uses a computational spiking neural network model of physiologically based cortical circuitry to explain the oscillatory responses, known as I-waves, which occur following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. The model contains over 38,000 excitatory and inhibitory neurons with 160 million synapses to replicate observed experimental responses to TMS and investigate the structure of population-based circuitry involved in generating coordinated dynamic activity.},

  abstract     = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF), a training method for the self-regulation of brain activity, has shown promising results as a neurorehabilitation tool, depending on the ability of the patient to succeed in neuromodulation. This study explores connectivity-based structural and functional success predictors in an NF n -back working memory paradigm targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We established as the NF success metric the linear trend on the ability to modulate the target region during NF runs and performed a linear regression model considering structural and functional connectivity (intrinsic and seed-based) metrics. We found a positive correlation between NF success and the default mode network (DMN) intrinsic functional connectivity and a negative correlation with the DLPFC-precuneus connectivity during the 2-back condition, indicating that success is associated with larger uncoupling between DMN and the executive network. Regarding structural connectivity, the salience network emerges as the main contributor to success. Both functional and structural classification models showed good performance with 77% and 86% accuracy, respectively. Dynamic switching between DMN, salience network and central executive network seems to be the key for neurofeedback success, independently indicated by functional connectivity on the localizer run and structural connectivity data. Neurofeedback using real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI NF) is a potential neurorehabilitation tool for several neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, not all subjects are capable to learn how to self-regulate their brain, that is, to be successful in rt-fMRI NF. Our goal, in this study, is to find connectivity metrics that predict this success in a working memory paradigm targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), so that we can avoid futile implementation of the technique in the future by previously selecting responders. We found that success is probably dependent on the dynamic switching between DMN, salience network, and central executive network, influenced by both functional and structural connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the coupling between the structure and the function of the brain and its development across maturation has attracted a lot of interest in the field of network neuroscience in the last 15 years. Mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that the onset of certain brain disorders is linked with the interplay between the structural architecture of the brain and its functional processes, often accompanied with unusual connectivity features. This paper introduces a method called the network-based statistic–simultaneous node investigation (NBS-SNI) that integrates both representations into a single framework, and identifies connectivity abnormalities in case-control studies. With this method, significance is given to the properties of the nodes, as well as to their connections. This approach builds on the well-established network-based statistic (NBS) proposed in 2010. We uncover and identify the regimes in which NBS-SNI offers a gain in statistical resolution to identify a contrast of interest using synthetic data. We also apply our method on two real case-control studies, one consisting of individuals diagnosed with autism and the other consisting of individuals diagnosed with early psychosis. Using NBS-SNI and node properties such as the closeness centrality and local information dimension, we found hypo- and hyperconnected subnetworks and show that our method can offer a 9 percentage points gain in prediction power over the standard NBS. We propose an extension to the well-known network-based statistic (NBS) dubbed NBS-SNI, where the extension SNI stands for simultaneous node investigation. The goal of this approach is to integrate nodal properties such as centrality measures into the statistical network-based framework of NBS to probe for abnormal connectivity between important nodes in case-control studies. We expose the regimes where NBS-SNI offers greater statistical resolution for identifying a contrast of interest using synthetic data and test the approach with a real autism-healthy dataset that contains both the structural ( DTI ) and functional (fMRI) brain networks of each individual. We also tested our approach on a second dataset of individuals diagnosed with early psychosis. In the second case, our framework is supplemented by incorporating the anatomically derived measures of intrinsic curvature index and gray matter volume directly as a node property, rather than the structural networks, thereby illustrating the versatility of our approach.},

  abstract     = {A pervasive challenge in neuroscience is testing whether neuronal connectivity changes over time due to specific causes, such as stimuli, events, or clinical interventions. Recent hardware innovations and falling data storage costs enable longer, more naturalistic neuronal recordings. The implicit opportunity for understanding the self-organised brain calls for new analysis methods that link temporal scales: from the order of milliseconds over which neuronal dynamics evolve, to the order of minutes, days, or even years over which experimental observations unfold. This review article demonstrates how hierarchical generative models and Bayesian inference help to characterise neuronal activity across different time scales. Crucially, these methods go beyond describing statistical associations among observations and enable inference about underlying mechanisms. We offer an overview of fundamental concepts in state-space modeling and suggest a taxonomy for these methods. Additionally, we introduce key mathematical principles that underscore a separation of temporal scales, such as the slaving principle, and review Bayesian methods that are being used to test hypotheses about the brain with multiscale data. We hope that this review will serve as a useful primer for experimental and computational neuroscientists on the state of the art and current directions of travel in the complex systems modelling literature. Exploring changes in brain connectivity over time is a major challenge in neuroscience. This review article discusses the application of hierarchical generative models and Bayesian statistical methods to investigate modulators of neuronal dynamics across different temporal scales. By utilizing these innovative techniques, researchers can move beyond describing statistical associations and ask questions about underlying mechanisms. The article provides an overview of state-space modelling, dynamics, and a taxonomy of methods. It also introduces mathematical principles that link temporal scales and reviews the use of Bayesian statistical methods in testing hypotheses about the brain using multiscale data. This review aims to serve as a resource for experimental and computational neuroscientists by presenting the current state of the art and future directions of travel in modelling literature.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the concept of network hubs and their role in brain disease is now rapidly becoming important for clinical neurology. Hub nodes in brain networks are areas highly connected to the rest of the brain, which handle a large part of all the network traffic. They also show high levels of neural activity and metabolism, which makes them vulnerable to many different types of pathology. The present review examines recent evidence for the prevalence and nature of hub involvement in a variety of neurological disorders, emphasizing common themes across different types of pathology. In focal epilepsy, pathological hubs may play a role in spreading of seizure activity, and removal of such hub nodes is associated with improved outcome. In stroke, damage to hubs is associated with impaired cognitive recovery. Breakdown of optimal brain network organization in multiple sclerosis is accompanied by cognitive dysfunction. In Alzheimer’s disease, hyperactive hub nodes are directly associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathology. Early and reliable detection of hub pathology and disturbed connectivity in Alzheimer’s disease with imaging and neurophysiological techniques opens up opportunities to detect patients with a network hyperexcitability profile, who could benefit from treatment with anti-epileptic drugs.},
