  abstract     = {Given a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ and an integer $r$ , we say that a graph is $r$ -Ramsey for $\mathcal{F}$ if any $r$ -colouring of its edges admits a monochromatic copy of a graph from $\mathcal{F}$ . The threshold for the classic Ramsey property, where $\mathcal{F}$ consists of one graph, in the binomial random graph was located in the celebrated work of Rödl and Ruciński. In this paper, we offer a twofold generalisation to the Rödl–Ruciński theorem. First, we show that the list-colouring version of the property has the same threshold. Second, we extend this result to finite families $\mathcal{F}$ , where the threshold statements might also diverge. This also confirms further special cases of the Kohayakawa–Kreuter conjecture. Along the way, we supply a short(-ish), self-contained proof of the $0$ -statement of the Rödl–Ruciński theorem.},

As an immediate corollary of our formula, we show that the tensor rank of the $n \times n$ determinant tensor is no larger than the $n$ -th Bell number, which is much smaller than the previously best-known upper bounds when $n \geq 4$ . Over fields of non-zero characteristic we obtain even tighter upper bounds, and we also slightly improve the known lower bounds. In particular, we show that the $4 \times 4$ determinant over ${\mathbb{F}}_2$ has tensor rank exactly equal to $12$ . Our results also improve upon the best-known upper bound for the Waring rank of the determinant when $n \geq 17$ , and lead to a new family of axis-aligned polytopes that tile ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ .},

  abstract     = {A linear equation $E$ is said to be sparse if there is $c\gt 0$ so that every subset of $[n]$ of size $n^{1-c}$ contains a solution of $E$ in distinct integers. The problem of characterising the sparse equations, first raised by Ruzsa in the 90s, is one of the most important open problems in additive combinatorics. We say that $E$ in $k$ variables is abundant if every subset of $[n]$ of size $\varepsilon n$ contains at least $\text{poly}(\varepsilon )\cdot n^{k-1}$ solutions of $E$ . It is clear that every abundant $E$ is sparse, and Girão, Hurley, Illingworth, and Michel asked if the converse implication also holds. In this note, we show that this is the case for every $E$ in four variables. We further discuss a generalisation of this problem which applies to all linear equations.},

It is known that when the graph distance is rescaled by $n^{1/3}$ and vertices are given a uniform measure, the MST converges in distribution in the Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov (GHP) topology. We prove that if the weight of each edge is resampled independently with probability $\varepsilon \gg n^{-1/3}$ , then the pair of rescaled minimum spanning trees – before and after the noise – converges in distribution to independent random spaces. Conversely, if $\varepsilon \ll n^{-1/3}$ , the GHP distance between the rescaled trees goes to $0$ in probability. This implies the noise sensitivity and stability for every property of the MST that corresponds to a continuity set of the random limit. The noise threshold of $n^{-1/3}$ coincides with the critical window of the Erdős-Rényi random graphs. In fact, these results follow from an analog theorem we prove regarding the minimum spanning forest of critical random graphs.},

  abstract     = {The bipartite independence number of a graph $G$ , denoted as $\tilde \alpha (G)$ , is the minimal number $k$ such that there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b=k+1$ with the property that for any two disjoint sets $A,B\subseteq V(G)$ with $|A|=a$ and $|B|=b$ , there is an edge between $A$ and $B$ . McDiarmid and Yolov showed that if $\delta (G)\geq \tilde \alpha (G)$ then $G$ is Hamiltonian, extending the famous theorem of Dirac which states that if $\delta (G)\geq |G|/2$ then $G$ is Hamiltonian. In 1973, Bondy showed that, unless $G$ is a complete bipartite graph, Dirac’s Hamiltonicity condition also implies pancyclicity, i.e., existence of cycles of all the lengths from $3$ up to $n$ . In this paper, we show that $\delta (G)\geq \tilde \alpha (G)$ implies that $G$ is pancyclic or that $G=K_{\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}}$ , thus extending the result of McDiarmid and Yolov, and generalizing the classic theorem of Bondy.},

  abstract     = {The protection number of a vertex $v$ in a tree is the length of the shortest path from $v$ to any leaf contained in the maximal subtree where $v$ is the root. In this paper, we determine the distribution of the maximum protection number of a vertex in simply generated trees, thereby refining a recent result of Devroye, Goh, and Zhao. Two different cases can be observed: if the given family of trees allows vertices of outdegree $1$ , then the maximum protection number is on average logarithmic in the tree size, with a discrete double-exponential limiting distribution. If no such vertices are allowed, the maximum protection number is doubly logarithmic in the tree size and concentrated on at most two values. These results are obtained by studying the singular behaviour of the generating functions of trees with bounded protection number. While a general distributional result by Prodinger and Wagner can be used in the first case, we prove a variant of that result in the second case.},

  abstract     = {We give algorithms for approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic $q$ -color Potts model on graphs of maximum degree $d$ . Our primary contribution is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for $d$ -regular graphs with an expansion condition at low temperatures (that is, bounded away from the order-disorder threshold). The expansion condition is much weaker than in previous works; for example, the expansion exhibited by the hypercube suffices. The main improvements come from a significantly sharper analysis of standard polymer models; we use extremal graph theory and applications of Karger’s algorithm to count cuts that may be of independent interest. It is #BIS-hard to approximate the partition function at low temperatures on bounded-degree graphs, so our algorithm can be seen as evidence that hard instances of #BIS are rare. We also obtain efficient algorithms in the Gibbs uniqueness region for bounded-degree graphs. While our high-temperature proof follows more standard polymer model analysis, our result holds in the largest-known range of parameters $d$ and $q$ .},

We prove a result which says that if one replaces $K_n^k$ in Gyárfás’ theorem by any ‘expansive’ $k$ -uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices (that is, a $k$ -uniform hypergraph $G$ on $n$ vertices in which $e(V_1, \ldots, V_k)\gt 0$ for all disjoint sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k\subseteq V(G)$ with $|V_i|\gt \alpha$ for all $i\in [k]$ ), then one gets a largest monochromatic component of essentially the same size (within a small error term depending on $r$ and $\alpha$ ). As corollaries we recover a number of known results about large monochromatic components in random hypergraphs and random Steiner triple systems, often with drastically improved bounds on the error terms. Gyárfás’ result is equivalent to the dual problem of determining the smallest possible maximum degree of an arbitrary $r$ -partite $r$ -uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$ edges in which every set of $k$ edges has a common intersection. In this language, our result says that if one replaces the condition that every set of $k$ edges has a common intersection with the condition that for every collection of $k$ disjoint sets $E_1, \ldots, E_k\subseteq E(H)$ with $|E_i|\gt \alpha$ , there exists $(e_1, \ldots, e_k)\in E_1\times \cdots \times E_k$ such that $e_1\cap \cdots \cap e_k\neq \emptyset$ , then the smallest possible maximum degree of $H$ is essentially the same (within a small error term depending on $r$ and $\alpha$ ).

A book $B_n$ is a graph consisting of $n$ triangles all sharing a common edge. Recently, Conlon, Fox, and Wigderson conjectured that for any $0\lt \alpha \lt 1$ , the random lower bound $r(B_{\lceil \alpha n\rceil },B_n)\ge (\sqrt{\alpha }+1)^2n+o(n)$ is not tight. In other words, there exists some constant $\beta \gt (\sqrt{\alpha }+1)^2$ such that $r(B_{\lceil \alpha n\rceil },B_n)\ge \beta n$ for all sufficiently large $n$ . This conjecture holds for every $\alpha \lt 1/6$ by a result of Nikiforov and Rousseau from 2005, which says that in this range $r(B_{\lceil \alpha n\rceil },B_n)=2n+3$ for all sufficiently large $n$ . We disprove the conjecture of Conlon, Fox, and Wigderson. Indeed, we show that the random lower bound is asymptotically tight for every $1/4\leq \alpha \leq 1$ . Moreover, we show that for any $1/6\leq \alpha \le 1/4$ and large $n$ , $r(B_{\lceil \alpha n\rceil }, B_n)\le \left (\frac 32+3\alpha \right ) n+o(n)$ , where the inequality is asymptotically tight when $\alpha =1/6$ or $1/4$ . We also give a lower bound of $r(B_{\lceil \alpha n\rceil }, B_n)$ for $1/6\le \alpha \lt \frac{52-16\sqrt{3}}{121}\approx 0.2007$ , showing that the random lower bound is not tight, i.e., the conjecture of Conlon, Fox, and Wigderson holds in this interval.},

Building up on the same ideas, we resolve a conjecture of Bollobás, Leader and Tiba that for subsets $A,B$ of $\mathbb{F}_p$ of size at most $\alpha p$ for an appropriate constant $\alpha \gt 0$ , one only needs three elements $b_1,b_2,b_3\in B$ to guarantee $|A+\{b_1,b_2,b_3\}|\ge |A|+|B|-1$ .

Determining $\textrm{ex}(Q_n, H)$ and even identifying whether $H$ has a positive or zero Turán density remains a widely open question for general $H$ . By relating extremal numbers in a hypercube and certain corresponding hypergraphs, Conlon found a large class of graphs, ones having so-called partite representation, that have zero Turán density. He asked whether this gives a characterisation, that is, whether a graph has zero Turán density if and only if it has partite representation. Here, we show that, as suspected by Conlon, this is not the case. We give an example of a class of graphs which have no partite representation, but on the other hand, have zero Turán density. In addition, we show that any graph whose every block has partite representation has zero Turán density in a hypercube.},

We call the $G^{(i)}$ the base graphs and the product graph $G$ the host graph. Very recently, Lichev ( J. Graph Theory , 99(4):651–670, 2022) showed that, under a mild requirement on the isoperimetric properties of the base graphs, the component structure of the percolated graph $G_p$ undergoes a phase transition when $p$ is around $\frac{1}{d}$ , where $d$ is the average degree of the host graph. In the supercritical regime, we strengthen Lichev’s result by showing that the giant component is in fact unique, with all other components of order $o(|G|)$ , and determining the sharp asymptotic order of the giant. Furthermore, we answer two questions posed by Lichev ( J. Graph Theory , 99(4):651–670, 2022): firstly, we provide a construction showing that the requirement of bounded degree is necessary for the likely emergence of a linear order component; secondly, we show that the isoperimetric requirement on the base graphs can be, in fact, super-exponentially small in the dimension. Finally, in the subcritical regime, we give an example showing that in the case of irregular high-dimensional product graphs, there can be a polynomially large component with high probability, very much unlike the quantitative behaviour seen in the Erdős-Rényi random graph and in the percolated hypercube, and in fact in any regular high-dimensional product graphs, as shown by the authors in a companion paper (Percolation on high-dimensional product graphs. arXiv:2209.03722 , 2022).},

In general, we prove that a monotone class has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if it excludes some fixed topological minor. We also study the underlying treewidth of graph classes defined by an excluded subgraph or excluded induced subgraph. We show that the class of graphs with no $H$ subgraph has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if every component of $H$ is a subdivided star, and that the class of graphs with no induced $H$ subgraph has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if every component of $H$ is a star.},

Despite this difference, for $p\lt d$ , we are able to prove that the total edge costs normalized by the rate $n^{1-p/d}$ converge to a limiting constant that can be represented as a series of integrals, thus extending a classical result of Avram and Bertsimas to the bipartite case and confirming a conjecture of Riva, Caracciolo and Malatesta.},

  abstract     = {Given a fixed graph $H$ and a constant $c \in [0,1]$ , we can ask what graphs $G$ with edge density $c$ asymptotically maximise the homomorphism density of $H$ in $G$ . For all $H$ for which this problem has been solved, the maximum is always asymptotically attained on one of two kinds of graphs: the quasi-star or the quasi-clique. We show that for any $H$ the maximising $G$ is asymptotically a threshold graph, while the quasi-clique and the quasi-star are the simplest threshold graphs, having only two parts. This result gives us a unified framework to derive a number of results on graph homomorphism maximisation, some of which were also found quite recently and independently using several different approaches. We show that there exist graphs $H$ and densities $c$ such that the optimising graph $G$ is neither the quasi-star nor the quasi-clique (Day and Sarkar, SIAM J. Discrete Math. 35(1), 294–306, 2021). We also show that for $c$ large enough all graphs $H$ maximise on the quasi-clique (Gerbner et al., J. Graph Theory 96(1), 34–43, 2021), and for any $c \in [0,1]$ the density of $K_{1,2}$ is always maximised on either the quasi-star or the quasi-clique (Ahlswede and Katona, Acta Math. Hung. 32(1–2), 97–120, 1978). Finally, we extend our results to uniform hypergraphs.},

We consider a variant of the Erdős-Hajnal problem for hypergraphs where we forbid a family of hypergraphs described by their orders and sizes. For graphs, we observe that if we forbid induced subgraphs on $m$ vertices and $f$ edges for any positive $m$ and $0\leq f \leq \binom{m}{2}$ , then we obtain large homogeneous sets. For triple systems, in the first nontrivial case $m=4$ , for every $S \subseteq \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ , we give bounds on the minimum size of a homogeneous set in a triple system where the number of edges spanned by every four vertices is not in $S$ . In most cases the bounds are essentially tight. We also determine, for all $S$ , whether the growth rate is polynomial or polylogarithmic. Some open problems remain.},

We offer a related characterization: $b_1(x) = x - 1/2$ and $({-}1)^{n-1} b_n(x)$ for $n \gt 0$ is the $n$ -fold circular convolution of $b_1(x)$ with itself. Equivalently, $1 - 2^n b_n(x)$ is the probability density at $x \in (0,1)$ of the fractional part of a sum of $n$ independent random variables, each with the beta $(1,2)$ probability density $2(1-x)$ at $x \in (0,1)$ . This result has a novel combinatorial analog, the Bernoulli clock : mark the hours of a $2 n$ hour clock by a uniformly random permutation of the multiset $\{1,1, 2,2, \ldots, n,n\}$ , meaning pick two different hours uniformly at random from the $2 n$ hours and mark them $1$ , then pick two different hours uniformly at random from the remaining $2 n - 2$ hours and mark them $2$ , and so on. Starting from hour $0 = 2n$ , move clockwise to the first hour marked $1$ , continue clockwise to the first hour marked $2$ , and so on, continuing clockwise around the Bernoulli clock until the first of the two hours marked $n$ is encountered, at a random hour $I_n$ between $1$ and $2n$ . We show that for each positive integer $n$ , the event $( I_n = 1)$ has probability $(1 - 2^n b_n(0))/(2n)$ , where $n! b_n(0) = B_n(0)$ is the $n$ th Bernoulli number. For $ 1 \le k \le 2 n$ , the difference $\delta _n(k)\,:\!=\, 1/(2n) -{\mathbb{P}}( I_n = k)$ is a polynomial function of $k$ with the surprising symmetry $\delta _n( 2 n + 1 - k) = ({-}1)^n \delta _n(k)$ , which is a combinatorial analog of the well-known symmetry of Bernoulli polynomials $b_n(1-x) = ({-}1)^n b_n(x)$ .},

For every fixed $C$ , if each vertex $v \in \bigcup _{i=1}^m V(G_i)$ is contained in at most $C$ of the graphs $G_1, \dots, G_m$ , then the (list) chromatic number of $\bigcup _{i=1}^m G_i$ is at most $D + o(D)$ . This result confirms a special case of a conjecture of Vu and generalizes Kahn’s bound on the list chromatic index of linear uniform hypergraphs of bounded maximum degree. In fact, this result holds for the correspondence (or DP) chromatic number and thus implies a recent result of Molloy and Postle, and we derive this result from a more general list colouring result in the setting of ‘colour degrees’ that also implies a result of Reed and Sudakov.},

We generalize their result, showing that the hypothesis of this theorem actually asymptotically almost surely ensures the existence of every orientation of a cycle of every possible length, simultaneously. Moreover, we prove that we can relax the minimum semi-degree condition to a minimum total degree condition when considering orientations of a cycle that do not contain a large number of vertices of indegree $1$ .

For $k$ colours and $n$ positions, Chvátal found asymptotically optimal bounds when $k \le n^{1-\varepsilon }$ . Following a sequence of gradual improvements for $k\geq n$ colours, the central open question is to resolve the gap between $\Omega (n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n\log \log n)$ for $k=n$ . In this paper, we resolve this gap by presenting the first algorithm for solving $k=n$ Mastermind with a linear number of queries.

  abstract     = {Given a graph $H$ , let us denote by $f_\chi (H)$ and $f_\ell (H)$ , respectively, the maximum chromatic number and the maximum list chromatic number of $H$ -minor-free graphs. Hadwiger’s famous colouring conjecture from 1943 states that $f_\chi (K_t)=t-1$ for every $t \ge 2$ . A closely related problem that has received significant attention in the past concerns $f_\ell (K_t)$ , for which it is known that $2t-o(t) \le f_\ell (K_t) \le O(t (\!\log \log t)^6)$ . Thus, $f_\ell (K_t)$ is bounded away from the conjectured value $t-1$ for $f_\chi (K_t)$ by at least a constant factor. The so-called $H$ -Hadwiger’s conjecture, proposed by Seymour, asks to prove that $f_\chi (H)={\textrm{v}}(H)-1$ for a given graph $H$ (which would be implied by Hadwiger’s conjecture). In this paper, we prove several new lower bounds on $f_\ell (H)$ , thus exploring the limits of a list colouring extension of $H$ -Hadwiger’s conjecture. Our main results are: The first result generalizes recent results on complete and complete bipartite graphs and shows that the list chromatic number of $H$ -minor-free graphs is separated from the desired value of $({\textrm{v}}(H)-1)$ by a constant factor for all large graphs $H$ of linear connectivity. The second result tells us that for almost all graphs $H$ with superlogarithmic average degree $f_\ell (H)$ is separated from $({\textrm{v}}(H)-1)$ by a constant factor arbitrarily close to $2$ . Conceptually these results indicate that the graphs $H$ for which $f_\ell (H)$ is close to the conjectured value $({\textrm{v}}(H)-1)$ for $f_\chi (H)$ are typically rather sparse.},

  abstract     = {Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an intersecting family. A $(k-1)$ -set $E$ is called a unique shadow if it is contained in exactly one member of $\mathcal{F}$ . Let ${\mathcal{A}}=\{A\in \binom{[n]}{k}\colon |A\cap \{1,2,3\}|\geq 2\}$ . In the present paper, we show that for $n\geq 28k$ , $\mathcal{A}$ is the unique family attaining the maximum size among all intersecting families without unique shadow. Several other results of a similar flavour are established as well.},

  abstract     = {We study the locations of complex zeroes of independence polynomials of bounded-degree hypergraphs. For graphs, this is a long-studied subject with applications to statistical physics, algorithms, and combinatorics. Results on zero-free regions for bounded-degree graphs include Shearer’s result on the optimal zero-free disc, along with several recent results on other zero-free regions. Much less is known for hypergraphs. We make some steps towards an understanding of zero-free regions for bounded-degree hypergaphs by proving that all hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ have a zero-free disc almost as large as the optimal disc for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ established by Shearer (of radius $\sim 1/(e \Delta )$ ). Up to logarithmic factors in $\Delta$ this is optimal, even for hypergraphs with all edge sizes strictly greater than $2$ . We conjecture that for $k\ge 3$ , $k$ -uniform linear hypergraphs have a much larger zero-free disc of radius $\Omega (\Delta ^{- \frac{1}{k-1}} )$ . We establish this in the case of linear hypertrees.},

  abstract     = {We study two models of discrete height functions , that is, models of random integer-valued functions on the vertices of a tree. First, we consider the random homomorphism model , in which neighbours must have a height difference of exactly one. The local law is uniform by definition. We prove that the height variance of this model is bounded, uniformly over all boundary conditions (both in terms of location and boundary heights). This implies a strong notion of localisation, uniformly over all extremal Gibbs measures of the system. For the second model, we consider directed trees, in which each vertex has exactly one parent and at least two children. We consider the locally uniform law on height functions which are monotone , that is, such that the height of the parent vertex is always at least the height of the child vertex. We provide a complete classification of all extremal gradient Gibbs measures, and describe exactly the localisation-delocalisation transition for this model. Typical extremal gradient Gibbs measures are localised also in this case. Localisation in both models is consistent with the observation that the Gaussian free field is localised on trees, which is an immediate consequence of transience of the random walk.},

Lovász and Sós showed that the structure of such graphs is forced by homomorphism densities of graphs with at most $(10q)^q+q$ vertices; subsequently, Lovász refined the argument to show that graphs with $4(2q+3)^8$ vertices suffice. Our results imply that the structure of generalised quasirandom graphs with $q\ge 2$ parts is forced by homomorphism densities of graphs with at most $4q^2-q$ vertices, and, if vertices in distinct parts have distinct degrees, then $2q+1$ vertices suffice. The latter improves the bound of $8q-4$ due to Spencer.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a quasipolynomial-time deterministic approximation algorithm for the partition function of a Gibbs point process interacting via a stable potential. This result holds for all activities $\lambda$ for which the partition function satisfies a zero-free assumption in a neighbourhood of the interval $[0,\lambda ]$ . As a corollary, for all finiterange stable potentials, we obtain a quasipolynomial-time deterministic algorithm for all $\lambda \lt 1/(e^{B + 1} \hat C_\phi )$ where $\hat C_\phi$ is a temperedness parameter and $B$ is the stability constant of $\phi$ . In the special case of a repulsive potential such as the hard-sphere gas we improve the range of activity by a factor of at least $e^2$ and obtain a quasipolynomial-time deterministic approximation algorithm for all $\lambda \lt e/\Delta _\phi$ , where $\Delta _\phi$ is the potential-weighted connective constant of the potential $\phi$ . Our algorithm approximates coefficients of the cluster expansion of the partition function and uses the interpolation method of Barvinok to extend this approximation throughout the zero-free region.},
