  abstract     = {The interaction between scientific fields may be subject to strategic constraints —that is, fruitful interaction between fields may require adapting one field to the strategies informing the other. One way the concepts within an interfield field develop is by recrafting concepts originating in one practice in terms compatible with the strategies guiding the other. This conceptual accommodation may be a prerequisite to fruitful interactions between fields with different central problems. I explore these themes by considering the strategic constraints operative in the interfield field of quantum chemistry and the conceptual accommodation required for application to organic chemistry.},

In this article, we recast this suggestion using the notion of public justification.

On our alternative proposal, hedging is often justified because it renders scientific claims as publicly accessible reasons.},

I reply that Henderson’s approximation condition is indeed too strong to be plausible, but it is not needed by the meta-inductive approach; a much weaker and highly plausible approximation condition is sufficient.},

More specifically, we study distance minimization with a refined notion of Bregman divergence and expected utility maximization with strict proper scores.

In our view, formats are individuated by the computational profiles of vehicles, that is, the set of constraints that fix the computational transformations vehicles can undergo.

However, we also show that, for all sufficiently complex classes, there are inductive problems for which convergence is topologically atypical.

Because basal cognition is committed to empirically testable hypotheses, a methodological challenge arises: how can experiments avoid using zoocentric assumptions that ignore the ecological contexts that might elicit cognitively driven behavior in nonneuronal organisms? To meet this challenge, I articulate the principle of dynamic holism (PDH), a methodological principle for guiding research on nonneuronal cognition. I describe PDH’s relation to holistic research programs in human-focused cognitive science and psychology then present an argument from analogy based on holistic developmental biology. Last, I examine two experiments exemplifying the need for PDH.},

It illustrates this by analyzing an ongoing large-scale replication attempt of Southgate et al.’s work exploring infants’ understanding of false beliefs.

Behavioral preferences also explain when agential preferences cannot be analytically separated from the environment that produces the relevant behavior (Condition 2) and when the environment is a significant causal factor (Condition 3).

I argue that in the dynamic POE, the challenge is to explain how an insight under beliefs in which the old evidence E is known increased the credence of a scientific hypothesis. Therefore, Sprenger’s counterfactual solution, in which E has been artificially removed, does not resolve the problem. I consider several potential responses.},

First, it is doubtful whether the CPT utility function measures what its proponents intend. Second, by imposing risk neutrality on agents, the approach involves a more problematic paternalism.},

To do so, Manders provides a translation $f$ from the Newtonian theory ${T_N}$ into the Leibnizian modal relationist account ${T_L}$ . In this article, we show that the translation does not establish equivalence because there is no translation $g:{T_L} \mapsto {T_N}$ that preserves theoremhood.
