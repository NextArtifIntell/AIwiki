  abstract     = {It is known that the simple slice sampler has robust convergence properties; however, the class of problems where it can be implemented is limited. In contrast, we consider hybrid slice samplers which are easily implementable and where another Markov chain approximately samples the uniform distribution on each slice. Under appropriate assumptions on the Markov chain on the slice, we give a lower bound and an upper bound of the spectral gap of the hybrid slice sampler in terms of the spectral gap of the simple slice sampler. An immediate consequence of this is that the spectral gap and geometric ergodicity of the hybrid slice sampler can be concluded from the spectral gap and geometric ergodicity of the simple version, which is very well understood. These results indicate that robustness properties of the simple slice sampler are inherited by (appropriately designed) easily implementable hybrid versions. We apply the developed theory and analyze a number of specific algorithms, such as the stepping-out shrinkage slice sampling, hit-and-run slice sampling on a class of multivariate targets, and an easily implementable combination of both procedures on multidimensional bimodal densities.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the filtering of partially observed multidimensional diffusion processes that are observed regularly at discrete times. This is a challenging problem which requires the use of advanced numerical schemes based upon time-discretization of the diffusion process and then the application of particle filters. Perhaps the state-of-the-art method for moderate-dimensional problems is the multilevel particle filter of Jasra et al. ( SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 55 (2017), 3068–3096). This is a method that combines multilevel Monte Carlo and particle filters. The approach in that article is based intrinsically upon an Euler discretization method. We develop a new particle filter based upon the antithetic truncated Milstein scheme of Giles and Szpruch ( Ann. Appl. Prob. 24 (2014), 1585–1620). We show empirically for a class of diffusion problems that, for $\epsilon&gt;0$ given, the cost to produce a mean squared error (MSE) of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the estimation of the filter is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\log(\epsilon)^2)$ . In the case of multidimensional diffusions with non-constant diffusion coefficient, the method of Jasra et al. (2017) requires a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ to achieve the same MSE.},

It is based on the control of a (typically non-monotonic) stochastic recursion by another (typically monotonic) one. We show that this algorithm is particularly suitable for stochastic matching models with bounded patience, a class of models for which the steady-state distribution of the system is in general unknown in closed form. We first show that the Markov chain of this model can easily be controlled by an infinite-server queue. We then investigate the particular case where patience times are deterministic, and this control argument may fail. In that case we resort to an ad-hoc technique that can also be seen as a control (this time, by the arrival sequence). We then compare this algorithm to the primitive coupling-from-the-past (CFTP) algorithm and to control by an infinite-server queue, and show how our perfect simulation results can be used to estimate and compare, for instance, the loss probabilities of various systems in equilibrium.},

Moreover, we assume that the reinsurance premium principle is calculated by the expected value premium principle. Under the optimality criteria of minimizing the value at risk and conditional value at risk of the insurer’s total risk exposure, we derive the explicit optimal reinsurance treaties, which are layer reinsurance treaties. A new approach is developed to construct the optimal reinsurance treaties. Comparisons with existing studies are also made. Finally, we provide a numerical study based on real data and an example to illustrate the proposed models and results.

The processes considered constitute a broad class of models that find application across the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, finance, and engineering. Motivated by important relevant problems in statistical inference, we derive new, generalised shot-noise simulation methods whenever a normal variance-mean (NVM) mixture representation exists for the driving Lévy process, including the generalised hyperbolic, normal-gamma, and normal tempered stable cases. Simple, explicit conditions are identified for the convergence of the residual of a truncated shot-noise representation to a Brownian motion in the case of the pure Lévy process, and to a Brownian-driven SDE in the case of the Lévy-driven SDE. These results provide Gaussian approximations to the small jumps of the process under the NVM representation. The resulting representations are of particular importance in state inference and parameter estimation for Lévy-driven SDE models, since the resulting conditionally Gaussian structures can be readily incorporated into latent variable inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, expectation-maximisation, and sequential Monte Carlo.},

With a view to practical risk assessments, this paper delves into the worst-case expectile, where only partial information on the underlying distribution is available and there is no closed-form representation. We explore the asymptotic behavior of the worst-case expectile on two specified ambiguity sets: one is through the Wasserstein distance from a reference distribution and transforms this problem into a convex optimization problem via the well-known Kusuoka representation, and the other is induced by higher moment constraints. We obtain precise results in some special cases; nevertheless, there are no unified closed-form solutions. We aim to fully characterize the extreme behaviors; that is, we pursue an approximate solution as the level $\alpha $ tends to 1, which is aesthetically pleasing. As an application of our technique, we investigate the ambiguity set induced by higher moment conditions. Finally, we compare our worst-case expectile approach with a more conservative method based on stochastic order, which is referred to as ‘model aggregation’.},

We present a simple condition for the transition of the process at a discontinuity which can be used to extend any existing sampler for smooth densities, and give specific choices for this transition which work with popular algorithms such as the bouncy particle sampler, the coordinate sampler, and the zigzag process. Our theoretical results extend and make rigorous arguments that have been presented previously, for instance constructing samplers for continuous densities restricted to a bounded domain, and we present a version of the zigzag process that can work in such a scenario. Our novel approach to deriving the invariant distribution of a piecewise deterministic Markov process with boundaries may be of independent interest.},

Moreover, we obtain lower and upper bounds that are applicable in all traffic regimes and become tight in the heavy-traffic regime. We obtain these results by generalizing the drift method recently developed for the case of independent and identically distributed arrivals to the case of Markovian arrivals. We illustrate this generalization by first obtaining the heavy-traffic mean queue length and its distribution in a single-server queue under Markovian arrivals and then applying it to the case of an input-queued switch. The key idea is to exploit the geometric mixing of finite-state Markov chains, and to work with a time horizon that is chosen so that the error due to mixing depends on the heavy-traffic parameter.},

Seeds appear randomly in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at random times and start growing instantaneously in all directions with a random speed. The locations, birth times, and growth speeds of the seeds are given by a Poisson process. Under suitable conditions on the random growth speed, the time distribution, and a weight function $h\;:\;\mathbb{R}^d \times [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ , we prove a Gaussian convergence of the sum of the weights at the exposed points, which are those seeds in the model that are not covered at the time of their birth. Such models have previously been considered, albeit with fixed growth speed. Moreover, using recent results on stabilization regions, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on the distance between the normalized sum of weights and a standard Gaussian random variable in the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov metrics.},

The Freidlin–Wentzell quasipotential is the usual candidate rate function for the sequence of invariant measures indexed by the number of particles. The paper provides two counterexamples where the quasipotential is not the rate function. The quasipotential arises from finite-horizon considerations. However, there are certain barriers that cannot be surmounted easily in any finite time horizon, but these barriers can be crossed in the stationary regime. Consequently, the quasipotential is infinite at some points where the rate function is finite. After highlighting this phenomenon, the paper studies some sufficient conditions on a class of interacting particle systems under which one can continue to assert that the Freidlin–Wentzell quasipotential is indeed the rate function.},

WRGs are a generalisation of the random recursive tree and directed acyclic graph models, in which vertices are assigned vertex-weights and where new vertices attach to $m\in\mathbb{N}$ predecessors, each selected independently with a probability proportional to the vertex-weight of the predecessor. Prior work established the asymptotic growth rate of the maximum degree of the WRG model, and here we show that there exists a critical exponent $\mu_m$ such that the typical label size of the maximum-degree vertex equals $n^{\mu_m(1+o(1))}$ almost surely as n , the size of the graph, tends to infinity. These results extend results on the asymptotic behaviour of the location of the maximum degree, formerly only known for the random recursive tree model, to the more general weighted multigraph case of the WRG model. Moreover, for the weighted recursive tree model, that is, the WRG model with $m=1$ , we prove the joint convergence of the rescaled degree and label of high-degree vertices under additional assumptions on the vertex-weight distribution, and also extend results on the growth rate of the maximum degree obtained by Eslava, Lodewijks, and Ortgiese ( Stoch.

  abstract     = {Continuous-time Markov chains are frequently used to model the stochastic dynamics of (bio)chemical reaction networks. However, except in very special cases, they cannot be analyzed exactly. Additionally, simulation can be computationally intensive. An approach to address these challenges is to consider a more tractable diffusion approximation. Leite and Williams ( Ann. Appl. Prob. 29 , 2019) proposed a reflected diffusion as an approximation for (bio)chemical reaction networks, which they called the constrained Langevin approximation (CLA) as it extends the usual Langevin approximation beyond the first time some chemical species becomes zero in number. Further explanation and examples of the CLA can be found in Anderson et al. ( SIAM Multiscale Modeling Simul. 17 , 2019). In this paper, we extend the approximation of Leite and Williams to (nearly) density-dependent Markov chains, as a first step to obtaining error estimates for the CLA when the diffusion state space is one-dimensional, and we provide a bound for the error in a strong approximation. We discuss some applications for chemical reaction networks and epidemic models, and illustrate these with examples. Our method of proof is designed to generalize to higher dimensions, provided there is a Lipschitz Skorokhod map defining the reflected diffusion process. The existence of such a Lipschitz map is an open problem in dimensions more than one.},

We solve for the closed-form optimal portfolio, which shows that a first-loss contract can sometimes behave like an option contract. We propose an asymptotic approach to investigate the portfolio. This approach can be adopted to illustrate economic insights, including the fact that the portfolio under a convex contract becomes more conservative when the market state is better. Furthermore, we discover a means of Pareto improvement by simultaneously considering the investor’s utility and increasing the manager’s incentive rate. This is achieved by establishing the collection of Pareto points of a single contract, proving that it is a strictly decreasing and strictly concave frontier, and comparing the Pareto frontiers of different contracts. These results may be helpful for the illustration of risk choices and the design of Pareto-optimal contracts.},

Sci. 36 , 2022), we discussed a cumulative residual inaccuracy measure for coherent systems at component level, that is, based on the common, stochastically dependent component lifetimes observed under a non-homogeneous Poisson process. In this paper, using a point process martingale approach, we extend this concept to a cumulative residual inaccuracy measure between non-explosive point processes and then specialize the results to Markov occurrence times. If the processes satisfy the proportional risk hazard process property, then the measure determines the Markov chain uniquely. Several examples are presented, including birth-and-death processes and pure birth process, and then the results are applied to coherent systems at component level subject to Markov failure and repair processes.},

Based on the so-called flux-balance equation, we establish identities for stationary measures and QSDs, which we use to derive tail asymptotics. In particular, for continuous-time Markov chains with asymptotic power law transition rates, tail asymptotics for stationary distributions and QSDs are classified into three types using three easily computable parameters: (i) super-exponential distributions, (ii) exponential-tailed distributions, and (iii) sub-exponential distributions. Our approach to establish tail asymptotics of stationary distributions is different from the classical semimartingale approach, and we do not impose ergodicity or moment bound conditions. In particular, the results also hold for explosive Markov chains, for which multiple stationary distributions may exist. Furthermore, our results on tail asymptotics of QSDs seem new. We apply our results to biochemical reaction networks, a general single-cell stochastic gene expression model, an extended class of branching processes, and stochastic population processes with bursty reproduction, none of which are birth–death processes. Our approach, together with the identities, easily extends to discrete-time Markov chains.},

However, for the mean residual life (MRL) order, it has recently been proved that the preservation result does not hold true in general, but rather holds for a particular class of distributions. In this paper, we study whether or not a similar preservation result holds for the mean inactivity time (MIT) order. We prove that the MIT order is not preserved from signatures to system lifetimes with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components, but holds for special classes of distributions. The relationship between these classes and the order statistics is also highlighted. Furthermore, the distribution-free comparison of the performance of coherent systems with dependent and identically distributed (d.i.d.) components is studied under the MIT ordering, using diagonal-dependent copulas and distorted distributions.},

The latter is a block graph combining in a tree-like structure a finite number of transitive tournaments, each of which is a DAG in which every two nodes are connected. We study the limit of the joint tails of the max-linear model conditionally on the event that a given variable exceeds a high threshold. Under a suitable condition, the limiting distribution involves the factorization into independent increments along the shortest trail between two variables, thereby imitating the behaviour of a Markov random field. We are also interested in the identifiability of the model parameters in the case when some variables are latent and only a subvector is observed. It turns out that the parameters are identifiable under a criterion on the nodes carrying the latent variables which is easy and quick to check.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose new Metropolis–Hastings and simulated annealing algorithms on a finite state space via modifying the energy landscape. The core idea of landscape modification rests on introducing a parameter c , such that the landscape is modified once the algorithm is above this threshold parameter to encourage exploration, while the original landscape is utilized when the algorithm is below the threshold for exploitation purposes. We illustrate the power and benefits of landscape modification by investigating its effect on the classical Curie–Weiss model with Glauber dynamics and external magnetic field in the subcritical regime. This leads to a landscape-modified mean-field equation, and with appropriate choice of c the free energy landscape can be transformed from a double-well into a single-well landscape, while the location of the global minimum is preserved on the modified landscape. Consequently, running algorithms on the modified landscape can improve the convergence to the ground state in the Curie–Weiss model. In the setting of simulated annealing, we demonstrate that landscape modification can yield improved or even subexponential mean tunnelling time between global minima in the low-temperature regime by appropriate choice of c , and we give a convergence guarantee using an improved logarithmic cooling schedule with reduced critical height. We also discuss connections between landscape modification and other acceleration techniques, such as Catoni’s energy transformation algorithm, preconditioning, importance sampling, and quantum annealing. The technique developed in this paper is not limited to simulated annealing, but is broadly applicable to any difference-based discrete optimization algorithm by a change of landscape.},

Tóth and Vető found that this model exhibited very peculiar behavior, as the process formed by the local times of all the edges, evaluated at a stopping time of a certain type and suitably renormalized, converges to a deterministic process, instead of a random one as in similar models. In this work, we study the fluctuations of the local times process around its deterministic limit, about which nothing was previously known. We prove that these fluctuations converge in the Skorokhod $M_1$ topology, as well as in the uniform topology away from the discontinuities of the limit, but not in the most classical Skorokhod topology. We also prove the convergence of the fluctuations of the aforementioned stopping times.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by applications to COVID dynamics, we describe a model of a branching process in a random environment $\{Z_n\}$ whose characteristics change when crossing upper and lower thresholds. This introduces a cyclical path behavior involving periods of increase and decrease leading to supercritical and subcritical regimes. Even though the process is not Markov, we identify subsequences at random time points $\{(\tau_j, \nu_j)\}$ —specifically the values of the process at crossing times, viz. $\{(Z_{\tau_j}, Z_{\nu_j})\}$ —along which the process retains the Markov structure. Under mild moment and regularity conditions, we establish that the subsequences possess a regenerative structure and prove that the limiting normal distributions of the growth rates of the process in supercritical and subcritical regimes decouple. For this reason, we establish limit theorems concerning the length of supercritical and subcritical regimes and the proportion of time the process spends in these regimes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we explicitly identify the limiting variances in terms of the functionals of the offspring distribution, threshold distribution, and environmental sequences.},

This contrasts sharply with most epidemic models, in which infection is spread purely by pairwise interaction. A sequence of epidemic processes, indexed by n , and an approximating branching process are constructed on a common probability space via embedded random walks. We show that under suitable conditions the process of infectives in the epidemic process converges almost surely to the branching process. This leads to a threshold theorem for the epidemic process, where a major outbreak is defined as one that infects at least $\log n$ individuals. We show further that there exists $\delta \gt 0$ , depending on the model parameters, such that the probability that a major outbreak has size at least $\delta n$ tends to one as $n \to \infty$ .},

A piecewise deterministic process modeling adaptation is coupled to a Feller logistic diffusion modeling population size. As the individual features in the population become further away from the optimal ones, the growth rate declines, making population extinction more likely. Assuming that the environment changes deterministically and steadily in a constant direction, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution, the associated survival capacity, and the Q -process. Our approach also provides several exponential convergence results (in total variation for the measures). From this synthetic information, we can characterize the efficiency of internal adaptation (i.e. population turnover from mutant invasions). When the latter is lacking, there is still stability, but because of the high level of population extinction. Therefore, any characterization of internal adaptation should be based on specific features of this quasi-ergodic regime rather than the mere existence of the regime itself.},

One well-known class of copulas in two dimensions is the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM) copula, since its simple analytic shape enables closed-form solutions to many problems in applied probability. However, the classical definition of the high-dimensional FGM copula does not enable a straightforward understanding of the effect of the copula parameters on the dependence, nor a geometric understanding of their admissible range. We circumvent this issue by analyzing the FGM copula from a probabilistic approach based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions. This paper examines high-dimensional exchangeable FGM copulas, a subclass of FGM copulas. We show that the dependence parameters of exchangeable FGM copulas can be expressed as a convex hull of a finite number of extreme points. We also leverage the probabilistic interpretation to develop efficient sampling and estimating procedures and provide a simulation study. Throughout, we discover geometric interpretations of the copula parameters that assist one in decoding the dependence of high-dimensional exchangeable FGM copulas.},

We consider this process in the case where the underlying graph is an inhomogeneous random graph whose kernel is of rank one. Assuming that initially every vertex is infected independently with probability $p \in (0,1]$ , we provide a law of large numbers for the size of the set of vertices that are infected by the end of the process. Moreover, we investigate the case $p = p(n) = o(1)$ , and we focus on the important case of inhomogeneous random graphs exhibiting a power-law degree distribution with exponent $\beta \in (2,3)$ . The first two authors have shown in this setting the existence of a critical $p_c =o(1)$ such that, with high probability, if $p =o(p_c)$ , then the process does not evolve at all, whereas if $p = \omega(p_c)$ , then the final set of infected vertices has size $\Omega(n)$ .

  abstract     = {Consider the following migration process based on a closed network of N queues with $K_N$ customers. Each station is a $\cdot$ /M/ $\infty$ queue with service (or migration) rate $\mu$ . Upon departure, a customer is routed independently and uniformly at random to another station. In addition to migration, these customers are subject to a susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) dynamics. That is, customers are in one of two states: I for infected, or S for susceptible. Customers can swap their state either from I to S or from S to I only in stations. More precisely, at any station, each susceptible customer becomes infected with the instantaneous rate $\alpha Y$ if there are Y infected customers in the station, whereas each infected customer recovers and becomes susceptible with rate $\beta$ . We let N tend to infinity and assume that $\lim_{N\to \infty} K_N/N= \eta $ , where $\eta$ is a positive constant representing the customer density. The main problem of interest concerns the set of parameters of such a system for which there exists a stationary regime where the epidemic survives in the limiting system. The latter limit will be referred to as the thermodynamic limit. We use coupling and stochastic monotonicity arguments to establish key properties of the associated Markov processes, which in turn allow us to give the structure of the phase transition diagram of this thermodynamic limit with respect to $\eta$ . The analysis of the Kolmogorov equations of this SIS model reduces to that of a wave-type PDE for which we have found no explicit solution. This plain SIS model is one among several companion stochastic processes that exhibit both random migration and contagion. Two of them are discussed in the present paper as they provide variants to the plain SIS model as well as some bounds and approximations. These two variants are the departure-on-change-of-state (DOCS) model and the averaged-infection-rate (AIR) model, which both admit closed-form solutions. The AIR system is a classical mean-field model where the infection mechanism based on the actual population of infected customers is replaced by a mechanism based on some empirical average of the number of infected customers in all stations. The latter admits a product-form solution. DOCS features accelerated migration in that each change of SIS state implies an immediate departure. This model leads to another wave-type PDE that admits a closed-form solution. In this text, the main focus is on the closed stochastic networks and their limits. The open systems consisting of a single station with Poisson input are instrumental in the analysis of the thermodynamic limits and are also of independent interest. This class of SIS dynamics has incarnations in virtually all queueing networks of the literature.},

The jump intensity involves periodic and aperiodic constituents, as well as oscillating and non-oscillating constituents. This means that the noise can come both from the underlying periodic medium and from external environments, and is allowed to have different scales. It turns out that the Feller process converges in distribution, as the scaling parameter goes to zero, to a Lévy process. As special cases of our result, some homogenization problems studied in previous works can be recovered. We also generalize the approach to the homogenization of symmetric stable-like processes with variable order. Moreover, we present some numerical experiments to demonstrate the usage of our homogenization results in the numerical approximation of first exit times.},
