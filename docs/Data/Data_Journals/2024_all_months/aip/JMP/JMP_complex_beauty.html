  abstract     = {We study the non-stationary Anderson parabolic problem on the lattice Z d , i.e., the equation ϰ ∂ u ∂ t = ϰ A u ( t , x ) + ξ t ( x ) u ( t , x ) , u ( 0 , x ) ≡ 1 , ( t , x ) ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ) × Z d ⁠ . Here A is a non-local difference operator, ξ t ( x ), t ≥ 0, x ∈ Z d , is the family of the correlated white noises and ϰ &gt; 0 is the diffusion coefficient. The changes of ϰ (large vs small) are responsible for the qualitative phase transition in the model. At the first step the analysis of the model is reduced to the solution of the stochastic differential equation (in the standard Itô’s form) on the weighted Hilbert space l 2 ( Z d , μ ) with an appropriate measure μ . The equations of first two moments of the solution u ( t , x ) are derived and studied using the spectral analysis of the corresponding Schrödinger operators with special class of the positive definite potentials. The analysis reveals several bifurcations depending on the properties of the kernel of A and the correlation function in the potential.},

We establish an RHS with a positive-definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermitian composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermitian composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.},

From the Schrödinger-Lohe model, we rigorously derive the Vlasov-Lohe model using Wigner transform and Wigner measure method. In semiclassical limit, generalized Wigner distributions to the Schrödinger-Lohe model converge to a set of Wigner measures which corresponds to a weak solution to the Vlasov-Lohe model, and then we show the asymptotic collective behaviors of the Vlasov-Lohe model. When one-body potentials are identical, we show that complete synchronization emerges for the Vlasov-Lohe model. In contrast, for non-identical potentials the lack of boundedness results in practical synchronization for the integrals of solutions. Moreover, we construct a global existence of classical solutions to the Vlasov-Lohe model using the standard method of characteristics. Analysis in this work can deal with possibly non-identical potentials in which their differences are constant.},

We also obtain a third equivalent characterization in terms of the covariant derivative of the 1-form β . We use these results to classify all locally metrizable m -Kropina spaces whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In the special case where the first de Rham cohomology group of the underlying manifold is trivial (which is true of simply connected manifolds, for instance), we show that global metrizability is equivalent to local metrizability and hence, in that case, our necessary and sufficient conditions also characterize global metrizability. In addition, we further obtain explicitly all Ricci-flat, locally metrizable m -Kropina metrics in (3 + 1)D whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In fact, the only possibilities are essentially the following two: either α is flat and β is α -parallel, or α is a pp-wave and β is α -parallel.},

  abstract     = {This is the continuation of the study of differential graded (dg) vertex algebras defined in our previous paper [Caradot et al. , “Differential graded vertex operator algebras and their Poisson algebras,” J. Math. Phys. 64 , 121702 (2023)]. The goal of this paper is to construct a functor from the category of dg vertex Lie algebras to the category of dg vertex algebras which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor. This functor not only provides an abundant number of examples of dg vertex algebras, but it is also an important step in constructing a homotopy theory [see Avramov and Halperin, “Through the looking glass: A dictionary between rational homotopy theory and local algebra,” in Algebra, Algebraic Topology and their Interactions , Lecture Notes in Mathematics, edited by J. E. Roos (Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1986), Vol. 1183, pp. 1–27 and D. G. Quillen, Homotopical Algebra , Lecture Notes in Mathematics (Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1967), Vol. 43] in the category of vertex algebras. Vertex Lie algebras were introduced as analogues of vertex algebras, but in which we only consider the singular part of the vertex operator map and the equalities it satisfies. In this paper, we extend the definition of vertex Lie algebras to the dg setting. We construct a pair of adjoint functors between the categories of dg vertex algebras and dg vertex Lie algebras, which leads to the explicit construction of dg vertex (operator) algebras. We will give examples based on the Virasoro algebra, the Neveu–Schwarz algebra, and dg Lie algebras.},

  abstract     = {The Landau–Ginzburg/Conformal Field Theory (LG/CFT) correspondence predicts tensor equivalences between categories of matrix factorisations of certain polynomials and categories associated to the N = 2 supersymmetric conformal field theories. We realise this correspondence for the potential x d for any d ≥ 2, where previous results were limited to odd d . Our proof first establishes the fact that both sides of the correspondence carry the structure of module tensor categories over the category of Z d -graded vector spaces equipped with a non-trivial braiding. This allows us to describe the CFT side as generated by a single object as a module tensor category, and use this to efficiently provide a functor realising the tensor equivalence.},

It is shown that there exists a critical value M cr &gt; 0 such that if the total incoming mass flux M 0 is less than M cr , then there exists a unique subsonic cavity flow, with the free boundary smoothly emanating from the endpoint of the obstacle and having a constant end pressure along the free boundary. Moreover, the positivity of the radial velocity and the asymptotic behavior of the cavity flow at far field are also obtained. As a by-product, the convexity of the free boundary is derived. Based on the convex geometry property of the free boundary, we obtain the positivity of the axial velocity in the fluid. If the free boundary is strictly convex, it is further proved that the optimal regularity of the free boundary at the separation point is C 1 , 1 2 ⁠ .},

The main difficulties lie in the presence of linear curl terms and the lack of micro-rotation velocity dissipation. By utilizing the effect of velocity dissipation and damping term in the equation of micro-rotational velocity, we prove the non-uniform decay and the upper bounds of decay estimates of the global solutions. Furthermore, the lower bounds of decay estimates are shown by making full use of the structure of this system and by introducing a combined quantity. The approach used here can also be applied to derive the lower and upper bounds of decay for the magneto-micropolar equations with full dissipation. We remark that the lower bounds are new even for the fully dissipative system.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the original storage prescription for the Hopfield model of neural networks – as well as for its dense generalizations – has been turned into a genuine Hebbian learning rule by postulating the expression of its Hamiltonian for both the supervised and unsupervised protocols. In these notes, first, we obtain these explicit expressions by relying upon maximum entropy extremization à la Jaynes. Beyond providing a formal derivation of these recipes for Hebbian learning, this construction also highlights how Lagrangian constraints within entropy extremization force network’s outcomes on neural correlations: these try to mimic the empirical counterparts hidden in the datasets provided to the network for its training and, the denser the network, the longer the correlations that it is able to capture. Next, we prove that, in the big data limit, whatever the presence of a teacher (or its lacking), not only these Hebbian learning rules converge to the original storage prescription of the Hopfield model but also their related free energies (and, thus, the statistical mechanical picture provided by Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky is fully recovered). As a sideline, we show mathematical equivalence among standard Cost functions ( Hamiltonian ), preferred in Statistical Mechanical jargon, and quadratic Loss Functions, preferred in Machine Learning terminology. Remarks on the exponential Hopfield model (as the limit of dense networks with diverging density) and semi-supervised protocols are also provided.},

Considering the huge benefits of vaccination and the unpredictability of changes in the natural environment, we propose and investigate a stochastic susceptible-vaccinated-infected-recovered epidemic model with general incidence rate and mean-reversion process by incorporating the Black-Karasinski process into the vaccination strategy model. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the model are proved theoretically. Then, by constructing several suitable Lyapunov functions and a compact set, the existence of the stationary distribution for the model is obtained. In addition, by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and using the related algebraic equation theory, the probability density function of the model around the quasi-endemic equilibrium is derived. Finally, some numerical simulations are employed to explain our theoretical results.},

In this paper, we introduce Lévy noise into the Cucker–Smale model to investigate its effect on the flocking dynamics of the system. The well-posedness of the system is guaranteed by defining an appropriate stopping time and constructing a Lyapunov function. Through the strong law of large numbers for martingales, a sufficient framework of the strong stochastic flocking is obtained without the strict assumption that the communication rate function has a positive lower bound due to the introduction of Lévy noise. We find that Lévy noise can accelerate flocking and become good noise in some cases. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to validate our results and further observe effects of Lévy noise.},

Then we analyze the dynamical behavior of the stochastic model in detail, including the existence and uniqueness of the global solution, the p th moment boundedness, asymptotic pathwise estimation and the existence of a stationary distribution. It is worth noting that by solving the six-dimensional algebraic equations corresponding to the stochastic model, we get the approximate expression of the probability density function around the quasi-coexistence equilibrium of the stochastic system. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are presented to confirm the feasibility and correctness of our theoretical analysis results. Our findings show the importance of considering the effect of this type of stochastic process on the population dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We describe the symmetry group of the stabilizer polytope for any number n of systems and any prime local dimension d . In the qubit case, the symmetry group coincides with the linear and anti-linear Clifford operations. In the case of qudits, the structure is somewhat richer: For n = 1, it is a wreath product of permutations of bases and permutations of the elements within each basis. For n &gt; 1, the symmetries are given by affine symplectic similitudes . These are the affine maps that preserve the symplectic form of the underlying discrete phase space up to a non-zero multiplier. We phrase these results with respect to a number of a priori different notions of “symmetry,” including Kadison symmetries (bijections that are compatible with convex combinations), Wigner symmetries (bijections that preserve inner products), and symmetries realized by an action on Hilbert space. Going beyond stabilizer states, we extend an observation of Heinrich and Gross [Quantum 3 , 132 (2019)] and show that the symmetries of fairly general sets of Hermitian operators are constrained by certain moments. In particular: the symmetries of a set that behaves like a 3-design preserve Jordan products and are therefore realized by conjugation with unitaries or anti-unitaries. (The structure constants of the Jordan algebra are encoded in an order-three tensor, which we connect to the third moments of a design). This generalizes Kadison’s formulation of the classic Wigner theorem on quantum mechanical symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Bigraded Toda hierarchy L 1 M ( n ) = L 2 N ( n ) is generalized to L 1 M ( n ) = L 2 N ( n ) + ∑ j ∈ Z ∑ i = 1 m q n ( i ) Λ j r n + 1 ( i ) ⁠ , which is the analogue of the famous constrained KP hierarchy L k = ( L k ) ≥ 0 + ∑ i = 1 m q i ∂ − 1 r i ⁠ . It is known that different bosonizations of fermionic KP hierarchy will give rise to different kinds of integrable hierarchies. Starting from the fermionic form of constrained KP hierarchy, bilinear equation of this generalized bigraded Toda hierarchy (GBTH) are derived by using 2–component boson–fermion correspondence. Next based upon this, the Lax structure of GBTH is obtained. Conversely, we also derive bilinear equation of GBTH from the corresponding Lax structure.},

  abstract     = {The traveling tube (TWT) design in a nutshell comprises of a pencil-like electron beam (e-beam) in vacuum interacting with guiding it slow-wave structure (SWS). In our prior studies the e-beam was represented by one-dimensional electron flow and SWS was represented by a transmission line (TL). We extend in this paper our previously constructed field theory for TWTs as well the celebrated Pierce theory by replacing there the standard TL with its generalization allowing for the low frequency cutoff. Both the standard TL and generalized transmission line (GTL) feature uniformly distributed shunt capacitance and serial inductance, but the GTL in addition to that has uniformly distributed serial capacitance. We remind the reader that the standard TL represents a waveguide operating at the so-called TEM mode with no low frequency cutoff. In contrast, the GTL represents a waveguide operating at the so-called TM mode featuring the low frequency cutoff. We develop all the details of the extended TWT field theory and using a particular choice of the TWT parameters we derive a physically appealing factorized form of the TWT dispersion relations. This form has two factors that represent exactly the dispersion functions of non-interacting GTL and the e-beam. We also find that the factorized dispersion relations comes with a number of interesting features including: (i) focus points that belong to each dispersion curve as TWT principle parameter varies; (ii) formation of “hybrid” branches of the TWT dispersion curves parts of which can be traced to non-interacting GTL and the e-beam.},

In particular, we focus on the Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension ν ≥ 5, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension ν ≥ 3 at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the linearly independent Nambu–Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.},

In this article, we prove the LTO axioms for Kitaev’s Quantum Double model for a finite group G . We identify the boundary nets of algebras with fusion categorical nets associated to ( H i l b ( G ) , C [ G ] ) or ( R e p ( G ) , C G ) depending on whether the boundary cut is rough or smooth, respectively. This allows us to make connections to the work of Ogata [Ann. Henri Poincaré 25 , 2353–2387 (2024)] on the type of the cone von Neumann algebras in the algebraic quantum field theory approach to topological superselection sectors. We show that the boundary algebras can also be calculated from a trivial G -symmetry protected topological phase ( G -SPT), and that the gauging map preserves the boundary algebras. Finally, we compute the boundary algebras for the (3 + 1)D Quantum Double model associated to an Abelian group.},

Following the standard framework of quantum theory, the problem translates into finding an appropriate quantum image of the classical arrival time T C ( q , p ) ⁠ , usually in operator form T ̂ ⁠ . In this paper, we consider the problem anew within the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The resulting quantum image is a real-valued and time-reversal symmetric function T M ( q , p ) in formal series of ℏ 2 with the classical arrival time as the leading term. It is obtained directly from the Moyal bracket relation with the system Hamiltonian and is hence interpreted as a Moyal deformation of the classical TOA. We investigate its properties and discuss how it bypasses the known obstructions to quantization by showing the isomorphism between T M ( q , p ) and the rigged Hilbert space TOA operator constructed in Pablico and Galapon [Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138 , 153 (2023)], which always satisfy the time-energy canonical commutation relation for arbitrary analytic potentials. We then examine TOA problems for a free particle and a quartic oscillator potential as examples.},

Second, we deal with a tri-partite system subject at its ends to two independent QRMs and a weak coupling Hamiltonian. The latter is split as an affine combination of individual Hamiltonians, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity of the entropy production to leading order, with the possible exception of one affine combination. We apply these results to a physically motivated model and exhibit explicit expressions for the leading orders steady-state solution, entropy production and entropy fluxes. Moreover, these approximations are numerically shown to hold beyond the expected regimes.},

We prove that for fixed α , there is a transition in the transport properties as β varies in (0, 1]: For 0 &lt; β &lt; α , the edge current grows exponentially in time, for α = β , the edge current is asymptotically constant, and for β &gt; α , the edge current decays in time.

The basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated using the method of next-generation matrix. The critical wave speed c m * is determined by analyzing the distribution of roots of the characteristic equation. When R 0 &gt; 1 and wave speed c ⩾ c m * ⁠ , the existence of traveling waves connecting disease-free and endemic steady states is obtained by constructing sub- and super-solutions and a Lyapunov functional, and applying Schauder’s fixed-point theorem and a limit argument. When R 0 &gt; 1 and 0 &lt; c &lt; c m * ⁠ , the nonexistence of traveling waves connecting disease-free and endemic steady states is proven by contradiction and two-sided Laplace transform. This indicates that the critical wave speed c m * is exactly the minimum wave speed. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate theoretical results. The dependence of the minimal speed c m * on time delay, diffusion rates and contact rates is discussed, showing that the longer the latent period and the lower the diffusion rates of infected individuals and the inter-group transmission rates between groups, the slower the spread of disease.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a cancer invasion model that incorporates porous medium diffusion (Δ u m ) and extracellular matrix remodeling effects [ ηω (1 − u − ω )] in a bounded domain of R N ( N ≥ 2). Rich achievements have been achieved for the case η = 0 in the past ten years for the nonlinear diffusion case, but there is no any progress for η &gt; 0. In this paper, we pay our attention to the global existence of solutions of the case η &gt; 0, and establish the critical exponent m * = 2 N − 2 N of global solvability. More precisely, if m &gt; m *, the solution will always exist globally, while if m &lt; m *, there exist blow-up solutions. In this system, the remodeling effect of extracellular matrix [ ηω (1 − u − ω )] bring some essential difficulties to the estimation of the haptotactic term, so the main technique we used is completely different from the case of η = 0.},

In particular, we consider the limit corresponding to the growth of the coupling strength to infinity, recently studied using resolvent analysis. The limits obtained in this paper are given in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and other L -functions, suggesting further relations between spectral zeta function of quantum interaction models and number theory.},

Specifically, except for two specific scenarios, the ( n 2 − n 1 + 1)-flow of the (2 + 1)-dimensional reduced multi-component AKNS hierarchy can similarly be decomposed into the corresponding n 1 -flow and n 2 -flow of the reduced multi-component AKNS hierarchy. Through the application of these integrable decompositions and Darboux transformation techniques, multiple solitons for the standard focusing multi-component “breaking soliton” equations, as well as singular, exponential, and rational solitons for the nonlocal defocusing multi-component “breaking soliton” equations, are systematically presented. Furthermore, the elastic interactions and dynamical behaviors among these soliton solutions are thoroughly investigated without loss of generality.},

Complexity 4 , 035005 (2023)], Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy. We upgrade this treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d -regular graphs in terms of a d -dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d -regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto’s earlier findings.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the nonlinear evolution of magnetic field turbulence in proximity of steady ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) configurations characterized by a small electric current, a small plasma flow, and approximate flux surfaces, a physical setting that is relevant for plasma confinement in stellarators. The aim is to gather insight on magnetic field dynamics, to elucidate accessibility and stability of three-dimensional MHD equilibria, as well as to formulate practical methods to compute them. Starting from the ideal MHD equations, a reduced dynamical system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for the flux function and the angle variable associated with the Clebsch representation of the magnetic field is obtained. It is shown that under suitable boundary and gauge conditions such reduced system preserves magnetic energy, magnetic helicity, and total magnetic flux. The noncanonical Hamiltonian structure of the reduced system is identified, and used to show the nonlinear stability of steady solutions against perturbations involving only one Clebsch potential. The Hamiltonian structure is also applied to construct a dissipative dynamical system through the method of double brackets. This dissipative system enables the computation of MHD equilibria by minimizing energy until a critical point of the Hamiltonian is reached. Finally, an iterative scheme based on the alternate solution of the two steady equations in the reduced system is proposed as a further method to compute MHD equilibria. A theorem is proven which states that the iterative scheme converges to a nontrivial MHD equilbrium as long as solutions exist at each step of the iteration.},

  abstract     = {Spacetime geometry is described by two– a priori independent–geometric structures: the symmetric connection Γ and the metric tensor g . Metricity condition of Γ (i.e. ∇ g = 0) is implied by the Palatini variational principle, but only when the matter fields belong to an exceptional class. In case of a generic matter field, Palatini implies non-metricity of Γ. Traditionally, instead of the (first order) Palatini principle, we use in this case the (second order) Hilbert principle, assuming metricity condition a priori . Unfortunately, the resulting right-hand side of the Einstein equations does not coincide with the matter energy-momentum tensor. We propose to treat seriously the Palatini-implied non-metric connection. The conventional Einstein’s theory, rewritten in terms of this object, acquires a much simpler and universal structure. This approach opens a room for the description of the large scale effects in General Relativity (dark matter?, dark energy?), without resorting to purely phenomenological terms in the Lagrangian of gravitational field. All theories discussed in this paper belong to the standard General Relativity Theory, the only non-standard element being their (much simpler) mathematical formulation. As a mathematical bonus, we propose a new formalism in the calculus of variations, because in case of hyperbolic field theories the standard approach leads to nonsense conclusions.},

  abstract     = {The Weil–Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundaries are known to be given by polynomials in the boundary lengths. These polynomials satisfy Mirzakhani’s recursion formula, which fits into the general framework of topological recursion. We generalize the recursion to hyperbolic surfaces with any number of special geodesic boundaries that are required to be tight . A special boundary is tight if it has minimal length among all curves that separate it from the other special boundaries. The Weil–Petersson volume of this restricted family of hyperbolic surfaces is shown again to be polynomial in the boundary lengths. This remains true when we allow conical defects in the surface with cone angles in (0, π ) in addition to geodesic boundaries. Moreover, the generating function of Weil–Petersson volumes with fixed genus and a fixed number of special boundaries is polynomial as well, and satisfies a topological recursion that generalizes Mirzakhani’s formula. This work is largely inspired by recent works by Bouttier, Guitter, and Miermont [Ann. Henri Lebesgue 5 , 1035–1110 (2022)] on the enumeration of planar maps with tight boundaries. Our proof relies on the equivalence of Mirzakhani’s recursion formula to a sequence of partial differential equations (known as the Virasoro constraints) on the generating function of intersection numbers. Finally, we discuss a connection with Jackiw–Teitelboim (JT) gravity. We show that the multi-boundary correlators of JT gravity with defects are expressible in the tight Weil–Petersson volume generating functions, using a tight generalization of the JT trumpet partition function.},

  abstract     = {We provide a simple proof of dynamical delocalization, that is, time-increasing lower bounds on quantum transport for discrete, one-particle Schrödinger operators on ℓ 2 ( Z d ) ⁠ , provided solutions to the Schrödinger equation satisfy certain growth conditions. The proof is based on basic resolvent identities and the Combes-Thomas estimate on the exponential decay of the Green’s function. As a consequence, we prove that generalized eigenfunctions for energies outside the spectrum of H must grow exponentially in some directions. We also prove that if H has any absolutely continuous spectrum, then the Schrödinger operator exhibits dynamical delocalization. We apply the general result to Γ-trimmed Schrödinger operators, with periodic Γ, and prove dynamical delocalization for these operators. These results also apply to the Γ-trimmed Anderson model, providing a random, ergodic model exhibiting both dynamical localization in an energy interval and dynamical delocalization.},

  abstract     = {The Grothedieck bound formalism is studied using “rescaling transformations,” in the context of a single quantum system. The rescaling transformations enlarge the set of unitary transformations (which apply to isolated systems), with transformations that change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the wavefunction, and can be linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g., quantum tunneling, damping and amplification, etc). A special case of rescaling transformations are the dequantisation transformations, which map a Hilbert space formalism into a formalism of scalars. The Grothendieck formalism considers a “classical” quadratic form C ( θ ) which takes values less than 1, and the corresponding “quantum” quadratic form Q ( θ ) which takes values greater than 1, up to the complex Grothendieck constant k G . It is shown that Q ( θ ) can be expressed as the trace of the product of θ with two rescaling matrices, and C ( θ ) can be expressed as the trace of the product of θ with two dequantisation matrices. Values of Q ( θ ) in the “ultra-quantum” region (1, k G ) are very important, because this region is classically forbidden [ C ( θ ) cannot take values in it]. An example with Q ( θ ) ∈ ( 1 , k G ) is given, which is related to phenomena where classically isolated by high potentials regions of space, communicate through quantum tunneling. Other examples show that “ultra-quantumness” according to the Grothendieck formalism ( Q ( θ ) ∈ ( 1 , k G ) ) ⁠ , is different from quantumness according to other criteria (like quantum interference or the uncertainty principle).},

Under some suitable assumptions of the far fields and boundary values of the density, the velocity and the absolute temperature, the large-time behavior of the solutions for the initial boundary value problem is govern by the stationary solution and basic waves of the corresponding hyperbolic system. Then the asymptotic stability of the boundary layer, and the superposition of the boundary layer and the three-rarefaction wave are shown provided that the initial perturbation and the strength of the rarefaction wave and stationary wave are small. The proof is mainly based on L 2 -energy method, some time-decay estimates in L p -norm for the smoothed rarefaction wave and the space variable decay estimates of the boundary layer. This can be viewed as the first result about the nonlinear stability of the combination of two different wave patterns for the inflow problem of the full compressible Navier–Stokes–Korteweg equations.},

This makes the derived equations more physically realistic, as they overcome the infinite propagation velocity property of the Fourier law. This approach consists of adding the second strain gradient and the second volume fraction gradient field to the set of independent constituent variables. We then obtain a system of three second order time equations with higher gradient terms. Using semigroup theory, we show the well-posedness of the one-dimensional problem. By an approach based on the Gearhart–Herbst–Prüss–Huang theorem, we prove that the associated semigroup is exponentially stable but not differentiable. The lack of analyticity and the impossibility to localize the solutions in time are direct consequences.},

In addition, we introduce a forced convection to model any possible induced flow in the porous media. We depart from previously known models to further substantiate our driving equations. From a mathematical standpoint, our goal is to deepen in the understanding of the general behavior of solutions via analyzing their regularity, boundedness, and uniqueness.

For such nonlocal Hamiltonian systems, we show that they preserve the Liouville integrability and they can be linearized on the Jacobi variety. We also show how to construct the algebro-geometric solutions to the AKNS equation with space-inverse reductions by virtue of our nonlocal finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. As an application, algebro-geometric solutions to the AKNS equation with the Dirichlet and with the Neumann boundary conditions, and algebro-geometric solutions to the nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation are obtained. nonlocal finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian system, algebro-geometric solution, Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary, nonlocal NLS equation.},

We introduce the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices. The so called elementary Σ-matrices are ordinary matrix units, their sums are full Σ-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of σ -matrices. The expression of n -ary S U 2 in terms of full Σ-matrices is given using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted σ -matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order 4 q ( q &gt; 4), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite n -ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary Σ-matrices of order 4 q n − 1 + 1 ⁠ , and the finite n -ary group of phase-shifted full Σ-matrices of order 4 q .

  abstract     = {Elastic collisions of solitons generally have a finite phase shift. When the phase shift has a finitely large value, the two vertices of the (2 + 1)-dimensional two-soliton are significantly separated due to the phase shift, accompanied by the formation of a local structure connecting the two V-shaped solitons. We define this local structure as the stem structure. This study systematically investigates the localized stem structures between two solitons in the (2 + 1)-dimensional asymmetric Nizhnik–Novikov–Veselov system. These stem structures, arising from quasi-resonant collisions between the solitons, exhibit distinct features of spatial locality and temporal invariance. We explore two scenarios: one characterized by weakly quasi-resonant collisions (i.e. a 12 ≈ 0), and the other by strongly quasi-resonant collisions (i.e. a 12 ≈ + ∞ ). Through mathematical analysis, we extract comprehensive insights into the trajectories, amplitudes, and velocities of the soliton arms. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of the stem structures, including their length and extreme points. Our findings shed new light on the interaction between solitons in the (2 + 1)-dimensional asymmetric Nizhnik–Novikov–Veselov system.},

We have shown that NSVS is significantly different from any regular superposition of two SVSs. NSVS, like SVS, displays only even photons, but with different distributions. In some cases, NSVS has no vacuum state. NSVS displays sub-Poissonian statistics for small values of the squeezing parameter. NSVS reveals linear and amplitude-squared squeezing, with amplitude-squared squeezing surpassing SVS in most cases. The minimum uncertainty is explored, and a possible method for generating NSVS is explained. We have discovered that NSVS exhibits a similar behavior for all phase differences except when it equals precisely zero. This phenomenon has been identified and could potentially enable more sensitive measurements.},

The constructed family of coherent distributions is a complete analogue of the family of ordinary coherent states. More precisely, it satisfies all Gazeau–Klauder axioms satisfied by the usual coherent states. But in contrast to the coherent states belonging to the point spectrum of the annihilation operator (or operators), the coherent distributions belong to the continuous spectrum of some Hermitian operators. Therefore, the coherent distributions work better than the coherent states as the kernel of the integral representation of generalized eigenfunctions of operators with continuous spectrum. In this work, this approach is demonstrated with an example of solving a basic problem of quantum mechanics, i.e., the problem of the continuous part of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom.},

This is accomplished by showing that contact topological methods can be applied to reveal topological features of a class of solutions to Maxwell’s equations. This class of Maxwell fields is such that electric fields are parallel to magnetic fields. In addition these electromagnetic fields are composed of the so-called Beltrami fields. We employ several theorems resolving the Weinstein conjecture on closed manifolds with contact structures and stable Hamiltonian structures, where this conjecture refers to the existence of periodic orbits of the Reeb vector fields. Here a contact form is a special case of a stable Hamiltonian structure. After showing how to relate Reeb vector fields with electromagnetic 1-forms, we apply a theorem regarding contact manifolds and an improved theorem regarding stable Hamiltonian structures. Then a closed field line is shown to exist, where field lines are generated by Maxwell fields. In addition, electromagnetic energies are shown to be conserved along the Reeb vector fields.},

  abstract     = {We present a quasi-local, functional analytic method to locate and invariantly characterize the stationary limit surfaces of black hole spacetimes with stationary regions. The method is based on ellipticity-hyperbolicity transitions of the Dirac, Klein–Gordon, Maxwell, and Fierz–Pauli Hamiltonians defined on spacelike hypersurfaces of such black hole spacetimes, which occur only at the locations of stationary limit surfaces and can be ascertained from the behaviors of the principal symbols of the Hamiltonians. Therefore, since it relates solely to the effects that stationary limit surfaces have on the time evolutions of the corresponding elementary fermions and bosons, this method is profoundly different from the usual detection procedures that employ either scalar polynomial curvature invariants or Cartan invariants, which, in contrast, make use of the local geometries of the underlying black hole spacetimes. As an application, we determine the locations of the stationary limit surfaces of the Kerr–Newman, Schwarzschild–de Sitter, and Taub–NUT black hole spacetimes. Finally, we show that for black hole spacetimes with static regions, our functional analytic method serves as a quasi-local event horizon detector and gives rise to a relational concept of black hole entropy.},

The form of allowed regions for locally nonrotating observers as well as observers falling freely from infinity is established. The allowed regions contain rays which directly reach the horizon, or there exists a “neck” connecting the forbidden regions such that the rays coming from infinity cannot reach the horizon. In case we considered a set of observers at various radii instead of the neck we find two different regions – from one the rays reach the horizon and not infinity and from the other one they reach infinity, but not the horizon.

Our characterisation of G SM relies on the facts that projective pure spinors describe complex structures on R 10 ⁠ , and the product of two commuting complex structures is a what is known as a product structure.

Moreover we show that the local density approximation, in addition to capturing the bulk term exactly, also produces a correction of the correct order but not the correct size. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) corrections are found to be capable of capturing the surface term exactly, provided the gradient enhancement factor satisfies a simple explicit integral constraint. For current GGAs such as B88 and Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof we find that the new constraint is not satisfied and the size of the surface correction is overestimated by about ten percent. The new constraint might thus be of interest for the design of future exchange functionals.},

While the complexity of this problem is nontrivial due to its close connection to problems with known hardness results, a classical subpolynomial-time algorithm has recently been proposed [Fawzi et al. , 2022]. Combining several algorithmic techniques previously used for related problems, we propose an algorithm outperforming this result asymptotically and give rigorous bounds on its runtime. Our main techniques are the use of Araki expansionals, known from results on the nonexistence of phase transitions, and a matrix product operator construction. We also review a related approach using the Quantum Belief Propagation [Kuwahara et al. , 2018], which in combination with our findings yields an equivalent result.},

This construction is achieved through two equivalent ways: by means of the Plancherel Theorem and by identifying a Hilbert basis within L 2 ( M ) ⁠ . We analyze the existence of central extensions and identify those in duality with Hermitean operators on M ⁠ . By inspecting the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients of s l ( 2 , R ) ⁠ , we derive the Lie brackets characterising the corresponding generalised Kac-Moody algebras. The root structure of these algebras is identified, and it is shown that an infinite number of simultaneously commuting operators can be defined. Furthermore, we briefly touch upon applications of these algebras within the realm of supergravity, particularly in scenarios where the scalar fields coordinatize the non-compact manifold SL ( 2 , R ) / U ( 1 ) ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {This paper mainly deals with the (non)existence, asymptotic behaviors and uniqueness of traveling waves to a nonlocal diffusion system with asymmetric kernels and delays for quasi-monotone case. The difference from some previous works is the asymmetry reflected in both diffusion and reaction terms, and this not only has an impact on the positivity of minimal wave speed and the wave profiles of traveling waves with the same speed spreading from the left and right of the x -axis, but also leads to some difficulties for the nonexistence and asymptotic behaviors of traveling waves, which are overcome by using new techniques. Thereby, the results for traveling waves of nonlocal diffusion equations with symmetric kernels and with (or without) delays are improved to equations with asymmetric kernels, and those conclusions for scalar equations and systems with Laplace diffusion and local nonlinearities are also generalized to the nonlocal case. Finally, some concrete applications and numerical simulations are shown to confirm our theoretical results.},

To do this, we linearize the viscous Burgers equation and show the existence and uniqueness of common boundary function for the associated initial-boundary problems. Jump discontinuity of the spatial derivative of the solution makes a key role in determining large time asymptotics to the solutions. The explicit representation of the common boundary function and its asymptotic behavior are discussed for a specific case of the jump discontinuity. Here, the common boundary is obtained in terms of Associated Legendre functions of the first and second kind. For the general case, asymptotic behavior of the common boundary of the associated initial-boundary problems is used to determine the large time asymptotics for the Cauchy problem to the viscous Burgers equation.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the global well-posedness of the Oberbeck–Boussinesq approximation for the unsteady motion of a drop in another bounded fluid separated by a closed interface with surface tension. We assume that the initial state of the drop is close to a ball B R with the same volume as the drop, and that the boundary of the drop is a small perturbation of the boundary of B R . To begin, we introduce the Hanzawa transformation with an added barycenter point to obtain the linearized Oberbeck–Boussinesq approximation in a fixed domain. From there, we establish time-weighted estimates of solutions for the shifted equation using maximal L p – L q regularities for the two-phase fluid motion of the linearized system, as obtained by Hao and Zhang [J. Differ. Equations 322 , 101–134 (2022)]. Using time decay estimates of the semigroup, we then obtain decay time-weighted estimates of solutions for the linearized problem. Additionally, we prove that these estimates are less than the sum of the initial value and its own square and cube by estimating the corresponding non-linear terms. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of solutions in the finite time interval (0, T ) was proven by Hao and Zhang [Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. 22 (7), 2099–2131 (2023)]. After that, we demonstrate that the solutions can be extended beyond T by analyzing the properties of the roots of algebraic equations.},

First, it is shown that the system is locally well-posed. For that purpose, the existence of classical solutions which are perturbation of constant states is established. Second, it is proved that in the particular case of subsonic equilibrium states, sufficiently small perturbations decay globally in time. In order to prove this stability property, the linearized system around the subsonic state is examined. Using an appropriately constructed compensating matrix symbol in the Fourier space, it is proved that solutions to the linear system decay globally in time, underlying a dissipative mechanism of regularity gain type. These linear decay estimates, together with the local existence result, imply the global existence and the decay of perturbations to constant subsonic equilibrium states as solutions to the full nonlinear system.},

The most non-trivial part of this topic is the Novikov problem, namely, the problem of classifying non-closed trajectories for particles with an arbitrary dispersion relation in presence of a magnetic field. Here we will try to review both the classical results obtained in the study of this problem and the most recent results related to its most difficult part. At the same time, the study of electron dynamics on the Fermi surface can also be carried out in a more general setting, namely, as the study of the topology of the corresponding dynamical system and the physical phenomena associated with it. This approach is actually related to the Novikov problem, but includes the study of a wider range of issues, as well as a wider range of experimentally observed phenomena. Here we will try to describe a number of general principles relating changes in the topological pattern of trajectories on the Fermi surface to the observed phenomena in strong magnetic fields. We also note here that the study of the described effects can be quite informative for the experimental study of dispersion relations in conductors.},

  abstract     = {We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups – people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.},

Our approach bypasses an inherent problem in the standard arithmetic decomposition, namely, the fluctuating conformation tensor fields may not be positive definite and hence, do not retain their physical meaning. Using well-established results in matrix analysis, the space of positive definite matrices is transformed into a Riemannian manifold by defining and constructing a geodesic via the inner product on its tangent space. This geodesic is utilized to define three scalar invariants of the structure tensor, which do not suffer from the caveats of the regular invariants (such as trace and determinant) of the polymer conformation tensor. First, we consider the problem of formulating perturbative expansions of the structure tensor using the geodesic, which is consistent with the Riemannian manifold geometry. A constraint on the maximum time, during which the evolution of the perturbative solution can be well approximated by linear theory along the Euclidean manifold, is found. A comparison between the linear and the nonlinear dynamics, identifies the role of nonlinearities in initiating the symmetry breaking of the flow variables about the centerline. Finally, fully nonlinear simulations of the viscoelastic sub-diffusive channel flows, underscore the advantage of using these invariants in effectively quantifying the macrostructures.},

Here we present the noncompact analog of this construction via AdS 3 ≅ SU(1, 1).

This yields a two-parameter family of exact SU(1,1) Yang–Mills solutions on Minkowski space, whose field strengths are essentially rational functions of Cartesian coordinates. Gluing the two AdS copies happens on a dS 3 hyperboloid in Minkowski space, and our Yang–Mills configurations are singular on a two-dimensional hyperboloid d S 3 ∩ R 1 , 2 ⁠ . This renders their action and the energy infinite, although the field strengths fall off fast asymptotically except along the lightcone. We also construct Abelian solutions, which share these properties but are less symmetric and of zero action.},

Uniqueness of the forward/backward evolution of the discrete model is demonstrated in terms of the single-valuedness of the Lambert W function on the positive real axis. Furthermore, the exact solution to the continuous SIR model with vaccination is constructed via the integrable discretization. When applied to the original SIR model, the discretization procedure leads to two kinds of integrable discretization, and the exact solution to the continuous SIR model is also deduced. It is furthermore shown that the discrete SIR model geometrically linearizes the time evolution by using the non-autonomous parallel translation of the line intersecting the invariant curve.},

In the case of non-vanishing torsion in a four dimensional Riemann-Cartan geometry, the Minkowski geometry is the only geometry admitting ten affine frame symmetries. Excluding this geometry, the maximal number of affine frame symmetries is seven. A natural question is to ask what four dimensional geometries admit a seven-dimensional group of affine frame symmetries. Such geometries are locally homogeneous and admit the largest isotropy group permitted, and hence are called maximally isotropic. Using the symmetry frame formalism to compute affine frame symmetries along with the additional structure of the torsion tensor, we employ the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to determine all possible seven-dimensional symmetry groups for Riemann-Cartan geometries.},

We prove that the existence of a C *-strategy, the existence of a quantum commuting strategy, and the existence of a classical strategy are all equivalent for bisynchronous transitive games.

  abstract     = {The Kirkwood–Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution can describe any quantum state with respect to the eigenbases of two observables A and B . KD distributions behave similarly to classical joint probability distributions but can assume negative and nonreal values. In recent years, KD distributions have proven instrumental in mapping out nonclassical phenomena and quantum advantages. These quantum features have been connected to nonpositive entries of KD distributions. Consequently, it is important to understand the geometry of the KD-positive and -nonpositive states. Until now, there has been no thorough analysis of the KD positivity of mixed states. Here, we investigate the dependence of the full convex set of states with positive KD distributions on the eigenbases of A and B and on the dimension d of the Hilbert space. In particular, we identify three regimes where convex combinations of the eigenprojectors of A and B constitute the only KD-positive states: (i) any system in dimension 2; (ii) an open and dense probability one set of bases in dimension d = 3; and (iii) the discrete-Fourier-transform bases in prime dimension. Finally, we show that, if for example d = 2 m , there exist, for suitable choices of A and B , mixed KD-positive states that cannot be written as convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We further explicitly construct such states for a spin-1 system.},

The main novelty of our approach is to show that the relative perturbations, which are first order differential operators, can be factorized in suitably chosen auxiliary spaces. This allows us to derive the desired asymptotic expansions of the resolvents around zero. We then calculate their leading and sub-leading terms explicitly. Analogous factorization schemes for more general perturbations, including e.g. finite rank perturbations, are discussed as well.},

An apparently unrelated system, the relativistic Toda lattice, has been extensively studied in the context of complex nonlinear dynamics, and more recently for its connection to supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and topological string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-energy physics. Here we discuss a recently discovered spectral relationship between the Hofstadter model and the relativistic Toda lattice which has been later conjectured to be related to the Langlands duality of quantum groups. Moreover, by employing similarity transformations compatible with the quantum group structure, we establish a formula parametrizing the energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The main tools used are the spectral duality of tridiagonal matrices and the representation theory of the elementary quantum group.},

We solve the Riemann problem by constructing the regions in ( p , u , s ) coordinate system. Then we obtain the limiting behaviors of the Riemann solutions and the formation of δ -shock waves and vacuum as pressure vanishes. We conclude that, as pressure vanishes, the limit of Riemann solutions is the Riemann solutions of the reduced 2-dimensional pressureless gas dynamics model. Finally, we present numerical simulations which are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

We demonstrate that, under unrestricted reconfigurations of the internal structures of the seed resonators, the dynamical matrices of the materials generate the full self-adjoint sector of the stabilized group C *-algebra of the frieze group. As a consequence, in applications where the positions, orientations and internal structures of the seed resonators are adiabatically modified, the spectral bands of the dynamical matrices carry a complete set of topological invariants that are fully accounted by the K-theory of the mentioned algebra. By resolving the generators of the K-theory, we produce the model dynamical matrices that carry the elementary topological charges, which we implement with systems of plate resonators to showcase several applications in spectral engineering.

Taking the approach of Kiessling, we rigorously derive the expression for the force on the particle from the principle of total energy-momentum conservation. We provide a simple, closed form for the particle’s self-action, and show that it is restorative in this model, i.e. proportional to negative velocity, and causes the charge to return to rest after the radiation passes through. We establish these results by studying the joint evolution problem for the particle-scalar field system, and proving its global well-posedness and the claimed asymptotic behavior.},

  abstract     = {In a well-known result [R. Werner, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34 (35), 7081 (2001)], Werner classified all tight quantum teleportation and dense coding schemes, showing that they correspond to unitary error bases . Here tightness is a certain dimensional restriction: the quantum system to be teleported and the entangled resource must be of dimension d , and the measurement must have d 2 outcomes. Here we generalise this classification so as to remove the dimensional restriction altogether, thereby resolving an open problem raised in that work. In fact, we classify not just teleportation and dense coding schemes, but entanglement-reversible channels . These are channels between finite-dimensional C *-algebras which are reversible with the aid of an entangled resource state, generalising ordinary reversibility of a channel. We show that such channels correspond to families of linear maps which are bi-isometric with respect to a duality defined by the resource state. In particular, in Werner’s classification, a bijective correspondence between tight teleportation and dense coding schemes was shown: swapping Alice and Bob’s operations turns a teleportation scheme into a dense coding scheme and vice versa. We observe that this property generalises ordinary invertibility of a channel; we call it entanglement-invertibility . We show that entanglement-invertible channels are precisely the quantum bijections previously studied in noncommutative topology [B. Musto et al. , J. Math. Phys. 59 (8), 081706 (2018)], and therefore admit a classification in terms of Wang’s quantum permutation group [S. Wang, Commun. Math. Phys. 195 , 195–211 (1998)].},

This quantity, which we call Mutual Averaged Non-commutativity (MAN), is a simple generalization of a type of averaged Out-of-Time-Order-Correlators used in the study of quantum scrambling and chaos. MAN is defined by a Haar averaged squared norm of a commutator and for some types of algebras is manifestly of entropic nature. In particular, when the two algebras coincide the corresponding self-MAN can be fully computed in terms of the structural data of the associated Hilbert space decomposition. Properties and bounds of MAN are established in general and several concrete examples are discussed. Remarkably, for an important class of algebras, —which includes factors and maximal Abelian ones—MAN can be expressed in the terms of the algebras projections CP-maps. Assuming that the latter can be enacted as physical processes, one can devise operational protocols to directly estimate the MAN of a pair of algebras.},

Both the stability estimates improve as the upper bound of the wavenumber increases, which exhibit the phenomenon of increased stability. Second, we obtain the uniqueness of recovering both A and V by partial far-field data. The analysis employs scattering theory to obtain an analytic domain and an upper bound for the resolvent of the fourth order elliptic operator. Notice that due to an obstruction to uniqueness, the corresponding results do not hold in general for the Laplacian, i.e., Δ + A · ∇ + V . This can be explained by the fact that the resolvent of the biharmonic operator enjoys a faster decay estimate with respect to the wavenumber compared with the Laplacian.},

  abstract     = {We study quantum mechanics on the limiting case of a highly curved wire by approximating the physics around the curved region by three boundary condition parameters coming from the two-interval Sturm-Liouville theory. Since the geometric potential in this case is strong and non-integrable, these parameters depend crucially on the regularization of the curve. Hence, unless we know precisely the shape of the curve, any physical prediction is meaningless. In this context, the method presented in this paper becomes not only a useful approximation, but also a necessary scheme to deal with quantum mechanics on highly curved wires and (possibly) corners.},

This problem is motivated by the fact that, by the asymptotics of the local Weyl law, approximate Laplace eigenfunctions do have this approximation property on any compact Riemannian manifold. In this paper we are specifically interested in the Coulomb and harmonic oscillator operators on the hyperbolic spaces H d ( κ ) ⁠ . As the dimension of the space of bound states of these operators tends to infinity as κ ↘ 0, one can hope to approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation by eigenfunctions for some κ &gt; 0 that is not fixed a priori . Our main result shows that this is indeed the case, under suitable hypotheses. We also prove a global approximation theorem with decay for the Helmholtz equation on manifolds that are isometric to the hyperbolic space outside a compact set, and consider an application to the study of the heat equation on H d ( κ ) ⁠ . Although global approximation and inverse approximation results are heuristically related in that both theorems explore flexibility properties of solutions to elliptic equations on hyperbolic spaces, we will see that the underlying ideas behind these theorems are very different.},

We extend the geometric picture to the space of density matrices D N + ⁠ . We find it is not symplectic but admits a linear s u ( N ) Poisson structure. We identify Casimir surfaces of D N + and show that the space of pure states P N ≡ C P N − 1 is one of its symplectic submanifolds which is an intersection of primitive Casimirs. We identify generic symplectic submanifolds of D N + and calculate their dimensions. We find that D N + is singularly foliated by the symplectic leaves of varying dimensions, also known as coadjoint orbits. We also find an ascending chain of Poisson submanifolds D N M ⊂ D N M + 1 for 1 ≤ M ≤ N − 1. Each such Poisson submanifold D N M is obtained by tracing out the C M states from the bipartite system C N × C M and is an intersection of N − M primitive Casimirs of D N + ⁠ . Their Poisson structure is induced from the symplectic structure of the bipartite system. We also show their foliations.

  abstract     = {The Cosserat solid is a theoretical model of a continuum whose elementary constituents are notional rigid bodies, having both positional and orientational degrees of freedom. In this article, we present a differential geometric formulation of the mechanics of a Cosserat solid, motivated by Schaefer’s “motor field” theory. The solid is modeled as a special principal fiber bundle (a Cartan space) and its configurations are related by bundle maps. We show that the classical Lagrangian strain measure of a Cosserat solid is the difference of two Cartan connections on the bundle. The infinitesimal strain is derived by a rigorous linearization and is revealed to be the Lie derivative of a Cartan connection along the vector field representing the infinitesimal deformation. Incompatibilities in a Cosserat solid are characterised by a non-flat Cartan connection whose curvature is recognized as the density of topological defects. Stresses are defined as vector bundle-valued differential forms that are work-dual to strains and balance laws in the limit of vanishing inertia are obtained via a d’Alembert principle. Constitutive equations, with an emphasis on recent applications to active oriented solids, are briefly discussed.},

Given a braided algebra in a braided monoidal 2-category, it is possible to refine the notion of right module to that of a local module. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the 2-category of local modules admits a braided monoidal structure. In addition, if the braided monoidal 2-category has duals, we go on to show that the 2-category of local modules also has duals. Furthermore, if it is a braided fusion 2-category, we establish that the 2-category of local modules is a braided multifusion 2-category. We examine various examples. For instance, working within the 2-category of 2-vector spaces, we find that the notion of local module recovers that of braided module 1-category. Finally, we examine the concept of a Lagrangian algebra, that is a braided algebra with trivial 2-category of local modules. In particular, we completely describe Lagrangian algebras in the Drinfeld centers of fusion 2-categories, and we discuss how this result is related to the classifications of topological boundaries of (3 + 1)d topological phases of matter.},

This system, as a two-component generalization of the Novikov equation, is a completely integrable system which has Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian structure. Interestingly, it admits the two-component peaked solitons with different phases, which are the weak solutions in the sense of distribution and lie in the energy space H 1 × H 1 . It is shown that the peakons are asymptotically stable in the energy space H 1 × H 1 with non-negative momentum density by establishing a rigidity theorem for H 1 × H 1 -almost localized solutions. Our proof generalizes the arguments for studying the Camassa-Holm and Novikov equations. There are three new ingredients in our proof. One is a new characteristic describing interaction of the two-components; the second is new additional conserved densities for establishing the main inequalities; while the third one is a new Lyapunov functional used to overcome the difficulty caused by the loss of momentum.},

The solutions are obtained in fully explicit formulas, in a convenient space of distributions, without using any result within the classical framework. For such purpose we use the α -solution concept which is defined within a product of distributions. Such a concept generalizes the classical solution concept and for evolution equations may also be seen as an extension of the weak solution concept to the nonlinear setting.},

We establish a number of results pertaining to RCFTs in “small” genera, by which we informally mean genera with the central charge c and the number of primary operators r a n k ( C ) both not too large. We start by completely solving the modular bootstrap problem for theories with at most four primary operators. In particular, we characterize, and provide an algorithm which efficiently computes, the function spaces to which the partition function of any bosonic RCFT with r a n k ( C ) ≤ 4 must belong. Using this result, and leveraging relationships between RCFTs and holomorphic vertex operator algebras which come from “gluing” and cosets, we rigorously enumerate all bosonic theories in 95 of the 105 genera ( c , C ) with c ≤ 24 and r a n k ( C ) ≤ 4 ⁠ . This includes as (new) special cases the classification of chiral algebras with three primaries and c &lt; 120/7 ∼ 17.14, and the classification of chiral algebras with four primaries and c &lt; 62/3 ∼ 20.67. We then study two applications of our classification. First, by making use of chiral versions of bosonization and fermionization, we obtain the complete list of purely left-moving fermionic RCFTs with c &lt; 23 as a corollary of the results of the previous paragraph. Second, using a (conjectural) concept which we call “symmetry/subalgebra duality,” we precisely relate our bosonic classification to the problem of determining certain generalized global symmetries of holomorphic vertex operator algebras.},

In the context of the semiclassical approximation of quantum mechanics, projection operators can be seen as the analogue of characteristic functions of subsets of the phase space, which are discontinuous functions. We prove that projection operators indeed converge to characteristic functions of the phase space and that in terms of quantum Sobolev spaces, they exhibit the same maximal regularity as characteristic functions. This can be interpreted as a semiclassical asymptotic on the size of commutators in Schatten norms. Our study answers a question raised in Chong et al. [J. Eur. Math. Soc.

  abstract     = {With the help of the generalized Peres–Horodecki separability criterion (Simon’s condition) for a bipartite Gaussian state, we have studied the separability of the noncommutative (NC) space coordinate degrees of freedom. Non-symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space and NC space restricts the straightforward use of Simon’s condition in NCS. We have transformed the NCS system to an equivalent Hamiltonian in commutative space through the Bopp shift, which enables the utilization of the separability criterion. To make our study fairly general and to analyze the effect of parameters on the separability of bipartite state in NC-space, we have considered a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters, along with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The system is transformed ( S p ( 4 , R ) ) into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic structure intact. The solution of the TD-Schrödinger equation is obtained with the help of the Lewis–Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM). Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix) are constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence of the NC parameters in the oscillator determines the separability of the states. In particular, for isotropic oscillators, the separability condition for the bipartite Gaussian states depends on specific values of NC parameters. Moreover, particular anisotropic parameter values for the oscillator may cease the separability. In other words, both the deformation parameters ( θ , η ) and parameter values of the oscillator (mass, frequency) are important characteristics for the separability of bipartite Gaussian states. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the separability of states. With the help of a toy model, we have demonstrated how the tuning of a TD-NC space parameter affects the separability.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics has led to rapid progress in the methods of constructing inner products and determining the observables of the theory in quantum sciences. In this paper, we introduce metric controlled operator-valued frames and our motivation is to find the applications in the generalized setting of quantum mechanics. We give various characterizations of metric controlled operator-valued frames. We also explore various spectral properties of pseudo-Hermitian and pseudo-unitary operators. Finally, we give the method of representing infinte quantum channels in pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics using metric controlled operator-valued frames.},

  abstract     = {From the general inverse theory of periodic Jacobi matrices, it is known that a periodic Jacobi matrix of minimal period p ≥ 2 may have at most p − 2 closed spectral gaps. We discuss the maximal number of closed gaps for one-dimensional periodic discrete Schrödinger operators of period p ⁠ . We prove nontrivial upper and lower bounds on this quantity for large p and compute it exactly for p ≤ 6 ⁠ . Among our results, we show that a discrete Schrödinger operator of period four or five may have at most a single closed gap, and we characterize exactly which potentials may exhibit a closed gap. For period six, we show that at most two gaps may close. In all cases in which the maximal number of closed gaps is computed, it is seen to be strictly smaller than p − 2 ⁠ , the bound guaranteed by the inverse theory. We also discuss similar results for purely off-diagonal Jacobi matrices.},

Namely, time-components of the pullback attractors semi-converge to the global attractors of the corresponding limiting semigroups as the time-parameter goes to negative infinity. The present article is divided into two parts: theories and applications. In the theoretical part, we establish a sufficient and necessary criterion with respect to the backward asymptotic autonomy via backward compactness of pullback attractors. Moreover, this backward asymptotic autonomy is considered by the periodicity of pullback attractors. As for the applications part, we apply the abstract results to non-autonomous retarded sine-Gordon lattice systems. By backward uniform tail-estimates of solutions, we prove the existence of a pullback and global attractor for such lattice systems such that the backward asymptotic autonomy is satisfied. Furthermore, it is also fulfilled under the assumptions of the periodicity for the non-delay forcing and the convergence for processes.},

While the solution will blowup in the sense of some averaged quantity if the expanding rate is not fast enough.

For the KPI equation, the constraint method is an effective tool for generating solitonic or rational solutions from the solutions of lower-dimensional integrable systems. In this work, various nonsingular, rational lump solutions of the KPI equation are constructed by employing the vector one-constraint method and the generalized Darboux transformation of the (1 + 1)-dimensional vector Ablowitz–Kaup–Newell–Segur system. Furthermore, we investigate the large-time asymptotic behavior of high-order lumps in detail and discover distinct types of patterns. These lump patterns correspond to the high-order rogue wave patterns of the (1 + 1)-dimensional vector integrable equation and are associated with root structures of generalized Wronskian–Hermite polynomials.},

Here j is a KR -cycle index, as well as an index counting off the Altland-Zirnbauer classification of Time Reversal Symmetry (TRS) and Particle Hole Symmetry (PHS)—as we show. In this setting, the computation of the invariants can be seen as the evaluation of the natural pairing between KR -cycles and KR -classes. This fits with topological and analytical index computations as well as with Poincaré Duality and the Baum–Connes isomorphism for free Abelian groups. We provide an introduction starting from the basic objects of real, complex and quaternionic structures which are the mathematical objects corresponding to TRS and PHS.

We consider a rotation operator to compare velocity vectors on different tangent spaces. Due to the geometric restriction, the rotation operator is singular at antipodal points and the relative velocity between two agents located at these points is not well-defined. We assume that the communication rate between two antipodal points is zero to establish a well-defined flocking operator. We obtain the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of the solution to the flocking model. From the geometric property of the sphere, it is difficult to control the position difference between agents to avoid this singular position without bonding force. With a positive bonding force, we present a sufficient condition for the emergence of flocking.},

A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang–Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang–Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang–Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang–Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.},

A novelty is that the Lagrangian is described by a d + 1 form on R d , 2 whose pullback to AdS d +1 gives the genuine Lagrangian defined on anti de Sitter spacetime. Our derivation uses the triplet formulation originating from the first-quantized BRST approach, where the action principle is determined by the BRST operator and the inner product of a first-quantised system. In this way we build, in a manifestly so (2, d )-covariant manner, a unifying action principle for the three types of fields mentioned above. In particular, our derivation justifies the form of some actions proposed earlier for massive and massless fields on (anti)-de Sitter. We also give a general setup for ambient Lagrangians in terms of the respective jet-bundles and variational bi-complexes. In particular we introduce a suitable ambient-space Euler–Lagrange differential which allows one to derive the equations of motion ambiently, i.e., without the need to explicitly derive the respective spacetime Lagrangian.},

  abstract     = {The symplectic eigenvalues play a significant role in the finite-mode quantum information theory, and Williamson’s normal form proves to be a valuable tool in this area. Understanding the symplectic spectrum of a Gaussian Covariance Operator is a crucial task. Recently, in 2018, an infinite-dimensional analogue of Williamson’s Normal form was discovered, which has been instrumental in studying the infinite-mode Gaussian quantum states. However, most existing results pertain to finite-dimensional operators, leaving a dearth of literature in the infinite-dimensional context. The focus of this article is on employing approximation techniques to estimate the symplectic spectrum of certain infinite-dimensional operators. These techniques are well-suited for a particular class of operators, including specific types of infinite-mode Gaussian Covariance Operators. Our approach involves computing the Williamson’s Normal form and deriving bounds for the symplectic spectrum of these operators. As a practical application, we explicitly compute the symplectic spectrum of Gaussian Covariance Operators. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the understanding of symplectic eigenvalues in the context of infinite-dimensional operators, opening new avenues for exploration in quantum information theory and related fields.},

Although the potential term is not an ordinary function, but a distribution, it is possible to realize H ω as a symmetric operator in L 2 ([0, ∞); dt ) as was pointed out by the present author [Minami, Lect. Notes Math. 1299 , 298 (1986)], and it will be shown that H ω is actually self-adjoint with probability one. When the white noise in H ω is replaced by random functions of a specific type, [Kotani and Ushiroya, Commun. Math. Phys. 115 , 247 (1988)] made a precise analysis of the positive part of the spectrum. According to them, if the decaying factor is not square integrable, the positive part of the spectrum typically consists of singular continuous and dense pure-point parts, which are separated by a threshold number. On the other hand, the positive part of the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous when the decaying factor is square integrable. In this work, we shall focus on the case of square integrable decaying factor, and prove the absolute continuity of the positive part of the spectrum of H ω ⁠ . We shall further prove that the negative part of the spectrum of H ω is discrete, with no accumulation points other than 0.},

  abstract     = {A 2006 conjecture of Antunes and Freitas is addressed connecting the scaling-invariant polygonal isoperimetric and principal frequency deficits for triangles. This yields a quantitative polygonal Faber–Krahn inequality for triangles with an explicit constant. Furthermore, a problem mentioned in the 1951 book “Isoperimetric Inequalities In Mathematical Physics” by Pólya and Szegö is addressed: a formula is given for the principal frequency of a triangle. Moreover, a space of polygons is constructed for the classical Pólya and Szegö problem: in 1947, Pólya proved that if n = 3, 4 the regular polygon P n minimizes the principal frequency of an n-gon with given area α &gt; 0 and suggested that the same holds when n ≥ 5. In 1951, Pólya and Szegö discussed the possibility of counterexamples. This paper constructs explicit (2 n − 4)–dimensional polygonal manifolds M ( n , α ) and proves the existence of a computable N ≥ 5 such that for all n ≥ N , the admissible n -gons are given via M ( n , α ) and there exists an explicit set A n ( α ) ⊂ M ( n , α ) such that P n has the smallest principal frequency among n -gons in A n ( α ) ⁠ . Inter-alia when n ≥ 3, a formula is proved for the principal frequency of a convex P ∈ M ( n , α ) in terms of an equilateral n -gon with the same area; and, the set of equilateral polygons is proved to be an ( n − 3)–dimensional submanifold of the (2 n − 4)–dimensional manifold M ( n , α ) near P n . The techniques involve a partial symmetrization, tensor calculus, the spectral theory of circulant matrices, and W 2, p / BMO estimates. Last, an application is given in the context of electron bubbles.},

In this paper, we clarify the geometric conditions on X , which guarantee triviality of the K -theory class of any Wannier projection. We show that this property is equivalent to triviality of the unit of the uniform Roe algebra of D in the K -theory of its Roe algebra, and provide a geometric criterion for that. As a consequence, we prove triviality of the K -theory class of any Wannier projection on a connected proper measure space X of bounded geometry with a uniformly discrete set of localization centers.},

We find that for any noninteger value of K the Q ν − 1 / 2 − K ( cosh ⁡ ρ ) have an infinite number of poles in the complex ν plane, but for any negative integer K there are no poles at all. For K = 0 or any positive integer K there is only a finite number of poles, with there only being one single pole (at ν = 0) when K = 0. This pattern is analogous to the pattern of exceptional points that appear in a wide variety of physical contexts. However, while theories with exceptional points usually lose a finite number of degrees of freedom at the exceptional points, the Q ν − 1 / 2 − K ( cosh ⁡ ρ ) lose an infinite number of poles whenever K is integer. Moreover, while theories with exceptional points usually have a finite number of such exceptional points, the Q ν − 1 / 2 − K ( cosh ⁡ ρ ) possess an infinite number of points (all integer K ) at which they lose degrees of freedom. Other than in the PT -symmetry Jordan-block case, exceptional points usually occur at complex values of parameters. While not being Jordan-block exceptional points themselves, the poles associated with the Q ν − 1 / 2 − K ( cosh ⁡ ρ ) nonetheless occur at real values of K .},

  abstract     = {We investigate Gaussian Laplacian eigenfunctions (Arithmetic Random Waves) on the three-dimensional standard flat torus, in particular the asymptotic distribution of the nodal intersection length against a fixed regular reference surface. Expectation and variance have been addressed by Maffucci [Ann. Henri Poincaré 20 (11), 3651–3691 (2019)] who found that the expected length is proportional to the square root of the eigenvalue times the area of the surface, while the asymptotic variance only depends on the geometry of the surface, the projected lattice points being equidistributed on the two-dimensional unit sphere in the high-energy limit. He also noticed that there are “special” surfaces, so-called static, for which the variance is of smaller order; however he did not prescribe the precise asymptotic law in this case. In this paper, we study second order fluctuations of the nodal intersection length. Our first main result is a Central Limit Theorem for “generic” surfaces, while for static ones, a sphere or a hemisphere e.g., our main results are a non-Central Limit Theorem and a precise asymptotic law for the variance of the nodal intersection length, conditioned on the existence of so-called well-separated sequences of Laplacian eigenvalues. It turns out that, in this regime, the nodal area investigated by Cammarota [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 372 (5), 3539–3564 (2019)] is asymptotically fully correlated with the length of the nodal intersections against any sphere. The main ingredients for our proofs are the Kac-Rice formula for moments, the chaotic decomposition for square integrable functionals of Gaussian fields, and some arithmetic estimates that may be of independent interest.},

The potential is recovered from an arithmetic combination of the first two coefficients. Special cases of the considered problems include the recovery of the potential from a Weyl function, inverse two-spectrum Sturm–Liouville problems, as well as the inverse scattering problem on a finite interval.

For our considered Dirac-type operators, two inverse spectral problems are studied. Specifically, reconstruction of two complex L 2 -potentials is studied from complete spectra of two boundary value problems with one common boundary condition y 1 (0) = 0 or y 2 (0) = 0. We give answers to the full range of questions usually raised in the inverse spectral theory. That is, we give uniqueness, necessary and sufficient conditions of the solvability, reconstruction algorithm and uniform stability for our considered inverse problems.},

We analyze the validity of this conjecture using Friedrich’s formulation of spatial infinity, which gives rise to a regular initial value problem for the conformal field equations at spatial infinity. A central structure in this analysis is the cylinder at spatial infinity I representing a blow-up of the standard spatial infinity point i 0 to a 2-sphere. The cylinder I touches past and future null infinities I ± at the critical sets I ± ⁠ . We show that for a generic class of asymptotically Euclidean and regular initial data, BMS-supertranslation charges are not well-defined at I ± unless the initial data satisfies an extra regularity condition. We also show that given initial data that satisfy the regularity condition, BMS-supertranslation charges at I ± are fully determined by the initial data and that the relation between the charges at I − and those at I + directly follows from our regularity condition.},

In the so-called cyclic-melonic potential approximation of a tensorial field theory on the r -dimensional torus it was recently shown using functional renormalization group techniques that no such phase transition to a condensate phase with a tentative continuum geometric interpretation is possible. Here, keeping the same approximation, we show how to overcome this limitation amending the theory by local degrees freedom on R d ⁠ . We find that the effective r − 1 dimensions of the torus part dynamically vanish along the renormalization group flow while the d local dimensions persist up to small momentum scales. Consequently, for d &gt; 2 one can find a phase structure allowing also for phase transitions.},

Known methods for obtaining certificates on the ground energy typically use consistency of local observables and are expressed as semidefinite programming relaxations. The local marginals defined by such a relaxation do not necessarily satisfy entropy inequalities that follow from the existence of a global state. Here, we propose to add such entropy constraints that lead to tighter convex relaxations for the ground energy problem. We give analytical and numerical results illustrating the advantages of such entropy constraints. We also show limitations of the entropy constraints we construct: they are implied by doubling the number of sites in the relaxation and as a result they can at best lead to a quadratic improvement in terms of the matrix sizes of the variables. We explain the relation to a method for approximating the free energy known as the Markov Entropy Decomposition method.},

In doing so, we allow collapse dynamics to be governed intrinsically by the Markovian statistics of LRBs. The framework can host progressively convoluted stochastic state reduction dynamics in a tractable way and encapsulates jump-diffusion Schrödinger evolutions by use of the Lévy-Itô decomposition.

A compatible O -operator is a pair consisting of two O -operators satisfying a compatibility relation. A compatible O -operator algebra is an algebra together with a bimodule and a compatible O -operator. In this paper, we construct a graded Lie algebra and an L ∞ -algebra that respectively characterize compatible O -operators and compatible O -operator algebras as Maurer–Cartan elements. Using these characterizations, we define cohomology of these structures and as applications, we study formal deformations of compatible O -operators and compatible O -operator algebras. Finally, we consider a brief cohomological study of compatible dendriform algebras and find their relationship with the cohomology of compatible associative algebras and compatible O -operators.},

Moreover, the appearance of the logarithmic term makes the associated energy functional lose differentiable in the sense of Gateaux. By analyzing the structure of the Nehari manifold and developing some analysis techniques, the above obstacles are overcome in subtle ways and several existence result are obtained. Furthermore, we investigate the regularity, the monotonicity, and the symmetric properties of the solutions via the iterative technique and the moving plane method.},

By integrating the Einstein equations, we obtain an equivalent form to the sources, which is a nonlinear elliptic equation with singularities and complicated exponential terms. We prove the existence of a solution governing strings in the broken symmetry category on the whole plane, and the multiple string solutions are valid under a sufficient condition imposed only on the total number of strings. The technique of upper–lower solutions and the method of regularization are employed to show the existence of a solution when there are at least two distant string centers. When all the string centers are identical, a fixed-point theorem is used to study the properties of the nonlinear elliptic equation. Finally, we establish the sharp asymptotic estimate for the solutions at infinity and derive the dependence of the total gravitational curvature on the string number.},

Resorting to the character expansion as put forward by Balantekin, we derive explicit determinantal formulae containing Kummer’s confluent and Gauß’ hypergeometric function. They depend only on the eigenvalues of the deterministic matrices and are analytic in the parameters of the jump singularities. Furthermore, unitary two-matrix integrals of the same type are proposed and solved in the same manner. When making part of the deterministic matrices random and integrating over them, we obtain similar formulae in terms of Pfaffian determinants. This is reminiscent to a unitary group integral found recently by Kanazawa and Kieburg [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 51 (34), 345202 (2018)].},

  abstract     = {The probability density is a fundamental quantity for characterizing diffusion processes. However, it is seldom known except in a few renowned cases, including Brownian motion and the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and their bridges, geometric Brownian motion, Brownian excursion, or Bessel processes. In this paper, we utilize Girsanov’s theorem, along with a variation of the method of images, to derive the exact expression of the probability density for diffusions that have one entrance boundary. Our analysis encompasses numerous families of conditioned diffusions, including the Taboo process and Brownian motion conditioned on its growth behavior, as well as the drifted Brownian meander and generalized Brownian excursion.},

  abstract     = {The problem of computing the rate of diffusion-aided activated barrier crossings between metastable states is one of broad relevance in physical sciences. The transition path formalism aims to compute the rate of these events by analysing the statistical properties of the transition path between the two metastable regions concerned. In this paper, we show that the transition path process is a unique solution to an associated stochastic differential equation, with a discontinuous and singular drift term. The singularity arises from a local time contribution, which accounts for the fluctuations at the boundaries of the metastable regions. The presence of fluctuations at the local time scale calls for an excursion theoretic consideration of barrier crossing events. We show that the rate of such events, as computed from excursion theory, factorizes into a local time term and an excursion measure term, which bears empirical similarity to the transition state theory rate expression. Since excursion theory makes no assumption about the presence of a transition state in the potential energy landscape, the mathematical structure underlying this factorization ought to be general. We hence expect excursion theory (and local times) to provide some physical and mathematical insights in generic barrier crossing problems.},

Our results imply that analogous results hold for a number of related models including Dyson’s hierarchical Ising model, for which the double-exponential susceptibility growth we establish appears to be a new phenomenon even at the heuristic level.},

In the model, it is assumed that cholera has a fixed latent period and the latent individuals can diffuse, and a non-local term is incorporated to describe the mobility of individuals during the latent period. It is shown that the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions are fully determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 and the critical wave speed c *. Firstly, when R 0 &gt; 1 and the wave speed c &gt; c *, the existence of strong traveling waves is obtained by using Schauder’s fixed point theorem and Lyapunov functional approach. By employing a limiting argument, the existence of strong traveling waves is established when R 0 &gt; 1 and c = c *. Next, when R 0 ≤ 1 ⁠ , the nonexistence of traveling wave solutions is established by contradiction. Besides, when R 0 &gt; 1 and c &lt; c *, the nonexistence of traveling wave solutions is obtained by means of two-sided Laplace transform. This indicates that c * is indeed the minimal wave speed.

  abstract     = {In a previous work, we established perturbative renormalizability to all orders of the massive ϕ 4 4 -theory on a half-space also called the semi-infinite massive ϕ 4 4 -theory. Five counter-terms which are functions depending on the position in the space, were needed to make the theory finite. The aim of the present paper is to establish that for a particular choice of the renormalization conditions the effective action consists of a part which is independent of the boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin) plus a boundary term in the case of the Robin and Neumann boundary conditions. The key idea of our method is the decomposition of the correlators into a bulk part, which is defined as the scalar field model on the full space R 4 with a quartic interaction restricted to the half-space, plus a remainder which we call “the surface part.” We analyse this surface part and establish perturbatively that the ϕ 4 4 theory in R + × R 3 is made finite by adding the bulk counter-terms and two additional counter-terms to the bare interaction in the case of Robin and Neumann boundary conditions. These surface counter-terms are position independent and are proportional to ∫ S ϕ 2 and ∫ S ϕ∂ n ϕ . For Dirichlet boundary conditions, we prove that no surface counter-terms are needed and the bulk counter-terms are sufficient to renormalize the connected amputated (Dirichlet) Schwinger functions. A key technical novelty as compared to our previous work is a proof that the power counting of the surface part of the correlators is better by one scaling dimension than their bulk counterparts.},

The quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI) is investigated and proved to be bounded by a function proportional to exp(− q (| B | − K ) + 2 K ln | B |), with q and K computable constants. The properties of the bounding function are derived by a new approach, with a corresponding improved value given for its asymptotic decay rate q . We show the improved value of q to be optimal. Numerical investigations of the decay of QCMI are reported for a collection of matrix product states generated by selecting the defining isometry with respect to Haar measure.},

That is the Cauchy problem, i.e., we establish the analytical relation between the solutions r ( z , t ), r (− z , − t ) of the nonlocal cmKdV equation and the solution of a matrix RH problem. First, we analyze the eigenfunctions of the linear spectral problem of the nonlocal cmKdV equation. Second, we discuss the scattering matrix T ( ɛ ) and its spectral functions α 1 ( ɛ ), β ( ɛ ) and α 2 ( ɛ ) depending on the prescribed step-like initial value. Finally, we find that the solution of the Cauchy problem of the nonlocal cmKdV equation can be represented by the solution of the corresponding matrix RH problem.},

In this article, we reformulate the eigenproblem in terms of the ISOKANN framework, an iterative algorithm that learns the eigenfunctions by alternating between short burst simulations and a mixture of machine learning and classical numerics, which naturally leads to a proof of convergence. We furthermore show how the intermediate iterates can be used to reduce the sampling variance by importance sampling and optimal control (enhanced sampling), as well as to select locations for further training (adaptive sampling). We demonstrate the usage of our proposed method in experiments, increasing the approximation accuracy by several orders of magnitude.},

On the other hand, ever since the middle of the last century, it has been widely recognized that the climate variability exhibits long-time memory. In this paper, we first prove the global existence of weak solutions to the primitive equations of large-scale ocean and atmosphere dynamics with Caputo fractional time derivatives. Then we establish the existence of an absorbing set, which is positively invariant. Finally, an attractor (strictly speaking, the minimal attracting set containing all the limiting dynamics) is constructed for the time fractional primitive equations, which means that the present state of a system may have long-time influences on the states in far future. However, there was no work on the long-time behavior of the time fractional primitive equations and we fill this gap in this paper.},

Specifically, we prove that the strong solutions of Eq.

First we investigate the Born case for linearly polarized beams, E · B = 0, i.e., G 2 = 0 (crossed field configuration), which is identical for Born–Infeld and Born electrodynamics; subsequently we study the general Born–Infeld case for beams which are nonlinearly polarized, G 2 ≠ 0 ⁠ . In both cases, we show that the nonlinear field equations decouple using self-similar solutions and investigate the shock wave formation. We show that the only nonlinear solutions are exceptional traveling wave solutions which propagate with constant speed and which do not turn into shocks for our approximation. We obtain two types of exceptional wave solutions, then we numerically analyze which phase velocities correspond to the counter- or co-propagating beams and subsequently we determine the direction of propagation of the exceptional waves.},

Our model is a refinement of the axioms of general boundary quantum field theory, and is phrased in terms of correspondences between certain commuting diagrams of gluing identifications between manifolds and corresponding commuting diagrams of state-spaces and linear maps, thus making it amenable to formalization in terms of involutive symmetric monoidal functors and operad algebras. The underlying novel framework for gluing leads to equivariance of CQFT. We study CQFTs in dimension 2 and the algebraic structure they define on open and closed strings. We also consider, as a particular case, the compositional structure of 2-dimensional pure quantum Yang–Mills theory.},

We show that these two concepts are incompatible in the sense that the space of pure multiparticle singlet states does not contain any state for which all partitions of two particles vs the rest are maximally entangled. This puts restrictions on the construction of quantum codes and contributes to discussions in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence and quantum gravity.},

The new method is used to compute the Wigner distribution function exactly for such a semiconfinement quantum system.

For this quantum system, both the presence and absence of the applied external homogenous field are studied. Obtained exact expressions of the Wigner distribution function are expressed through the Bessel function of the first kind and Laguerre polynomials.

The key point is that the semiclassical path integral quantification around a particular solution depends on the variational equation around that solution: a very well-known object in dynamical systems and variational calculus. Then, as the variational equation is a linear ordinary differential system, it is possible to apply the Differential Galois Theory to study its solvability in closed form. We obtain closed form solutions for the semiclassical quantum fluctuations around constant velocity solutions for some systems like the classical Hermite/Verhulst, Bessel, Legendre, and Lamé potentials. We remark that some of the systems studied are not integrable, in the Liouville–Arnold sense.},

The difficulty of this problem comes from the ignorance of the exact Hamiltonian ruling the dynamic. In order to address this problem, we formulate an inverse problem consisting in determining the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from the knowledge of the state at some fixed finite time for each initial state. We focus on the simplest case where the Hamiltonian is given by −Δ + V , where the potential V = V ( t , x ) is non-compactly supported. Our main result is a uniqueness theorem, which establishes that the Hamiltonian ruling the dynamic of all quantum particles is determined by the prescription of the initial and final states of each particle. As a consequence, one expects to be able to know the state of any particle at any given time, without an a priori knowledge of the Hamiltonian just from the data consisting of the initial and final state of each particle.},

If m and l = max{ α , β } satisfy m &gt; max l ( n + 2 ) 2 , 1 ⁠ , then the system possesses a global classical solution, which is bounded in Ω × (0, ∞). Furthermore, it has been shown that such solution exponentially converges to equilibrium ( ( a b ) 1 m − 1 , 0 , 0 ) as t → ∞, where convergence rate can be formally characterized by the parameters of the system.},

  abstract     = {We consider a discrete non-linear Schrödinger equation on Z and show that, after adding a small potential localized in the time-frequency space, one can construct a three-parametric family of non-decaying spacetime quasiperiodic solutions to this equation. The proof is based on the Craig–Wayne–Bourgain method combined with recent techniques of dealing with Anderson localization for two-dimensional quasiperiodic operators with degenerate frequencies.},

First, we show that there exists a critical nozzle length L 1 , the global well-posedness of steady supersonic flows can be obtained and the explicit solution is given as long as the nozzle length L &lt; L 1 . Then we prove the global stability of steady supersonic flows under small perturbations of initial-boundary values by wave decomposition.},
