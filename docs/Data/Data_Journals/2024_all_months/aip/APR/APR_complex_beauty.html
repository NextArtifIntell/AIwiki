The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of blue μ LEDs decreases with size regardless of sidewall conditions, whereas that of red μ LEDs is insignificant due to carrier localization. Atomic probe tomography examination of 30%, 15%, and 7.5% indium-concentrated InGaN layers used in red μ LEDs shows that higher indium concentrations result in greater indium fluctuations, which promote carrier localization and thus shorten the diffusion length of carriers. Finally, by observing the peak wavelength of electroluminescence and the current density at peak EQE for both blue and red μ LEDs, we find that radiative recombination rate in μ LEDs is likely to be chip size dependent.},

  abstract     = {Switchability of materials properties by applying controlled stimuli such as voltage pulses is an emerging field of study with applicability in adaptive and programmable devices like neuromorphic transistors or non-emissive smart displays. One of the most exciting approaches to modulate materials performance is mobile ion/vacancy insertion for inducing changes in relevant electrical, optical, or magnetic properties, among others. Unveiling the interplay between changes in the concentration of mobile defects (like oxygen vacancies) and functional properties in relevant materials represents a step forward for underpinning the emerging oxide iontronics discipline. In this work, electrochemical oxide-ion solid-state pumping cells were fabricated for analog control of the oxygen stoichiometry in thin films of mixed ionic-electronic conductor La 0.5 Sr 0.5 FeO 3-δ . We demonstrate over more than four orders of magnitude electronic conductivity control at 50 °C within the same crystallographic phase through precise and continuous voltage control of the oxygen stoichiometry. We show that behind the modification of the transport properties of the material lays a paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic transition. We exploit such magnetoelectric coupling to show control over the exchange interaction between La 0.5 Sr 0.5 FeO 3-δ and a ferromagnetic Co layer deposited on top.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements in high-repetition-rate, high-average-power mid-infrared laser pulses have enabled the generation of tabletop high-flux coherent soft x-ray harmonics for photon-hungry experiments. However, for practical applications, it is crucial to effectively filter out the driving beam from the high harmonics. In this study, we leverage the distinctive properties of a Bessel–Gauss (BG) beam to introduce a novel approach for spatial filtering, specifically targeting soft x-ray harmonics, releasing with a high-photon flux simultaneously. Our simulations reveal that by finely adjusting the focus geometry and gas pressure, the BG beam naturally adopts an annular shape, emitting high harmonics with minimal divergence in the far field. To achieve complete spatial separation of the driving beam and harmonic emissions, we pinpoint the optimal gas pressure and focusing geometry, particularly under overdriven laser intensities, for achieving good phase matching of harmonic emissions from short-trajectory electrons within the gas medium when the exact ionization level is higher than the “critical” value. Additionally, we establish scaling relations for sustaining optimal phase-matching conditions crucial for spatially separating the driving laser and the high-harmonic field, especially as the wavelength of the driving laser increases. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a substantial enhancement of harmonic yields by at least one order of magnitude compared to a truncated Gaussian annular beam. We also show that under accessible experimental conditions, soft x-ray photon flux up to 10 10 photons/s at 250 eV can be achieved. The utilization of the BG beam opens up a promising pathway for the development of high-flux attosecond soft x-ray light sources, poised to serve a wide range of applications.},

Here, we propose an approach that integrates bioinspired pore design with mechanically guided magnetization, enabling programmable magnetoresponsive complex shapes with non-uniform and continuously adjustable curvatures. Various magnetoresponsive developable and non-developable surfaces, along with biomimetic 3D curved shapes, were prepared. The prepared SMSAs exhibit actuation rates of up to 20 s −1 . Furthermore, an inchworm-inspired soft crawling robot capable of steering, navigation, obstacle crossing, and cargo transportation was developed, achieving a locomotion speed of up to 1.2 body lengths per second. This work breaks through the design possibilities for SMSAs, enhances the actuation rates of soft actuators, and advances the application of SMSAs in soft crawling robots.},

Prior studies primarily focused on materials exhibiting out-of-plane or in-plane ferroelectric polarization, whose rotational degrees of freedom are commonly overlooked. Herein, we experimentally validate the existence of a weak yet symmetry-allowed in-plane polarization in the low-symmetry vdW ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6 by rigorous structural analysis and vectorial property characterizations. Remarkably, the magnitude of this in-plane polarization is tunable via an interface-induced electric field, leading to a significant contrast in second harmonic generation between oppositely polarized domains. Based on this unique rotational capability of electric polarization, we demonstrate an electrically tunable second-order optical emission in a fabricated vdW ferroelectric capacitor. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between crystal symmetry and tensorial physical properties, providing a novel pathway for manipulating nonlinear optical functionalities in vdW layered ferroelectrics.},

In this study, we introduce a scalable Bridgman crystal growth technique to synthesize large, environmentally stable single crystals of InSeI, achieving centimeter-sized chiral crystals with superior quality. Notably, this work marks the first report of photoluminescence (PL) emission from exfoliated InSeI chiral chains, alongside a detailed exploration of their polarization-dependent optical and phononic properties. Our Bridgman-grown crystals exhibit excellent structural integrity, enhanced exfoliation characteristics, and increased resistance to light-induced degradation compared to those produced by traditional solid-state methods. A microscopy analysis confirms the distinct chiral structure of InSeI, and the first in situ nanometer spatial resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements establish a bandgap of 2.08 eV, consistent with the cryogenic PL emission peak. Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, combined with calculated vibrational properties, identifies five distinct frequency regions in the Raman modes, predominantly associated with In-, In-I, In-Se-I, and Se-atomic motions, with significant intensity variations under different polarization orientations. This study not only offers a practical method for synthesizing high-quality InSeI but also provides the first comprehensive experimental insights into its unique optical and vibrational properties, significantly advancing the understanding of chiral material systems.},

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with atomically thin features and their derived heterostructures are able to allow for controlling local transfer of charge carrier but reports on 2D materials-enabled capacitive-type photoelectric synapses have not been experimentally exploited yet. Herein, MXene-TiO 2 heterostructured iontronic neural devices based on ion-dynamic capacitance enabling optoelectronic modulation are designed. According to the electrochemical insight, under UV light illustration, photoexcited electrons in TiO 2 flow to MXene, leading to the localized accumulation of electrons as the trapping center and thus inducing the embedding of H + for participating in the pseudo-intercalation. On removing the UV light, a part of trapped H + are not instantly returned to the initial state. As a result, this memcapacitor features hysteresis ion-dynamic capacitance under optoelectronic modulation. Through assessing its applicability to neuromorphic computing, this memcapacitor achieves the high recognition accuracy (93.5%) of handwritten digits by recognizing and sharpening the input signal trajectory.},

Here, we show a flexoelectric strategy in electrocatalytic water splitting. Remarkably enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are achieved in strain-gradient LaFeO 3 (LFO) thin-film heterostructures owing to the promotion of kinetic processes by P flexo . The improved OER is demonstrated by increased current density of ∼300% in linear sweep voltammetry and lowered charge transfer resistance by two orders of magnitude in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These are ascribed to the flexoelectric-induced downward bending of the LFO band, as revealed by density functional theory calculations and band structure measurements. With P flexo in the thin-film heterostructure catalysts, the adsorption of hydroxyl ions is strengthened on the polar LFO surface, and the transfer of electrons is accelerated from the reactants/key intermediates to the catalyst across the band-tilted LFO layer. These findings indicate the significance of flexoelectric effect in OER kinetics and open a new perspective for exploiting catalytic mechanisms and performances in water splitting.},

Here, we explore the device physics of perovskite LEDs using simple analytical and drift-diffusion modeling, aiming to understand how the distribution of electric field, carrier densities, and recombination in these devices differs from those assumed in other technologies such as organic LEDs. High barriers to electron and hole extraction are responsible for the efficient recombination and lead to sharp build-up of electrons and holes close to the electron- and hole-blocking barriers, respectively. Despite the strongly varying carrier distributions, bimolecular recombination is surprisingly uniform throughout the device thickness, consistent with the assumption typically made in optical models. The current density is largely determined by injection from the metal electrodes, with a balance of electron and hole injection maintained by redistribution of electric field within the device by build-up of space charge.},

Such dosimeters facilitate a range of cutting-edge applications, including anti-counterfeiting measures at low temperature for cryo-preservation. To facilitate such discovery, stacked vacuum referred binding energy diagrams for the LiYGeO 4 cluster of crystals have been first constructed. They offer a robust method for controlling both electron and hole trapping depth in the LiYGeO 4 cluster of crystals. Wide temperature shifting of Bi 2+ and Eu 2+ thermoluminescence (TL) glow bands emerges from 200 to 500 K for LiY x Lu 1-x GeO 4 :0.01Bi 3+ and LiY x Lu 1-x GeO 4 :0.01Bi 3+ , 0.001Eu 3+ , by changing x, facilitating conduction band tailoring. Wide temperature shifting of Bi 4+ TL glow bands emerges from 300 to 700 K for LiYGe z Si 1-z O 4 :0.01Bi 3+ , by tuning z, facilitating valence band tailoring. TL glow band peaks near 135, 185, 232, and 311 K emerge in Li y Na 1-y YGeO 4 : 0.001Bi 3+ . Particularly, the discovered Bi 3+ or/and lanthanide modified LiYGeO 4 cluster of crystals exhibit superior charge carrier storage capacity and minimal TL fading properties. For instance, the ratio of TL intensity of the optimized LiYGe 0.75 Si 0.25 O 4 :0.001Bi 3+ to that of industrial BaFBr(I):Eu 2+ is as high as ∼4. Interestingly, imaging of intense optically driven Bi 3+ ultraviolet-A (UVA) luminescence has been validated in 254 nm energized LiY 0.25 Lu 0.75 GeO 4 :0.01Bi 3+ with a 100 lux white LED illumination. Together with ZnS:Mn 2+ , LiTaO 3 :Bi 3+ , Sm 3+ , and Cs 2 ZrCl 6 :Sb 3+ perovskites, the realization of wide range liquid nitrogen temperature to 700 K Bi 3+ thermoluminescence in Bi 3+ or/and lanthanide modified LiYGeO 4 cluster of crystals with superior charge carrier storage capacity offers promising use for versatile anti-counterfeiting, information storage, and delayed x-ray imaging purposes.},

  abstract     = {Developing single-pixel full-color liquid crystal displays (LCDs) that do not require orientation layers and color filters is highly desirable since this would allow to better optimize their image resolution and light utilization efficiency while considerably reducing fabrication cost. However, so far, organic polymers have shown only limited color modulation range and inorganic materials have mostly been limited to on-and-off switches. Here, we report single-pixel full-color modulation along with gray scale control in electrically responsive two-dimensional (2D) inorganic sheets using α-ZrP and Ca 2 Nb 3 O 10 as our model materials. We demonstrate modulation of transmitted light spanning the entire visible spectrum at an ultralow driving electric field strength (below 10.4 V mm −1 ), which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than required for conventional organic liquid crystals. We attribute this unusually high performance to the surface charge, the ultra-small thickness, and the large electro-optic anisotropy of the 2D sheets used in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an LCD that efficiently combines gray scale and full-color modulation without the need for color filters or orientation layers. Our work thus opens the door to new types of LCDs and the simplicity of our setup allows its potential integration in various other information and image display systems.},

  abstract     = {Superlattices are materials created by the alternating growth of two chemically different materials. The direct consequence of creating a superlattice is the folding of the Brillouin zone, which gives rise to additional electronic bands and phonon modes. This phenomenon has been successfully exploited to achieve new transport and optical properties in semiconductor superlattices. Here, we show that multiferroic BiFeO 3 /LaFeO 3 superlattices exhibit several structural orders parallel and perpendicular to the growth direction, not existing in individual bulk materials. Using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and first-principles calculations, we reveal in particular a new long-range order of tilted FeO 6 octahedra, with a period along the growth direction about twice that of the chemical supercell, i.e., a superorder. The effect of this new structural order on the phonon dynamics is studied with ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments. While a folded-mode at 1.2 THz is attributed solely to the chemical modulation of the superlattice, the existence of another 0.7 THz mode seems to be explained only by a double Brillouin zone folding in agreement with the structural out-of-plane superorder. Our work shows that multiferroic BiFeO 3 /LaFeO 3 superlattices can be used to tune the spectrum of coherent THz phonons, and potentially that of magnons or electromagnons.},

  abstract     = {Flexible electrode is crucial for wearable electronic devices. To prevent performance degradation due to bending or stretching, the development of highly flexible and durable materials is imperative. Here, we address this challenge by selecting stainless-steel electrodes with excellent stability and flexibility. Through an anodization process on the stainless steel, we created an integrated flexible iron oxide electrode. Chemical vapor deposition and ion implantation were employed to develop concentration-controllable N-doped iron oxide electrodes. Comparative analysis highlights the outstanding performance of ion-implanted electrodes, with a specific capacitance increase of up to 3.01 times (332.375 mF cm −2 ) at 1 mA cm −2 . The N-doped electrode exhibits a capacitance retention of 76.67% after 8000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal N-induced lattice distortion, enhancing ion transport and reducing the bandgap. Leveraging these insights, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled, demonstrating exceptional stability and capacitance characteristics across different voltages. The flexibility of the stainless-steel substrate enables the FSC to maintain capacitive performance during bending. This research presents a promising solution for high-performance and stable capacitors in electrochemical energy storage applications.},

This study presents an advanced self-powered MXene/GaN Schottky ultraviolet photodetector that features a high-quality van der Waals interface to enhance photoresponsivity. The photodetector exhibits a high responsivity of 681.6 mA W −1 and a significant detectivity of 7.65 × 10 13 Jones at zero bias. In a self-powered mode, the detector can operate robustly even under dim illumination (0.15 μ W cm −2 ) due to the excellent Schottky contact and low amount of defect states at the MXene/GaN interface, which presents a strong intrinsic electric field. The photodetector has a high ultraviolet/visible rejection ratio ( R 360 nm / R 400 nm ) of 3.9 × 10 3 and a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 2.4 × 10 5 , which enable discrimination against visible light interference in real-world scenarios. We also demonstrated that the photodetectors worked well as ultraviolet signal receivers in an optical information communication system to accurately recognize pulsed signals transmitted from an ultraviolet light-emitting diode. These findings imply the great potential of van der Waals Schottky junctions between 2D MXenes and III-nitrides for high-performance photodetection and sensing in many integrated optoelectronic platforms.},

  abstract     = {A novel tapered quartz tuning fork (QTF) was designed to enhance its stress magnitude and charge distribution in QTF-based laser spectroscopy, which had a low resonant frequency of 7.83 kHz and a wide fork gap for long energy accumulation time and easy optical alignment. Compared to the reported rectangular QTF, this tapered QTF transfers the maximum stress position from the root to the middle to improve its sensing performance. Furthermore, the unique design eliminates the 90° right angles typically found in standard QTFs, which often lead to undesired “webs” and “facets” during the etching process. This design minimizes performance degradation by reducing the presence of residual unexpected materials. QTF-based laser spectroscopy of quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) and light-induced thermoelastic spectroscopy (LITES) were adopted to verify its performance. Compared with the widely used standard QTF, the total surface charge of the tapered QTF was improved 5.08 times and 5.69 times in QEPAS and LITES simulations, respectively. Experiments revealed that this tapered QTF-based QEPAS sensor had a 3.02 times improvement in signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) compared to the standard QTF-based system. Adding an acoustic micro-resonator to this tapered QTF-based QEPAS sensor improved the signal level by 97.20 times. The minimum detection limit (MDL) for acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) detection was determined to be 16.45 ppbv. In the LITES technique, compared to the standard QTF, this tapered QTF-based sensor had a 3.60 times improvement in SNR. The MDL for C 2 H 2 detection was determined to be 146.39 ppbv.},

In an antiparallel ferromagnetic bilayer system, we detect the propagation of both optic and acoustic modes, the latter exhibiting even a strong non-reciprocity. In single-layer systems, quasi-uniform spin waves are observed together with modes of higher order (up to the 4th order), bearing precessional nodes over the thickness of the film. Furthermore, the effects of magnetic material properties, film thickness, and magnetic fields on the spin-wave spectrum are determined experimentally. Our experimental results are consistent with numerical calculations from a micromagnetic theory even on these so-far unexplored time- and length scales.},

In most of these works, it is suggested that the observation of the AHE in such systems can be explained by a magnetic exchange interaction appearing at the interface between graphene and the underlying magnetic insulator. Considering the recently studied FL-graphene/bulk-CuCrP 2 S 6 system as an example, our careful and rigorous analysis of recent experimental and theoretical data presented in the literature shows that the claimed observation of the AHE and magnetic proximity effect in this system is not supported. Moreover, the theoretically calculated electronic structures of the studied system contain serious errors and flaws that cannot be considered as an accurate description of such an interface and cannot be taken as solid support for the proposed proximity effect.},

In this work, we experimentally investigate the main factors for the generation of current spikes in the three-terminal synaptic transistors that use LiCoO 2 (LCO), a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, as the channel layer. Kelvin probe force microscopy and impedance testing results reveal that ion migration and adsorption at the drain–source-channel interface cause the current spikes that compromise the device&#39;s performance. By controlling the crystal orientation of the LCO channel layer to impede the in-plane migration of lithium ions, we show that the LCO channel layer with the (104) preferred orientation can effectively suppress both the peak current and power consumption in the synaptic transistors. Our study provides a unique insight into controlling the crystallographic orientation for the design of high-speed, high-robustness, and low-power consumption nano-memristor devices.},

It is important to clarify the chemical lattice strains arising from compositional changes and the associated vacancy order–disorder phase transitions at the atomic scale. Here, we elucidate the intermediate process of a topotactic phase transition in Ca-doped bismuth ferrite films consisting of alternating stacks of oxygen perovskite layers and a brownmillerite-type oxygen vacancy layer. We use Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to closely examine the evolution of local strains exerted on the constituent sub-layers by electrochemical oxidation. A negative Raman chemical shift is observed during oxidation, which is linearly correlated with the local negative chemical expansivity of the oxygen layer. It seemingly contradicts with the general trend that oxides undergo lattice contraction upon oxidation. Oxygen vacancies initially confined in the vacancy layers can be understood to diffuse into the oxygen layers during melting of the ordered structure. The finding deepens our understanding of the electro-chemo-mechanical coupling of vacancy-ordered oxides.},

FM/AFM interfaces have also been proved to perform enhanced spin angular momentum transfer efficiency in spin pumping (SP), compared with typical FM/nonmagnetic interfaces. Here, we report an unexpected EB and enhanced SP between a ferromagnet and semiconductor. Considerable EB has been observed in Co films grown on ZnO single crystal due to the interface antiferromagnetism of the Zn 1− x Co x O ( x depends on the Co solubility limit in ZnO) layer. Moreover, SP measurements demonstrate a giant spin pumping efficiency at the Co/ZnO interface with a bump (spin mixing conductance G eff ↑ ↓ = 28 nm −2 ) around the blocking temperature T B ∼ 75 K. The enhanced SP is further confirmed by inverse spin Hall effect measurements and the spin Hall angle θ ISHE of Zn 1− x Co x O is estimated to be 0.011. The bound magnetic polarons with s–d exchange interaction between donor electrons and magnetic cation ions in Zn 1− x Co x O play a key role in the formation of antiferromagnetism with giant G eff ↑ ↓ ⁠ .

  abstract     = {This study presents an in-depth analysis of ferro-resistive switching (FRS) behaviors in a TiN/Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO)/WO x /W ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) device, with a particular focus on the role of the tungsten oxide (WO x ) interface layer (IL). Structural examinations confirm the presence of the WO x IL, which significantly influences the FRS properties of the device. Electrical measurements indicate the devices exhibit stable and reproducible FRS characteristics with an ON/OFF ratio of 9.7, predominantly attributed to the tunneling electro-resistance (TER) effect driven by the ferroelectric polarization. Comprehensive numerical simulations, incorporating the nucleation-limited switching model and Simmons tunneling mechanism, provide detailed insights into how the WO x IL and the trapped charges at the HZO/WO x interface affect polarization switching mechanisms and the electronic potential barrier profile. These findings underscore the importance of interface effects in HfO 2 -based FTJs and advance the understanding of the TER mechanism in multilayer ferroelectric systems.},

  abstract     = {Relaxation processes play a crucial role in glassy materials. However, current dielectric or mechanical spectroscopy typically reaches a lower limit of around 10 −1 or 10 −2 Hz, which restricts the exploration of long-time dynamics and stability. Here, we propose a mechanical protocol that enables the probing of relaxation processes down to 10 −5 Hz, extending the lower limit by ∼3–4 orders of magnitude. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in investigating metallic glasses, where the primary and secondary relaxations are detected over an extended timescale. An additional relaxation process has been captured below 10 −4 Hz, indicating the emergence of more complex relaxation phenomena over longer timescales. This progress in probing long-term dynamics opens up new possibilities for advancing glassy physics and material properties.},

  abstract     = {In vivo bioprinting, fabricating tissue-engineered implants directly in a patient, was recently developed to overcome the logistical and clinical limitations of traditional bioprinting. In vivo printing reduces the time to treatment, allows for real-time reconstructive adjustments, minimizes transportation challenges, improves adhesion to remnant tissue and ensuing tissue integration, and utilizes the body as a bioreactor. Unfortunately, most in vivo printers are frame-based systems with limited working areas that are incompatible with the human body and lack portability. Robotic arms have recently been used to resolve these challenges, but developed systems suffered from complex deposition or cross-linking modalities and lacked bioink temperature control, drastically limiting the use of biologically favorable bioinks. Here, we created a portable and affordable robotic arm bioprinter with precise control over bioink temperature. The system maintained biomaterial ink temperatures from 6 to 60 ± 0.05 °C. We tested a bioprinting optimization strategy with different temperature-sensitive bioinks. In addition, we engineered a personalized in vivo printing strategy derived from in situ scanning and model reconstruction that utilizes freely available and open-source software. We further demonstrated the benefits of human-derived bioinks made of blood components. The system and the proposed human-derived bioinks pave the way toward the personalization of scaffold-based regenerative medicine.},

The rising star of two-dimensional (2D) semimetals with extraordinary optoelectronic properties can fulfill these criteria. However, the formidable challenges with regard to large-scale patterning and substrate-selective requirements limit material deposition options for device fabrication. Here, we report a convenient and straightforward eutectic-tellurization transformation method for the wafer-level synthesis of 2D type-II Weyl semimetal WTe 2 . The non-cryogenic WTe 2 /Si Schottky junction device displays an ultrawide detection range covering 10.6 μ m with a high detectivity of ∼10 9 Jones in the mid-infrared (MIR) region and a short response time of 1.3 μ s. The detection performance has surpassed most reported IR sensors. On top of that, on-chip device arrays based on Schottky junction display an outstanding MIR imaging capability without cryogenic cooling, and 2D WTe 2 Weyl semimetal can serve as a saturable absorber for stable Q-switched and mode-locked laser operation applications. Our work offers a viable route for wafer-scale vdW preparation of 2D semimetals, showcasing their intriguing potential in on-chip integrated MIR detection systems and ultrafast laser photonics.},

By leveraging LSPR, PNSs can concentrate incident light, facilitate charge separation, and induce surface reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge in this field.

However, their practical applications may be limited by the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE), which causes skyrmions to deflect from the direction of the driving current. The SkHE usually results in annihilation of skyrmions due to the destructive skyrmion–boundary interactions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of the SkHE as well as the recent advances in manipulation and suppression of the SkHE in various types of magnetic materials. Additionally, we introduce some SkHE-free topological spin textures, such as skyrmioniums and hopfions. This review covers the following aspects: origin of the SkHE and its implications on spintronics, manipulation of the SkHE by external magnetic fields and geometrical engineering, and properties of SkHE-free spin textures. The review concludes by highlighting future research directions and challenges, suggesting that magnetic skyrmions and related topological spin textures will be essential for upcoming electronic and spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Electronic skin (e-skin), capable of sensing a physical or chemical stimulus and triggering a suitable response, is critical in applications such as healthcare, wearables, robotics, and more. With a substantial number and types of sensors over a large area, the low-cost fabrication is desirable for e-skin. In this regard, printing electronics attract the attention as it allow efficient use of materials, “maskless” fabrication, and low-temperature deposition. Additionally, the use of e-skin in real-time applications calls for faster computation and communication. However, due to limitations of widely used materials (e.g., low mobility) and the printing tools (e.g., poor print resolution), the use of printed electronics has been restricted to passive devices for low-end applications until recent years. Such limitations are now being addressed through high-mobility materials and highlighted in this review article, using e-skin as a vehicle. This paper discusses techniques that allow printing of high-quality electronic layers using inorganic nanostructures, and their further processing to obtain sensors, energy harvesters, and transistors. Specifically, the contact printing, transfer printing, and direct roll printing are discussed along with working mechanisms and the influence of print dynamics. For the sake of completeness, a few examples of organic semiconductor-based devices are also included. E-skin presents a good case for 3D integration of flexible electronics, and therefore, the use of high-resolution printing to connect various devices on a substrate or 3D stack is also discussed. Finally, major challenges hindering the scalability of printing methods and their commercial uptake are discussed along with potential solutions.},

However, the limited understanding and control of material defects represents today a bottleneck in the performance of GeSn-based devices, hindering their commercialization.

The time-evolving snapshots of the dynamical processes occurring during the battery operation can help design better strategies to prevent the formation of uncontrolled interphase layers, dendrites, electrode/electrolyte decompositions, and generation of gases. Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) has become one of the important techniques for understanding the aforementioned aspects. However, many potential pitfalls and cautions need to be considered from sample preparation, during PES measurements, to data analyses. Although the primary focus of this article is not to evaluate the PES technique itself, we first introduce a minimal set of fundamental concepts to minimize misinterpretation arising from the physics of PES. Subsequently, we examine studies that utilize PES techniques to determine chemical compositions of solid- and liquid-state battery materials, energy level diagrams that bridge different terminologies between PES and electrochemistry, along with the theoretical aspects of PES evolving from first-principle calculations to machine learning.

Surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based gas sensors have recently gained significant attention, owing to their desirable sensitivity, fast response/recovery time, wireless capabilities, and reliability. For detecting various types of targeted gases, SAW sensors with different device structures and sensitive materials have been developed with diversified working mechanisms. This paper is focused on overviewing recent advances in working mechanisms and theories of dominant sensitive materials and key mechanisms/principles for targeting various gases in the realm of SAW gas sensors. The basic sensing theories and parameters of SAW gas sensors are briefly discussed, and then the major influencing factors are systematically reviewed, including the effects of various sensitive layer materials, temperature/humidity, and UV illumination on the overall performance of SAW gas sensors.

  abstract     = {In recent years, metamaterials have shown great potential in various fields such as optics, acoustics, and electromagnetics. Sensors based on metamaterials have been gradually applied in daily production, life, and military. Metamaterials are artificial materials with unique properties that ordinary materials do not possess. Through clever microstructure design, they can achieve different properties and have demonstrated significant potential in areas like holographic projection, absorbing materials, and super-resolution microscopy. Sensors are devices that convert external environmental changes into recognizable signals, playing a crucial role in various fields such as healthcare, industry, and military. Therefore, the development of sensors with high sensitivity, low detection limit, wide detection range, and easy integration is of great significance. Sensors based on metamaterials can not only achieve these improvements but also offer advantages like anti-interference and stealth sensing, which traditional sensors lack. These enhancements and new features are significant for the sensor field&#39;s development. This article summarizes the benefits of metamaterial sensors in terms of increased sensitivity, expanded detection range, and ease of system integration. It also systematically discusses their applications in various fields such as biomedical and gas sensing. The focus is on the potential applications and development trends of metamaterial-based sensors in the future of human life, providing systematic guidance for the field&#39;s advancement.},

  abstract     = {Liquid metal batteries have been introduced as promising option to address the needs for new energy storage technologies. Currently, batteries based on sodium and zinc are under development and a favorable option due to their high theoretical cell potential, readily abundant materials, and cost-advantages. Nevertheless, they face the problem of self-discharge, which makes it inevitable to understand fluid dynamics in the whole cell. Motivated by that, several types of fluid mechanic instabilities in Na-Zn liquid metal batteries are identified and discussed here. On the one hand they can jeopardize secure operation, but on the other hand they can also improve mixing and increase the cell efficiency. In doing so, realistic cell as well as operation parameters are included and dimensionless numbers for identifying critical conditions are presented. The phenomena with highest significance for the discussed batteries are solutal convection, swirling flow, electrocapillary Marangoni convection, and droplet formation. Still, many open research questions remain and we aim at motivating researchers to dig deeper into some of these topics to contribute to an improved cell design and performance.},

  abstract     = {The Casimir force, which arises from quantum electrodynamic fluctuations, manifests as an attraction between metallic surfaces spaced mere hundreds of nanometers apart. As contemporary device architectures scale down to the nano- and microscales, quantum phenomena exert increasing influence on their behaviors. Nano- and microelectromechanical systems frequently encounter issues such as components adhering or collapsing due to the typically attractive Casimir interactions. Consequently, significant efforts have been devoted to manipulating Casimir forces, aiming to transition them from attractive to repulsive. This ability holds promise for mitigating component collapse in nanodevices and facilitating the realization of quantum levitation and ultralow friction devices. Four primary strategies have been proposed for engineering repulsive Casimir forces: employing liquid media, magnetic materials, thermodynamic nonequilibrium conditions, and specialized geometries. In this review, we examine these approaches for engineering repulsive Casimir forces, analyzing their experimental feasibility, and discussing potential implementations.},

Flexible magnetoelectric systems (FMESs), leveraging magnetoelectric coupling, hold vast potential applications in the fields of flexible sensing, memory storage, biomedicine, energy harvesting, and soft robotics. Consequently, they have emerged as a significant branch within the realm of flexible electronic devices. According to its working principle, FMES are divided into three categories: FMES based on magnetodeformation and piezoelectric effects, FMES based on giant magnetoresistive effect, and FMES based on electromagnetic induction. Although some articles have reviewed the first two types of FMES, there is a lack of systematic introduction of the FMES based on electromagnetic induction in existing studies, especially the development history and research status of the three types of FMES. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the development history and research status of these three kinds of FMES and reveals the working principle and mode of the flexible magnetoelectric system from the perspective of the force-electricity-magnetism coupling mode. In addition, the material selection criteria, device manufacturing methods, and application fields of the FMES are also introduced. Finally, this review delves into the challenges and opportunities confronting the development of FMES, exploring the future development directions. This review aims to establish a theoretical foundation and provide methodological strategies for future research on FMES. It is anticipated to promptly address the current gap in this research field and facilitate the development of the flexible electronic family.},

Subsequently, we present the discussion on the effect of nanopore size on the formation of an electrical double layer, and justify the electrochemical rationale behind the need for nanoarchitecturing of porous carbon materials. Traditional synthetic strategies of template-free and template-based methods and the previous porous carbon materials are also discussed as the potential synthetic methods and approaches available for nanoarchitecturing of MOF-derived porous carbons.

  abstract     = {Understanding contact mechanics and adhesion processes in thin films and micro-structured materials is fundamental in phonon and heat transport phenomena and is ubiquitous for the miniaturization of mechanical and thermal devices as well as the design/functionalization of structured surfaces and membranes. Acoustic-based methods are of great interest in this context since they provide a nondestructive mean to probe interface quality and adhesion, at various scales. In particular, Laser Ultrasonics (LU) techniques allow the generation of broadband acoustic pulses with a frequency content extending up to a few THz due to the thermoelastic expansion induced by the absorption of short laser pulses. In this review, we will explore the specificities of the LU generation/detection schemes and the unusual wide frequency range that make these opto-acoustic techniques a unique tool to study adhesion processes from micro- to nanoscales, and in a variety of systems, ranging from continuous films and coatings to nano-objects. Because the size of the contact area with respect to the acoustic wavelength dictates the acoustic dispersion, we will describe separately continuous structures, in which the contact is large, before discussing micro- and nanostructured media, where the contact is localized.},

  abstract     = {In conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, the logic state of a device is set by a gate voltage ( V G ). The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown until it was recently shown that a V G can tune the superconducting current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but with lower energy dissipation. The physical mechanism underlying the GCS, however, remains under debate. In this review article, we illustrate the main mechanisms proposed for the GCS, and the material and device parameters that mostly affect it based on the evidence reported. We conclude that different mechanisms are at play in the different studies reported so far. We then outline studies that can help answer open questions on the effect and achieve control over it, which is key for applications. We finally give insights into the impact that the GCS can have toward high-performance computing with low-energy dissipation and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Reduction of phonon mediated thermal transport properties, i.e., lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ L ⁠ ), of semiconductors can strongly affect the performance of thermoelectrics and optoelectronics. Although extrinsic routes to reduce κ L have been achieved through selective scattering of phonons via doping, alloying, and hierarchical nano-structuring, semiconductors with intrinsically low κ L have recently gained widespread attention due to their ability to decouple electronic and phonon transports. While innate low κ L in crystalline semiconductors is a desired requirement to achieve high performance thermoelectrics, the solar upconversion efficiency of photovoltaics based on metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been shown to increase due to their ultralow κ L through the hot-phonon bottleneck effect. Therefore, understanding the microscopic mechanisms underlying ultralow κ L in crystalline semiconductors is extremely important. Several structural factors that are intrinsic to a material have been shown to strongly influence the reduction of κ L ⁠ . Among them, the presence of rattling atoms, lone-pair electrons, and large lattice anharmonicity have been widely studied. Here, we bring out yet another largely unexplored intrinsic characteristic of materials related to the filled antibonding valence states (AVS) near the Fermi level, which are shown to induce low κ L in crystalline compounds. We focus our review on an emerging class of compounds–metal halide semiconductors including MHPs and investigate the interplay between structures, chemical bonding and κ L ⁠ , carefully curating from literature a list of 33 compounds having different structure dimensionality with known κ L ⁠ . We established a universal connection between the elastic moduli, speeds of sound, and κ L with the presence of AVS just below the Fermi level. We found that large peak in the AVS correlates positively with lower values of elastic moduli, speeds of sound, and κ L ⁠ , providing antibonding states based design criteria of low- κ L compounds. Furthermore, we discuss different synthesis strategies, which are crucial for experimental realization of ultralow κ L through structure manipulation. Additionally, we outline how chemical bonding data can be utilized in machine learning models for predictive modeling of κ L ⁠ . We hope that our approach of understanding low- κ L through the viewpoint of chemical bonding theory would encourage exploration of phonon transport properties in other families of materials having filled AVS that can provide further insights on the structure-bonding-property relationships aiding novel materials design approaches.},

  abstract     = {Molecular-scale junctions (MSJs) have been considered the ideal testbed for probing physical and chemical processes at the molecular scale. Due to nanometric confinement, charge and energy transport in MSJs are governed by quantum mechanically dictated energy profiles, which can be tuned chemically or physically with atomic precision, offering rich possibilities beyond conventional semiconductor devices. While charge transport in MSJs has been extensively studied over the past two decades, understanding energy conversion and transport in MSJs has only become experimentally attainable in recent years. As demonstrated recently, by tuning the quantum interplay between the electrodes, the molecular core, and the contact interfaces, energy processes can be manipulated to achieve desired functionalities, opening new avenues for molecular electronics, energy harvesting, and sensing applications. This Review provides a comprehensive overview and critical analysis of various forms of energy conversion and transport processes in MSJs and their associated applications. We elaborate on energy-related processes mediated by the interaction between the core molecular structure in MSJs and different external stimuli, such as light, heat, electric field, magnetic field, force, and other environmental cues. Key topics covered include photovoltaics, electroluminescence, thermoelectricity, heat conduction, catalysis, spin-mediated phenomena, and vibrational effects. The review concludes with a discussion of existing challenges and future opportunities, aiming to facilitate in-depth future investigation of promising experimental platforms, molecular design principles, control strategies, and new application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Third-generation photovoltaic materials, including metal halide perovskites (MHPs), colloidal quantum dots (QDs), copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), and organic semiconductors, among others, have become attractive in the past two decades. Unlike their first- and second-generation counterparts, these advanced materials boast properties beyond mere photovoltaic performance, such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, and cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, these materials possess more intricate crystalline structures that aid in understanding and predicting their transport properties. In particular, the distinctive phonon dispersions in MHPs, the layered architecture in quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, the strong quantum confinement in QDs, and the complex crystal structures interspersed with abundant disorders in quaternary CZTS result in unique and sometimes anomalous thermal transport behaviors. Concurrently, the criticality of thermal management in applications such as photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, light emitting diodes, and photodetection devices has received increased recognition, considering that many of these third-generation photovoltaic materials are not good thermal conductors. Effective thermal management necessitates precise measurement, advanced modeling, and a profound understanding and interpretation of thermal transport properties in these novel materials. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of various techniques for measuring thermal transport properties of these materials and discuss the ultralow thermal conductivities of three-dimensional (3D) MHPs, superlattice-like thermal transport in 2D perovskites, and novel thermal transport characteristics inherent in QDs and CZTS. By collecting and comparing the literature-reported results, we offer a thorough discussion on the thermal transport phenomenon in these materials. The collective understanding from the literature in this area, as reviewed in this article, can provide guidance for improving thermal management across a wide spectrum of applications extending beyond photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining an acceptable quality of life worldwide increasingly depends on the availability of clean and cost-effective energy, with power consumption expected to double by 2050. Therefore, the need for sustainable and affordable green energy has spurred innovative electrocatalysis research with the goal to develop materials and processes that are capable of producing environmentally friendly, carbon-neutral, clean, and green hydrogen fuel as an alternative to fossil fuel. In particular, heterostructured catalysts consisting of transition metal oxides and sulfides have emerged as a capable component of green energy technology. The dual functionality of these catalysts allows for water splitting, while the selectivity of the catalytic materials creates synergetic effects based on their electronic structure, surface composition, and electrochemical surface area. In this review, we examine the latest research and developments, synthesis methods, design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and performance outcomes for oxide/sulfide heterostructures. The review begins by introducing the current demand for hydrogen energy and electrocatalytic water-splitting and then describes the fundamental design principles for oxide/sulfide heterostructures and their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. A large part of the review is then dedicated to a comprehensive discussion of the various transition metal oxide/sulfide heterostructures designed for the OER, the HER, and two-electrode electrolyzer applications. In addition, the use of in situ and operando techniques, which provide crucial information for the design of effective electrocatalysts, is described. We also discuss the present status of electrocatalysis technology, including the challenges it faces and its future prospects as a means to achieve carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Overall, this review delivers a summary of the latest developments in electrocatalysis based on oxide/sulfide heterostructures for use in green hydrogen production.},

Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a pioneering active material in solar cells, generating interest in their potential use in other electronic and (opto)electronic devices, including field-effect transistors and phototransistors. However, before they can be commercialized, they still face significant challenges owing to their immanent instabilities with respect to heat, moisture, and light. In contrast, due to their exceptional environmental stability, the newly emerging two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper type perovskites have garnered significant recognition. The current state of the field is covered in this review article, as are the problems, and a perspective for the scenarios of perovskite field-effect transistors. The effects of temperature, light, and measurement conditions are taken into account, as well as the physics of the device and the fundamental mechanisms that drive these devices, such as ion migration and ionic defects. Subsequently, the performance of perovskite transistors and phototransistors described so far is analyzed and critically evaluated.

  abstract     = {The demand for efficient solvers of complicated combinatorial optimization problems, especially those classified as NP-complete or NP-hard, has recently led to increased exploration of novel computing architectures. One prominent collective state computing paradigm embodied in the so-called Ising machines has recently attracted considerable research attention due to its ability to optimize complex problems with large numbers of interacting variables. Ising model-inspired solvers, thus named due to mathematical similarities to the well-known model from solid-state physics, represent a promising alternative to traditional von Neumann computer architectures due to their high degree of inherent parallelism. While there are many possible physical realizations of Ising solvers, just as there are many possible implementations of any binary computer, photonic Ising machines (PIMs) use primarily optical components for computation, taking advantage of features like lower power consumption, fast calculation speeds, the leveraging of physical optics to perform the calculations themselves, possessing decent scalability and noise tolerance. Photonic computing in the form of PIMs may offer certain computational advantages that are not easily achieved with non-photonic approaches and is nonetheless an altogether fascinating application of photonics to computing. In this review, we provide an overview of Ising machines generally, introducing why they are useful, what types of problems they can tackle, and how different Ising solvers can be compared and benchmarked. We delineate their various operational mechanisms, advantages, and limitations vis-à-vis non-photonic Ising machines. We describe their scalability, interconnectivity, performance, and physical dimensions. As research in PIMs continues to progress, there is a potential that photonic computing could well emerge as a way to handle large and challenging optimization problems across diverse domains. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding capabilities and potential of PIMs in addressing such complex optimization problems.},

Here we review stability at the interfaces between perovskite and charge transport layers. These interfaces are particularly vulnerable to defects and degradation under external stresses such as heat, light, and bias, further compounded by their ionic nature and thermal expansion mismatch. To address these issues, strategies such as the use of additives, organic self-assembled monolayers, and low-dimensional perovskites have been developed to improve interface stability.

  abstract     = {Significant efforts have been dedicated to hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) over the past five decades. However, achieving commercially viable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in PWS systems remains elusive. These systems face intrinsic and extrinsic challenges, such as inadequate light absorption, insufficient charge separation, limited redox active sites, low surface area, and scalability issues in practical designs. To address these issues, conventional strategies including heterojunction engineering, plasmonics, hybridization, lattice defects, sensitization, and upconversion processes have been extensively employed. More recently, innovative hybrid strategies like photonic crystal-assisted and polarization field-assisted PWS have emerged, which improve light absorption and charge separation by harnessing the slow photon effect, multiple light scattering, and the piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties of materials. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive examination and summary of these new synergistic hybrid approaches, integrating plasmonic effects, upconversion processes, and photonic crystal photocatalysis. It also explores the role of temperature in suppressing exciton recombination during photothermic photocatalysis. This article also highlights emerging strategies such as the effects of magnetic fields, periodic illumination, many-body large-hole polaron, and anapole excitations, which hold significant potential to advance PWS technology and facilitate renewable hydrogen generation.},

  abstract     = {Knowing material behavior is crucial for successful design, especially given the growing number of next-generation energy, defense, and manufacturing systems operating in extreme environments. Specific applications for materials in extreme environments include fusion energy, semiconductor manufacturing, metal additive manufacturing, and aerospace. With increased applications, awareness of foundational science for materials in extreme environments is imperative. The speed of sound provides insights into phase boundaries, like shock-induced melting. Thermodynamic integration of the speed of sound enables the deduction of other desirable properties that are difficult to measure accurately, like density, heat capacity, and expansivity. Metrology advancements enable the speed of sound to be measured at extreme conditions up to 15 000 K and 600 GPa. This comprehensive review presents state-of-the-art sound speed metrology while contextualizing it through a historical lens. Detailed discussions on new standards and metrology best practices, including uncertainty reporting, are included. Data availability for condensed matter speed of sound is presented, highlighting significant gaps in the literature. A theoretical section covers empirically based theoretical models like equations of state and CALPHAD models, the growing practice of using molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations to fill gaps in measured data, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning prediction tools. Concluding, we review how a lack of measurement methods leads to gaps in data availability, which leads to data-driven theoretical models having higher uncertainty, thus limiting confidence in optimizing designs via numerical simulation for critical emerging technologies in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {The addition of low-loading content of nanofillers may improve the material properties of polymer-based nanocomposites. This improvement directly corresponds to the density of well-dispersed nanofillers in the matrix. However, for higher nanofiller loadings, the nanocomposites&#39; material properties not only may not be improved but also may be degraded due to agglomeration. This complex phenomenon, where nanofillers tend to form agglomerates with the enhancement of volume fraction, poses significant challenges in materials science and nanotechnology. It has been proven that agglomerations hinder the performance of the nanocomposites and thwart the unique properties of nanofillers in most aspects. Graphene, one of the most used nanofillers, plays a remarkable role in nanotechnology. Therefore, the key focus of the current review is to provide insight into the impact of agglomeration on the various material properties such as tensile, flexural, fracture, fatigue, thermal, electrical, and barrier characteristics of the polymer nanocomposites reinforced by graphene-based structures. A comprehensive review of the factors leading to the agglomeration of graphene in the nanocomposites was presented. It was concluded that agglomeration could be a barrier to developing polymer-based nanocomposites, and the challenges of controlling the nanofiller agglomerations were discussed in depth, highlighting the issue&#39;s complexity.},

  abstract     = {The most important ocean energy sources are wind energy and water wave energy, both of which are significant to carbon neutrality. Due to uneven distribution and random movement, the conversion efficiency from the two energies into electrical energy is limited, so the coupling of them is necessary. However, the current energy harvesting technologies generally target one certain type, or are simple mechanical coupling. Here, we propose a composite water wave energy harvesting scheme with wind excitation based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). A rotation TENG driven by wind is introduced as a pump to inject charges into the main TENG. For the main TENG driven by water waves, a specially designed charge self-shuttling mode is applied (CSS-TENG). Under the pump excitation, the shuttling charge amount is increased by 11.8 times, and the peak power density reaches 33.0 W m −3 , with an average power density of 2.4 W m −3 . Furthermore, the CSS-TENG is expanded into an array by parallel connection, and the practical applications are demonstrated. This work organically couples the wind and water wave energy in the ocean scene, through the charge pumping and self-shuttling mode, providing a new pathway for the synergistic development of clean and renewable energy sources.},

  abstract     = {Drug-eluting stents are commonly utilized for the treatment of coronary artery disease, where they maintain vessel patency and prevent restenosis. However, problems with prolonged vascular healing, late thrombosis, and neoatherosclerosis persist; these could potentially be addressed via the local generation of nitric oxide (NO) from endogenous substrates. Herein, we develop amine-functionalized graphene as a NO-generating coating on polylactic acid (PLA)-based bioresorbable stent materials. A novel catalyst was synthesized consisting of polyethyleneimine and polyethylene glycol bonded to graphene oxide (PEI-PEG@GO), with physicochemical characterization using x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. In the presence of 10 μ M S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), PEI-PEG@GO catalyzed the generation of 62% and 91% of the available NO, respectively. Furthermore, PEI-PEG@GO enhanced and prolonged real-time NO generation from GSNO and SNAP under physiological conditions. The uniform coating of PEI-PEG@GO onto stent material is demonstrated via an optimized simple dip-coating method. The coated PLA maintains good biodegradability under accelerated degradation testing, while the PEI-PEG@GO coating remains largely intact. Finally, the stability of the coating was demonstrated at room temperature over 60 days. In conclusion, the innovative conjugation of polymeric amines with graphene can catalyze the generation of NO from S -nitrosothiols at physiologically relevant concentrations. This approach paves the way for the development of controlled NO-generating coatings on bioresorbable stents in order to improve outcomes in coronary artery disease.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid fusion of temperature sensing technology and microwave technology, microwave temperature sensors have become the protagonist of competing research. We propose a planar resonator temperature sensor that combines substrate material modifications with sensor structure design. To realize this concept, high-performance TiO 2 - x wt. % ZnO (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) microwave dielectric ceramics are prepared. The various factors influencing dielectric properties, including crystal structure, phase composition, Raman vibration, microstructure, element valence, and oxygen vacancy, are completely investigated. The TiO 2 -0.7 wt. % ZnO ceramic exhibiting exceptional properties ( ε r = 106.6, Qf = 46 000 GHz, τ f = 426.0 ppm/°C) is selected for substrate fabrication. The frequency and temperature dependence of ε r and tan δ are analyzed at 2–4.5 GHz from −50 to 100 °C, revealing a good linearity between ε r and temperature. A CSRR temperature sensor employing this substrate material is designed, simulated, fabricated, and validated from −50 to 90 °C. This sensor generates two resonance frequencies (around 0.5 and 1.4 GHz) in the UHF band, demonstrating sensitivities of 2.2 MHz/10 °C and 6.3 MHz/10 °C at the first and second resonance frequencies, along with an outstanding normalized sensitivity of approximately 0.045. Through a comprehensive analysis of the physical mechanisms affecting the sensor&#39;s sensitivity and quality factor, the design of the sensor is strengthened from the perspective of optimizing the performance of microwave dielectric ceramics. The regulation mechanism of dielectric characteristics is enriched and clarified, thereby achieving a synergistic improvement in sensor performance. This work expands the application scope of microwave dielectric ceramics and provides an innovative approach to environmental monitoring.},

Herein, we demonstrate that skyrmion-like polar nanodomains appear at room temperature in SrTiO 3 /PbTiO 3 bilayer heterostructures by balancing the elastic and electrostatic energies via varying the SrTiO 3 capping layer thickness. These polar nanodomains, stable at room temperature, can be electrically written, erased, and rewritten into the bilayer by applying an appropriate bias on the conductive tip of an atomic force microscope. The lateral size and location of these polar nanodomains can be precisely controlled. Moreover, ring-shaped conductive domain walls are observed around these polar nanodomains, with on/off ratios of more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the ferroelectric background. Based on these characteristics, the polar nanodomains can be created, erased, and probed electrically, suggesting applications for high-density ferroelectric hard disks.},

Metal nanomaterials, i.e., gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), were synthesized by introducing various interfacial chemicals, to improve the hydrophilicity of biosensors, such as those used in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and lateral flow assay (LFA), respectively. Previously, thiolated AuNPs (SH-AuNPs) exhibited colloidal instability by forming irreversible aggregates in extreme environmental conditions; this phenomenon led to limitations such as poor sensitivity and reproducibility, in terms of biosensor application fields. Therefore, the development of novel interfacial chemicals remained a challenge for AuNP-based biosensor applications. Here, we first synthesized and demonstrated an ultra-stable AuNP functionalization by introducing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) compounds with a polyethylene glycol chain and azide terminal groups (NHC-AuNPs). The high binding energy of NHC-AuNPs compared with SH-AuNPs was demonstrated by density functional theory simulation, with NHC-AuNPs showing an unprecedented stability in extreme environmental conditions with varying ranges of pH, salts, and temperature; in particular, ultra-stability was observed in condition by freezing/thawing over 120 times. NHC-AuNPs were applied FRET and LFA biosensors and showed excellent sensing performances. Based on the results, NHC-AuNPs can be introduced for performance improvement in the development of diagnostic platforms to utilize in extreme environmental conditions.},

In the realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials, stacking order can play a crucial role in controlling and inducing phase transitions. However, in studying phase diagrams for 2D materials, the exploration of stacking degree of freedom has largely been overlooked, limiting our understanding and hindering future applications. Here, we experimentally explore the interplay of stacking and pressure degrees of freedom in revealing unique phase transitions in bilayer MoS 2 with two different stacking configurations. In AA stacking, interlayer sliding and asymmetric intralayer compressing precede intralayer rotation, while in AB stacking, asymmetric intralayer compressing and intralayer distortion occur simultaneously. Under further elevated pressure, the bilayer system transitions into 1T′ phase before amorphization. Our findings offer valuable insights for creating comprehensive phase diagrams and exploring exotic phases as well as phase transitions of 2D materials in a broader parameter space.},

For nitrogen doping, the depositions were carried out by laser ablating pure graphite (Gr) in the presence of Nitrogen (N 2 ) or Ammonia (NH 3 ). In another interesting case, 5 wt. % Boron nitride (BN) was added into the graphite target itself to obtain BN-doped graphite films. It was found that the growth condition mediated film constitution and properties significantly influence the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of the cells when tested for AFLMB. The cycle life demonstrated by the cells of pure graphitic film (Gr) was only about 110 cycles, while the N-doped graphite films obtained using N 2 gas (N 2 –Gr) exhibited stability up to about 300 cycles. Interestingly the N-doped films obtained using NH 3 gas (NH 3 –Gr) exhibited a stability of 715 cycles and B, N co-doped graphite (BN–Gr) film resulted in an even longer cycle life of 795 cycles. Density functional theory calculations were also performed to deeply understand the interaction and binding energy of Lithium within the undoped and doped graphene sheets modeled through the addition of light elements. It was found that the binding of Li is stronger in the (B, N) co-doped graphene as compared to the N-doped graphene and undoped graphene but much weaker than the B-doped graphene. Therefore, an improved lateral Li diffusion in the (B, N) co-doped graphene is observed where the Li binding strength is optimum resulting in better cycling stability.},

A remarkable large piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of ∼800 pC N −1 and longitudinal electromechanical coupling factor ( k 33 ) of 88% are obtained in (K,Na)NbO 3 (KNN)-based textured piezoceramics. From both experimental examinations and theoretical simulation, including phase-field analyses, it is found that the improved piezoelectric performance primarily stems from the stress-induced elastic field aligned with the preferred crystallographic orientation, which constrains the domain size, resulting in nanoscale short-range ordered domain structures. Such structures facilitate the flexible rotation of electric dipoles within coexisting phases due to flattened free energy distribution, thereby leading to the exceptionally large piezoelectric response. This understanding provides valuable guidance for the design of novel lead-free piezoceramics with excellent piezoelectric performance.},

Those studies interrogated the post-treated cells in comparison to control cells (cells not exposed to bio-electrosprays) through both well-established clinical read outs (flow cytometry, karyotypic, and gene microarray studies) and biological assays, demonstrating the ability of bio-electrosprays to directly and safely handle the most advanced and complex materials known to humankind, namely, living cells. Since our previous work demonstrated bio-electrospray&#39;s ability to jet both human sperm and whole fertilized embryos without damaging them, from a molecular level upward, we wished to investigate if there are any functional effects brought on to the jetted sperm&#39;s ability to fertilize oocytes. Therefore, in these investigations, we spearheaded this question by demonstrating for the first time, post-bio-electrosprayed bovine sperm remains motile and viable as assessed, to finally retain their capacity to fertilize oocytes in comparison to controls. These studies pave the way for this platform biotechnology to enter investigations for applications ranging from the development of biological models, sperm analysis/sorting, to their preservation.},

Nevertheless, a considerable challenge persists in the effective suppression of narrow-bandgap emission phases to ensure optimal color purity. In this investigation, we delve into the utilization of zwitterionic β-alanine (β-Ala) to facilitate the formation of nanocrystalline-structured perovskite. β-Ala, possessing both amino and carboxyl groups, is an effective passivating agent for various defect sites on the perovskite&#39;s surface, exhibiting versatility through multiple binding modes. This irregular passivation pattern strategically hinders the perovskite from adopting a conventional quasi-2D layered structure. Through the strategic implementation of diamine ligands and CsBr to modulate the growth process, we successfully engineered quasi-2D perovskite nanocrystals with Dion–Jacobson phase (Q-2D PNCs) via an in situ coordination process. The application of the PNCs as emitters in blue PeLEDs yielded promising outcomes. The pure blue PeLED with electroluminescent peak at 473 nm achieves a maximum brightness and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8005 cd/m 2 and 8.91%, respectively. Additionally, PeLEDs with sky blue emission (479 nm) exhibited a maximum brightness and EQE of 9431 cd/m 2 and 10.02%, respectively.},

Here, we report that microwave toroidal pulses can be launched by a transient finite-aperture broadband horn antenna emitter, as an electromagnetic counterpart of “air vortex cannon.” Applying this effective generator, we experimentally map the toroidal pulses&#39; topological skyrmionic textures in free space and demonstrate their resilient propagation dynamics, i.e., how that, during propagation, the pulses evolve toward stronger space-time nonseparability and closer proximity to the canonical Hellwarth–Nouchi toroidal pulses.

Recent theories have suggested that the NHSE can be well-tuned by external fields, opening a route to manipulating wave localization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the diverse interactions between NHSE and synthetic magnetic fields (SMFs) in coupled acoustic ring resonator lattices. We observe that the NHSE and SMFs can, via different physical mechanisms, compete or synergize, resulting in either the suppression or the creation of NHSE. With the aid of the complex frequency excitation technique, we experimentally observe that SMFs can suppress the NHSE by introducing Landau quantization, causing localization to move toward the bulk. In contrast, we show that the presence of SMF generates topological edge modes in the lattice, which then become corner skin modes by the second-order NHSE. Our results evidence the rich physics and diverse consequences that arise from the interplay of magnetic fields and NHSE, paving the way for actively controlling wave localization.},

Here, we propose how to further improve the performance of quantum COM sensors by breaking reciprocal symmetry in purely quantum regime. Specifically, we consider a spinning COM resonator and show that by selectively driving it in opposite directions, highly nonreciprocal optical squeezing can emerge, which in turn provides an efficient way to surpass the standard quantum limit which is otherwise unattainable for the corresponding reciprocal devices. Our work confirms that breaking reciprocal symmetry, already achieved in diverse systems well beyond spinning systems, can serve as a new strategy to further enhance the abilities of advanced quantum sensors, for applications ranging from testing fundamental physical laws to practical quantum metrology.},

  abstract     = {Nonreciprocal magnetotransport is one of the central topics in spintronics because of its importance for electrically probing magnetic information. Among numerous electrical probes used to read magnetic orders, unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), characterized by sign changes upon reversal of either current or magnetization, is currently a matter of great interest and has been identified in various spin–orbit-coupled bilayer systems composed of an (anti)ferromagnetic layer and a nonmagnetic layer with strong spin Hall effect. A recent theoretical work predicts that a spin-anomalous-Hall (SAH) UMR in those metallic conducting bilayers can originate from the spin-anomalous-Hall effect of the ferromagnetic layer and the structural inversion asymmetry. However, this type of UMR has not been reported experimentally. Here, we give the experimental evidence of spin-anomalous-Hall UMR in the light-metal/ferromagnetic-metal Cu/Co bilayers, where the emergence of net nonequilibrium spin density is attributed to the interfacial spin leakage asymmetry due to the spin memory loss effect at the Cu/Co interface and multiple spin reflections. We also show a highly tunable UMR in the Cu/Co/CuO x trilayer by varying the Cu thickness, which is due to the competition between the orbital Rashba effect in Co/CuO x and the spin-anomalous-Hall effect in Cu/Co. Our work widens the material choice for UMR device applications and provides an alternative approach to detect in-plane magnetization without an external spin polarizer.},

The facile fabrication approach for SSG with complex topologies to achieve high water evaporation efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, a MIL-101 (Fe)-derived C@Fe 3 O 4 ink was employed to multi-jet fusion (MJF) printing of polymeric porous SSGs with specific topologies. The optimized porous structure endows the printed SSGs with capillary force, greatly promoting water transport. The tree-like topology enables high water evaporation rates under various simulated solar radiation conditions. A finite element model was built to fully understand the light-to-thermal energy conversion and water evaporation processes. Moreover, the MJF-printed SSGs exhibit self-cleaning properties and can automatically remove accumulated salt on their surfaces, enabling sustainable desalination. During prolonged testing, the water evaporation rate of the SSGs remained relatively stable and reached as high as 1.55 kg m −2 h −1 . Additionally, the desalinated water met the standards for direct drinking water. This study presents a state-of-the-art technology for producing efficient SSGs for desalination and introduces a novel method for MJF printing of functional nanocomposites.},

By leveraging it, we identify a distinct CO 2 -run-out regime where the supply of CO 2 runs out due to the EDL steric effect from a dense layer of solvated cations with the maximum layer thickness equal to the solvated cation size. Consequently, CO 2 RR current density drops at a relatively negative transition potential generating a bell-shaped polarization curve, which is in contrast to the CO 2 -transport-limited regime where the current density reaches a plateau. Furthermore, we develop a graphical method, verified by experimental data, to generally predict the transition to the CO 2 -run-out regime.

However, the realization of high-performance QLED is still hindered by near-perfect quantum dots (QDs) with efficient and stable exciton recombination behavior. Here, we proposed a ligand compensation (LC) strategy to optimize the QDs by introducing a ligand pair of tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) and CsBr. The ligand pair could enhance the clarity and colloidal stability of the QD ink, facilitating the fabrication of highly smooth films. On one hand, TOP engages in interactions with Pb and effectively passivates the surface uncoordinated Pb 2+ . On the other hand, the supplement of CsBr provides a Br-rich environment to reduce Br vacancies (V Br ). Through LC, QD films possess a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 82% and a shallow hole level, which enables efficient exciton recombination. In addition, the LC makes QD films exhibit stable exciton combination behavior and electrical transport characteristics. Resultantly, the LC-optimized QLEDs show a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.7% and an operational lifetime T 50 of 182 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m −2 , which is obviously higher than that of the control device (EQE of 15.8%, T 50 of 11 h). The proposed LC strategy for optimizing perovskite QDs presents a novel concept for achieving high-performance QLEDs and holds great potential for widespread application in various optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Structural symmetry plays a pivotal role in the emergence of symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs), often observed at the Γ-point within the first Brillouin zone. However, structural symmetry is not an absolute requirement for the formation of BICs at the Γ-point. In this work, we demonstrate that all-dielectric metasurfaces and photonic crystal slabs, made of dimer nanostructures with different sizes and shapes, can sustain BICs at the Γ-point. We show that the nature of these BICs is well preserved, irrespective of the size mismatch/difference, as long as the center-to-center distance between two nanodisks is equal to half of the lattice constants of a superunit cell. The BICs are transformed into quasi-BICs (QBICs) with finite quality (Q) factors by varying the interspacing of dimer nanodisks. Multipole decomposition indicates that this BIC is primarily governed by a toroidal dipole, with a secondary contribution from a magnetic dipole and magnetic quadrupole. Furthermore, we establish that such a BIC is robust against the shape of nanodisks. Notably, we observe that the Q-factor of QBICs for right nanodisks displaced along the y-axis is three orders of magnitude higher than those along the x-axis, suggesting an effective approach to realizing ultrahigh-Q resonances. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of such a BIC by fabricating silicon dimer metasurfaces and photonic crystal slabs with dimer nanoholes. The trend of measured Q-factors and resonant wavelengths of QBICs shows good agreement with theoretical predictions. The maximum Q-factor is up to 22 633. These results not only advance our understanding of BICs within compound metasurfaces but also hold great promise in enhancing light–matter interactions.},

Such a thermal emitter is mainly constructed by multilayered films composed of nitrogen (N)-doped Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (N-GST) and an underlying metal film. The proposed device not only possesses special wavelength selectivity in the middle infrared range but can also dynamically adjust average emissivity (from 0.13 to 0.83) through the degree of crystallization. Besides, N doping can elevate the phase transition temperature of GST and enhance its thermal resistance, which renders it particularly well-suited for applications in higher temperature environments than pure GST. This emitter also shows strong adhesion capability and high flexibility against bending, enabling more practical and widespread situations. By using a multi-layer structure, we combined the more temperature-tolerant and dynamically modulating N-GST emitter with an optical thin film, successfully achieving dual camouflage for both infrared and visible light. The element doping technology and multi-layer stacking approach presented in this research will provide valuable insight for the development of dynamic emissive materials in multi-spectral camouflage scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The ultrafast dynamics of the antiferrodistortive phase transition in perovskite SrTiO 3 is monitored via time-domain Brillouin scattering. Using femtosecond optical pulses, we initiate a thermally driven tetragonal-to-cubic structural transformation and detect the crystal phase through changes in the frequency of Brillouin oscillations (BO) induced by propagating acoustic phonons. Coupling the measured BO frequency with a spatiotemporal heat diffusion model, we demonstrate that, for a sample kept in the tetragonal phase, deposition of sufficient thermal energy induces a rapid transformation of the heat-affected region to the cubic phase. The initial phase change is followed by a slower reverse cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation occurring on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. We attribute this ultrafast phase transformation in the perovskite to a structural resemblance between atomic displacements of the R-point soft optic mode of the cubic phase and the tetragonal phase, both characterized by anti-phase rotation of oxygen octahedra. The structural relaxation time exhibits a strong temperature dependence consistent with the prediction of the equation of motion describing collective oxygen octahedra rotation based on the energy landscape of the phenomenological Landau theory of phase transitions. Evidence of such a fast structural transition in perovskites can open up new avenues in information processing and energy storage sectors.},

Currently, although machine learning algorithms have played a crucial role in scientific research with numerous successful cases, relatively few instances exist where AI assists researchers in uncovering the underlying physical mechanisms behind a certain phenomenon and subsequently using that mechanism to improve machine learning algorithms&#39; efficiency. This article uses the investigation into the relationship between extreme Poisson&#39;s ratio values and the structure of amorphous networks as a case study to illustrate how machine learning methods can assist in revealing underlying physical mechanisms. Upon recognizing that the Poisson&#39;s ratio relies on the low-frequency vibrational modes of the dynamical matrix, we can then employ a convolutional neural network, trained on the dynamical matrix instead of traditional image recognition, to predict the Poisson&#39;s ratio of amorphous networks with a much higher efficiency. Through this example, we aim to showcase the role that artificial intelligence can play in revealing fundamental physical mechanisms, which subsequently improves the machine learning algorithms significantly.},

  abstract     = {The scarcity of fuels, high pollution levels, climate change, and other major environmental issues are critical challenges that modern societies are facing, mostly originating from fossil fuels-based economies. These challenges can be addressed by developing green, eco-friendly, inexpensive energy sources and energy storage devices. Electrochemical energy storage materials possess high capacitance and superior power density. To engineer highly efficient next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices, the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions and redox behavior must be probed in operational environments. They can be studied by investigating atomic and electronic structures using in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Such a technique has attracted substantial research and development interest in the field of energy science for over a decade. The mechanisms of charge/discharge, carrier transport, and ion intercalation/deintercalation can be elucidated. Supercapacitors generally store energy by two specific mechanisms—pseudocapacitance and electrochemical double-layer capacitance. In situ XAS is a powerful tool for probing and understanding these mechanisms. In this Review, both soft and hard x rays are used for the in situ XAS analysis of various representative electrochemical energy storage systems. This Review also showcases some of the highly efficient energy and power density candidates. Furthermore, the importance of synchrotron-based x-ray spectroscopy characterization techniques is enlightened. The impact of the electronic structure, local atomic structure, and electronically active elements/sites of the typical electrochemical energy storage candidates in operational conditions is elucidated. Regarding electrochemical energy storage mechanisms in their respective working environments, the unknown valence states and reversible/irreversible nature of elements, local hybridization, delocalized d-electrons spin states, participation of coordination shells, disorder, and faradaic/non-faradaic behavior are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the future direction of in situ XAS analysis combined with spatial chemical mapping from operando scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and other emerging characterization techniques is presented and discussed.},

This review comprehensively examines recent advancements in GeSe-based thermoelectric materials, focusing on their crystal structure, chemical bond, phase transition, and the correlations between chemical bonding mechanism and crystal structure. Additionally, the band structure and phonon dispersion of these materials are also explored. These unique features of GeSe provide diverse avenues for tuning the transport properties of both electrons and phonons. To optimize electrical transport properties, the strategies of carrier concentration engineering, multi-valence band convergence, and band degeneracy established on the phase modulation are underscored. To reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, emphasis is placed on intrinsic weak chemical bonds and anharmonicity related to chemical bonding mechanisms. Furthermore, extra-phonon scattering mechanisms, such as the point defects, ferroelectric domains, boundaries, nano-precipitates, and the phonon mismatch originating from the composite engineering, are highlighted. Additionally, an analysis of mechanical properties is performed to assess the long-term service of thermoelectric devices based on GeSe-based compounds, and correspondingly, the theoretical energy-conversion efficiency is discussed based on the present zT values of GeSe. This review provides an in-depth insight into GeSe by retrospectively examining the development process and proposing future research directions, which could accelerate the exploitation of GeSe and elucidate the development of broader thermoelectric materials.},

  abstract     = {It is only recently that the electric vehicle (EV) has evolved into a contemporary invention. There has been a rapid acceleration in the development of EVs in a number of nations in order to lessen their reliance on oil and their contribution to environmental pollution. In the tangible world, fully EVs do not release any carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from their tailpipes, unlike any other conventional vehicles. This results in a 50%–70% CO 2 reduction in air pollution per year. The achievement of electrification in transportation has led to a reduction in the weight and size of the vehicles as the need for internal combustion engines can be eliminated. Wide bandgap materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) offer advantages in the manufacturing of EVs. Beginning the late 2000s, the EV industry has begun to adopt GaN devices in their manufacturing processes. The semiconductor material GaN stands out as a material for power electronic systems in EVs owing to its high switching frequency, higher temperature limit, and high voltage breakdown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of semiconductor GaN materials for EV applications, which could be useful to provide insights for researchers and scientists to accelerate their innovation for the improvement of EVs. This review begins with an introduction to EVs, followed by the anticipated demand for EVs. The application of GaN devices in EVs, compared to the traditional Si and SiC devices, which are the primary power devices in current EVs, is discussed. The recent advancement in GaN devices that are capable of being used in various components of a fully automated EV, such as the battery, energy storage system, auxiliary power unit, and motor drive, in addition to their use in different non-automotive vehicles such as electric aircraft, electric ships, electric railways, electric submarines, and heavy duty vehicles, is also discussed. Finally, the challenges posed by GaN devices and potential solutions to overcome these shortcomings have been addressed.},

With recent proliferation of the abuse of pain medications, there is a pressing need for objective pain assessment given that a self-pain rating is the only metric doctors use for prescribing medications. To overcome this limitation, there has been increased attention on the use of EDA due to close association between pain and the SNS. With advancements in wearable sensors combined with signal processing and machine learning, it has become more feasible to objectively assess pain using EDA.

  abstract     = {Supercapacitors are widely acknowledged as crucial devices for storing and converting electrical energy, alongside batteries and fuel cells. Their ability to rapidly charge and discharge, typically within seconds or even milliseconds, makes them ideal for high-power applications. This feature provides significant advantages for electric vehicles, such as regenerative braking and hill-climbing, where quick energy transfer is essential. To optimize the power performance of supercapacitor cells, it is essential to focus not only on the active material but also on the inactive components, including binders, conductive agents, and separators. The latter functions as an electronic insulating barrier between the cathode and the anode while facilitating optimal ionic transport across the cell. Therefore, particularly in high-power devices, selecting suitable separators is crucial to ensure fast charging kinetics and minimal cell resistance. Despite significant progress in developing high-power electrode materials, relatively few studies have been dedicated to membranes and their impact on the cell&#39;s electrochemical behavior. Herein, we provide a practical guide for choosing appropriate membranes for high-power supercapacitor applications. A comprehensive description of the main characterization methods for reliable evaluation of separators, alongside practical experimental examples, is given below. A special discussion is devoted to the evaluation of membrane impedance by various analytical approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development and popularization of additive manufacturing, different technologies, including, but not limited to, extrusion-, droplet-, and vat-photopolymerization-based fabrication techniques, have emerged that have allowed tremendous progress in three-dimensional (3D) printing in the past decades. Bioprinting, typically using living cells and/or biomaterials conformed by different printing modalities, has produced functional tissues. As a subclass of vat-photopolymerization bioprinting, digital light processing (DLP) uses digitally controlled photomasks to selectively solidify liquid photocurable bioinks to construct complex physical objects in a layer-by-layer manner. DLP bioprinting presents unique advantages, including short printing times, relatively low manufacturing costs, and decently high resolutions, allowing users to achieve significant progress in the bioprinting of tissue-like complex structures. Nevertheless, the need to accommodate different materials while bioprinting and improve the printing performance has driven the rapid progress in DLP bioprinters, which requires multiple pieces of knowledge ranging from optics, electronics, software, and materials beyond the biological aspects. This raises the need for a comprehensive review to recapitulate the most important considerations in the design and assembly of DLP bioprinters. This review begins with analyzing unique considerations and specific examples in the hardware, including the resin vat, optical system, and electronics. In the software, the workflow is analyzed, including the parameters to be considered for the control of the bioprinter and the voxelizing/slicing algorithm. In addition, we briefly discuss the material requirements for DLP bioprinting. Then, we provide a section with best practices and maintenance of a do-it-yourself DLP bioprinter. Finally, we highlight the future outlooks of the DLP technology and their critical role in directing the future of bioprinting. The state-of-the-art progress in DLP bioprinter in this review will provide a set of knowledge for innovative DLP bioprinter designs.},

  abstract     = {Ordered porous carbon materials with regularly arranged pores and adjustable pore sizes have attracted significant attention due to their versatile applications across various fields. In this context, uniform carbon coating of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes is an effective approach to fabricating an ordered array of cylindrical carbonaceous nanopores with adjustable pore diameter and length. The resulting carbon-coated AAO (C/AAO) composite exhibits a meticulously ordered array of meso/macropores, devoid of inter-particle pores and resistance, setting it apart from conventional ordered porous carbons with powder forms. The pore dimensions of C/AAO can be precisely controlled over a wide range, and the carbon chemistry can be customized through heteroatom doping and chemical modifications, all without altering the pore structure. These inherent advantages position C/AAO as a highly promising material with broad application prospects. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis and characterization of C/AAO and related materials, along with their diverse utilization in the fields of optics, field emission, gas sensing, energy storage, electrocatalyst support, and bionics.

Electrons originate from various defect structures, such as impurity dopants, vacancies, antisite defects, and grain/domain boundaries, which sensitively varies depending on material synthesis processes. Moreover, the pronounced anisotropic nature of thermoelectric properties requires grain alignment along specific crystallographic directions. Therefore, the challenges in achieving high-performance n -type Bi 2 Te 3 alloys lie in the difficulties of independently controlling defect structures (electron concentration), textured microstructures (electron/phonon transport property), and nanofeatures.

  abstract     = {Ever since they have been studied, gas discharges have been classified by their visual appearance as well as by their current and voltage levels. Glow and arc discharges are the most prominent and well-known modes of discharges involving electrodes. In a first approximation, they are distinguished by their current and voltage levels, and current–voltage characteristics are a common way to display their relations. In this review, glow discharges are defined by their individual electron emission mechanism such as secondary electron emission by photons and primary ions, and arcs by their respective collective mechanism such as thermionic or explosive electron emission. Emitted electrons are accelerated in the cathode sheath and play an important role in sustaining the discharge plasma. In some cases, however, electron emission is not important for sustaining the plasma, and consequently we have neither a glow nor an arc discharge but a third type of discharge, the ohmic discharge. In part 1 of this review, these relationships are explained for quasi-stationary discharges, culminating with updated graphical presentations of I–V characteristics (Figs. 15 and 16). In part 2, further examples are reviewed to include time-dependent discharges, discharges with electron trapping (hollow cathode, E × B discharges) and active anode effects.},

  abstract     = {Photoacoustic imaging, an emerging modality that seamlessly combines advantages of optical absorption contrast and ultrasound resolution, holds great promise for noninvasive imaging of biological tissues. Its applications span across diverse fields, such as dermatology, oncology, cardiology, and neurology. However, achieving accurate image reconstruction and physiological parameters quantification from raw photoacoustic signals presents a significant challenge. This challenge primarily arises from the inherent heterogeneity of tissues, encompassing variations in optical fluence and acoustic properties. In addition, incomplete information acquired from a limited view also leads to artifacts, image distortions, and reduced spatial resolution. Furthermore, robust spectral unmixing approach is another key step to restore the initial biochemical components&#39; distribution with complex or unknown background absorption. To overcome these hurdles, researchers have proposed numerous state-of-the-art techniques, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of quantitative photoacoustic imaging (qPAI) in heterogeneous tissue. This review aims to comprehensively overview recent developments over the past decade, for addressing four main challenges frequently encountered in qPAI: limited-view reconstruction, acoustic heterogeneity, optical fluence fluctuations, and robust spectral unmixing, which serves as a reference for readers seeking to understand the specific challenges and corresponding solutions in this field.},

This review explores the functionality of structural design, especially the optimization of micellar systems, hexagonal and lamellar phases, and bicontinuous cubic and sponge phases, to achieve efficient skin permeation of therapeutic loaded LLCs. Furthermore, customization of surfactant to achieve skin compatibility and permeation is explored along with incorporating molecular modifications, functionalization, and the influence of surfactant hydrophilic–lipophilic balance.

  abstract     = {Spontaneous light emission is central to a vast range of physical systems and is a founding pillar for the theory of light–matter interactions. In the presence of complex photonic media, the description of spontaneous light emission usually requires advanced theoretical quantum optics tools such as macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, involving quantized electromagnetic fields. Although rigorous and comprehensive, the complexity of such models can obscure the intuitive understanding of many quantum-optical phenomena. Here, we review a method for calculating spontaneous emission and other quantum-optical processes without making explicit use of quantized electromagnetic fields. Instead, we introduce the concept of transition currents, comprising charges in matter that undergo transitions between initial and final quantum states. We show how predictions that usually demand advanced methods in quantum electrodynamics or quantum optics can be reproduced by feeding these transition currents as sources to the classical Maxwell equations. One then obtains the relevant quantum observables from the resulting classical field amplitudes, without washing out quantum optical effects. We show that this procedure allows for a straightforward description of quantum phenomena, even when going beyond the dipole approximation and single emitters. As illustrative examples, we calculate emission patterns and Purcell-enhanced emission rates in both bound-electron and free-electron systems. For the latter, we derive cathodoluminescence emission and energy-loss probabilities of free electrons interacting with nanostructured samples. In addition, we calculate quantum-beat phenomena in bound-electron systems and wave function-dependent optical coherence in free-electron systems. Remarkably, the transition-current formalism captures more complex phenomena, such as many-body interference effects and super-radiance of both bound- and free-electron systems, second-order processes such as two-photon emission, and quantum recoil corrections to free-electron radiation. We review a variety of light–matter interactions in fields ranging from electron microscopy to nanophotonics and quantum optics, for which the transition-current theoretical formalism facilitates practical simulations and a deeper understanding of novel applications.},

When particles in a probe are prepared into a suitable quantum entangled state, they may collectively accumulate information about the physical quantity to be measured, leading to an improvement in measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit and approaching the Heisenberg limit. The rapid advancement of techniques for quantum manipulation and detection has enabled the generation, manipulation, and detection of multi-particle entangled states in synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms and trapped ions. This article aims to review and illustrate the fundamental principles and experimental progresses that demonstrate multi-particle entanglement for quantum metrology, as well as discuss the potential applications of entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {The rapid success achieved from perovskite solar cell has drawn great expectations for commercialization of next-generation photovoltaics. Among the various perovskite materials, the inorganic perovskite derivatives have been of particular interest, ascribed to its superior thermal and chemical stability, which is a crucial criterion for reliable long-term operation. Nonetheless, the development of the efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells has been lagged from its organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts owing to the notorious phase-stability challenges associated with the formation of non-photoactive phases. The early progress of the inorganic perovskite solar cells has been centered on the stable perovskite phase-preparation and leads to the effective bulk management through intermediate engineering and compositional engineering strategies. Yet, challenges remain in securing the as-formed perovskite phase throughout the long-term operation. Accordingly, recent studies find interfacial modification strategies successful by constricting the phase-transformation channels in various perspectives such as defect propagation, strain, component segregation, charge accumulation, and external stresses. In this review, we start with the brief description on the inorganic perovskite solar cells and the associated advantages including chemical and optoelectronic properties. We then provide a review on the challenges of inorganic perovskite solar cells associated with the phase instabilities. We elaborate on the origins of the phase instabilities in terms of thermodynamics and the recently proposed channels including intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that facilitate the detrimental phase transformation. Finally, we survey the recent successful approaches to stabilize the inorganic perovskite solar cells through interface managements and provide outlook on further progress.},

  abstract     = {The precise controllability of the Fermi level is a critical aspect of quantum materials. For topological Weyl semimetals, there is a pressing need to fine-tune the Fermi level to the Weyl nodes and unlock exotic electronic and optoelectronic effects associated with the divergent Berry curvature. However, in contrast to two-dimensional materials, where the Fermi level can be controlled through various techniques, the situation for bulk crystals beyond laborious chemical doping poses significant challenges. Here, we report the milli-electron-volt (meV) level ultra-fine-tuning of the Fermi level of bulk topological Weyl semimetal tantalum phosphide using accelerator-based high-energy hydrogen implantation and theory-driven planning. By calculating the desired carrier density and controlling the accelerator profiles, the Fermi level can be experimentally fine-tuned from 5 meV below, to 3.8 meV below, to 3.2 meV above the Weyl nodes. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals the crystalline structure is largely maintained under irradiation, while electrical transport indicates that Weyl nodes are preserved and carrier mobility is also largely retained. Our work demonstrates the viability of this generic approach to tune the Fermi level in semimetal systems and could serve to achieve property fine-tuning for other bulk quantum materials with ultrahigh precision.},

However, the performance of 2D nanocrystal light-emitting diodes (LEDs) remains limited. Here, exciton dynamics are rationally controlled by both shell engineering and device engineering, obtaining colloidal quantum well LEDs (CQW-LEDs) with superior performance. The formation of CQW films on charge transport layers shows an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield of 76.63%. An unreported relationship among Auger lifetime, electron confinement energy, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) in 2D nanocrystal devices is directly observed. The optimized CQW-LEDs possess a maximum power efficiency of 6.04 lm W −1 and a current efficiency of 9.20 cd A −1 , setting record efficiencies for 2D nanocrystal red LEDs. Additionally, a remarkable EQE of 13.43% has been achieved, accompanied by an exceptionally low efficiency roll-off. Significantly, EQE for flexible CQW-LEDs is 42-fold higher than the previous best results. Furthermore, active-matrix CQW-LEDs on printed circuit boards are developed. The findings not only unlock new possibilities for controlling exciton dynamics but also provide an alternative strategy to achieve high-performance 2D nanocrystal based applications.},

The accurate identification and quantification of these compounds because of their ubiquity and potential health hazards has fueled the development of advanced sensing technologies. This work presents a sensing system in the realm of long-wavelength infrared spectroscopy for achieving enhanced selectivity and sensitivity of benzene, toluene, and propane detection through quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy. High-resolution gas spectroscopy is made possible by the use of specially designed InAs/AlSb-based quantum cascade lasers, emitting in the wavelength range 13–15 μ m, and quartz tuning forks. The sensor system, characterized by its robustness and precision, demonstrates exceptional capabilities in benzene, toluene, and propane detection. The system&#39;s capacity for practical applications in environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics is demonstrated by its ability to distinguish these volatile organic compounds with a minimum detection limit of 113 ppb, 3 ppb, and 3 ppm for toluene, benzene, and propane at an integration time of 10 s, even in complex gas matrices. This work advances gas sensing technology while also offering insightful information on spectral interferences, a persistent problem in the field.

In this work, we demonstrate graphene/MoTe 2 heterojunction integrating with microring resonators (MRRs) to serve as an optical modulator under positive bias voltage and a photodetector under negative bias voltage at the telecom band. Such a device primarily benefits from graphene&#39;s optoelectronic characteristics, including broadband absorption and electrostatically tunable refractive index. The obtained dual-functional MoTe 2 /graphene heterojunction devices demonstrate a modulation depth of ∼26.7 dB, a bandwidth of 7.0 GHz, and a self-driven, wavelength-sensitive optoelectronic response at the telecom C band.

The spectroelectrochemical experiments conducted with varying sizes of the intercalant revealed the size-dependent stability of the intercalated MoS 2 nanosheets. The observed absorption change of the exciton bands is reversible and arises from the storage of electrons in MoS 2 nanosheets and the subsequent weakening of interlayer van der Waals interactions following cation intercalation. This structural change is evidenced by the emergence of A * 1g out-of-plane Raman mode. Additionally, the photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the emergence of a lower binding energy component of Mo 3d and the shift in Fermi level to higher energies, confirming the presence of stored electrons in cation intercalated-MoS 2 . The underlying mechanism of intercalation-induced property modifications in MoS 2 discussed in the present study is useful in developing strategies for energy conversion devices.},

However, robotic grasping recognition in real-life scenarios is highly challenging due to the complexity of real-life objects in shapes, sizes, and other details, as well as the uncertainty of real grabs in orientations and locations. Here, we propose a novel robotic tactile sensing method, utilizing the spatiotemporal sensing of multimodal tactile sensors acquired during hand grasping to simultaneously perceive multi-attributes of the grasped object, including thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, surface roughness, contact pressure, and temperature. Multimodal perception of thermal attributes (thermal conductivity, diffusivity, and temperature) and mechanical attributes (roughness and contact pressure) greatly enhance the robotic ability to recognize objects. To further overcome the complexity and uncertainty in real-life grasping recognition, inspired by human logical reasoning “from easy to hard” in solving puzzles, we propose a novel cascade classifier using multilayered long short-term memory neural networks to hierarchically identify objects according to their features. With the enhanced multimodal perception ability of tactile sensors and the novel cascade classifier, the robotic grasping recognition achieves a high recognition accuracy of 98.85% in discriminating diverse garbage objects, showing excellent generalizability. The proposed spatiotemporal tactile sensing with logical reasoning strategy overcomes the difficulty of robotic object recognition in complex real-life scenes and facilitates its practical applications in our daily lives.},

The topological Hall effect has been widely adopted as a distinctive marker of skyrmion emergence. Alternately, here we propose a novel signature of skyrmion state by quantitatively investigating the magnetoresistance (MR) induced by skyrmionic bubbles in CeMn 2 Ge 2 . An intriguing finding was revealed: the anomalous MR measured at different temperatures can be normalized into a single curve, regardless of sample thickness. This behavior can be accurately reproduced by the recent chiral spin textures MR model. Further analysis of the MR anomaly allowed us to quantitatively examine the effective magnetic fields of various scattering channels. Remarkably, the analyses, combined with the Lorentz transmission electron microscopy results, indicate that the in-plane scattering channel with triplet exchange interactions predominantly governs the magnetotransport in the Bloch-type skyrmionic bubble state. Our results not only provide insights into the quantum correction on MR induced by skyrmionic bubble phase, but also present an electrical probing method for studying chiral spin texture formation, evolution, and their topological properties, which opens up exciting possibilities for identifying new skyrmionic materials and advancing the methodology for studying chiral spin textures.},

The micrometer-sized FLG grid on a nickel current collector was fabricated as a model sample, allowing direct comparative studies using complementary techniques. A reversible sodium-diglyme co-intercalation into the graphene grid was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, the nanomechanical properties of electrolyte decomposition products on graphene anode and Ni current collector surfaces were studied by ultrasonic force microscopy, and the chemical components of the SEI were confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping. We observed a mechanically soft SEI layer formed on the carbon anode surface compared with the electrode current collector surface within the low voltage region (&lt;0.3 V vs Na + /Na), this SEI layer does not affect the reversible Na-diglyme co-intercalations into FLG. At the same time, the SEI layer formed on the Ni current collector mainly contains stiff and thin inorganic species and is electrochemically stable at low voltage regions. Our results clarify the SEI formation behavior on the FLG anode surface in the diglyme electrolyte, providing experimental evidence for the fundamental understanding of Na-diglyme co-intercalation.},

  abstract     = {The topological (anti)skyrmion configurations have presented promise for versatile spintronic applications in racetrack memory, logic gates, and bio-inspired computing due to the nontrivial spin topology and convenient current-driven dynamics. However, the precise control of (anti)skyrmion-based information unit transportation via electric current in conquer of skyrmion Hall effect remains challenging especially in ferromagnetic films, limiting their integration into spintronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate the density, velocity, and direction control of half-skyrmion, with a topological charge of 1/2, in a predictable and governable way under the stimuli of electric current in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers. The particular nonsymmetric configuration of half-skyrmion introduces variable competing forces under joint manipulation of magnetic field and electric current. Thereby, the half-skyrmion application with highly controllable dynamic behavior is further proposed in prototype devices such as half-skyrmionic racetrack memory device with parallelized operation, programmable logic devices, and neuromorphic computing artificial synapses. This work sheds light on the versatile spintronic applications of half-skyrmions through electromagnetic coordinated manipulation.},

However, the origin of observed enhanced ionic conductivity as well as the details of the atomic structure at these interfaces remain elusive. Here, systematic, multi-stoichiometry computational searches and experimental investigations are performed to obtain stable and exact atomic structures of interfaces between CeO 2 and SrTiO 3 —two archetypes of the corresponding structural families. Local reconstructions take place at the interface because of mismatched lattices. TiO 2 terminated SrTiO 3 causes a buckled rock salt CeO interface layer to emerge. In contrast, SrO terminated SrTiO 3 maintains the fluorite structure at the interface compensated by a partially occupied anion lattice. Moderate enhancement in oxygen diffusion is found along the interface by simulations, yet evidence to support further significant enhancement is lacking. Our findings demonstrate the control of interface termination as an effective pathway to achieve desired device performance.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have been recognized as promising solution-processable gain media; however, the lasers with state-of-the-art performance exclusively originate from the cadmium- and lead-based NCs. Herein, we for the first time unravel that high-quality heavy-metal-free ZnSe/ZnS NCs show superior optical gain and lasing performance when the sizes exceed the quantum confinement regime. Corroborated by comprehensive transient spectroscopy, we reveal that the optical gain in large ZnSe/ZnS NCs originates from the novel Coulomb-correlated electron–hole plasma (C-EHP) instead of high-order multi-exciton recombination. Thanks to the formation of a four-level system and the suppression of Auger recombination, the C-EHP renders low gain threshold (9.4 μ J/cm 2 ), high gain coefficient (&gt;6500 cm −1 ), and long gain lifetime (∼4 ns). Such desirable gain properties compete well with those of classic CdSe NCs and enable the construction of a high-performance laser device. This work represents significant progress toward the development of solution-processable non-heavy-metal nanocrystal lasers.},

This has motivated the recent surge of interest in developing mechanical computing platforms at all length scales, including the nanoscale, in which traditional electrical computers are augmented with mechanical ones. However, the most proposed nanomechanical bits are volatile memory bits based on the dynamic response of nanomechanical resonators, and as such, there is a need to develop robust and reprogrammable entirely non-volatile nanomechanical bits. Here, we exploit the multiple quasi-stable configurations of the graphene/fullerene/graphene (GFG) van der Waals heterostructure to work as a novel nonvolatile nanomechanical bit. The GFG heterostructure is unique and robust in that it can return to its initial state without further mechanical input, it can be used for logic functions at relevant operating temperatures through simple application of uniaxial strain, it can exhibit reprogrammability between five basic logic gates (NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) by varying the magnitude or direction of applied strain, and it can be used to represent combinatorial logic through full and half adders. These findings provide a new opportunity to develop mechanical computers based on the large class of nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Microring resonators, due to their ability to enable robust strong light–matter interactions within their structures, have garnered substantial interest for their utility in sensing applications, particularly in the realm of gas detection. However, there is an inherent trade-off between a microring resonator&#39;s quality factor and confinement factor in the air, making it difficult to balance them. Here, we demonstrate a novel solution with a suspended nanomembrane silicon (SNS) microring resonator. This resonator has ultrathin sub-wavelength thicknesses (0.02–0.03λ), which breaks the trade-off, offering not only a high intrinsic quality factor of 6 × 10 5 but also an extraordinarily large confinement factor of ∼80% in the air at mid-infrared wavelengths. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we applied the SNS microring resonator for CO 2 gas sensing, exhibiting a sensitivity over 10 times higher than conventional silicon resonators and a large dynamic sensing range spanning from 0% to 100% with a high resolution of better than 4% and chemical specificity. By virtue of its excellent properties, the SNS microring resonator has the potential to open new possibilities for the development of unprecedented nanophotonic integrated circuits, with a broad range of applications in on-chip sensing scenarios.},

  abstract     = {GaN and related semiconductors have become an increasingly prominent material for a wide range of active and passive devices from optoelectronics to high frequency and power electronics as well as photocatalysis. Regardless of the application, anisotropic etching is required for micro and nano structuring, currently performed by reactive ion etching (RIE). Alternately, metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) is an open-circuit plasma-free anisotropic etching method that has demonstrated high aspect ratio device structures devoid of plasma-induced damage found in RIE. This paper presents an in-depth study of the ensemble electrochemical mechanisms that govern the photo-enhanced MacEtch process of GaN and related heterojunctions. Through in-depth experimental investigations, modeling and simulations, the effects of local cathode and anode design, energy-band alignments, and solution chemistry on MacEtch are correlated with the underlying electronic mechanisms of carrier generation, annihilation, transport, and extraction, establishing a fundamental framework for parametrized prediction of system behavior. These findings carry profound implications for tailored design of photoelectrochemical processes employed not just for uniformly etching wide/ultrawide bandgap materials but more broadly for semiconductor-based photocatalytic reactions in general. One-pot photo-enhanced MacEtching of AlInGaN multi-heterojunction device structures including superlattices and multi-quantum wells are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Converting mechanical energy into direct-current electric power based on the tribovoltaic effect is a typical characteristic of tribovoltaic nanogenerators (TVNGs). Although this newly discovered physics effect has been devoted to numerous research studies recently, a generalized theoretical model is still missing, thus unable to comprehensively elaborate the working principles of TVNG. Unlike previous qualitative explanations restricted to the conventional diffusion-drift theory, a new theoretical model is proposed according to classical semiconductor physics. Using the model, the governing equation of a TVNG is derived for the first time, which provides possibilities for revealing the variations of basic physical variables whether within the device or in an external circuit. The direct-current output is suggested to be the coupling of the tribovoltaic effect and contact electrification; in detail, it directly results from the movement and realignment of quasi-Fermi levels for excess carriers that are contiguous to the junction/contacting interface under non-equilibrium conditions. Moreover, an equivalent circuit model is established, equivalent to a constant current source parallel to a p–n junction diode according to the lumped parameter circuit theory. Notably, a new term, mechano-induced electric field E M, is defined and introduced to describe the impact of triboelectric charges at interfaces. Furthermore, using the COMSOL Multiphysics software, a dynamic simulation model for TVNGs is proposed, allowing the simulation and calculation of various TVNGs with different geometric constructions and charge distributions.},

Here, we report four different methods for on-chip temperature measurements native to CMOS industrial fabrication processes. These include secondary and primary thermometry methods and cover conventional thermometry structures used at room temperature as well as methods exploiting phenomena that emerge at cryogenic temperatures, such as superconductivity and Coulomb blockade. We benchmark the sensitivity of the methods as a function of temperature and use them to measure local excess temperature produced by on-chip heating elements.

Three prominent electron traps were detected in Ga 2 O 3 epilayers by a combination of the depth-resolved capacitance spectroscopy profiling and gradual dry etching. The near-surface trap occurring at 1.06 eV below the conduction band minimum (E C ), named E3, was found to be confined within a 180 nm surface region of the Ga 2 O 3 epilayers. Two bulk traps at E C − 0.75 eV (E2 * ) and at E C − 0.82 eV (E2) were identified and interconnected with the V Ga - and Fe Ga -type defects, respectively. In the framework of the impact ionization model, employing the experimental trap parameters, the TCAD simulated breakdown characteristics matched the experimental breakdown properties well, consistently with inverse proportionality to the total trap densities. In particular, the shallowest distributed E3 trap with the deepest level is responsible for higher leakage and premature breakdown. In contrast, Ga 2 O 3 Schottky diodes without E3 trap exhibit enhanced breakdown voltages, and the leakage mechanism evolves from variable range hopping at medium reverse voltages, to the space-charge-limited conduction at high reverse biases. This work bridges the fundamental gap between spatial charge inhomogeneities and diode breakdown features, paving the way for more reliable defect engineering in high-performance Ga 2 O 3 power devices.},

However, due to the difficulty in implementing periodic trapping potential for neutral excitons, observing Anderson localization of excitons in disordered semiconductors remains challenging. We report evidence of Anderson localization of Frenkel excitons in the alloyed perovskite nanocrystals that possess high topological and compositional disorder. The broken symmetry-driven constructive interference of scattered exciton wavefunctions around the octahedrons induces strong exciton localization and, consequently, exciton–phonon coupling. This causes significant promotion of the luminescence quantum efficiency from 30% to an impressive 75% owing to enhanced radiative and suppressed nonradiative quantum transition rates. These findings clarify that both Anderson localization and exciton–lattice coupling play key roles in triggering immobility of Frenkel excitons in disordered wide-bandgap semiconductors and guide design of monocomponent warm white light emitters based on highly efficient alloyed perovskite nanocrystals.},

  abstract     = {The pursuit of sculpting materials at increasingly smaller and deeper scales remains a persistent subject in the field of micro- and nanofabrication. Anisotropic deep-reactive ion etching of silicon at cryogenic temperatures (cryo-DRIE) was investigated for fabricating arrays of vertically aligned Si nanowires (NWs) of a large range of dimensions from micrometers down to 30 nm in diameter, combined with commonly used wafer-scale lithography techniques based on optical, electron-beam, nanoimprint, and nanosphere/colloidal masking. Large selectivity of ∼100 to 120 and almost 700 was found with resists and chromium hard masks, respectively. This remarkable selectivity enables the successful transfer of patterned geometries while preserving spatial resolution to a significant extent. Depending on the requirements by applications, various shapes, profiles, and aspect ratios were achieved by varying process parameters synchronously or asynchronously. High aspect ratios of up to 100 comparable to the best result by metal-assisted wet-chemical etching and sub- μ m trenches by DRIE were obtained with NW diameter of 200 nm, at an etch rate of ∼4 μ m/min without being collapsed. At the same time, low surface roughness values were maintained on the NW top, sidewall, and bottom surface of ∼0.3, ∼13, and ∼2 nm, respectively, as well as high pattern fidelity and integrity, which were measured using angle-resolved Fourier microscopy, combined atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy on selected NWs. This work establishes the foundation in the controllable development of Si nanoarchitectures, especially at sub-100 nm structures, for energy-harvesting and storage, damage-free optoelectronics, quantum, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices.},

  abstract     = {Biological neurons are electro-mechanical systems, where the generation and propagation of an action potential are coupled to the generation and transmission of an acoustic wave. Neuristors, such as VO 2 , characterized by insulator-metal transition (IMT) and negative differential resistance, can be engineered as self-oscillators, which are good approximations of biological neurons in the domain of electrical signals. In this study, we show that these self-oscillators are coupled electro-opto-mechanical systems, with better energy conversion coefficients than the conventional electro-mechanical or electro-optical materials. This is due to the significant contrast in the material&#39;s resistance, optical refractive index, and density across the induced temperature range in a Joule heating driven IMT. We carried out laser interferometry to measure the opto-mechanical response while simultaneously driving the devices electrically into self-oscillations of different kinds. We analyzed films of various thicknesses, engineered device geometry, and performed analytical modeling to decouple the effects of refractive index change vis-à-vis mechanical strain in the interferometry signal. We show that the effective piezoelectric coefficient (d 13 *) for our neuristor devices is 660 ± 20 pm/V, with a 31% internal energy conversion efficiency, making them viable alternatives to Pb-based piezoelectrics for MEMS applications. Furthermore, we show that the effective electro-optic coefficient (r 13 * ) is ∼22 nm/V, which is much larger than that in thin-film and bulk Pockels materials.},

  abstract     = {Charge transfer is a fundamental interface process that can be harnessed for light detection, photovoltaics, and photosynthesis. Recently, charge transfer was exploited in nanophotonics to alter plasmon polaritons by involving additional non-polaritonic materials to activate the charge transfer. Yet, direct charge transfer between polaritonic materials has not been demonstrated. We report the direct charge transfer in pure polaritonic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of α-MoO 3 /graphene. We extracted the Fermi energy of 0.6 eV for graphene by infrared nano-imaging of charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in the vdW heterostructure. This unusually high Fermi energy is attributed to the charge transfer between graphene and α-MoO 3 . Moreover, we have observed charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in multiple energy–momentum dispersion branches with a wavelength elongation of up to 150%. With the support from the density functional theory calculation, we find that the charge transfer between graphene and α-MoO 3 , absent in mechanically assembled vdW heterostructures, is attributed to the relatively pristine heterointerface preserved in the epitaxially grown vdW heterostructure. The direct charge transfer and charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons demonstrated in our work hold great promise for developing nano-optical circuits, computational devices, communication systems, and light and energy manipulation devices.},

Manipulating their symmetry and topology is important for understanding the mechanisms that underlie their topological phase transformation as well as offering tunable degrees of freedom to encode information, which has already been demonstrated in magnetic materials. Recently, the photonic counterparts of skyrmions and merons were constructed in a 2D wave system with deep-subwavelength features promising for optical sensing, imaging, and information decoding. However, their experimental realization relied on stringent excitation conditions that only support a single spin texture type on a specific structure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the transformation between photonic skyrmion and meron spin lattices on the same metallic meta-surface having a well-designed structural period. We show experimentally the wavelength-tuned symmetry transformation of the photonic spin lattices, which are also found to be robust against disorder in the structure to a certain degree. This work provides new insights into controlling the electromagnetic field symmetry and topology, as well as in developing applications in spin optics and topological photonics.},

One significant bottleneck is the lack of an HT thermal characterization technique capable of analyzing advanced materials exhibiting varying surface roughness and in-plane anisotropy. To tackle these challenges, we introduce spatially resolved lock-in micro-thermography, an innovative technique enhanced by tensor analysis for optical thermal characterization. Our comprehensive analysis and experimental findings showcase notable advancements: We present a novel tensor-based methodology that surpasses the limitations of vector-based analysis prevalent in existing techniques, significantly enhancing the characterization of arbitrary in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors. On the instrumental side, we introduce a straightforward camera-based detection system that, when combined with the tensor-based methodology, enables HT thermal measurements. This technique requires minimal sample preparation and enables the determination of the entire in-plane thermal conductivity tensor with a single data acquisition lasting under 40 s, demonstrating a time efficiency over 90 times superior to state-of-the-art HT thermology. Additionally, our method accommodates millimeter-sized samples with poor surface finish, tolerating surface roughness up to 3.5 μ m ⁠ . These features highlight an innovative approach to realizing HT and accurate thermal characterization across various research areas and real-world applications.},

It is disclosed that the supercooled liquid metal-elastomer can maintain an extremely stable soft state until the supercooling is eliminated by modulating the mechanical force and elastomer deformation. This circumvents the utilization of intricate refrigeration equipment and offers a highly efficient and concise strategy for stiffness regulation. Moreover, conceptual experiments were performed to demonstrate the practical values of this technology through designing and testing the new shape memory materials, temperature-sensitive switches, and controlled circuits. The solidification mechanisms of supercooled Ga triggered by homocrystal seeds were interpreted.

However, the noise sources and mechanisms have not been completely understood, particularly for the materials with a non-fully gapped Fermi surface where the electrical current includes components from individual electrons and the sliding charge-density wave. We investigated noise in nanowires of quasi-one-dimensional NbSe 3 , focusing on a temperature range near the Pearls transition T P1 ∼ 145 K. The data analysis allowed us to separate the noise produced by the individual conduction electrons and the quantum condensate of the charge density waves before and after the onset of sliding. The noise as a function of temperature and electric bias reveals several intriguing peaks. We explained the observed features by the depinning threshold field, the creep and sliding of the charge density waves, and the possible existence of the hidden phases. It was found that the charge density wave condensate is particularly noisy at the moment of depinning. The noise of the collective current reduces with the increasing bias voltage in contrast to the noise of the individual electrons. Our results shed light on the behavior of the charge density wave quantum condensate and demonstrate the potential of noise spectroscopy for investigating the properties of low-dimensional quantum materials.},

Decellularized tilapia and cod skin were explored as constituents of the composite and compared with the conventionally used decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) derived from porcine skin tissue. As a cell-laden bioink for 3D bioprinting, the choice of tilapia skin dECM, which possesses remarkable printability, allows for precise three-dimensional (3D) structure fabrication. Meanwhile, cod skin dECM was selected as the dispersed phase for enhancing biological activities because of its omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid, which is known to promote angiogenesis and is crucial for nutrient supply during tissue regeneration and lower inflammation. Through meticulous compositional optimization of the fish skin dECMs, efficient printability and high myogenic activity of the fish skin dECM composite were attained. In vitro evaluations using adipose stem cells clearly demonstrated the support of the cell-laden composite bioink for myogenesis, as determined by various cellular activities, including myogenic genes, compared to those of the porcine-based dECM bioink. The regenerative potential of the composites was validated using an in vivo mouse model of volumetric muscle loss. Based on these results, this study provides valuable insights into the use of decellularized fish skin as composite biomaterials and demonstrates their distinct advantages in muscle tissue engineering, in terms of both printability and bioactivity induction.},

We find the LSMO/P-SCO interface coupling has greatly suppressed the magnetic dead layer of LSMO, resulting in an emergent interfacial ferromagnetic phase. Thus, robust ferromagnetic order can be maintained in the 2 u.c.-thick LSMO layer (∼7.7 Å), showing a Curie temperature of ∼260 K and remarkable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. X-ray absorption spectra reveal notable charge transfer from Mn to Cu at the interface, and thus, resulted preferential d 3z 2 −r 2 orbital occupation for interfacial Mn ions plays an important role in the inducing of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in quasi-two-dimensional LSMO layer.

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric materials harvest waste heat and convert it into reusable electricity. Thermoelectrics are also widely used in inverse ways such as refrigerators and cooling electronics. However, most popular and known thermoelectric materials to date were proposed and found by intuition, mostly through experiments. Unfortunately, it is extremely time and resource consuming to synthesize and measure the thermoelectric properties through trial-and-error experiments. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model that utilizes the fused orbital field matrix and composition descriptors to screen a large pool of materials to discover new thermoelectric candidates with power factor higher than 10 μ W/cm K 2 . The model used our own data generated by high-throughput density functional theory calculations coupled with ab initio scattering and transport package to obtain electronic transport properties without assuming constant relaxation time of electrons, which ensures more reliable electronic transport properties calculations than previous studies. The classification model was also compared to some traditional machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting and random forest. We deployed the classification model on 3465 cubic dynamically stable structures with non-zero bandgap screened from Open Quantum Materials Database. We identified many high-performance thermoelectric materials with ZT &gt; 1 or close to 1 across a wide temperature range from 300 to 700 K and for both n - and p -type doping with different doping concentrations. Moreover, our feature importance and maximal information coefficient analysis demonstrates two previously unreported material descriptors, namely, mean melting temperature and low average deviation of electronegativity, that are strongly correlated with power factor and thus provide a new route for quickly screening potential thermoelectrics with high success rate. Our deep CNN model with fused orbital field matrix and composition descriptors is very promising for screening high power factor thermoelectrics from large-scale hypothetical structures.},

Thanks to their excitonic properties, 2D perovskites are also promising active materials to be included in devices working at room temperature. In this work, we study the presence of very narrow and spatially localized optical transitions in 2D lead halide perovskites by μ -photoluminescence and time-decay measurements. These discrete optical transitions are characterized by sub-millielectronvolt linewidths ( ⁠ ≃ 120 μ eV ⁠ ) and long decay times (5–8 ns). X-ray photoemission and density-functional theory calculations have been employed to investigate the chemical origin of electronic states responsible of these transitions.

Ionized DAP recombination is identified as the most likely physical source of the observed discrete optical emission lines. The analysis of the experimental data with a simple model, which evaluates the Coulombic interaction between ionized acceptors and donors, returns a donor in Bohr radius of the order of ≃ 10 nm. The analysis of the spectral and electronic characteristics of these single donor–acceptor states in 2D perovskites is of particular importance both from the point of view of fundamental research, as well as to be able to link the emission of these states with new optoelectronic applications that require long-range optically controllable interactions.},

Understanding ET mechanisms is crucial for developing sustainable energy solutions and synthesizing value-added compounds efficiently.

Among the theoretical and experimental cornerstones, Marcus Theory, electronic conductance, computational modeling, biomolecular thermodynamics, electrochemical and kinetic theories, protein film voltammetry, and the emergence of in situ and operando techniques are explored. Theoretical modeling is vital for understanding and predicting ET processes. Additionally, the significance of experimental techniques for investigating the ET process in biological entities and interfaces is discussed. Protein film voltammetry is a valuable and consolidated technique for studying ET processes at the protein-electrode interface, whereas in situ and operando techniques for interrogating ET processes in real time provide insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of ET. The concept of quantum conductance in biological structures is addressed, evidencing a trend and power of single-entity analysis. Aspects of extracellular and interfacial ET processes are presented and discussed in the electrochemical energy conversion systems. A deep understanding of these processes can improve the design of efficient bioinspired catalysts.

  abstract     = {Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been known as the most widely used light source in lighting and displays for more than 60 years. There is still room for progress in the performance of LEDs, especially since the current devices with various types of different light-emitting layer materials have converged to unity in terms of internal quantum efficiency, and there is an urgent need to improve the light extraction efficiency. Metasurfaces (MSs) have received attention from researchers as structures that can be integrated with LEDs to efficiently modulate the phase and amplitude of light through resonance and scattering, which can reduce light loss. This paper reviews the development of metasurfaces in LEDs so far. The different working mechanisms of metasurfaces composed of different materials are first analyzed in depth. Subsequently, three aspects of light extraction, angle change, and polarization modulation are described in detail according to different applications of metasurfaces in LEDs. Finally, the current status of metasurface applications in LEDs is summarized, and the future development prospects are envisioned.},

  abstract     = {This contribution provides a thorough examination of the structural characteristics of pyrochlore-type lanthanide titanates and zirconates Ln 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Ln 2 Zr 2 O 7 , across various length scales. This paper also examines their processing, interesting physical properties (electrical, magnetic, and thermal characteristics), and responses to high pressure and ion irradiation. Brief sections on the elemental oxides&#39; crystal chemistry, pertinent phase diagrams, and energetics of defect formation are also provided. Pyrochlore-type Ln 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Ln 2 Zr 2 O 7 stand out as truly multifunctional materials. Moreover, they have emerged as fascinating materials due to magnetic geometrical frustration, arising from the ordering of magnetic Ln 3+ and non-magnetic Ti 4+ (or Zr 4+ ) cations into separate, interpenetrating lattices of corner-sharing tetrahedra. This results in a diverse array of exotic magnetic ground states, such as spin-ice (e.g., Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 or Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 ) or quantum spin ice (e.g., Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 ), observed at both low and room temperatures. They also exhibit varied electrical and electrochemical characteristics. Some members such as Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 , function as fast ion conductors with a conductivity (σ) of ≈10 −2 S·cm −1 at 800 °C and activation energy ( E a ) ranging from 0.85 to 1.52 eV, depending on the degree of structural disorder. Others, such as Gd 2 TiMoO 7 , are mixed ionic-electronic conductors with σ ≈ 25 S·cm −1 at 1000 °C, making them promising candidate materials for applications in energy conversion and storage devices and oxygen separation membranes. Their exceptionally low thermal conductivity (e.g., κ ∼ 1.1–1.7 W·m −1 ·K −1 between 700 and 1200 °C for Ln 2 Zr 2 O 7 ), close to the glass-like lower limit of highly disordered solids, positions them as valuable materials for thermal barrier coatings. They can also effectively accommodate actinides (e.g., Pu, Np, Cm, Am) in solid solutions and sustain prolonged exposure to radiation due to alpha-decay events, while preserving the integrity of the periodic atomic structure. Proposed as major components in actinide-bearing ceramics, they contribute to the long-term immobilization and disposal of long-lived waste radionuclides from nuclear programs. Some of these properties are displayed simultaneously, opening avenues for new applications. Despite the wealth of data available in the literature, this review highlights the need for a better understanding of order/disorder processes in pyrochlore-type materials and the influence of the structural length scale on their physical and chemical properties. Recent experimental evidence has revealed that pyrochlore short-range structure is far more complex than originally thought. Moreover, pyrochlore local structure is now believed to include short-range, lower symmetry, ordered domains, such as the orthorhombic weberite-type of structure. Notably, short- and long-range structures appear decoupled across different length scales and temperature regimes, and these differences persist even in well-ordered samples. We believe that the pyrochlore structure offers a unique opportunity for examining the interplay between chemical composition, defect chemistry, and properties.},

  abstract     = {The unique geometric and thermal properties of carbon nanoparticles (NPs)—including nanotubes, graphene, and nanodiamonds—have led to their use as additives in many composite material systems. In this review, we investigate the mechanisms behind the altered thermal conductivity ( κ ) of thermoelectric (TE) and other thermal materials that have been composited with carbon NPs. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the relevant theoretical and applied literature, including a detailed review of the available thermal conductivity data across five common classes of TE materials (Bi 2 Te 3 variants, skutterudites, metal–oxide, SnSe, Cu 2 Se) in combination with carbon additives, including graphene, nanotubes, carbon black, carbon fiber, and C 60 . We argue that the effectiveness of carbon NPs in reducing κ in TE composites generally arises due to a combination of the presence of the carbon NP interfaces and significant changes in the microstructure of the host material due to compositing, such as suppressed grain growth and the introduction of pores, dislocations, and strain. Carbon NPs themselves are effective phonon scatterers in TE composites due to a significant mismatch between their high-frequency phonon distribution and the lower-frequency phonon distribution of the host material. While carbon NP doping has proven itself as an effective way to increase the performance of TE materials, there is still a significant amount of work to do to precisely understand the fundamental thermal transport mechanisms at play. Rigorous material characterization of nanocomposites and spectroscopic studies of the precise lattice dynamics will greatly aid the development of a fully quantitative, self-consistent model for the thermal conductivity of carbon nanocomposites.},

This intricate process involves the segregation of a liquid into two distinct phases: a coacervate phase enriched with polymers and a polymer-deficient phase comprising the remaining dilute solution. The potential of coacervates extends beyond their natural occurrence in biological systems, as they possess the capability to encapsulate various types of biomolecules in an aqueous solution, obviating the need for organic solvents. Consequently, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing functional nanoscale coacervate-driven assemblies using both natural and synthetic polymers for a myriad of applications.

However, the conventional ferroelectric materials, which have been limited by physical size restrictions, can no longer satisfy the above requirements. Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials can effectively overcome the size limitation of traditional ferroelectrics due to the weak van der Waals force between layers, which is easy to thin while retaining their own unique properties.

One of the key and urgent limitations of LnNPs is the weak and narrow absorption of lanthanides. Fabrication of heterostructures will overcome this hurdle and enhance the performance of LnNPs. Developing novel heterostructures to enhance the absorption of lanthanides and studying the energy transfer pathways and efficiencies are of broad interest to the chemical and physical research community. There is currently no systematic review to summarize different types of LnNP heterostructures. Thus, this review will summarize five types of heterostructures combining LnNPs with organic and inorganic dyes, plasmonics, semiconducting quantum dots, and metal–organic frameworks. The enhancement of absorption and the improvement of light conversion performance are compared and discussed. This review also discusses the energy transfer pathways and efficiencies between LnNPs and other components and provides suggestions to form heterostructures with enhanced absorption and efficient energy transfer for future applications.

This replication not only facilitates remarkable computational efficiency but also equips devices with efficient real-time data-processing capability, which is a cornerstone in artificial intelligence evolution and human–machine interface enhancement. Herein, we highlight recent advancements in neuromorphic systems designed to mimic the functionalities of the human tactile sensory system, a critical component of somatosensory functions. After discussing the tactile sensors which biomimic the mechanoreceptors, insights are provided to integrate artificial synapses and neural networks for advanced information recognition emphasizing the efficiency and sophistication of integrated system. It showcases the evolution of tactile recognition biomimicry, extending beyond replicating the physical properties of human skin to biomimicking tactile sensations and efferent/afferent nerve functions. These developments demonstrate significant potential for creating sensitive, adaptive, plastic, and memory-capable devices for human-centric applications. Moreover, this review addresses the impact of skin-related diseases on tactile perception and the research toward developing artificial skin to mimic sensory and motor functions, aiming to restore tactile reception for perceptual challenged individuals. It concludes with an overview of state-of-the-art biomimetic artificial tactile systems based on the manufacturing–structure–property–performance relationships, from devices mimicking mechanoreceptor functions to integrated systems, underscoring the promising future of artificial tactile sensing and neuromorphic device innovation.},

  abstract     = {III-nitride heterostructure-based metal–insulator–semiconductor high-electron-mobility transistors (MIS-HEMTs), compared with Schottky and p-GaN gate HEMTs, have demonstrated significant potential in the next-generation high-power electronic devices due to their exceptional gate reliability. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of threshold voltage (V TH ) instability in III-nitride heterostructure-based MIS-HEMTs, with a specific emphasis on the interfaces of the multi-heterostructures. Two widely studied amorphous materials, namely, Al 2 O 3 and SiN x , have been extensively examined as primary gate insulators in GaN-based MIS-HEMTs. To efficiently remove native oxides from the (Al)GaN surface, a novel in situ high-temperature remote plasma pretreatment (RPP) technique has been developed. This technique involves sequential application of NH 3 /N 2 plasmas on the (Al)GaN surface before depositing the gate insulators using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. The remarkable RPP process has proven to be a highly effective method for revealing atomic steps on the GaN surface, irrespective of whether the surface has undergone oxidation or etching processes. To further enhance the interface quality and potentially reduce bulk traps in the gate insulator, optimization of deposition temperature and post-deposition annealing conditions have been explored. Additionally, an electron-blocking layer, such as SiON, is incorporated into the MIS-HEMTs to prevent electron injection into bulk traps within the insulator. Novel characterization techniques including constant-capacitance and isothermal-mode deep-level transient spectroscopy have also been developed to explore the failure mechanisms in MIS-HEMTs. These techniques allow for the differentiation between bulk traps in the GaN epitaxy and those present within the gate insulators. This in-depth physical understanding provides valuable insights into the sources of failure in GaN-based MIS-HEMTs.},

Therefore, exposure to ultrasound waves or non-thermal microwaves with a suitable resonant frequency oscillating electric field holds the potential to neutralize the virus particle with no damage to human.

With the recent surge in research and development of emerging memristors, which exploit the inherent variability of these devices, there has been a notable increase in studies on HW security. Particularly, volatile threshold switch (TS) devices, which exhibit insulator/metal characteristics below/above a certain threshold voltage, show great promise as security devices due to their lower power consumption and higher cycling endurance compared to nonvolatile memory devices. Despite the promising attributes and increasing demand for TS devices for HW security, there remains a lack of a comprehensive overview covering various TS devices and their potential contributions to HW privacy.

  abstract     = {By utilizing the significant amount of energy absorbed and released during their phase transitions, phase change materials (PCMs) can capture and store thermal energy to fill gaps between supply and demand. Due to their many favorable properties, organic PCMs have gained attention in a wide range of applications. Nevertheless, their inherent low thermal conductivity has limited the direct use of organic PCMs in thermal energy storage (TES). Extensive research has been conducted on enhancing organic PCM thermal conductivity by incorporating high thermal conductivity materials. Owing to their high thermal conductivity and low density, carbon-based materials have been extensively used for thermal conductivity enhancement in phase change composites (PCCs). Carbon-based organic PCCs, which incorporate highly thermally conductive carbon allotropes and their direct chemical derivatives with organic PCMs, are a group of diverse PCCs with highly promising potential for TES applications. Adequate latent heat and shape stability performances are crucial to the success of the applicational performances of these PCCs. Much empirical research has pushed efforts to enhance these phase change properties, yet a logical understanding of these enhancement efforts based on the thermodynamics and intermolecular interactions of carbon-based organic PCCs has been elusive. In particular, the effect of characterization methods on the evaluation of phase change properties has been largely understudied. This review strives to provide novel physical and chemical insights into latent heat and shape stabilization evaluation processes and enhancement efforts in carbon-based organic PCCs through a detailed review and analysis of recent literature. The review provides an unprecedented comprehension of newly developed PCCs that challenge the traditional understanding that the latent heat of PCCs cannot exceed that of its base PCM. Efforts on phase change property enhancement driven by these new insights have the potential for carbon-based organic PCCs to succeed in a variety of TES applications, including solar-thermal harvesting, thermal management of batteries and electronics, thermoregulating textiles, and infrared stealth and infrared responsive materials.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of water electrolysis for green hydrogen (H 2 ) production, powered by renewable energy, is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out as one of the most efficient H 2 production technologies. However, implementing it on an industrial scale faces substantial challenges, particularly regarding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER, a critical process with inherently slow kinetics requiring additional potential, significantly influences overall water-splitting efficiency. Most OER electrocatalysts in PEMWE struggle with poor stability in harsh acidic environments at high oxidative potentials. While rare-earth metal oxides, such as iridium or ruthenium oxides, offer stability in commercial oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts (OECs), their use depends on achieving economically and sustainably viable operations. An alternative approach involves developing low- or non-noble metal-based OECs with sustaining high activity and long-term durability. Although such materials currently exhibit lower activity and stability than noble-based OECs, notable progress has been made in enhancing their performance. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in designing acidic-stable OECs based on low or without noble metal contents. It delves into the thermodynamics and degradation mechanisms of OECs in acidic media, evaluation parameters for activity and stability, strategies for developing active and acid-stable OECs, and the challenges and opportunities of acid water electrolysis. Through a detailed analysis of these aspects, the review aims to identify opportunities for engineering actively durable OECs.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor laser diodes (LDs), with merits of little volume, lightweight, low power consumption, ease of modulation, and high data rates, are great candidates for space laser communications. However, operating in a radiation environment can result in various damages to LDs. Hence, the growing focus on satellite laser communications necessitates LDs with improved radiation hardness. This review covers the efforts made in investigating the radiation effects on LDs induced by various types of radiation, including neutrons, γ-rays, protons, electrons, and other radiation particles. The conditions of radiation experiments and the behaviors and mechanisms of the degradation of LD material and device performance after being radiated are surveyed and discussed. It has been revealed that quantum dot (QD) LDs typically exhibit superior radiation tolerance compared to quantum well LDs or LDs with bulk active layers due to the enhanced confinement of carriers and reduced active areas in QD LDs, indicating significant potential for space applications. Furthermore, current challenges and issues in this field are discussed and addressed, providing a perspective and outlook for further research. Our review aims to guide the development of suitable light sources for future space laser communications, fostering high-performance satellite communications networks.},

  abstract     = {The effective treatment of long-gap peripheral nerve injury (PNI) remains a challenge in clinical settings. The autograft, the gold standard for the long-gap PNI therapy, has several limitations, including a limited supply of donor nerve, size mismatch between the donor and recipient sites, functional loss at the donor site, neuroma formation, and the requirement for two operations. With the increasing abundance of biocompatible materials with adjustable structures and properties, tissue engineering provides a promising avenue for bridging peripheral nerve gaps and addressing the above issues of autograft. The physical cues provided by tissue engineering scaffolds, essential for regulating the neural cell fate and microenvironments, have received considerable research attention. This review elaborates on three major physical cues of tissue engineering scaffolds for peripheral nerve regeneration: topological structure, mechanical support, and electrical stimulation. These three aspects are analogs to Lego bricks, wherein different combinations result in diverse functions. Innovative and more effective bricks, along with multi-level and all-around integration, are expected to provide new advances in tissue engineering for peripheral nerve generation.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and laparoscopic surgery are extremely challenging because of the small length scales, the requirements of wireless manipulation, operational accuracy, and precise localization. In this regard, miniaturized magnetic soft robotic swimmers (MSRS) are attractive candidates since they offer a contactless mode of operation for precise path maneuvering. Inspired by nature, researchers have designed these small-scale intelligent machines to demonstrate enhanced swimming performance through viscous fluidic media using different modes of propulsion. In this review paper, we identify and classify nature-inspired basic swimming modes that have been optimized over large evolutionary timescales. For example, ciliary swimmers like Paramecium and Coleps are covered with tiny hairlike filaments (cilia) that beat rhythmically using coordinated wave movements for propulsion and to gather food. Undulatory swimmers such as spermatozoa and midge larvae use traveling body waves to push the surrounding fluid for effective propulsion through highly viscous environments. Helical swimmers like bacteria rotate their slender whiskers (flagella) for locomotion through stagnant viscid fluids. Essentially, all the three modes of swimming employ nonreciprocal motion to achieve spatial asymmetry. We provide a mechanistic understanding of magnetic-field-induced spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking principles adopted by MSRS for the effective propulsion at such small length scales. Furthermore, theoretical and computational tools that can precisely predict the magnetically driven large deformation fluid–structure interaction of these MSRS are discussed. Here, we present a holistic descriptive review of the recent developments in these smart material systems covering the wide spectrum of their fabrication techniques, nature-inspired design, biomedical applications, swimming strategies, magnetic actuation, and modeling approaches. Finally, we present the future prospects of these promising material systems. Specifically, synchronous tracking and noninvasive imaging of these external agents during in vivo clinical applications still remains a daunting task. Furthermore, their experimental demonstrations have mostly been limited to in vitro and ex vivo phantom models where the dynamics of the testing conditions are quite different compared the in vivo conditions. Additionally, multi-shape morphing and multi-stimuli-responsive modalities of these active structures demand further advancements in 4D printing avenues. Their multi-state configuration as an active solid-fluid continuum would require the development of multi-scale models. Eventually, adding multiple levels of intelligence would enhance their adaptivity, functionalities, and reliability during critical biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Solution-based processing of two-dimensional (2D) materials has garnered significant interest as a facile and versatile route for the large-scalable production of 2D material films. Despite the benefits in process, these films were not considered suitable for device applications during the early stages of research because their electronic properties were far from those of 2D materials obtained through micromechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition. Due to the small lateral dimensions and polydisperse thickness of constituent 2D nanosheets, the resulting film tends to be porous and exhibits numerous inter-sheet junctions, primarily contacting edge-to-edge. This nanosheet morphology leads to poor electrical conductivity of the network, and also hinders the film functioning as a semiconductor or an insulator. To produce ultrathin 2D nanosheets with narrow thickness distribution and large lateral sizes, various chemical exfoliation strategies have been explored, but these are limited by long process times, involvement of harsh chemicals, and/or undesired structural damage or phase changes. Recent breakthroughs in electrochemical exfoliation using tetraalkylammonium intercalants enabled the production of high-quality 2D nanosheets with structural characteristics favorable for producing ultrathin, conformal films of 2D materials, which allow for scalable production of high-performance electronic components that can readily be assembled into functional devices via solution-processing. In this review article, we aim to offer an extensive introduction solution-based processing techniques for acquiring 2D nanosheets, their subsequent assembly into thin films, and their diverse applications, primarily focusing on electronics and optoelectronics but also extending to other fields. Remaining challenges and potential avenues for advancement will also be discussed.},

  abstract     = {Photonic integrated circuits play an increasingly important role in several emerging technologies. Their functionality arises from a combination of integrated components, e.g., couplers, splitters, polarization rotators, and wavelength selective filters. Efficient and accurate simulation of these components is crucial for circuit design and optimization. In dielectric systems, design procedures typically rely on coupled-mode theory (CMT) methods, which then guide subsequent refined full-wave calculations. Miniaturization to deep sub-wavelength scales requires the inclusion of lossy plasmonic (metal) components, making optimization more complicated by the interplay between coupling and absorption. Even though CMT is well developed, there is no consensus as to how to rigorously and quantitatively implement it for lossy systems. Here we present an intuitive coupled-mode theory framework for quantitative analysis of dielectric–plasmonic directional and adiabatic couplers, whose large-scale implementation in 3D is prohibitively slow with full-wave methods. This framework relies on adapting existing coupled mode theory approaches by including loss as a perturbation. This approach will be useful in designing dielectric–plasmonic circuits, providing a first reference point for anyone using techniques such as inverse design and deep learning optimization methods.},

However, due to the diffraction limit, a slew of THz studies are restricted to drawing conclusions from the spatially varying THz responses around half of the probing wavelengths, i.e., from tens to a couple of hundred micrometers. To address this fundamental challenge, scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), notably scattering-type SNOM (s-SNOM), combined with THz sources has been employed and is fueling growing interest in this technique across multiple disciplines.

The wound healing cascade may be altered due to the progression of certain diseases, such as diabetes, venous hypertension, or peripheral arterial disease, resulting in non-healing chronic wounds. Chronic wounds can be characterized by a wide variety of pathologies including increased reactive oxygen species, ineffective neutrophil activity, overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chronic hypoxia. Medical intervention is crucial to heal chronic wounds. This review explores current research to engineer improved chronic wound treatment devices, dressings, and constructs to facilitate tissue regeneration and wound closure. This review first covers different physical stimulation therapies, then, local therapeutic delivery systems, and finally three-dimensional (bio)printing techniques for the fabrication of skin grafts and wound dressings.

  abstract     = {The rapid progress of the internet of things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence has increased demand for high-performance computing. This demand has led to a focused exploration of novel nonvolatile memory (NVM) and brain-inspired neuromorphic-computing electronics, with research efforts directed at identifying materials compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Exploring fluorite-structured hafnium-zirconium oxide (HZO) mixed oxides has revealed promising ferroelectric (FE) and memristor characteristics, suggesting potential applications in emerging technologies. However, certain intrinsic properties of HZO-based FEs, such as high coercive fields ( E c ) and polarization metastability, may pose challenges for commercial viability. Recent investigations of fluorite-structured HZO-based antiferroelectrics (AFEs) have highlighted their advantages, including lower energetic barriers, higher switching speeds, and a uniform phase distribution. These inherent benefits position fluorite-structured HZO-based AFEs as potential candidates within the NVM landscape. Furthermore, the accumulated polarization and spontaneous depolarization characteristics of fluorite-structured HZO-based AFEs make them worthy of potential integration into neuromorphic-computing because they resemble certain aspects of neuron behavior. Despite these positive aspects, a more thorough exploration and consideration are needed to address existing challenges. This review aims to present fluorite-structured HZO-based AFE materials and highlight the current challenges, possible applications, and future opportunities and can act as an update for recent developments in these intriguing materials and provide guidance for future researchers in the optimization and design of HZO-based AFE materials and devices for emerging NVM and neuromorphic-computing applications.},

  abstract     = {Recent technological breakthroughs in synchrotron and x-ray free electron laser facilities have revolutionized nanoscale structural and dynamic analyses in condensed matter systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements in coherent scattering and diffractive imaging techniques, which are now at the forefront of exploring materials science complexities. These techniques, notably Bragg coherent diffractive imaging and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic dichroism, and x-ray correlation analysis leverage beam coherence to achieve volumetric three-dimensional imaging at unprecedented sub-nanometer resolutions and explore dynamic phenomena within sub-millisecond timeframes. Such capabilities are critical in understanding and developing advanced materials and technologies. Simultaneously, the emergence of chiral crystals—characterized by their unique absence of standard inversion, mirror, or other roto-inversion symmetries—presents both challenges and opportunities. These materials exhibit distinctive interactions with light, leading to phenomena such as molecular optical activity, chiral photonic waveguides, and valley-specific light emissions, which are pivotal in the burgeoning fields of photonic and spintronic devices. This review elucidates how novel x-ray probes can be leveraged to unravel these properties and their implications for future technological applications. A significant focus of this review is the exploration of new avenues in research, particularly the shift from conventional methods to more innovative approaches in studying these chiral materials. Inspired by structured optical beams, the potential of coherent scattering techniques utilizing twisted x-ray beams is examined. This promising direction not only offers higher spatial resolution but also opens the door to previously unattainable insights in materials science. By contextualizing these advancements within the broader scientific landscape and highlighting their practical applications, this review aims to chart a course for future research in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract     = {Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable efficiencies comparable to those of their established silicon counterparts at a very fast pace. Moreover, solution-processable facile technologies offer low-cost, low-temperature, scalable fabrication of these solar cells. Numerous studies have focused on improving the performance, stability, and processing of PSCs. However, potential lead toxicity and poor long-term stability impede their commercialization. In recent years, several studies have developed novel encapsulants for PSCs that can simultaneously improve stability and impede potential lead leakage. Although improvements have been made on both fronts, no solution to date could achieve a level of stability and leakage prevention that could result in a market breakthrough. Here, we analyze PSC encapsulation and lead leakage prevention techniques undertaken in recent years. While most of the related studies focused on improving either stability or toxicity, we note that both can be solved together with a suitable encapsulant that is impermeable to both moisture and Pb 2+ ions. In addition, the lack of a unified standard stability testing protocol has led to stability testing under a variety of temperatures, humidities, and environmental conditions. Therefore, the urgency for a standard protocol for stability and lead toxicity testing cannot be overlooked.},

By manipulating the doping level of the carrier, the localization of the free electron wavefunction can be tuned, leading to multi-level variations in resistance. This memristive switching behavior is in all electronic and displays excellent switching uniformity, holding great potential for applications in high-density memories and neuromorphic computing chips.},

  abstract     = {To reach a long term viable green hydrogen economy, rational design of active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical. An important hurdle in this reaction originates from the fact that the reactants are singlet molecules, whereas the oxygen molecule has a triplet ground state with parallel spin alignment, implying that magnetic order in the catalyst is essential. Accordingly, multiple experimentalists reported a positive effect of external magnetic fields on OER activity of ferromagnetic catalysts. However, it remains a challenge to investigate the influence of the intrinsic magnetic order on catalytic activity. Here, we tuned the intrinsic magnetic order of epitaxial La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 thin film model catalysts from ferro- to paramagnetic by changing the temperature in situ during water electrolysis. Using this strategy, we show that ferromagnetic ordering below the Curie temperature enhances OER activity. Moreover, we show a slight current density enhancement upon application of an external magnetic field and find that the dependence of magnetic field direction correlates with the magnetic anisotropy in the catalyst film. Our work, thus, suggests that both the intrinsic magnetic order in La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 films and magnetic domain alignment increase their catalytic activity. We observe no long-range magnetic order at the catalytic surface, implying that the OER enhancement is connected to the magnetic order of the bulk catalyst. Combining the effects found with existing literature, we propose a unifying picture for the spin-polarized enhancement in magnetic oxide catalysts.},

At low temperatures, the conduction channels through the bulk of the material are fully gapped, making 3DTIs perfect systems to study the 2D transport behavior of Dirac fermions. Here, we report a 3DTI Bi 1.1 Sb 0.9 STe 2 with a reduced level of defects, and thus, high-temperature insulating behavior in its bulk states. The insulator-to-metal transition occurs at ∼250 K, below which the bulk contributions are negligible. Even at room temperature, the conductivity contribution from the bulk channel is less than 20%. Quantum transport properties of topological surface states are observed in the Bi 1.1 Sb 0.9 STe 2 nanoflake devices, e.g., high Hall mobility (∼1150 cm 2 /V s at 3 K), strong Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations with π Berry phase, weak antilocalization, and electron–electron interaction. Notably, additional oscillation patterns with quasi-periodicity-in- B and field-independent amplitude features are observed. The surface dominant transport behavior up to room temperature suggests that Bi 1.1 Sb 0.9 STe 2 is a room temperature topological insulator for electronic/spintronic applications.},

In particular, amorphous oxide channel exhibits inherent advantages on mass productions based on a low-temperature processability compatible with cost-effective large-sized glass. Here, we developed hydrogen defect termination to produce amorphous-GaO x (a-GaO x ) channel for n -channel oxide-TFT and demonstrated high-mobility a-GaO x -TFT exhibiting a high saturation mobility ( μ sat ) of ∼31 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , threshold voltage ( V th ) of ∼3.3 V, a current on/off ratio of ∼10 8 , and subthreshold swing value ( s -value) of ∼1.17 V·dec −1 . The study found that oxygen conditions during the channel fabrication process, i.e., oxygen partial pressure during the film deposition and post-thermal annealing atmospheres, were critical for the TFT performances of gallium oxide-TFTs, and subgap defects originated from low-valence Ga + state and excess oxygen rather than oxygen vacancy had a large responsibility for the device performances. The finding explains why the development of gallium oxide-TFTs is largely behind the other oxide-TFTs. We also fabricated depletion and enhancement-mode a-GaO x -TFTs and developed a full-swing zero- V GS -load inverter with high voltage gain ∼200 and sufficient noise margins. The present study demonstrates a high potential of gallium oxide channel for low-temperature processed n -channel oxide-TFT for next-generation electronic applications.},

One is the only focus on far-field control to eliminate temperature distortion in the background while neglecting near-field regulation in the functional region. Another is lacking adaptability due to complex devices like thermoelectric modules and stepping motors. To tackle these challenges, the concept of diffusive superimposed dipoles characterized by orthogonal thermal dipole moments is proposed. Cooperative near- and far-field regulation of temperature fields is achieved by designing superimposed dipole moments, enabling transparency, and cloaking functionalities with isotropic and homogeneous materials. Simulation and experiment outcomes affirm the efficacy of this adaptive thermal field control technique, even when interface thermal resistance is taken into account. Adaptivity stems from dipole moment decomposability, allowing metadevices to operate in various heat flux directions (0°–360°) and background thermal conductivity. These findings could pave the way for cooperative and adaptive thermal management and hold potential applications in other Laplace fields, including direct current and hydrodynamics.},

By tuning the layer stacking pattern, symmetry-breaking and electric polarization can be created in otherwise non-polar crystals, whose polarization reversal depends on the interlayer sliding motion. Herein, we demonstrate that in a vdW layered ferroelectric, its existing polarization is closely coupled to the interlayer sliding driven by hydrostatic pressure. Through combined structural, electrical, vibrational characterizations, and theoretical calculations, we clearly map out the structural evolution of CuInP 2 S 6 under pressure. A tendency toward a high polarization state is observed in the low-pressure region, followed by an interlayer-sliding-mediated phase transition from a monoclinic to a trigonal phase. Along the transformation pathway, the displacive-instable Cu ion serves as a pivot point that regulates the interlayer interaction in response to external pressure. The rich phase diagram of CuInP 2 S 6 , which is enabled by stacking orders, sheds light on the physics of vdW ferroelectricity and opens an alternative route to tailoring long-range order in vdW layered crystals.},

  abstract     = {Strain engineering is an important method to control the structure and properties of functional thin films. Here, a new method to induce chemical strain through controllable substrate strain is proposed, which was first applied to double-perovskite thin films. We significantly improved the ferroelectricity of BiSmFe 2 O 6- δ double-perovskite thin films to ∼4.80 μ C/cm 2 , approximately improved six times. The value is more excellent than that of the orthorhombic double-perovskite ferroelectric systems. Synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction and spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy show that tensile strain can change the epitaxial growth mode and increase the lattice volume. Meanwhile, first-principles density functional theory calculations show that the tensile strain reduces the formation energy of oxygen vacancy. The increased oxygen vacancies can induce a large negative chemical pressure of −7.69 GPa imposed on the thin films on SrTiO 3 substrates. The existence of more oxygen vacancies in the Fe-O octahedra of the thin films drives Fe ions away from their high-symmetrical central position, leading to the improvement of ferroelectricity. In addition, the large polarization and oxygen vacancy migration promote the improved functional properties of the thin films, such as large resistive switching (10 3 times). This strategy and approach will effectively promote the further application of the novel orthorhombic rare-earth double-perovskite devices.},

  abstract     = {Scalable integrated single-photon sources are critical for quantum photonics and can enable applications such as high-speed quantum communication and quantum information processing. Ideally, to establish a scalable platform, such single-photon sources require emission speed-up and efficient extraction in a single architecture, especially for extremely large extraction decay rates. However, this goal remains elusive so far. Current approaches to enhance photon extraction decay rates for plasmonic nanostructures, including hybrid antennas, plasmonic cavities, photonic hypercrystals, and metamaterials, are either dependent on hybrid plasmonic modes, which suffer from structural complexity, or limited by poor outcoupling efficiency. Here, we propose a novel paradigm—spatial topological transition in the architecture of feasible metamaterial structure (e.g., an array of silver flat-topped conical rods), which can strongly enhance the photon extraction decay rate of quantum emitters. The underlying physics relies on the emerging unique feature of spatial topological transitions due to the transition from elliptical to hyperbolic iso-frequency contours in a single spatially varying metamaterial. Hence, the supported high-k eigenmodes in the metamaterial can now become momentum-matched with the radiative modes. More importantly, due to the existence of elliptical and hyperbolic zones, it is possible to allow for the realization of an extremely large value of extraction decay rate. Our results thus represent a crucial step for the integration of single-photon sources into photonic quantum networks and quantum information applications.},

Existing cryptosystems based on complex cipher algorithms generally require extensive computational resources, making them difficult to use in vision sensors that have limited processing capabilities. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel in situ image cryptography scheme based on a neuromorphic vision sensor comprising all-optically controlled (AOC) memristors. Due to the unique light wavelength and irradiation history-dependent bidirectional persistent photoconductivity of AOC memristors, a visual image can be stored, encrypted, decrypted, denoised, and destroyed within a vision sensor. A decrypted image can be encoded in situ and then accurately recognized through a memristive neural network. Encrypted and destroyed images are capable of withstanding hacking attacks even with trained neural networks. Our cryptography scheme enables complete cryptographic operations entirely on a sensor and, therefore, effectively safeguards visual information. This work provides a simple yet efficient solution to the security challenges faced by vision sensors.},

Toward these applications, a broad and controllable linear dynamic range (DR) is desirable for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reliability. Here, we develop a comprehensive strain-enhanced DR model for 2D NEMS resonators, which is experimentally verified through the tuning of DRs in 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) NEMS resonators using gate-induced strain. We find that the resonance frequency, quality factor, and nonlinear coefficient are all tuned by the gate voltage, which enhance the DR together. Through the guidance of the DR tuning model, we demonstrate DR enhancement by up to 26.9 dB (from 69.5 to 96.4 dB) in a 2D MoS 2 NEMS resonator by properly tuning the gate voltage, leading to a theoretical mass resolution of 26 yg (1 yg = 10 −24 g). To accurately extract the DR, we further differentiate the quality factors for thermomechanical resonances and for resonances at the largest linear amplitude. This gate-enhanced DR model is also verified using a MoTe 2 resonator, with DR enhancement of 7 dB (91.2 to 98.2 dB). The results provide a promising pathway for accurately predicting and optimizing the DRs in NEMS resonators, toward enhanced sensitivity and SNR in mass sensing, radio frequency signal processing, memory, and computing applications.},

  abstract     = {The recently developed concept of optical skyrmions has introduced an exciting dimension to the emerging field of Poincaré engineering in optical lattices. There remains an unexplored territory in investigating system geometries to enhance the versatility of manipulating the topological landscape within optical lattices. Here, we present both experimental and theoretical evidence showcasing the periodic vectorial characteristics of field- and spin-based skyrmion lattices, generated by plasmonic vortices with varying topological charges. Our findings reveal that the geometric symmetry of the system plays a pivotal role in governing the periodic arrangement of these vortex patterns. Building upon this arrangement, the orbital–orbital coupling of plasmonic vortices gives rise to densely packed energy flow distributions, intricately bonded to topological charges. Consequently, this results in the formation of sublattices within the momentum space, each characterized by distinct k-vectors. Skyrmion and meron topologies, driven by the intrinsic spin–orbital coupling, are presented in these lattices. This proposed framework illuminates how symmetry serves as a fundamental tool in the manipulation of optical lattice topologies, opening up new avenues in fields ranging from optical trapping, laser writing, quantum gas microscopy, to electron quantum state control, each of which is poised to benefit from these nontrivial advances.},

These studies show the effect of cationic alloying of antiferromagnetic RTe 3 for fully tunable near room-temperature CDW properties. Dy x Gd 1−x Te 3 and Dy x Tb 1−x Te 3 alloys were synthesized through a chemical vapor transport technique, and the rare-earth element composition was controlled by changing the ratio of rare-earth metal reagents. The results show that the lattice parameters can be continuously tuned with the composition of the rare-earth cations leading to the variation of the internal chemical pressure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and electric transport measurement show that the CDW transition temperature (T CDW ) of RTe 3 alloys varies with lattice parameters/chemical pressure spanning across 300–380 K. Additional magnetism studies offer the first insights into the magnetic ordering in RTe 3 alloys. The emergence of multiple magnetic transitions implies complex magnetic interactions that arise from interactions between different rare-earth elements. Overall findings introduce ways to control the CDW behavior and provide valuable insights into the magnetic ordering in RTe 3 alloys, contributing to further investigation and a better understanding of their properties.},

  abstract     = {The desire for intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (κ L ) in thermoelectrics motivates numerous efforts on understanding the microscopic mechanisms of heat transport in solids. Here, based on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that α-MgAgSb hosts low-energy localized phonon bands and avoided crossing of the rattler modes, which coincides with the inelastic neutron scattering result. Using the two-channel lattice dynamical approach, we find, besides the conventional contribution (∼70% at 300 K) from particlelike phonons propagating, the coherence contribution dominated by the wavelike tunneling of phonons accounts for ∼30% of the total κ L at 300 K. By considering dual contributions, our calculated room-temperature κ L of 0.64 W m −1 K −1 well agrees with the experimental value of 0.63 W m −1 K −1 . More importantly, our computations give a nonstandard κ L ∝ T −0.61 dependence, perfectly explaining the abnormal temperature-trend of ∼ T −0.57 in experiment for α-MgAgSb. By molecular dynamics simulation, we reveal that the structure simultaneously has soft crystalline sublattices with the metavalent bonding and fluctuating liquid-like sublattices with thermally induced large amplitude vibrations. These diverse forms of chemical bonding arouse mixed part-crystal part-liquid state, scatter strongly heat-carrying phonons, and finally produce extremely low κ L . The fundamental research from this study will accelerate the design of ultralow-κ L materials for energy-conversion applications.},

The microwave-induced ac current and magnetization precession both at GHz frequencies can cooperatively generate a dc voltage. In conventional ferromagnets, this effect, dubbed as resonant AHE (RAHE), is often overwhelmed by other effects such as spin pumping and spin rectification induced by anisotropic magnetoresistance. Here, we observe the RAHE in Co 2 MnGa, a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal. In this material, the RAHE dominates over other effects, as observed in angle-dependent measurements. The RAHE in Co 2 MnGa is an order of magnitude larger than in Permalloy, a conventional ferromagnet. This enhancement is induced by the Berry curvature in the topological band structure of Co 2 MnGa. The large RAHE demonstrated in this work provides a viable methodology to convert microwave signals into dc voltages for telecommunication applications.},

Furthermore, direct and high-efficiency drug release to cells is realized by constructing the other fluid–solid interface on the back side of cells, where drugs are encapsulated within cross-linked alginate hydrogel in the open microfluidic channel.

Taking materials with Zinc-Blende structure as an example, we reveal that such systems can naturally generate various polarization-entangled Bell states over a very broad range of wavelengths and emission directions, with little to no engineering needed. Interestingly, we uncover different regimes of operation, where polarization-entangled photons can be generated with dependence on or complete independence from the pumping wavelength and polarization, and the modal content of the nanoresonator.

Although this system has been shown to exhibit unconventional superconducting properties, the underlying mechanism of the superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we provide experimental evidence of the microscopic coexistence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity and broken space-inversion symmetry in the Ni/Bi bilayer. The evidence is obtained from nonreciprocal transport around the superconducting transition temperature, where the resistance depends on the direction of an applied current and an external magnetic field. We find that the nonreciprocal superconducting transport is most pronounced around the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition temperature. These observations support the 2D Rashba superconductivity in the Ni/Bi bilayer, which will serve as a basis for advancing the understanding of unconventional superconductivity.},

In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution system; focus on protocols based on coherent states, whose systems are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. We start by reviewing the theoretical protocols and the current security status of these protocols. Then, we discuss the system structure, the key module, and the mainstream system implementations.

  abstract     = {In the continuously evolving realm of nonlinear optics, epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials have captured significant scientific interest, becoming a compelling focal point over the past decade. During this time, researchers have shown extraordinary demonstrations of nonlinear processes such as unity order index change via intensity dependent refractive index, enhanced second harmonic generation, saturable absorption in ultra-thin films and more recently, frequency shifting via time modulation of permittivity. More recently, remarkable strides have also been made in uncovering the intricacies of ENZ materials&#39; nonlinear optical behavior. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the various types of nonlinearities commonly observed in these systems, with a focus on Drude based homogenous materials. By categorizing the enhancement into intrinsic and extrinsic factors, it provides a framework to compare the nonlinearity of ENZ media with other nonlinear media. The review emphasizes that while ENZ materials may not significantly surpass the nonlinear capabilities of traditional materials, either in terms of fast or slow nonlinearity, they do offer distinct advantages. These advantages encompass an optimal response time, inherent enhancement of slow light effects, and a broadband characteristic, all encapsulated in a thin film that can be purchased off-the shelf. The review further builds upon this framework and not only identifies key properties of transparent conducting oxides that have so far made them ideal test beds for ENZ nonlinearities, but also brings to light alternate material systems, such as perovskite oxides, that could potentially outperform them. We conclude by reviewing the upcoming concepts of time varying physics with ENZ media and outline key points the research community is working toward.},

The marriage of electrochemistry and optical modulation has infused fascinating properties in electrochromic devices, which find applications in thermal management, display, smart windows, and camouflage. Inspired by the multipronged advancements in electrochemical devices, the incorporation of multivalent metal ions having rich electrochemistry into electrochromic devices is bloomed in recent years. Zinc, distinguished by its high crustal abundance, suitable standard redox potential, and inherent safety, has facilitated the assembly of highly efficient electrochromic devices. Zinc anode-based electrochromic devices with dual-band (visible and near-infrared) tunability, energy retrieval functions, multi-color options, multiple working modes (transmittance mode and reflectance mode), and scalability have been prominently showcased. Here in this review, the birth of zinc anode-based electrochromic devices will be systematically narrated, starting from the discovery of electrochromic phenomenon, to the evolution of electrochromic devices, and to the latest achievements in zinc anode-based electrochromic devices. Additionally, this review delves into the future development trends and perspectives of zinc anode-based electrochromic devices. This review serves as a handbook, which summarizes the history of electrochromism, introduces the physics behind it, highlights the development in zinc anode-based electrochromic devices, and aims to inspire future endeavors into this field, particularly those focused on developing energy-efficient electrochromic devices.},

  abstract     = {As society strides toward a sustainable future powered by lithium-ion batteries, the integral role of polymeric binders becomes increasingly evident. Historically serving as a film former and chemical adhesive that amalgamates the active host materials and conductive carbon in battery electrodes, their role has been redefined with the advent of innovative battery systems and host materials. These emerging technologies pose unique challenges, propelling the shift toward “customizable” binder designs. Polymeric binders should now ensure structural robustness, especially for high-capacity host materials, by leveraging varied intermolecular interactions to counteract internal stresses. Additionally, incorporating high-voltage electrode materials or electrolytes demands binders with an expansive electrochemical stability window. The interface energy control of binders is also critical, especially when incorporating dissolving cathodes or transitioning to solid-state electrolytes. This review provides a comprehensive understanding, breaking down the design principles of polymeric binders into three distinct paradigms: (1) structural design for high-capacity anodes, (2) electrochemical design for high-voltage cathodes or electrolytes, and (3) interfacial design for dissolving cathodes and solid-state batteries. Our discourse offers both a reflection on the evolving multifunctional nature of binders and a roadmap for future endeavors in the binder design for advanced lithium battery chemistries.},

Synthesis of new material is typically followed by a set of characterization steps aiming to provide feedback for optimization or discover fundamental mechanisms. However, the sequence of synthesis and characterization methods and their interpretation, or research workflow, has traditionally been driven by human intuition and is highly domain specific. Here, we explore concepts of scientific workflows that emerge at the interface between theory, characterization, and imaging. We discuss the criteria by which these workflows can be constructed for special cases of multiresolution structural imaging and functional characterization, as a part of more general material synthesis workflows. Some considerations for theory–experiment workflows are provided. We further pose that the emergence of user facilities and cloud labs disrupts the classical progression from ideation, orchestration, and execution stages of workflow development. To accelerate this transition, we propose the framework for workflow design, including universal hyperlanguages describing laboratory operation, ontological domain matching, reward functions and their integration between domains, and policy development for workflow optimization. These tools will enable knowledge-based workflow optimization; enable lateral instrumental networks, sequential and parallel orchestration of characterization between dissimilar facilities; and empower distributed research.},

  abstract     = {Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are increasingly found in all realms of the world, including water and soil. Now, there is growing concern over this type of pollution in the air. Many well-established techniques exist for detecting particulate matter (PM) in the air. They are low-cost and handheld, and some of them even allow direct detection from the air. While various MNP detection methods have been demonstrated, airborne MNP detection methods depend on expensive laboratory instruments. This review paper examines the current analytic methods used to identify PM and MNP and discusses their similarities and differences. PM can be detected directly from the air primarily via light scattering, while direct air detection of MNP has not been demonstrated. Sampling steps allow both PM and MNP to be detected from the air. Since PM detection does not require the type identification of materials, mass detection has been utilized, including gravimetric and microbalance methods. Simple optical detection based on absorbance or reflectance and electrical current measurements have also been used for PM detection. However, MNP detection does require type identification, including plastic vs non-plastic or the type of plastic, requiring more sophisticated methods, including spectroscopic and thermal analyses. Microscopic identification has been utilized for both PM and MNP detection since it can identify the size, morphology, autofluorescence, and spectroscopic properties. Machine learning algorithms can also analyze the microscopic images and spectra to identify the type of PM and MNP. While microscopic identification previously required a bulky benchtop microscope, a portable or even handheld microscope has become available, allowing it to detect MNPs in a portable, low-cost manner.},

  abstract     = {The recent successes of superconducting qubits and the demonstration of quantum supremacy over classical bits herald a new era for information processing. Yet, the field is still in its infancy and there exist viable alternative candidates that can also store quantum information. In this review, we will highlight ideas, attempts, and the experimental progress to address nuclear spins in graphene, a readily available Dirac semimetal that consists of a single layer of carbon atoms. Carbon isotopes with a nuclear spin are rare in natural graphene. However, it is possible to enrich the spin-bearing 13 C isotopes to produce large-scale graphene sheets, which constitute the testbed to store, transport, and retrieve spin information, or to engineer nanostructures. Here, the hyperfine interaction between the electron spins and the nuclear spins serves as an experimental control knob and mediator to address nuclear polarization and nuclear spin coherence times through electrical measurements. The exploitation of nuclear spins in graphene is thus an alluring perspective. We will discuss methods to synthesize 13 C graphene and show experimental approaches and challenges to exploit the relatively weak hyperfine interaction in two-dimensional 13 C graphene devices. The ultimate purpose, i.e., the exploitation of nuclear spins in graphene for information processing, is not within reach, but its potential for future applications merits a revisit of the current state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Doped polysilicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts have emerged as a key technology for the next generation of silicon solar cells in mass production, owing to their excellent performance and high compatibility with the existing passivated emitter and rear cell technology. However, the current solar cell architecture based on a rear-side electron-selective ( n + ) poly-Si contact is also approaching its practical limit (∼26%) in mass production. The full potential of doped poly-Si passivating contacts can only be realized through incorporation of both electron-selective and hole-selective ( p + ) poly-Si contacts. While studies of both p + and n + poly-Si contacts commenced simultaneously, significant performance differences have arisen. Phosphorus-doped poly-Si contacts consistently outperform boron-doped counterparts, displaying typically lower recombination current density ( J 0 ) values ( ⁠ 1 – 5 f A/cm 2 vs 7 – 15 f A/cm 2 ). This discrepancy can be attributed to inadequate optimization of p + poly-Si contacts and fundamental limitations related to boron doping. The poorer passivation of p + poly-Si contacts can be at least partly attributed to boron segregation into the interfacial oxide layers, compromising the interfacial oxide integrity and reducing the chemical passivation effectiveness. This review critically examines the progress of p + poly-Si contacts characterized by cell efficiency and J 0 values, delves into existing challenges, identifies potential solutions, and explores some potential solar cell architectures to enhance efficiency by incorporating p + poly-Si contacts.},

Within this context, the electrostatically formed nanowire (EFN) sensor, a silicon-on-insulator-based multiple-gate field-effect transistor, is an ultrasensitive and selective VOC and gas sensing platform. Unlike conventional silicon nanowires (also known for their superior sensitivity to chemical species), in EFN, the nanowire is defined electrostatically post-fabrication through appropriate biasing of the surrounding gates. The fabrication of the EFN leverages established CMOS compatible silicon processing technologies, facilitating the production of inexpensive, scalable, and robust sensors. By precisely controlling gate biases, a conductive channel with a tunable diameter is formed, allowing for the formation of nanowire with diameter below 20 nm. The adjustable size and shape of the nanowire offer tunable sensing parameters, including sensitivity, limit of detection, and dynamic range. The multiple parameters also yield a unique fingerprint for each VOC, thus enabling selective detection of VOCs. By simply altering the biasing configuration, a single EFN sensor can achieve high sensitivity and a broad dynamic range, which is limited in the case of physically defined silicon NW sensors. This review provides a comprehensive overview encompassing the EFN sensor&#39;s design, fabrication considerations, process flow, electrical characterization methods, sensing performances to VOCs, and gases at room temperature. Moreover, the scope of advanced sensor designs with array of EFN sensors and integrated heaters is also discussed. Finally, some future perspectives of this technology are presented.},

Exploring the impact of their different structures on the anode/electrolyte interface allows the tailoring of ILs for post-Li-ion batteries. This comprehensive review gives an overview of the current challenges of different metal anodes, followed by a fundamental understanding of metal anode/electrolyte interface evolution in ILs in a coherent manner, highlighting the potential of ILs to address the specific problems of each type of metal anode. Electrochemical reactions—such as passivating film formation, metal deposition/stripping, dendritic growth—occurring at the metal anodes in IL-based electrolytes are openly debated, and how ILs can help to improve these phenomena is presented. Unanswered scientific questions on the nature of electrode/electrolyte coupling are identified. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are proposed regarding the development, limitations, and opportunities of metal anode/ionic liquid interfaces. This timely review will expose literature gaps and provide novel opportunities to exploit ILs in materials science and technology research.},

  abstract     = {Graphene-based materials and DNA probes/nanostructures have emerged as building blocks for constructing powerful biosensors. Graphene-based materials possess exceptional properties, including two-dimensional atomically flat basal planes for biomolecule binding. DNA probes serve as excellent selective probes, exhibiting specific recognition capabilities toward diverse target analytes. Meanwhile, DNA nanostructures function as placement scaffolds, enabling the precise organization of molecular species at nanoscale and the positioning of complex biomolecular assays. The interplay of DNA probes/nanostructures and graphene-based materials has fostered the creation of intricate hybrid materials with user-defined architectures. This advancement has resulted in significant progress in developing novel biosensors for detecting DNA, RNA, small molecules, and proteins, as well as for DNA sequencing. Consequently, a profound understanding of the interactions between DNA and graphene-based materials is key to developing these biological devices. In this review, we systematically discussed the current comprehension of the interaction between DNA probes and graphene-based materials, and elucidated the latest advancements in DNA probe–graphene-based biosensors. Additionally, we concisely summarized recent research endeavors involving the deposition of DNA nanostructures on graphene-based materials and explored imminent biosensing applications by seamlessly integrating DNA nanostructures with graphene-based materials. Finally, we delineated the primary challenges and provided prospective insights into this rapidly developing field. We envision that this review will aid researchers in understanding the interactions between DNA and graphene-based materials, gaining deeper insight into the biosensing mechanisms of DNA–graphene-based biosensors, and designing novel biosensors for desired applications.},

  abstract     = {The recent development of multidimensional ultrafast spectroscopy techniques calls for the introduction of computational schemes that allow for the simulation of such experiments and the interpretation of the corresponding results from a microscopic point of view. In this work, we present a general and efficient first-principles scheme to compute two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy maps based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory. The interface of this approach with the Ehrenfest scheme for molecular dynamics enables the inclusion of vibronic effects in the calculations based on a classical treatment of the nuclei. The computational complexity of the simulations is reduced by the application of numerical advances such as branching techniques, undersampling, and a novel reduced phase cycling scheme, applicable for systems with inversion symmetry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to prototypical molecules such as benzene, pyridine, and pyrene. We discuss the role of the approximations that inevitably enter the adopted theoretical framework and set the stage for further extensions of the proposed method to more realistic systems.},

  abstract     = {Adoptive T cell immunotherapies, including engineered T cell receptor (eTCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies, have shown efficacy in treating a subset of hematologic malignancies, exhibit promise in solid tumors, and have many other potential applications, such as in fibrosis, autoimmunity, and regenerative medicine. While immunoengineering has focused on designing biomaterials to present biochemical cues to manipulate T cells ex vivo and in vivo , mechanical cues that regulate their biology have been largely underappreciated. This review highlights the contributions of mechanical force to several receptor–ligand interactions critical to T cell function, with central focus on the TCR–peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). We then emphasize the role of mechanical forces in (i) allosteric strengthening of the TCR–pMHC interaction in amplifying ligand discrimination during T cell antigen recognition prior to activation and (ii) T cell interactions with the extracellular matrix. We then describe approaches to design eTCRs, CARs, and biomaterials to exploit TCR mechanosensitivity in order to potentiate T cell manufacturing and function in adoptive T cell immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {The Von Neumann architecture has been the foundation of modern computing systems. Still, its limitations in processing large amounts of data and parallel processing have become more apparent as computing requirements increase. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for developing next-generation computing and memory devices with unprecedented computational power and significantly lower energy consumption. In particular, the development of optoelectronic artificial synaptic devices has made significant progress toward emulating the functionality of biological synapses in the brain. Among them, the potential to mimic the function of the biological eye also paves the way for advancements in robot vision and artificial intelligence. This review focuses on the emerging field of optoelectronic artificial synapses and memristors based on low-dimensional nanomaterials. The unique photoelectric properties of these materials make them ideal for use in neuromorphic and optoelectronic storage devices, with advantages including high carrier mobility, size-tunable optical properties, and low resistor–capacitor circuit delay. The working mechanisms, device structure designs, and applications of these devices are also summarized to achieve truly sense-storage-computer integrated optoelectronic artificial synapses.},

In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent advances in ultrahigh Q-factor cavities, integration of Josephson junction-based qubits, and bosonic-encoded qubits in 3D cavities. We examine the sources of quantum state dephasing caused by damping and noise mechanisms in cavities and qubits, highlighting the critical challenges that need to be addressed to achieve even higher coherence times. We critically survey the latest progress made in implementing single 3D qubits using superconducting materials, normal metals, and multi-qubit and multi-state quantum systems. Our work sheds light on the promising future of this research area, including novel materials for cavities and qubits, modes with nontrivial topological properties, error correction techniques for bosonic qubits, and new light–matter interaction effects.},
