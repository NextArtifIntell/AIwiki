  abstract     = {The unpreconditioned H-TFETI-DP (hybrid total finite element tearing and interconnecting dual-primal) domain decomposition method introduced by Klawonn and Rheinbach turned out to be an effective solver for variational inequalities discretized by huge structured grids. The basic idea is to decompose the domain into non-overlapping subdomains, interconnect some adjacent subdomains into clusters on a primal level, and enforce the continuity of the solution across both the subdomain and cluster interfaces by Lagrange multipliers. After eliminating the primal variables, we get a reasonably conditioned quadratic programming (QP) problem with bound and equality constraints. Here, we first reduce the continuous problem to the subdomains&#39; boundaries, then discretize it using the boundary element method, and finally interconnect the subdomains by the averages of adjacent edges. The resulting QP problem in multipliers with a small coarse grid is solved by specialized QP algorithms with optimal complexity. The method can be considered as a three-level multigrid with the coarse grids split between primal and dual variables. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the presented H-TBETI-DP (hybrid total boundary element tearing and interconnecting dual-primal) method and nice spectral properties of the discretized Steklov–Poincaré operators as compared with their finite element counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Mixed Finite Elements (FEs) with assumed stresses and displacements provide many advantages in analysing shell structures. They ensure good results for coarse meshes and provide an accurate representation of the stress field. The shell FEs within the family designated by the acronym Mixed Isostatic Self-equilibrated Stresses (MISS) have demonstrated high performance in linear and nonlinear problems thanks to a self-equilibrated stress assumption. This article extends the MISS family by introducing an eight nodes solid-shell FE for the analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures. The element, named MISS-4S, features 24 displacement variables and an isostatic stress representation ruled by 18 parameters. The displacement field is described only by translations, eliminating the need for complex finite rotation treatments in large displacements problems. A total Lagrangian formulation is adopted with the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor. The numerical results concerning popular shell obstacle courses prove the accuracy and robustness of the proposed formulation when using regular or distorted meshes and demonstrate the absence of any locking phenomena. Finally, convergences for pointwise and energy quantities show the superior performance of MISS-4S compared to other elements in the literature, highlighting that an isostatic and self-equilibrated stress representation, already used in shell models, also gives advantages for solid-shell FEs.},

This composition entails a structured ice skeleton surrounded by voids filled with air and spread with liquid water. Mechanically, snow experiences dynamic transformations, including bonding/degradation between its grains, significant inelastic deformations, and a distinct rate sensitivity. Given snow&#39;s varied structures and mechanical strengths in natural settings, a comprehensive constitutive model is necessary. Our study introduces a pioneering formulation grounded on the modified Cam-Clay model, extended to finite strains. This formulation is further enriched by an implicit gradient damage modeling, creating a synergistic blend that offers a detailed representation of snow behavior. The versatility of the framework is emphasized through the careful calibration of damage parameters. Such calibration allows the model to adeptly capture the effects of diverse strain rates, particularly at high magnitudes, highlighting its adaptability in replicating snow&#39;s unique mechanical responses across various conditions. Upon calibration against established experimental benchmarks, the model demonstrates a suitable alignment with observed behavior, underscoring its potential as a comprehensive tool for understanding and modeling snow behavior with precision and depth.},

  abstract     = {With the wide application of thermoelastic structures in industries such as the aerospace field, the problem of topology optimization of thermoelastic structures has become a very common and important research topic. It is well known that the thermal environment has a non-negligible influence on the dynamic performance of structures. However, few people consider the influence of the thermal environment on structural stiffness in thermoelastic dynamic topology optimization. In practical engineering applications, the influence of the environment on the structure performance should be considered to obtain the optimal structure. In this paper, we focus on the problem of dynamic topology optimization considering the effect of non-uniform temperature fields on structural stiffness. The influence of non-uniform temperature fields adds on structural stiffness to the topology optimization of thermoelastic dynamic for the first time, thereby comprehensively addressing its effects on structural stiffness in the context of dynamic topology optimization under harmonic vibration and transient load. The proposed method begins by computing the distribution of the non-uniform temperature field within the structure. Subsequently, thermal stresses in the structure are determined through the application of thermoelastic theory. The geometric stiffness matrix of the structure is then calculated using finite element theory. The dynamic topology optimization model, employing a variable density approach, is established in conjunction with the dynamic compliance design objective. Sensitivity analysis is conducted through the adjoint method, and the design variables are updated utilizing the method of moving asymptotes. Numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed method and obtain the influence of different factors on the optimization results. The results show that the dynamic compliance of the optimized structure increases with increasing heat flux. For the optimization under harmonic vibration, the optimization results obtained by different external excitation frequencies are significantly different. For transient optimization, the study discovers that the optimization present transient effect.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with quadrature/cubature rules able to deal with multiple subspaces of functions, in such a way that the integration points are common for all the subspaces, yet the (nonnegative) weights are tailored to each specific subspace. These subspace-adaptive weights cubature rules can be used to accelerate computational mechanics applications requiring efficiently evaluating spatial integrals whose integrand function dynamically switches between multiple pre-computed subspaces. One of such applications is local hyperreduced-order modeling (HROM), in which the solution manifold is approximately represented as a collection of basis matrices, each basis matrix corresponding to a different region in parameter space. The proposed optimization framework is discrete in terms of the location of the integration points, in the sense that such points are selected among the Gauss points of a given finite element mesh, and the target subspaces of functions are represented by orthogonal basis matrices constructed from the values of the functions at such Gauss points, using the singular value decomposition (SVD). This discrete framework allows us to treat also problems in which the integrals are approximated as a weighted sum of the contribution of each finite element, as in the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method of C. Farhat and co-workers. Two distinct solution strategies are examined. The first one is a greedy strategy based on an enhanced version of the empirical cubature method (ECM) developed by the authors elsewhere (we call it the subspace-adaptive weights ECM, SAW-ECM for short), while the second method is based on a convexification of the cubature problem so that it can be addressed by linear programming algorithms. We show in a toy problem involving integration of polynomial functions that the SAW-ECM clearly outperforms the other method both in terms of computational cost and optimality. On the other hand, we illustrate the performance of the SAW-ECM in the construction of a local HROMs in a highly nonlinear equilibrium problem (large strains regime). We demonstrate that, provided that the subspace-transition errors are negligible, the error associated to hyperreduction using adaptive weights can be controlled by the truncation tolerances of the SVDs used for determining the basis matrices. We also show that the number of integration points decreases notably as the number of subspaces increases, and that, in the limiting case of using as many subspaces as snapshots, the SAW-ECM delivers rules with a number of integration points only dependent on the intrinsic dimensionality of the solution manifold and the degree of overlapping required to avoid subspace-transition errors. The Python source codes of the proposed SAW-ECM are openly accessible in the public repository https://github.com/Rbravo555/localECM .},

  abstract     = {The coupling between free and porous medium flows has received significant attention since it plays an important role in a wide range of problems from fluid-soil interactions to biofluid dynamics. However, modeling this coupled process remains a difficult task as it often involves a domain decomposition algorithm in conjunction with a special treatment at the interface. The problem can become more challenging under non-isothermal conditions because it requires the iterative procedure at every time step to simultaneously meet the transient mass continuity, force equilibrium, and energy balance for the entire system. This article presents a diffuse interface framework for modeling non-isothermal Stokes-Darcy flow and the corresponding finite element formulation that bypasses the need for explicitly splitting the domain into two, which enables the unified treatment for distinct regions with different hydrothermal flow regimes. To achieve this goal, we employ the Allen-Cahn type phase field model to generate the diffuse geometry, where the solution field can be seen as a regularized approximation of the Heaviside indicator function, allowing us to transfer the interface conditions into a set of immersed boundary conditions. Our formulation suggests that the isothermal operator splitting strategy can be adopted without compromising accuracy if the heat and mass transfer processes are decoupled by assuming that the density and viscosity of the phase constituents are independent to the temperature. Numerical examples are also introduced to verify the implementation and to demonstrate the model capacity.},

  abstract     = {Several forms for constructing novel physics-informed neural-networks (PINNs) for the solution of partial-differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs) based on derivative operator splitting are proposed, using the nonlinear Kirchhoff rod as a prototype for demonstration. The present work is a natural extension of our review paper (Vu-Quoc and Humer, CMES-Comput Modeling Eng Sci , 137(2):1069–1343, 2023) aiming at both experts and first-time learners of both deep learning and PINN frameworks, among which the open-source DeepXDE (DDE; SIAM Rev , 63(1):208–228, 2021) is likely the most well documented framework with many examples. Yet, we encountered some pathological problems (time shift, amplification, static solutions) and proposed novel methods to resolve them. Among these novel methods are the PDE forms, which evolve from the lower-level form with fewer unknown dependent variables (e.g., displacements, slope, finite extension) to higher-level form with more dependent variables (e.g., forces, moments, momenta), in addition to those from lower-level forms. Traditionally, the highest-level form, the balance-of-momenta form, is the starting point for (hand) deriving the lowest-level form through a tedious (and error prone) process of successive substitutions. The next step in a finite element method is to discretize the lowest-level form upon forming a weak form and linearization with appropriate interpolation functions, followed by their implementation in a code and testing. The time-consuming tedium in all of these steps could be bypassed by applying the proposed novel PINN directly to the highest-level form. We also developed a script based on JAX, the High Performance Array Computing library. For the axial motion of elastic bar, while our JAX script did not show the pathological problems of DDE-T (DDE with TensorFlow backend), it is slower than DDE-T. Moreover, that DDE-T itself being more efficient in higher-level form than in lower-level form makes working directly with higher-level form even more attractive in addition to the advantages mentioned further above. Since coming up with an appropriate learning-rate schedule for a good solution is more art than science, we systematically codified in detail our experience running optimization (network training) through a normalization/standardization of the network-training process so readers can reproduce our results.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning has significantly impacted various fields, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in the realm of solid mechanics, benefiting greatly from the remarkable approximation capabilities of neural networks. In solving PDEs, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and the deep energy method (DEM) have garnered substantial attention. The principle of minimum potential energy and complementary energy are two important variational principles in solid mechanics. However, the well-known DEM is based on the principle of minimum potential energy, but it lacks the important form of minimum complementary energy. To bridge this gap, we propose the deep complementary energy method (DCEM) based on the principle of minimum complementary energy. The output function of DCEM is the stress function, which inherently satisfies the equilibrium equation. We present numerical results of classical linear elasticity using the Prandtl and Airy stress functions, and compare DCEM with existing PINNs and DEM algorithms when modeling representative mechanical problems. The results demonstrate that DCEM outperforms DEM in terms of stress accuracy and efficiency and has an advantage in dealing with complex displacement boundary conditions, which is supported by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.

The challenge is to meet the extremely high accuracy required by professional musicians, in a complex domain, for all fingerings and over a wide frequency range, within an affordable computational time. Several modelling assumptions are made to limit the numerical complexity of the problem while preserving all relevant physics. A dedicated high-performance solution strategy is also proposed, based on partitioning, condensation and model order reduction, exploiting the combinatorial nature of wind instrument fingerings. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the simulation of an alto saxophone. An order of magnitude reduction in memory and computational cost is achieved.},

Thus, an accurate regularization of the tensor-valued internal variables is essential to obtain physically correct results. Here, we focus on the regularization of anisotropic damage at finite strains. Thus, a flexible anisotropic damage model with isotropic, kinematic, and distortional hardening is equipped with three gradient-extensions using a full and two reduced regularizations of the damage tensor. Theoretical and numerical comparisons of the three gradient-extensions yield excellent agreement between the full and the reduced regularization based on a volumetric-deviatoric regularization using only two nonlocal degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {The localization of deformations plays a crucial role in the failure of granular materials. Concerning classical continuum constitutive models, the localization of deformations is considered to be connected to the loss of ellipticity of the governing rate equilibrium equations, and entails mesh sensitivity in finite element simulations. While previous studies are often limited to strain localization analyses of individual tests, the focus of the present contribution lies on studying the localization properties in general constitutive states. For this purpose, a staggered optimization algorithm for determining the loss of ellipticity, considering both extreme values, minimum and maximum, of the determinant of the acoustic tensor, is proposed. Part of this algorithm representing a novel application of spherical Fibonacci lattices for discretizing the feasible domain of the associated optimization problem. In the presented localization study of the widely recognized modified Cam-clay model, special attention is paid to determining the influence of the individual model parameters. Specifically, three factors favoring strain localization are found, namely (i) a low value of the ratio of the primary compression index and the recompression index, (ii) a large value of the critical state frictional constant, as well as (iii) a large value of Poisson&#39;s ratio. Moreover, a structural finite element study is performed, confirming the results of localization analyses at the constitutive level.},

Design updates are generated using the gradient-based method of moving asymptotes and the material is modeled using small strain, nonlinear isotropic hardening wherein the coaxiality between the plastic strain rate and stress is exploited. This formulation renders an efficient state solve and we demonstrate that the adjoint sensitivity scheme resembles that of the state update. Furthermore, the KKT condition is enforced directly into the path dependent adjoint sensitivity analysis which eliminates the need of monitoring the elasto-plastic switches when calculating the gradients and provides a straight forward framework for elasto-plastic topology optimization.

However, individually discretizing each material layer into finite elements presents a prohibitive computational expensive given the large number of thin layers comprising some laminated composites. To address these challenges, an 8-node layered solid hexahedral finite element is formulated with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between efficiency and fidelity. The element is discretized into an arbitrary number of distinct material layers, and employs reduced in-plane integration within each layer. The chosen reduced integration scheme is supplemented by a novel physical stabilization approach which includes layerwise enhancements to mitigate various forms of locking phenomena. The proposed framework additionally supports the inclusion of interlaminar enhanced displacements to better represent the kinematics of general layered composite materials. The described element formulation has been implemented in the ParaDyn finite element code, and its efficacy for modeling laminated composite structures is demonstrated on a variety of verification problems.},

In dynamical systems, SC is especially suited for full-field uncertainty propagation that characterizes the distributions of the high-dimensional solution fields of a model with stochastic input parameters. However, due to the highly nonlinear nature of the parameter-to-solution map in even the simplest dynamical systems, the constructed SC surrogates are often inaccurate. This work presents an alternative approach, where we apply the SC approximation over the dynamics of the model, rather than the solution. By combining the data-driven sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics framework with SC, we construct dynamics surrogates and integrate them through time to construct the surrogate solutions. We demonstrate that the SC-over-dynamics framework leads to smaller errors, both in terms of the approximated system trajectories as well as the model state distributions, when compared against full-field SC applied to the solutions directly. We present numerical evidence of this improvement using three test problems: a chaotic ordinary differential equation, and two partial differential equations from solid mechanics.},

One advantage is the flexibility to use arbitrary shaped elements including the possibility to add nodes on the fly during simulation, which opens a new variety of application fields. The latter mentioned feature is used in this publication to propose an adaptive mesh-refinement strategy during the thermodynamic optimization procedure and investigate its feasibility. The thermodynamic topology optimization (TTO) includes a efficient gradient-enhanced approach to regularization of the otherwise ill-posed density based topology optimization approach and was already applied to various material models in combination with finite elements. However, the special numerical treatment leading to efficiency of the regularization approach within the TTO has to be modified to be applicable to VEM, which is presented in the publication.

Frequently, certain localized regions in the geometrical nonlinear finite element analysis of the topology optimization have excessive artificial distortions due to the low stiffness of the void and low-density elements. The present stabilization applies a hyperelastic constitutive material model for the numerical stabilization that is associated with the condition number of the deformation gradient and thereby, is associated with the numerical conditioning of the mapping between current configuration and reference configuration of the underlying continuum mechanics on a constitutive material model level. The stabilization method is independent upon the topology design variables during the optimization iterations. Numerical parametric studies show that the parameters for the constitutive hyperelasticity material of the new stabilization scheme are governed by the stiffness of the constitutive model of the initial physical system. The parametric studies also show that the stabilization scheme is independently upon the type of constitutive model of the physical system and the element types applied for the finite element modeling. The new stabilization scheme is numerical verified using both academic reference examples and industrial applications. The numerical examples show that the number of optimization iterations is significantly reduced compared to the stabilization approaches previously reported in the literature.},

Discretization of the optimality equation then yields a linear although severely ill-posed equation which is then regularized via appropriate ad-hoc penalizers based upon a-priori information about the conductivities of all materials present. This process results in a generalized Tikhonov-Phillips functional whose global minimizer yields our approximate solution to the inverse problem. In our previous work we showed that this approach yields quite satisfactory results in the cases of two different conductivities. We considered here an appropriate extension of that approach for the N $$ N $$ materials case and show a few numerical examples for the case N = 3 $$ N=3 $$ in which the method is able to produce very good reconstructions of the exact solution.},

The connectivity constraints, on the other hand, are treated via constrained mechanical systems of d&#39;Alembert type. In case of straight, that is, nonflexible, fibers, the proposed algorithm reduces to the SAM ( Comput.

  abstract     = {The phase-field formulation for fracture propagation is widely adopted due to its capability of naturally treating complex crack geometries. The challenges of the phase-field crack simulation include the non-convexity of the underlying energy functional and the expensive computational cost associated with the fine mesh required to resolve the phase-field length-scale around the crack region. We present a novel phase-field monolithic scheme based on the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method, or the L-BFGS method, to address the convergence difficulties usually encountered by a Newton-based approach because of the non-convex energy functional. Comparing with the conventional BFGS method, the L-BFGS monolithic scheme avoids to store the fully dense Hessian approximation matrix. This feature is critical in the context of finite element simulations. To alleviate the expensive computational cost, we integrate the proposed L-BFGS monolithic scheme with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique. We provide the algorithmic details about the proposed L-BFGS monolithic scheme, especially about how to handle the hanging-node constraints generated during the AMR process as extra linear constraints. Several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed monolithic scheme, including the accuracy, the robustness, and the computational efficiency regarding the memory consumption and the wall-clock time. Particularly, we emphasize the importance of the appropriately chosen convergence criteria for brute crack propagation. The proposed L-BFGS phase-field monolithic scheme combined with the AMR technique offers an accurate, robust, and efficient approach to model brittle crack propagation in both 2D and 3D problems.},

  abstract     = {Imposing nonperiodic boundary conditions for unit cell analyses may be necessary for a number of reasons in applications, for example, for validation purposes and specific computational setups. The work at hand discusses a strategy for utilizing the powerful technology behind fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based computational micromechanics—initially developed with periodic boundary conditions in mind—for essential boundary conditions in mechanics, as well, for the case of the discretization on a rotated staggered grid. Introduced by F. Willot into the community, the rotated staggered grid is presumably the most popular discretization, and was shown to be equivalent to underintegrated trilinear hexahedral elements. We leverage insights from previous work on the Moulinec–Suquet discretization, exploiting a finite-strain preconditioner for small-strain problems and utilize specific discrete sine and cosine transforms. We demonstrate the computational performance of the novel scheme by dedicated numerical experiments and compare displacement-based methods to implementations on the deformation gradient.},

The kinematics of this popular model is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor, allowing for a combination of Newtonian viscosity and arbitrary isotropic hyperelasticity. The algorithm is based on approximation of precomputed solutions. Both Lagrangian and Eulerian versions of the algorithm with equivalent properties are available. The proposed numerical scheme is non-iterative, unconditionally stable, and first order accurate. Moreover, the integration algorithm strictly preserves the inelastic incompressibility constraint, symmetry, positive definiteness, and w-invariance. The accuracy of stress calculations is verified in a series of numerical tests, including non-proportional loading and large strain increments. In terms of stress calculation accuracy, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the implicit Euler method with strict inelastic incompressibility. The algorithm is implemented into MSC.MARC and a demonstration initial-boundary value problem is solved.},

These formulations are not numerically stable, leading to loss of several digits of accuracy when used in the small strain regime, and often precluding the use of single precision floating point arithmetic. We trace the source of this instability to specific points of numerical cancellation, interpretable as ill-conditioned steps. We show how to compute various strain measures in a stable way and how to transform common constitutive models to their stable representations, formulated in either initial or current configuration. The stable formulations all provide accuracy of order ϵ machine $$ {\epsilon}_{\mathrm{machine}} $$ . In many cases, the stable formulations have elegant representations in terms of appropriate strain measures and offer geometric intuition that is lacking in their standard representation. We show that algorithmic differentiation can stably compute stresses so long as the strain energy is expressed stably, and give principles for stable computation that can be applied to inelastic materials.},

  abstract     = {Failure probability function (FPF) can reflect quantitative effects of random input distribution parameter (DP) on failure probability, and it is significant for decoupling reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). But the FPF estimation is time-consuming since it generally requires repeated reliability analyses at different DPs. For efficiently estimating FPF, an augmented directional sampling (A-DS) is proposed in this paper. By using the property that the limit state surface (LSS) in physical input space is independent of DP, the A-DS establishes transformation of LSS samples in standard normal spaces corresponding to different DPs. By the established transformation in different standard normal spaces, the LSS samples obtained by DS at a given DP can be transformed to those at other DPs. After simple interpolation post-processing on those transformed samples, the failure probability at other DPs can be estimated by DS simultaneously. The main novelty of A-DS is that a strategy of sharing DS samples is designed for estimating the failure probability at different DPs. The A-DS avoids repeated reliability analyses and inherits merit of DS suitable for solving problems with multiple failure modes and small failure probability. Compared with other FPF estimation methods, the examples sufficiently verify the accuracy and efficiency of A-DS.},

  abstract     = {The moving morphable components (MMC) method has been widely used for topology optimization due to its ability to provide an explicit description of topology. However, the MMC method may encounter the instability issue during iteration. Specifically, the iteration history is highly sensitive to parameters of the optimizer, that is, the move limits in the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). Additionally, the final topology obtained from the MMC method usually depends on the initial values. To address these issues and improve the stability of the MMC method in practical applications, this article introduces two strategies. The first strategy is based on the time-series MMC (TSMMC) method, which proposes a unified description of curved components. However, the use of control-points-based design variables may introduce instability into the iteration process due to the strong locality associated with these variables. To mitigate this, global design variables have been incorporated into the formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that this mixed formulation, combining global and local design variables, can enhance stability significantly. To further enhance stability, the second strategy involves using the trust region-based moving asymptotes (TRMA) method as the optimizer instead of MMA. The TRMA method incorporates an accuracy control mechanism, resulting in stable and fast convergence behavior, as demonstrated in the numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Sliding electrical contact involves multiple conductors sliding in contact at different speeds, with current flowing through the contact surfaces. The Lagrangian method is commonly used to describe the electromagnetic field in order to overcome the trouble of convective dominance, especially in high-speed sliding electrical contact problems. However, to maintain correct field continuity, magnetic vector potential A ′ $$ {\mathbf{A}}^{\prime } $$ and scalar potential ϕ ′ $$ {\phi}^{\prime } $$ taken as variables cannot be continuous simultaneously at the ideal sliding electrical contact interface. This involves a strongly discontinuous condition for variables. Further, commonly used spatial–temporal discretization algorithms are invalid, for example, the classic finite element (CFEM) framework does not allow discontinuous variables, and the backward Euler method in time domain introduces a significant interface error source associated with the velocity of relative motion. To accurately handle strongly discontinuous conditions in numerical calculations, a mixed nodal finite element scheme and a higher-order accurate temporal discretization scheme are introduced. In this scheme, classical finite element method is performed in each subdomain, and the derivative terms at the boundary are added as new variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the above methods are verified by comparing them with a standard solution in a two-dimensional railgun model and analyzing the current density distribution in a three-dimensional railgun model.},

In this article, we apply the recently proposed scaled boundary cubature (SBC) scheme to compute the weak form integrals in various virtual element formulations over polygonal and polyhedral meshes. In doing so, we demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and the accuracy that it delivers on a broad suite of boundary-value problems in 2D and 3D over polytopes with affine faces as well as on elements with curved boundaries. In addition, the use of the SBC scheme is exemplified in an enriched Poisson formulation of the VEM in which weakly singular functions are required to be integrated.

  abstract     = {The effective inclusion of a priori knowledge when embedding known data in physics-based models of dynamical systems can ensure that the reconstructed model respects physical principles, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the solution in the previously unseen regions of state space. This paper presents a physics-constrained data-driven discrepancy modeling method that variationally embeds known data in the modeling framework. The hierarchical structure of the method yields fine scale variational equations that facilitate the derivation of residuals which are comprised of the first-principles theory and sensor-based data from the dynamical system. The embedding of the sensor data via residual terms leads to discrepancy-informed closure models that yield a method which is driven not only by boundary and initial conditions, but also by measurements that are taken at only a few observation points in the target system. Specifically, the data-embedding term serves as residual-based least-squares loss function, thus retaining variational consistency. Another important relation arises from the interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function, thereby incorporating a priori knowledge of the problem and adding computational intelligence to the modeling framework. Numerical test cases show that when known data is taken into account, the data driven variational (DDV) method can correctly predict the system response in the presence of several types of discrepancies. Specifically, the damped solution and correct energy time histories are recovered by including known data in the undamped situation. Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the surrogate problem with embedded data recovers the fundamental frequency band of the target system. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the DDV method is manifested via reconstructed displacement and velocity fields that yield time histories of strain and kinetic energies which match the target systems. The proposed DDV method also serves as a procedure for restoring eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a deficient dynamical system when known data is taken into account, as shown in the numerical test cases presented here.},

  abstract     = {Material heterogeneity gives composite constructions unique mechanical and physical qualities. Combining multiple materials takes full use of these features in stress-constrained topology optimization. Traditional research in this field often assumes a consistent yield criterion for all possible materials but adapts their stiffness and strengths accordingly. To cope with this challenge, an innovative single-variable interpolation approach is proposed to enable the simultaneous inclusion of distinct yield criteria and material strengths. A stress-constrained topology optimization formulation is presented based on this yield function interpolation method, which can independently support various materials with different elastic characteristics, material strengths, and yield criteria. Then, the large-scale problem of local stress constraints can be effectively solved by the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method. Several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) design scenarios are investigated to reduce the overall mass of the structure while considering stress constraints. The optimal composite designs exhibit several crucial benefits resulting from material heterogeneity, including the enlargement of the design possibilities, the dispersion of stress, and the utilization of asymmetry in tension-compression strength.},

  abstract     = {This article extends recently developed finite variation sensitivity analysis (FVSA) approaches to an inverse homogenization problem. The design of metamaterials with prescribed mechanical properties is stated as a discrete density-based topology optimization problem, in which the design variables define the microstructure of the periodic base cell. The FVSA consists in estimating the finite variations of the objective and constraint functions after independently switching the state of each variable. It is used to properly linearize the functions of binary variables so the optimization problem can be solved through sequential integer linear programming. Novel sensitivity expressions were developed and it was shown that they are more accurate than the ones conventionally used in literature. Referred to as the conjugate gradient sensitivity (CGS) approach, the proposed strategy was quantitatively evaluated through numerical examples. In these examples, metamaterials with prescribed homogenized Poisson&#39;s ratios and minimal homogenized Young&#39;s moduli were obtained. A hexagonal base cell with dihedral symmetry was used to produce only metamaterials with isotropic properties. It was shown that, by using the CGS approach instead of the conventional sensitivity analysis, the sensitivity error was substantially reduced for the considered problem. The proposed developments effectively improved the stability and robustness of the discrete optimization procedures. In all the considered examples, when more accurate sensitivity analyses were performed, the parameters of the topology optimization method could be tuned more easily, yielding effective solutions even if the settings were not ideal.},

The region of interest called the local problem, where the crack propagates, is represented by a 2D elasticity model, where a fine mesh of plane stress/strain elements and special enrichment functions are used to describe this phenomenon accurately. A model of Timoshenko-frame elements simulates the overall behavior of the structure. A coarse mesh of plane stress/strain elements provides a bridge between these two representation scales. The mixed-dimensional coupling method imposes displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium at the interface between the two different element types by an iterative procedure based on the principle of virtual work. After establishing the constraint equations for the interface, the 2D elasticity model is related to the small-scale model by the global-local enrichment strategy of GFEM . In such a strategy, the numerical solutions of the local problem subjected to boundary conditions derived from the global-scale problem enrich the approximation of this same global problem in an iterative procedure. Each step of the crack propagation requires a new sequence of this iterative global-local procedure. On the other hand, the constraint equation for the interface is defined only once. The crack representation in a confined region by the global-local strategy avoids a remeshing that would require new constraint equations. Two numerical problems illustrate the proposed strategy and assess the influence of the analysis parameters.},

This displacement-based element includes three translational degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node. Notably, only two-dimensional discretization for one of the two parallel shell surfaces, referred to as the scaling surface, is necessary. The interpolation scheme for the scaling surface is postulated to be applicable to all surfaces parallel to it in the thickness. The derivation strictly adheres to the 3D theory of elasticity, without making additional kinematic assumptions. As a result, the displacement field along the thickness is analytically solved, and the element formulation is immune to transverse locking, membrane locking, and other issues, eliminating the need for additional remedies. Extensive investigations into the robustness and accuracy of the elements have been conducted using well-known benchmark problems, along with additional challenging problems. Numerical examples confirm that the element formulation is free from transverse shear locking and membrane locking. Moreover, the proposed formulation is easily extendable to cases involving shell elements with varying thickness and holds the potential for extension to the nonlinear response analysis of shell structures.},

In this method, point clouds obtained by a TLS are considered as a partial surface of the deformed structure. An analysis model is assumed to be created from CAD data or drawings. The analysis is performed under deformed shape constraints, namely, the deformed surface constraints or the normal vector constraints, which are generated by the point clouds. These constraints are introduced to reproduce the current displacements and stresses for the structure through the analysis. This method was applied to analyses of a plate and a desk using point clouds, which were created virtually on a computer or obtained by a TLS in the numerical examples. The results showed that this method can consider unexpected deformations that occur before laser scanning. Although the computed stresses oscillated when the scanned point cloud was used due to measurement errors and conventional point cloud processing methods, the stress values were responsive enough to indicate unnatural shapes of the deformed structure. Moreover, the oscillation was observed only in areas with constraints, whereas it was not seen in areas without constraints.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a diffusive-discrete crack transition scheme for stably conducting ductile fracture simulations within a finite strain framework. In the developed scheme, the crack initiation and propagation processes are determined according to an energy minimization problem based on crack phase-field theory, and the predicted diffusive path is transformed to a discrete representation using the finite cover method during the staggered iterative scheme. In particular, for stably conducting ductile fracture simulations, three computational techniques, the staggered iterative configuration update technique, the subincremental damage update technique, and the crack opening stabilization technique, are introduced. The first and second techniques can be used regardless of whether discrete cracks are considered, and the third technique is specialized for diffusive-discrete crack transition schemes. Accordingly, ductile fracture simulations with the developed scheme rarely encounter troublesome problems such as oscillations in the displacement field and severe distortion of finite elements that can lead to divergence of calculations. After the crack phase-field model for ductile fractures is formulated and discretized, the numerical algorithms for realizing the diffusive-discrete crack transition while maintaining computational stability are explained. Several representative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the developed approach.},

Combining materials with different lattice constants induces strain, leading to the bending of these heterostructures. We propose a model for nonlinear elastic heterostructures such as bimetallic beams or nanowires that takes into account local prestrain within each distinct material region. The resulting system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in Lagrangian coordinates incorporates a nonlinear strain and a linear stress-strain relationship governed by Hooke&#39;s law. To validate our model, we apply it to bimetallic beams and hexagonal hetero-nanowires and perform numerical simulations using finite element methods (FEM). Our simulations examine how these structures undergo bending under varying material compositions and cross-sectional geometries. In order to assess the fidelity of the model and the accuracy of simulations, we compare the calculated curvature with analytically derived formulations. We derive these analytical expressions through an energy-based approach as well as a kinetic framework, adeptly accounting for the lattice constant mismatch present at each compound material of the heterostructures. The outcomes of our study yield valuable insights into the behavior of strained bent heterostructures. This is particularly significant as the strain has the potential to influence the electronic band structure, piezoelectricity, and the dynamics of charge carriers.},

The formulation employs a multiscale micromechanical framework to determine the effective elastic properties of composites at different scales. The stress–strain constitutive relation is derived by splitting the strain tensor into “elastic-damage” and “plastic-damage” parts while introducing the homogenized free potential energy function and the undamaged potential energy function. The elastoplastic damage response of the material is further characterized by elastic–plastic-damage coupling. To construct realistic 3D three-phase concrete mesostructures in numerical simulations, this paper introduces an encapsulation placement method that avoids particle overlap checking when placing aggregates. This methodology allows adjustments for the aggregate compactness as needed and enhances computational efficiency in concrete mesostructure construction. The numerical results of the modeling show good agreement with the experimental values in the open literature. Further, the influence of nano-silica addition contents and ITZ (interfacial transition zone) thicknesses on the elastoplastic damage response of nano-silica incorporated concrete are quantitatively and qualitatively investigated for the optimization of nano-silica incorporated cementitious composites. The proposed model facilitates simulating and optimizing the mechanical characteristics of nano-silica incorporated concrete and enhances the computational efficiency of 3D concrete modeling with the introduced encapsulation placement method.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes two contributions to the calculation of free-surface flows using the particle finite element method (PFEM). The PFEM is based upon a Lagrangian approach: a set of particles defines the fluid and each particle is associated with a velocity vector. Then, unlike a pure Lagrangian method, all the particles are connected by a triangular mesh. The difficulty lies in locating the free surface from this mesh. It is a matter of deciding which of the elements in the mesh are part of the fluid domain, and to define a boundary—the free surface. Then, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved on the fluid domain and the particle position is updated using the velocity vector from the finite element solver. Our first contribution is to propose an approach to adapt the mesh with theoretical guarantees of quality : the mesh generation community has acquired a lot of experience and understanding about mesh adaptation approaches with guarantees of quality on the final mesh. The approach we use here is based on a Delaunay refinement strategy , allowing to insert and remove nodes while gradually improving mesh quality. We show that what is proposed allows to create stable and smooth free surface geometries. One characteristic of the PFEM is that only one fluid domain is modeled, even if its shape and topology change. It is nevertheless necessary to apply conditions on the domain boundaries. When a boundary is a free surface, the flow on the other side is not modeled, it is represented by an external pressure. On the external free surface boundary, atmospheric pressure can be imposed. Nevertheless, there may be internal free surfaces: the fluid can fully encapsulate cavities to form bubbles. The pressure required to maintain the volume of those bubbles is a priori unknown. For example, the atmospheric pressure would not be sufficient to prevent the bubbles from deflating and eventually disappearing. Our second contribution is to propose a multi-point constraint approach to enforce global incompressibility of those empty bubbles. We show that this approach allows to accurately model bubbly flows that involve two fluids with large density differences, for instance water and air, while only modeling the heavier fluid.},

To address this issue, the current study presents a new stress minimization method that utilizes the Windowed Evolutionary Structural Optimization (WESO) framework. The method aims to improve algorithm stability by optimizing design variables with an intermediate density. The use of a P-norm stress aggregation method improves the assessment of global stress levels and enhances computational efficiency. Furthermore, a stable element sensitivity formulation, derived from the adjoint sensitivity analysis of the global stress measure, effectively handles the nonlinear stress behavior. Mesh filtering techniques are utilized to convert sensitivity from elements to nodes, and the structural topological solution is represented using the level set function (LSF) based on element-node sensitivity. This method addresses the singularity issue commonly found in density-based optimization methods and facilitates the achievement of smooth topological solutions. Through 2D and 3D benchmark designs, the proposed method&#39;s feasibility, stability, and superiority are thoroughly demonstrated. A parametric study is conducted to identify the optimal parameter range for the algorithm, leading to the development of a rational method for parameter selection.

  abstract     = {As a common smart hydrogel, thermo-sensitive hydrogel exhibits significant potential applications in the field of biological engineering due to its unique property of undergoing a substantial volume transition in response to temperature changes. For numerical implementation of thermo-sensitive hydrogel, many approaches have been developed to simulate the transient deformation during fluid diffusion or heat conduction process. However, the numerical approach for the transient deformation during both fluid diffusion and heat conduction processes is still lacking. To this end, we develop a three-field coupled finite element framework that can be used to simulate the transient deformation behavior of thermo-sensitive hydrogel involving large deformation, fluid diffusion, and heat conduction. In the proposed framework, there exist three processes that deal with displacement, concentration, and temperature fields, separately. To realize the coupling of three fields, the separated solving processes are assembled together by using a two-way coupled approach. Based on the developed finite element framework, the coupling effects between the concentration and temperature can be realized by defining a body flux and a temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient without solving the complex coupling equations. The finite element framework is implemented in ABAQUS by utilizing several user subroutines. The numerical implementation is validated by comparing the numerical results of a hydrogel disk with experimental results. Furthermore, various numerical examples are simulated to investigate the applicability of the proposed finite element framework under different multi-field coupling conditions. The proposed finite element scheme is proved to be an efficient and stable tool for numerically simulating the transient behavior of thermo-sensitive hydrogel incorporating the phase transition effect.},

  abstract     = {The solution approximation for partial differential equations (PDEs) can be substantially improved using smooth basis functions. The recently introduced mollified basis functions are constructed through mollification, or convolution, of cell-wise defined piecewise polynomials with a smooth mollifier of certain characteristics. The properties of the mollified basis functions are governed by the order of the piecewise functions and the smoothness of the mollifier. In this work, we exploit the high-order and high-smoothness properties of the mollified basis functions for solving PDEs through the point collocation method. The basis functions are evaluated at a set of collocation points in the domain. In addition, boundary conditions are imposed at a set of boundary collocation points distributed over the domain boundaries. To ensure the stability of the resulting linear system of equations, the number of collocation points is set larger than the total number of basis functions. The resulting linear system is overdetermined and is solved using the least square technique. The presented numerical examples confirm the convergence of the proposed approximation scheme for Poisson, linear elasticity, and biharmonic problems. We study in particular the influence of the mollifier and the spatial distribution of the collocation points.},

  abstract     = {Reduced order models (ROMs) are often coupled with concurrent multiscale simulations to mitigate the computational cost of nonlinear computational homogenization methods. Construction (or training) of ROMs typically requires evaluation of a series of linear or nonlinear equilibrium problems, which itself could be a computationally very expensive process. In the eigenstrain-based reduced order homogenization method (EHM), a series of linear elastic microscale equilibrium problems are solved to compute the localization and interaction tensors that are in turn used in the evaluation of the reduced order multiscale system. These microscale equilibrium problems are typically solved using either the finite element method or semi-analytical methods. In the present study, a reduced order variational spectral method is developed for efficient computation of the localization and interaction tensors. The proposed method leads to a small stiffness matrix that scales with the order of the reduced basis rather than the number of degrees of freedom in the finite element mesh. The reduced order variational spectral method maintains high accuracy in the computed response fields. A speedup higher than an order of magnitude can be achieved compared to the finite element method in polycrystalline microstructures. The accuracy and scalability of the method for large polycrystals and increasing phase property contrast are investigated.},

These mixed formulations require either finite element spaces for the unknowns that satisfy the proper inf-sup conditions to guarantee stability or to employ stabilized finite element formulations that provide freedom for the choice of the interpolating spaces. The latter approach is followed in this work, using the Variational Multiscale concept to derive these formulations. Regarding the tackling of the geometry, we consider both infinitesimal and finite strain problems, considering for the latter both an updated Lagrangian and a total Lagrangian description of the governing equations.

The microscale fluid-structure interaction problem and the macroscale are coupled through an extended version of the Hill-Mandel principle, leading to a variationally consistent averaging scheme of the microscale fields. The effective macroscopic constitutive relations are obtained by expressing the microscale problem with a reduced-order model that contains the longwave basis and the so-called local resonance basis, yielding the closed-form expressions for the homogenized material properties. The resulting macroscopic model is an enriched porous continuum with internal variables that represent the microscale dynamics at the macroscale, whereby the Biot model is recovered as a special case.

Nevertheless, the non-local characteristics of the PD equations and the required inversion operations when solving fluid equations result in prohibitively high computational costs. In this paper, a fast explicit solution scheme for FEM-PD models based on matrix operation is introduced, where the graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to accelerate the computation. An in-house software is developed in MATLAB in both CPU and GPU versions. We first solve a problem related to pore pressure distribution in a single crack, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method by a comparison of FEM-PD solutions with those of PD-only models and analytical solutions. Subsequently, several examples are solved, including a one-dimensional dynamic consolidation problem and the fluid-driven hydraulic fracture propagation problems in both 2D and 3D cases, to comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in simulating deformation and fracture in saturated porous media under the influence of hydro-mechanical coupling. In the presented numerical results, some typical strong dynamic phenomena, such as stepwise crack advancement, crack branching, and pressure oscillations, are observed. In addition, we compare the wall times of all the cases executed on both the GPU and CPU, highlighting the substantial acceleration performance of the GPU, particularly when tackling problems with a significant computational workload.},

Finally, we extend the impulse-based LS-DEM to include arbitrarily shaped topographic surfaces and exploit its algorithmic advantages to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling realistic behavior of granular flows.

  abstract     = {The phase field modeling of fracture is able to simulate the nucleation and the propagation of complex crack patterns. However, the relatively small internal lengths that are required usually lead to very fine meshes and high computational costs, especially for three-dimensional applications. In the present work, additional cost also comes from the implicit dynamics regularization of unstable crack propagations which potentially leads to a large variation of time steps when switching from quasi-static to dynamic regimes. To reduce the time to solution in this context, this study proposes a domain decomposition framework and acceleration techniques for the phase field fracture staggered solver. The displacement subproblem and the phase field one are solved with parallel domain decomposition solvers. Dual domain decomposition methods provide low cost preconditioner well adapted to the phase field subproblem. For displacement subproblems undergoing unstable crack propagations, primal domain decomposition methods are preferred to be less sensitive to the treatment of floating substructures. Preconditioners performances are assessed and scalability studies over academic test cases, up to 324 subdomains, are presented. Finally, the robustness of the approach is illustrated on two semi-industrial simulations.},

The hybrid equilibrium element formulation can model high order (quadratic, cubic and quartic) stress fields which strongly satisfy homogeneous equilibrium equations, inter-element and boundary equilibrium equations. The HEE can implicitly model both the initially rigid behaviour of an extrinsic interface and its debonding condition with separation displacement and softening. The extrinsic interface is embedded at the element sides and its behaviour is governed by means of the same degrees of freedom of HEE ( generalized stresses ), without any additional degree of freedom. The proposed extrinsic cohesive model is developed in the thermodynamic framework of damage mechanics. The proposed crack propagation criterion states that crack grows when the maximum principal stress reaches the tensile strength value, in a direction orthogonal to the principal stress direction. The crack is embedded at an element side and the mesh around crack tip is adapted, by rotation of the element sides, in order to have the interface aligned to the crack growth direction. Three classic two-dimensional problems of fracture propagation are numerically reproduced and the results compared to the experimental data or to the other numerical results.},

Our study focuses on a thermomechanical model of an Inconel 625 cantilever beam, based on the AMBench2018-01 benchmark proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The proposed approach consists of a forward uncertainty quantification analysis of the residual strains of the cantilever beam given the uncertainty in some of the parameters of the numerical simulation, namely the powder convection coefficient and the activation temperature. The uncertainty on such parameters is modelled by a data-informed probability density function obtained by a Bayesian inversion procedure, based on the displacement experimental data provided by NIST. To overcome the computational challenges of both the Bayesian inversion and the forward uncertainty quantification analysis we employ a multi-fidelity surrogate modelling technique, specifically the multi-index stochastic collocation method. The proposed approach allows us to achieve a 33% reduction in the uncertainties on the prediction of residual strains compared with what we would get basing the forward UQ analysis on a-priori ranges for the uncertain parameters, and in particular the mode of the probability density function of such quantities (i.e., its “most likely value”, roughly speaking) results to be in good agreement with the experimental data provided by NIST, even though only displacement data were used for the Bayesian inversion procedure.},

The solid-fluid interaction is accounted for using the mixture theory of Biot based on the volume fractions concept. Different sources of nolinearities arising from the multiphase fluid flow effects, advective-diffusive heat transfer, inelastic deformation, fluid flux injection induced mechanical tractions, solid skeleton deformation permeability dependence, and temperature dependent viscosity are included in developing a robust numerical solver for the targeted coupled multiphysics problem. To address the effect of microstructure in inelastic localized deformation behaviour with dilational softening, a nonlocal plasticity model is proposed based on a characteristic length scale which rectifies the non-physical pathological mesh dependence problem encountered in conventional plasticity. The accuracy and strength of the developed model is shown with comparing the obtained numerical results of a benchmark bilateral compression test with existing published data in the literature. To show the versatility and robustness of the developed computational framework in modelling the geomechanics of real-case engineering practices, large scale thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) subsurface stimulation processes with applications in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are effectively simulated and the targeted enhanced recovery and performances are demonstrated. The current formulation does not include phase transformation modelling capability, and therefore, the developed models may not be applicable for simulation of the engineering processes that involve phase change behaviour (e.g., steam injection).},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization (TO) has recently emerged as an advanced design method. To ensure practical reliability in the design process, it is imperative to incorporate considerations of uncertainty. Consequently, performing reliability analysis (RA) during the design phase becomes necessary. However, RA itself constitutes an optimization problem. Combining these two optimization problems can result in inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a decoupled approach that integrates deterministic topology optimization (DTO) and RA cycles. The reliability-based stress-constrained TO (RBSCTO) problem is considered in this paper. The DTO constraint is derived based on shifting vectors derived from the previous cycle&#39;s RA outcomes, enabling low-reliability constraint shift towards the feasible direction. The DTO is solved based on solid-isotropic-material-with-penalization (SIMP) and augmented Lagrangian method. Meanwhile, the optimization problem in RA is addressed using finite differences and the interior point method. To reduce the errors resulting from linear approximation and optimization in RA when the target reliability is very low, an outlier handling method is employed. Meantime, we utilize a probabilistic neural network to enhance the efficiency of reliability assessment. Comparative studies against traditional methods across four RBSCTO tasks are demonstrated to validate its effectiveness. Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate the reliability of results.},

  abstract     = {Quadrilateral mesh is preferred in numerical simulation compared with triangular mesh, but high-quality and robust quadrilateral mesh generation for complex geometries remains a challenging problem. In this study, an enhanced indirect method by the combination of triangles is proposed for the generation of high-quality quadrilateral mesh. It takes a triangular mesh as the input, and except that the number of elements needs to be even, the triangular mesh can be generated by the commonly used AFT method or Delaunay method. To ensure the quality of the combined quads, a local-global triangular remeshing procedure is conducted first, and size gradation and vertex valence are focused in this step. Then, the well-known Blossom algorithm is used to find the perfect matching triangles for combination. Finally, in order to reduce the number of unnecessary singularities, a connectivity optimization procedure is introduced to replace the irregular elements in local regions with regular elements and thus improve the overall quality of the combined quads. Numerical experiments on meshes in both 2D and 3D cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

All elements proposed in the literature for such formulations use a distinct set of degrees of freedom to discretise each field. In this work, we introduce for the first time shared degrees of freedom, that lead to a mixed formulation with a significantly better numerical performance.

  abstract     = {Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are elastomeric networks with anisotropic monomers that reorient in response to applied loads, and in particular, thermomechanical loads. LCE complex microstructures translate into complex behaviors, such as soft elasticity, rate-dependency, and hysteresis. In this work, we develop a three-dimensional finite element implementation for monodomain LCEs, with the material modeled as a finite deformation viscoelastic network with a viscous director. The formulation is designed so that the director field can be modeled as an internal variable. Unique to this class of materials is that their deformation response function depends on the full deformation gradient and not just the right-stretch tensor. This results in the material tangent losing its ‘usual’ symmetry properties. Accordingly, this makes the use of a first Piola–Kirchhoff finite element formulation advantageous. We utilize this framework to examine a number of nuances associated with the simulation and design of LCE based systems. In particular, we investigate in some detail the importance of a careful characterization of an LCE&#39;s initial director field. Via simulations of separate tension and compression experiments, we highlight the possibility of incorrect predictions when even small perturbations to initial conditions occur. The simulations are also used to illustrate the goodness of the model in replicating simple and complex experimental results, including the first-of-their-kind buckling-like column compression and thick-walled balloon inflation simulations.},

The numerical modeling of flexoelectricity is largely carried out using mixed FE, which has its historical foundations in strain gradient theories. However, existing finite elements are either limited to 2D or have inherited numerical instabilities due to the known saddle-point structuring. The current work presents a numerically robust three-dimensional mixed FE for higher-order electromechanical applications without the use of stabilization or penalty parameters. After its verification, the new finite element is applied to the new problem of truncated semicone torsion, taking into account flexoelectricity in piezoelectric solids, and the original findings are reported.

  abstract     = {We investigate the behavior of different shape functions for the discretization of hyperbolic problems. In particular, we consider classical Lagrange polynomials and B-splines. The studies focus on the performance of the these functions as a spatial discretization approach combined with an explicit time marching scheme. In this regard, a major concern is the maximum eigenvalue that imposes restrictions on the critical time step size and suitable lumping techniques that yield a diagonal mass matrix. The accuracy of the discretization methods is assessed in an asymptotic manner in terms of the convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Further, the global accuracy is investigated in terms of the full spectrum. The results show that B-spline discretization with a consistent mass matrix are more accurate than those based on Lagrange shape functions, which holds true in the boundary-fitted as well as in the immersed setting. On the other hand, Lagrange shape functions are more robust with respect to standard lumping techniques, which cannot be directly applied for B-splines without loss of accuracy. In general, we observe that none of the standard lumping schemes yields optimal results for B-splines, even in the boundary-fitted setting. For the immersed setting, also Lagrange shape functions show a drop in accuracy which depends on the position of the boundary that cuts the element. Several remedies are considered in order to overcome these issues, including interpolatory B-spline bases as well as eigenvalue stabilization methods. While accuracy and stability can be improved using these remedies, we conclude from our study that it is still an open question, how to design a discretization method that achieves large critical time step sizes in combination with a diagonal mass matrix and high accuracy in the immersed setting. We note that these considerations primarily relate to linear structural dynamics applications, such as for example, structural acoustics. In nonlinear problems, such as automotive crash dynamics, other considerations predominate. An example of a one-dimensional elastic-plastic bar impacting a rigid wall is illustrative.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian processes provide probabilistic surrogates for various applications including classification, uncertainty quantification, and optimization. Using a gradient-enhanced covariance matrix can be beneficial since it provides a more accurate surrogate relative to its gradient-free counterpart. An acute problem for Gaussian processes, particularly those that use gradients, is the ill-conditioning of their covariance matrices. Several methods have been developed to address this problem for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes but they have various drawbacks such as limiting the data that can be used, imposing a minimum distance between evaluation points in the parameter space, or constraining the hyperparameters. In this paper a diagonal preconditioner is applied to the covariance matrix along with a modest nugget to ensure that the condition number of the covariance matrix is bounded, while avoiding the drawbacks listed above. The method can be applied with any twice-differentiable kernel and when there are noisy function and gradient evaluations. Optimization results for a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer with the Gaussian kernel are compared with the use of the preconditioning method, a baseline method that constrains the hyperparameters, and a rescaling method that increases the distance between evaluation points. The Bayesian optimizer with the preconditioning method converges the optimality, that is, the norm of the gradient, an additional 5 to 9 orders of magnitude relative to when the baseline method is used and it does so in fewer iterations than with the rescaling method. The preconditioning method is available in the open source Python library GpGradPy, which can be found at https://github.com/marchildon/gpgradpy/tree/paper_precon .},

To achieve this strategy, an edge-to-edge coupling method based on Lagrange multipliers has been set-up to ensure the continuity of velocities at the interface. To switch from a computation initially purely FEM to a FEM-DEM one, a field transfer method was required. In particular, a displacement field transfer method has been set-up. The switching from a FEM subdomain to a DEM one is activated by a transition criterion. Each time a FEM subdomain is substituted by a DEM one, the DEM subdomain microscopic properties are set-up with respect to the subdomain geometry and desired particle refinement. This is performed thanks to the linking to the so-called “Cooker,” a tool distributed along with the GranOO Workbench. Two subdomain remeshing cases were dealt with: that of an initially FEM subdomain that is converted to DEM, and that of DEM subdomains which coalesce. A numerical test case shows that the dynamic remeshing method behaves as expected: FEM subdomains are substituted by DEM ones when the transition criterion is met, and DEM subdomains coalesce when required. The final numerical test case shows a good agreement with a crack propagation experiment of the literature, while a speedup of about 20 was observed when compared to pure DEM computation.},

  abstract     = {In traditional topology optimization, the computing time required to iteratively update the material distribution within a design domain strongly depends on the complexity or size of the problem, limiting its application in real engineering contexts. This work proposes a multi-stage machine learning strategy that aims to predict an optimal topology and the related stress fields of interest, either in 2D or 3D, without resorting to any iterative analysis and design process. The overall topology optimization is treated as regression task in a low-dimensional latent space, that encodes the variability of the target designs. First, a fully-connected model is employed to surrogate the functional link between the parametric input space characterizing the design problem and the latent space representation of the corresponding optimal topology. The decoder branch of an autoencoder is then exploited to reconstruct the desired optimal topology from its latent representation. The deep learning models are trained on a dataset generated through a standard method of topology optimization implementing the solid isotropic material with penalization, for varying boundary and loading conditions. The underlying hypothesis behind the proposed strategy is that optimal topologies share enough common patterns to be compressed into small latent space representations without significant information loss. Results relevant to a 2D Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm beam and a 3D bridge case demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework to provide accurate optimal topology predictions in a fraction of a second.},

The transfer functions of these systems are assumed to have a special structure, for example, coming from second-order linear systems or time-delay systems, and they may also have parameter dependencies. Firstly, we investigate the connection between classic interpolation-based model reduction methods with the reachability and observability subspaces of linear structured parametric systems. We show that if enough interpolation points are taken, the projection matrices of interpolation-based model reduction encode these subspaces. Consequently, we are able to identify the dominant reachable and observable subspaces of the underlying system. Based on this, we propose a new model reduction algorithm combining these features and leading to reduced-order systems. Furthermore, we discuss computational aspects of the approach and its applicability to a large-scale setting. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach with several numerical large-scale benchmark examples.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic models generating time-dependent model predictions are typically associated with high-dimensional input spaces and high-dimensional output spaces, in particular if time is discretized. It is computationally prohibitive to apply traditional global sensitivity analysis (SA) separately on each time output, as is common in the literature on multivariate SA. As an alternative, we propose a novel method for efficient global SA of dynamic models with high-dimensional inputs by combining a new polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)-driven partial least squares (PLS) algorithm with the analysis of variance. PLS is used to simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of the input and output variables spaces, by identifying the input and output latent variables that account for most of their joint variability. PCE is incorporated into the PLS algorithm to capture the non-linear behavior of the physical system. We derive the sensitivity indices associated with each output latent variable, based on which we propose generalized sensitivity indices that synthesize the influence of each input on the variance of entire output time series. All sensitivities can be computed analytically by post-processing the coefficients of the PLS-PCE representation. Hence, the computational cost of global SA for dynamic models essentially reduces to the cost for estimating these coefficients. We numerically compare the proposed method with existing methods by several dynamic models with high-dimensional inputs. The results show that the PLS-PCE method can obtain accurate sensitivity indices at low computational cost, even for models with strong interaction among the inputs.},

  abstract     = {We present a machine learning framework capable of consistently inferring mathematical expressions of hyperelastic energy functionals for incompressible materials from sparse experimental data and physical laws. To achieve this goal, we propose a polyconvex neural additive model (PNAM) that enables us to express the hyperelastic model in a learnable feature space while enforcing polyconvexity. An upshot of this feature space obtained via the PNAM is that (1) it is spanned by a set of univariate basis functions that can be re-parametrized with a more complex mathematical form, and (2) the resultant elasticity model is guaranteed to fulfill the polyconvexity, which ensures that the acoustic tensor remains elliptic for any deformation. To further improve the interpretability, we use genetic programming to convert each univariate basis into a compact mathematical expression. The resultant multi-variable mathematical models obtained from this proposed framework are not only more interpretable but are also proven to fulfill physical laws. By controlling the compactness of the learned symbolic form, the machine learning-generated mathematical model also requires fewer arithmetic operations than its deep neural network counterparts during deployment. This latter attribute is crucial for scaling large-scale simulations where the constitutive responses of every integration point must be updated within each incremental time step. We compare our proposed model discovery framework against other state-of-the-art alternatives to assess the robustness and efficiency of the training algorithms and examine the trade-off between interpretability, accuracy, and precision of the learned symbolic hyperelastic models obtained from different approaches. Our numerical results suggest that our approach extrapolates well outside the training data regime due to the precise incorporation of physics-based knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The paper introduces a computational framework using a novel Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formalism in the form of a system of first-order conservation laws. In addition to the usual material and spatial configurations, an additional referential (intrinsic) configuration is introduced in order to disassociate material particles from mesh positions. Using isothermal hyperelasticity as a starting point, mass, linear momentum and total energy conservation equations are written and solved with respect to the reference configuration. In addition, with the purpose of guaranteeing equal order of convergence of strains/stresses and velocities/displacements, the computation of the standard deformation gradient tensor (measured from material to spatial configuration) is obtained via its multiplicative decomposition into two auxiliary deformation gradient tensors, both computed via additional first-order conservation laws. Crucially, the new ALE conservative formulation will be shown to degenerate elegantly into alternative mixed systems of conservation laws such as Total Lagrangian, Eulerian and Updated Reference Lagrangian. Hyperbolicity of the system of conservation laws will be shown and the accurate wave speed bounds will be presented, the latter critical to ensure stability of explicit time integrators. For spatial discretisation, a vertex-based Finite Volume method is employed and suitably adapted. To guarantee stability from both the continuum and the semi-discretisation standpoints, an appropriate numerical interface flux (by means of the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions) is carefully designed and presented. Stability is demonstrated via the use of the time variation of the Hamiltonian of the system, seeking to ensure the positive production of numerical entropy. A range of three dimensional benchmark problems will be presented in order to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the framework. Examples will be restricted to the case of isothermal reversible elasticity to demonstrate the potential of the new formulation.},

To capture the dependence of the underlying system on frequency and parameters, our proposed approach combines rational approximation and smooth interpolation. In the approximation effort, locally adaptive sparse grids are applied to effectively explore the parameter domain even if the number of parameters is modest or high. Adaptivity is also employed to build rational approximations that efficiently capture the frequency dependence of the problem. These two features enable our method to build surrogate models that achieve a user-prescribed approximation accuracy, without wasting resources in “oversampling” the frequency and parameter domains. Thanks to its non-intrusiveness, our proposed method, as opposed to projection-based techniques for model order reduction, can be applied regardless of the complexity of the underlying physical model. Notably, our algorithm for adaptive sampling can be used even when prior knowledge of the problem structure is not available. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it in the study of an aerodynamic bearing. Our method allows us to build surrogate models that adequately identify the bearing&#39;s behavior with respect to both design and operational parameters, while still achieving significant speedups.},

These relationships or impositions in turn are encoded into a constrained Gaussian process for prediction, uncertainty quantification and extrapolation. Using numerous examples and comparative studies, this article evidently proves that the use of constrained Gaussian processes is data-efficient, highly accurate, yields low uncertainties, recovers model overfitting and extrapolates very well compared to unconstrained or conventional Gaussian processes.

  abstract     = {We recently proposed an efficient method facilitating the parametric study of a finite element mechanical simulation as a postprocessing step, that is, without the need to run multiple simulations: the a posteriori finite element method (APFEM). APFEM only requires the knowledge of the vertices of the parameter space and is able to predict accurately how the degrees of freedom of a simulation, i.e., nodal displacements, and other outputs of interests, for example, element stress tensors, evolve when simulation parameters vary within their predefined ranges. In our previous work, these parameters were restricted to material properties and loading conditions. Here, we extend the APFEM to additionally account for changes in the original geometry. This is achieved by defining an intermediary reference frame whose mapping is defined stochastically in the weak form. Subsequent deformation is then reached by correcting for this stochastic variation in the reference frame through multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. The resulting framework is shown here to provide accurate mechanical predictions for relevant applications of increasing complexity: (i) quantifying the stress concentration factor of a plate under uniaxial loading with one and two elliptical holes of varying eccentricities, and (ii) performing the stochastic homogenisation of a composite plate with uncertain mechanical properties and geometry inclusion. This extension of APFEM completes our original approach to account parametrically for geometrical alterations, in addition to boundary conditions and material properties. The advantages of this approach in our original work in terms of stochastic prediction, uncertainty quantification, structural and material optimisation and Bayesian inferences are all naturally conserved.},

  abstract     = {Sparse regression and feature extraction are the cornerstones of knowledge discovery from massive data. Their goal is to discover interpretable and predictive models that provide simple relationships among scientific variables. While the statistical tools for model discovery are well established in the context of linear regression, their generalization to nonlinear regression in material modeling is highly problem-specific and insufficiently understood. Here we explore the potential of neural networks for automatic model discovery and induce sparsity by a hybrid approach that combines two strategies: regularization and physical constraints. We integrate the concept of L p regularization for subset selection with constitutive neural networks that leverage our domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics. We train our networks with both, synthetic and real data, and perform several thousand discovery runs to infer common guidelines and trends: L 2 regularization or ridge regression is unsuitable for model discovery; L 1 regularization or lasso promotes sparsity, but induces strong bias that may aggressively change the results; only L 0 regularization allows us to transparently fine-tune the trade-off between interpretability and predictability, simplicity and accuracy, and bias and variance. With these insights, we demonstrate that L p regularized constitutive neural networks can simultaneously discover both, interpretable models and physically meaningful parameters. We anticipate that our findings will generalize to alternative discovery techniques such as sparse and symbolic regression, and to other domains such as biology, chemistry, or medicine. Our ability to automatically discover material models from data could have tremendous applications in generative material design and open new opportunities to manipulate matter, alter properties of existing materials, and discover new materials with user-defined properties.},

  abstract     = {Numerical modeling of immiscible two-phase flow in deformable porous media has become increasingly significant due to its applications in oil reservoir engineering, geotechnical engineering and many others. The coupling between two-phase flow and geomechanics gives rise to a major challenge to the development of physically consistent mathematical models and effective numerical methods. In this article, based on the concept of free energies and guided by the second law of thermodynamics, we derive a thermodynamically consistent mathematical model for immiscible two-phase flow in poro-viscoelastic media. The model uses the fluid and solid free energies to characterize the fluid capillarity and solid skeleton elasticity, so that it rigorously follows an energy dissipation law. The thermodynamically consistent formulation of the pore fluid pressure is naturally derived for the solid mechanical equilibrium equation. Additionally, the model ensures the mass conservation law for both fluids and solids. For numerical approximation of the model, we propose an energy stable and mass conservative numerical method. The method herein inherits the energy dissipation law through appropriate energy approaches and subtle treatments for the coupling between two phase saturations, the effective pore pressure and porosity. Using the locally conservative cell-centered finite difference methods on staggered grids with the upwind strategies for saturations and porosity, we construct the fully discrete scheme, which has the ability to conserve the masses of both fluids and solids as well as preserve the energy dissipation law at the fully discrete level. In particular, the proposed method is an unbiased algorithm, that is, treating the wetting phase, the non-wetting phase and the solid phase in the same way. Numerical results are also given to validate and verify the features of the proposed model and numerical method.},

  abstract     = {Modeling an aortic dissection represents a particular challenge from a numerical perspective, especially when it comes to the interaction between solid (aortic wall) and liquid (blood flow). The complexity of patient-specific simulations requires a variety of parameters, modeling assumptions and simplifications that currently hinder their routine use in clinical settings. We present a numerical framework that captures, among other things, the layer-specific anisotropic properties of the aortic wall, the non-Newtonian behavior of blood, patient-specific geometry, and patient-specific flow conditions. We compare hemodynamic indicators and stress measurements in simulations with increasingly complex material models for the vessel tissue ranging from rigid walls to anisotropic hyperelastic materials. We find that for the present geometry and boundary conditions, rigid wall simulations produce different results than fluid–structure interaction simulations. Considering anisotropic fiber contributions in the tissue model, stress measurements in the aortic wall differ, but shear stress-based biomarkers are less affected. In summary, the increasing complexity of the tissue model enables capturing more details. However, an extensive parameter set is also required. Since the simulation results depend on these modeling choices, variations can lead to different recommendations in clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) are increasingly pivotal in the design of advanced metamaterials, seamlessly integrated with material or topology optimization. Their intrinsic capability to predict and interconnect material properties across vast design spaces, often computationally prohibitive for conventional methods, has led to groundbreaking possibilities. This paper introduces an innovative machine learning approach for the optimization of acoustic metamaterials, focusing on Multiresonant Layered Acoustic Metamaterial (MLAM), designed for targeted noise attenuation at low frequencies (below 1000 Hz). This method leverages ML to create a continuous model of the Representative Volume Element (RVE) effective properties essential for evaluating sound transmission loss (STL), and subsequently used to optimize the overall topology configuration for maximum sound attenuation using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The significance of this methodology lies in its ability to deliver rapid results without compromising accuracy, significantly reducing the computational overhead of complete topology optimization by several orders of magnitude. To demonstrate the versatility and scalability of this approach, it is extended to a more intricate RVE model, characterized by a higher number of parameters, and is optimized using the same strategy. In addition, to underscore the potential of ML techniques in synergy with traditional topology optimization, a comparative analysis is conducted, comparing the outcomes of the proposed method with those obtained through direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the corresponding full 3D MLAM model. This comparative analysis highlights the transformative potential of this combination, particularly when addressing complex topological challenges with significant computational demands, ushering in a new era of metamaterial and component design.},

  abstract     = {In topology optimization of transient problems, memory requirements and computational costs often become prohibitively large due to the backward-in-time adjoint equations. Common approaches such as the Checkpointing (CP) and Local-in-Time (LT) algorithms reduce memory requirements by dividing the temporal domain into intervals and by computing sensitivities on one interval at a time. The CP algorithm reduces memory by recomputing state solutions instead of storing them. This leads to a significant increase in computational cost. The LT algorithm introduces approximations in the adjoint solution to reduce memory requirements and leads to a minimal increase in computational effort. However, we show that convergence can be hampered using the LT algorithm due to errors in approximate adjoints. To reduce memory and/or computational time, we present two novel algorithms. The hybrid Checkpointing/Local-in-Time (CP/LT) algorithm improves the convergence behavior of the LT algorithm at the cost of an increased computational time but remains more efficient than the CP algorithm. The Parallel-Local-in-Time (PLT) algorithm reduces the computational time through a temporal parallelization in which state and adjoint equations are solved simultaneously on multiple intervals. State and adjoint fields converge concurrently with the design. The effectiveness of each approach is illustrated with two-dimensional density-based topology optimization problems involving transient thermal or flow physics. Compared to the other discussed algorithms, we found a significant decrease in computational time for the PLT algorithm. Moreover, we show that under certain conditions, due to the use of approximations in the LT and PLT algorithms, they exhibit a bias toward designs with short characteristic times. Finally, based on the required memory reduction, computational cost, and convergence behavior of optimization problems, guidelines are provided for selecting the appropriate algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The intractable multiscale constitutives and the high computational cost in direct numerical simulations are the bottlenecks in fracture analysis of heterogeneous materials. In an attempt to achieve a balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a mathematically rigorous phase-field model for multiscale fracture. Leveraging the phase-field theory, the difficulty of discrete-continuous coupling in conventional cross-scale crack propagation analysis is resolved by constructing a continuum description of the crack. Based on the asymptotic expansion, an equivalent two-field coupled boundary-value problem is well-defined, from which we rigorously derive the macroscopic equivalent parameters, including the equivalent elasticity tensor and the equivalent fracture toughness tensor. In our approach, both the displacement field and the phase-field are simultaneously expanded, allowing us to obtain a fracture toughness tensor with diagonal elements of the corresponding matrix controlling anisotropic fracture behavior and non-diagonal elements governing crack deflection. This enables multiscale finite element homogenization procedure to accurately reproduce microstructural information, and capture the crack deflection angle in anisotropic materials without any a priori knowledge. From the numerical results, the proposed multiscale phase-field method demonstrates a significant reduction in computation time with respect to full-field simulations. Moreover, the method accurately reproduces physical consistent anisotropic fracture of non-centrosymmetric porous media, and the experimentally consistent damage response of fiber-reinforced composites. This work fuses well-established mathematical homogenization theory with the cutting-edge fracture phase-field method, sparking a fresh perspective for the fracture of heterogeneous media.},

  abstract     = {The study of polymers has continued to gain substantial attention due to their expanding range of applications, spanning essential engineering fields to emerging domains like stretchable electronics, soft robotics, and implantable sensors. These materials exhibit remarkable properties, primarily stemming from their intricate polymer chain network, which, in turn, increases the complexity of precisely modeling their behavior. Especially for modeling elastomers and their fracture behavior, accurately accounting for the deformations of the polymer chains is vital for predicting the rupture in highly stretched chains. Despite the importance, many robust multiscale continuum frameworks for modeling elastomer fracture tend to simplify network deformations by assuming uniform behavior among chains in all directions. Recognizing this limitation, our study proposes a multiscale fracture model that accounts for the anisotropic nature of elastomer network responses. At the microscale, damage in the chains is assumed to be driven by both the chain&#39;s entropy and the internal energy due to molecular bond distortions. In order to bridge the stretching in the chains to the macroscale deformation, we employ the maximal advance path constraint network model, inherently accommodating anisotropic network responses. As a result, chains oriented differently can be predicted to exhibit varying stretch and, consequently, different damage levels. To drive macroscale fracture based on damages in these chains, we utilize the micromorphic regularization theory, which involves the introduction of dual local-global damage variables at the macroscale. The macroscale local damage variable is obtained through the homogenization of the chain damage values, resulting in the prediction of an isotropic material response. The macroscale global damage variable is subjected to nonlocal effects and boundary conditions in a thermodynamically consistent phase field continuum formulation. Moreover, the total dissipation in the system is considered to be mainly due to the breaking of the molecular bonds at the microscale. To validate our model, we employ the double-edge notched tensile test as a benchmark, comparing simulation predictions with existing experimental data. Additionally, to enhance our understanding of the fracturing process, we conduct uniaxial tensile experiments on a square film made up of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rubber embedded with a hole and notches and then compare our simulation predictions with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we visualize the evolution of stretch and damage values in chains oriented along different directions to assess the predictive capacity of the model. The results are also compared with another existing model to evaluate the utility of our model in accurately simulating the fracture behavior of rubber-like materials.},

High-order time integrators can deliver the optimal performance of highly accurate and robust spatial discretizations such as isogeometric analysis. The generalized- α $$ \alpha $$ method delivers unconditional stability and second-order accuracy in time and controls the numerical dissipation in the discrete spectrum&#39;s high-frequency region. We extend the generalized- α $$ \alpha $$ methodology to obtain high-order time marching methods with high accuracy and dissipation control in the discrete high-frequency range. Furthermore, we maintain the original stability region of the second-order generalized- α $$ \alpha $$ method in the new higher-order methods; we increase the accuracy of the generalized- α $$ \alpha $$ method while keeping the unconditional stability and user-control features on the high-frequency numerical dissipation. The methodology solves k &gt; 1 , k ∈ ℕ $$ k&gt;1,k\in \mathbb{N} $$ matrix problems and updates the system unknowns, which correspond to higher-order terms in Taylor expansions to obtain ( 3 / 2 k ) th $$ \left(3/2k\right)\mathrm{th} $$ -order method for even k $$ k $$ and ( 3 / 2 k + 1 / 2 ) th $$ \left(3/2k+1/2\right)\mathrm{th} $$ -order for odd k $$ k $$ .

Additionally, we show that our method is A-stable, and for ρ ∞ = 0 $$ {\rho}^{\infty }=0 $$ we obtain an L-stable method. Furthermore, we extend this strategy to analyze the accuracy order of a generic method. Lastly, we provide numerical examples that validate our analysis of the method and demonstrate its performance. First, we simulate heat propagation; then, we analyze nonlinear problems, such as the Swift–Hohenberg and Cahn–Hilliard phase-field models. To conclude, we compare the method to Runge–Kutta techniques in simulating the Lorenz system.},

The evolution of the viscous deformations is based upon a new numerical approach, which allows for a consistent consideration of anisotropic finite strain viscoelasticity, according to the authors knowledge. A standard Maxwell model is used to describe viscous behaviour at finite deformations. Furthermore, the orthotropic Yeoh material model is extended to include a distinction between behaviour under tensile and compression loading. The proposed formulation is validated, and parameters of the model are identified by material tests on Sorghum bicolor plants. Subsequently, numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the capabilities of the model. In general, the proposed Yeoh material formulation is shown to accurately represent the inability of fibres to carry compression loading. Furthermore, the viscoelastic approach, developed relative to the viscous intermediate configuration, is demonstrated to be capable of producing plausible results. Additionally, the mechanical behaviour of Sorghum bicolor plants is simulated using the introduced formulation.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in computational tools and additive manufacturing have expanded design possibilities on fluid devices and structures to also include aesthetics. However, traditional discrete density-based topology optimization methods usually use square and cubic regular meshes, resulting in jagged contour patterns that require mesh refinement and post-processing to numerical solution steps of complex physics problems. In this article, we propose a new isosurface boundary capture strategy for topology optimization in structural and fluid flow problems. The capture of smoothed boundaries is done via a simple strategy through element splitting and analysis domain remeshing. The smoothing procedure novelty lies on the optimizer regular mesh decomposition into smaller triangular or tetrahedral elements with a pseudo-density nodal function that produces implicit geometry boundaries. We employ the TOBS-GT (topology optimization of binary structures with geometry trimming) method to solve optimization problems for mean compliance and fluid flow energy dissipation, subject to a volume fraction constraint. Since, we perform discrete body-fitted optimization, the material interpolation models are expressed in linear form without penalty factors. Our method produces a lower computational cost topology evolution with high resolution and mitigated sharp details, achieved via smooth edges and surfaces, as demonstrated through benchmark numerical examples in two- and three-dimensional space. In addition, the proposed strategy facilitates the optimization of benchmark fluid flow examples for moderate Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract     = {Several decades after the invention of the rechargeable Li-ion battery, countless innovations from both the research and industry communities have led to placing the secondary battery at the heart of the electrification revolution in recent years. Mathematical and numerical models have been trusted companions in advancing the technology to help guide design improvements or to gain insight when physical measurements are impossible to perform. Starting with the breakthrough porous electrode theory (PET) model proposed by Newman and co-workers in 1975 (Newman and Tiedemann, AIChE Journal, 1975, 21, 25–41), many authors have improved the formulation from a variety of perspectives. The novel aspects of the model we propose in this paper expand on this long stream of PET formulations and aim to address modeling needs that, to the authors&#39; knowledge, have not been yet considered. The proposed formulation is characterized by the following concurrent features: (1) a full 3D description of the macroscale behavior and 1D microscale in spherical coordinates (Pseudo 4D formulation [P4D]) accounting for geometric details of the cell architecture such as imperfect spiral jellyrolls in cylindrical cells; (2) multiple concurrent particle chemistries to model the microscale lithiation/delithiation behavior at every macroscale element integration point, leading to a multiscale ( ) approach; (3) a fully coupled thermal-electrochemical-mechanical stress interaction due to lithiation/delithiation induced swelling and external confinement; (4) spatially-dependent porosity evolutions due to swelling of the particles in the porous electrodes; (5) electrolyte flow in the porous regions and overfill spaces via Darcy-based flow including partial saturation of the active regions; (6) detailed descriptions of individual battery components such as the electrodes, separator, and current collectors with the possibility of “connecting” the different components through contact definitions; (7) fully linearized macro-microscale coupling behavior allowing for large time increments in an implicit time integration scheme for a scalable and computationally effective numerical solution. A number of numerical examples including validation against experimental data are performed to demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model and its efficiency for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {We present a phase-field fracture model for a stress resultant geometrically exact shell in finite deformation regime where the configuration manifold evolves according to deformation and fracture. The Reissner–Mindlin shell problem is first solved via the finite element method, where the independent unknown fields are the displacement and director. The phase-field ductile fracture model is then coupled with the verified geometrically exact shell by enriching the three-field elasto-plastic free energy with a regularized crack surface energy. To capture the geometrical nonlinearity due to the large plastic deformation exhibited in the processing zone, the corresponding finite-strain stress resultant elasto-plasticity model is coupled with the phase field model. This coupling between the stress resultant elasto-plasticity model and the phase-field fracture model enables us to predict the different amounts of energy dissipation attributed to plastic deformation and fracture and hence simulate the crack propagation in the ductile regime properly. We introduce a mixed finite element model with displacement, director, and phase-field order parameters as the nodal degree of freedoms formulated on the mid-surface. An energy-based arc-length method is generalized to track the equilibrium path and mitigate instabilities arising from material nonlinearity. Four numerical examples are presented to validate the implementation of the model and demonstrate its capability to simulate ductile fracture in shell structures. These examples include a plane-stress tension/shear fracture model, the Muscat-Fenech and Atkins plate, axial tension of a notched cylindrical shell, and ductile fracture of a simply supported plate under uniform pressure.},

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion systems have been proposed as a model for pattern formation and morphogenesis. The Fickian diffusion typically employed in these constructions model the Brownian motion of particles. The biological and chemical elements that form the basis of this process, like cells and proteins, occupy finite mass and volume and interact during migration. We propose a Reaction-Diffusion system with Maxwell-Stefan formulation to construct the diffusive flux. This formulation relies on inter-species force balance and provides a more realistic model for interacting elements. We also present a variational system inference-based technique to extract these models from spatiotemporal data for these processes. We show that the inferred models can capture the characteristics of local Turing instability that instigates the pattern formation process. Moreover, the equilibrium solutions of the inferred models form similar patterns to the observed data.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear static analyses of three-dimensional (3D) curved geometrically exact beams are carried out using a hierarchal quadrature element method (HQEM) in this work. The initial value of the rotational quaternions is computed from an initial-value problem with arc-length as the “time” variable, so that the quaternions can be differentiated in subsequent computation. The 3D curved geometrically exact beams are first expressed by NURBS and then transformed to be expressed by the hierarchical quadrature bases. The geometrically exact beams are then analyzed by the same hierarchical quadrature bases, which conforms to the isogeometric concept. This procedure of analysis is new. The weak-form quadrature element method (QEM) is a special case of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM). It is found that the best accuracy may be obtained when the number of integration nodes is one degree less than the nodal points, instead of taking them the same as in the weak-form QEM. Numerical tests through several examples show that the HQEM can present results with high accuracy using only a few degrees of freedom and is not sensitive to shear locking.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a new high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, in which neither a penalty parameter nor a stabilization parameter is needed. We refer to this method as penalty-free DG. In this method, the trial and test functions belong to the broken Sobolev space, in which the functions are in general discontinuous on the mesh skeleton and do not meet the Dirichlet boundary conditions. However, a subset can be distinguished in this space, where the functions are continuous and satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions, and this subset is called admissible. The trial solution is chosen to lie in an augmented admissible subset, in which a small violation of the continuity condition is permitted. This subset is constructed by applying special augmented constraints to the linear combination of finite element basis functions. In this approach, all the advantages of the DG method are retained without the necessity of using stability parameters or numerical fluxes. Several benchmark problems in two dimensions (Poisson equation, linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, and biharmonic equation) on polygonal (triangles, quadrilateral, and weakly convex polygons) meshes as well as a three-dimensional Poisson problem on hexahedral meshes are considered. Numerical results are presented that affirm the sound accuracy and optimal convergence of the method in the norm and the energy seminorm.},

The GOPs are randomly oriented and evenly distributed throughout the composite layers, with their weight fraction varying in the thickness direction. The Halpin-Tsai model is employed to estimate each layer&#39;s effective material properties. The nonlinear governing equations for the FG-GOPRC beam are derived based on the first-order shear deformation beam theory, and a nonlinear algebraic system is formulated using the principle of potential energy. In this research, a comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to examine the influence of various factors on the buckling and post-buckling behaviors of the composite beams. These factors include the distribution pattern and weight fraction of graphene platelets (GPLs) nanofillers, as well as the geometry, size, slenderness ratio, and boundary conditions of the beams. Through the analysis, the study highlights the significant strengthening effect of these factors on the buckling and post-buckling performance of the composite beams. The findings from this investigation contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of multilayer nanocomposite beams reinforced with GOPs. This knowledge can be valuable in designing and optimizing of composite structures for enhanced buckling resistance and post-buckling performance.},

The distinguishing feature of this unsymmetric element is that two different interpolation schemes are employed for virtual displacement and real stress calculations, respectively. The assumed natural strain (ANS) method with shell assumptions, referring to the current configuration, is introduced to modify the strain tensors derived from the assumed virtual displacement fields in terms of isoparametric coordinates, thereby mitigating shear locking and trapezoidal locking. On the other hand, the analytical trial functions (ATFs) derived from the general solutions of homogenous governing equations for linear elasticity are updated in each increment step to obtain the incremental deformation gradient, which is then utilized for calculating the real stresses for curing the numerical difficulties in large deformation problems. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm enables the hyper-elastic solid-shell element US-ATFHS8 to exhibit excellent performance in both regular and distorted meshes and yield considerable results even when other models cannot work.},

We extend the idea of deterministic modal decomposition method for structural dynamic analysis to stochastic cases. Standard/generalized stochastic eigenvalue equations are adopted to calculate the stochastic subspaces for stochastic static/dynamic problems and they are solved by an efficient reduced-order method. The stochastic solutions of both static and dynamic equations are approximated by stochastic bases of the stochastic subspaces. Original stochastic static/dynamic equations are then transformed into a set of single-degree-of-freedom (SDoF) stochastic static/dynamic equations, which are efficiently solved by the proposed non-intrusive methods. Specifically, a non-intrusive stochastic Newmark method is developed for the solution of SDoF stochastic dynamic equations, and the element-wise division of sample vectors is used to solve the SDoF stochastic static equations. All of these methods have low computational effort and are weakly sensitive to the stochastic dimension, thus the proposed methods avoid the curse of dimensionality successfully. Two numerical examples, including two- and three-dimensional spatial problems with low and high stochastic dimensions, are given to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.},

The functional is a modified Hellinger-Reissner in terms of the kinematic variables and independent transverse shear strains. Hence, we consider quadratic rotations, as in DKQ, and linear independent shear strains with constant tangential components on sides, as in MITC4. The quadratic rotation contributions and the mixed shear strain components are wiped out by static condensation. To adequately satisfy the constant curvature patch tests, we also consider the orthogonality conditions between the linear and quadratic bending modes, as in the Bergan free formulation, to avoid ‘spurious bending energy’ for thick plates (also called bending locking). The paper contains comprehensive patch tests and convergence tests with regular and irregular meshes (displacements, internal forces, and strain energy) of circular and square plates. The element is compared with other existing elements (MITC4, DKMQ). It is concluded that BKWA is an efficient element regarding several criteria.},

The s-version finite element method (s-FEM), which models a precipitate of arbitrary shape using a local mesh is used to calculate coherency stress fields. The method facilitates meshing precipitate volumes of arbitrary geometry, and multiple local meshes can be superimposed at various positions of the global mesh. Accuracy and convergence conditions of the method are established. For a single precipiate, the method is shown to be 3.5 times faster than a standard FEM calculation for the same accuracy, and the gain in speed increases with the number of precipitates.

As a consequence, laminate composite voxels may be regarded as a kinematic assumption within a discretization scheme rather than a part of material modeling , as suggested originally. We discuss how to seamlessly integrate composite voxels into the framework of a level-set description of the microstructure, in particular the accurate and efficient computation of normals and cut-volume fractions. In contrast to more traditional strategies based on subvoxelizations, the introduced method avoids systematic errors when computing composite voxel properties.

  abstract     = {New methods are presented for the direct computation of higher-order inverse mass matrices (also called reciprocal mass matrices) that are used for explicit transient finite element analysis. The motivation of this work lies in the need of having appropriate sparse inverse mass matrices, which present the same structure as the consistent mass matrix, preserve the total mass, predict suitable frequency spectrum and dictate sufficiently large critical time step sizes. For an efficient evaluation of the reciprocal mass matrix, the projection matrix should be diagonal. This condition can be satisfied by adopting dual shape functions for the momentum field, generated from the same shape functions used for the displacement field. A theoretically consistent derivation of the inverse mass matrix is based on the three-field Hamilton principle and requires the projection matrix to be evaluated from the integral of these shape functions. Unfortunately, for higher-order FE shape functions and serendipity FE elements, the projection matrix is not positive definitive and can not be employed. Therefore, we study several lumping procedures for higher order reciprocal mass matrices considering their effect on total-mass preserving, frequency spectra and accuracy in explicit transient simulations. The article closes with several numerical examples showing suitability of the direct inverse mass matrix in dynamics.},

In this study, novel high-order multi-scale asymptotic solutions are developed to accurately capture the locally oscillating characteristics of gas flow and solid displacement fields at multiple scales. First, the formal macro-meso two-scale asymptotic expansion is performed to establish the homogenized solutions and macro-meso high-order models which can predict the HM coupling problems at the macroscale and mesoscale. By directly expanding the cell functions defined at the mesoscale to the microscopic levels, the high-order two-scale expansion for the mesoscopic cell functions is built, and the upscaled relations for the flow parameters and constitutive coefficients from the microscale to the mesoscale and macroscale are developed correspondingly. The multi-scale low/high-order models are established by combining the high-order expansion of all cell functions at the mesoscale and the developed macro-meso two-scale models. The main contributions are that the present approaches follow the reverse thought processes of reiteration homogenization methods, and offer a very innovative and efficient way to establish high-accuracy high-order models for the nonlinear HM coupling problems in the heterogeneous porous medium with any number of spatial scales. The effectiveness and accuracy of the present solution are validated by several representative cases with different constitutive coefficient contrasts. The results demonstrate that the high-order solutions provide an accurate prediction for gas transport and solid deformation of heterogeneous porous media with multi-scale configurations.},

As in structural dynamics masses in a gravity field generate the loading, their location, and their modifications within the deformation process must be considered in a nonlinear simulation. A specific view besides loading by masses is on gas and fluid interaction with structures. In addition, load control using specifically designed algorithms is evaluated with respect to realistic applications. Within the load modeling an unavoidable, however side aspect, is the general discussion about the so-called follower forces and non-conservative loading.

A variational formulation for the two-scale boundary value problem and the associated finite element formulation is developed. Constraints with 5 or 9 Lagrange parameters are derived which eliminate both rigid body movements and dependencies of the shear stiffness on the size of the representative volume elements (RVEs). At the bottom and top surface of the RVEs which extend through the total thickness of the shell stress boundary conditions are present. The periodic boundary conditions at the lateral surfaces are applied in such a way that particular membrane, bending and shear modes are not restrained. This is shown by means of a homogeneous RVE. The first of all linear formulation is extended to finite strain problems introducing transformation relations for the stress resultants and the material matrix. The transformations are performed at the Gauss points on macro level. Several boundary value problems including large deformations, stability and inelasticity are computed and compared with 3D reference solutions.},

This article aims on presenting a novel numerical method for large deformation simulations, which is named the implicit Updated Lagrangian Fragile Points Method (ULFPM). The point-based nature of the proposed method ensures immunity to mesh distortion, and its stability is guaranteed by its foundation on weak form formulations. For verifications, the proposed implicit ULFPM has been applied to several large deformation problems. For all the examples, the proposed method is able to provide reliable results with a good agreement with the reference results. Moreover, the implicit ULFPM performs better than the Finite Element Method to some extent for extremely large deformation problems. It is also discussed that the accuracy of the implicit ULFPM is improved significantly by using the support domain refinement scheme. The examples indicate that the proposed method can serve as a reliable tool for predicting the large deformations of structures in engineering practices.},

  abstract     = {In this work, several structure preserving and energy dissipative contact approaches are proposed and evaluated. The time integration schemes considered are general with regard to the version of constraint type, but here the emphasis was on mortar contact. The proposed mortar contact approach conserves both linear and angular momentum for mortar contact in a novel way. The proposed time integration scheme can conserve energy or provide strict contact dissipation. In addition, the proposed scheme enforces both gap constraints and gap velocity constraints (i.e., persistency). Using a midstep time integrator often causes energy dissipation during initial impact, here this energy can be recovered in a novel way. Enforcing the gap velocity constraint mitigates the contact chatter of the contact pressure and nodes in many problems. Whereas some approaches enforce the persistency condition and gap constraints simultaneously during the solution of the equations of motion (EOM) requiring multipliers for both constraints included in the equation set, here the gap constraint is solved through the equations of motion and the persistency condition is satisfied in the time integration scheme by the velocity update after the equations of motion. It is shown that this approach is strictly dissipative in that a plastic contact condition can be achieved. Analogous to a coefficient of restitution for rigid bodies, any dissipated energy can then be returned upon release if energy conservation is desired. Structure preserving methods are good for long-time dynamics simulations and energy conserving and strictly dissipative methods can overcome stability issues associated with standard time integration algorithms such as the Newmark method.},

Because the feedback of sound pressure onto the fluid-loaded structures has to be taken into account in this case, a fully coupled scheme which combines the structural finite element method (FEM) and the acoustic boundary element method (BEM) is employed in the numerical simulation. The resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem created by the coupled finite element and boundary element (FE-BE) method is converted into a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) of reduced dimension by using a contour integral method. The design sensitivity formulation for non-repeated eigenvalues is derived based on an adjoint method which uses both the left and right eigenvectors, and a small GEP is formed to calculate the gradients of repeated eigenvalues. The Burton-Miller formulation is employed to shift the fictitious eigenfrequencies and their derivatives, and the parameter setting which is beneficial to the filtering of fictitious eigenfrequencies is investigated. Numerical examples are given to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed method.},

However, two significant numerical issues must be addressed: non-smoothness caused by multiple frequencies and Artificial Localized Rigid Motion (ALRM) modes due to the violation of the topological constraint related to isolated islands and point-connections. The above two issues are solved by employing the discrete variable topology optimization method based on Sequential Approximate Integer Programming (SAIP). First, the directional differentiability and multiple frequencies preservation constraints are formulated as the linear integer constraints. And then, the integer programming with these linear integer constraints is established and solved by the discrete variable linear or quadratic programming solver with multi-constraint Canonical Relaxation Algorithm (CRA). We also prove that the popular Average Modal Frequencies (AMF) strategy, like the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) function, cannot rigorously tackle this non-smoothness caused by multiple frequencies. Furthermore, to eliminate the ALRM modes and concentrate on the real structural global modes, the burning method is employed to impose the topological constraint of the first Betti number that represents the number of isolated islands and point-connections. Numerical examples, including 2D and 3D, two-fold and three-fold multiple frequencies, natural frequencies and frequency gaps, are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, in many situations, simply filling spaces may not be the most effective approach. In that scenario, this work introduces a multiphase acoustic topology optimization methodology to design closed-space structures for sound attenuation. Based on the Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) algorithm, the proposed approach combines Biot&#39;s poroelasticity equations, expressed in the mixed u $$ \mathbf{u} $$ /p form, and the Unified Multiphase (UMP) technique to fully describe the multiphysics involved in the acoustic, poroelastic and elastic model relations. An objective function contemplating different combinations of structural, viscous and thermal dissipated powers is maximized over multiple frequencies. Volume constraints in each material phase and a novel material interpolation scheme are also considered. The resultant topologies present enhanced dissipated power levels and manufacturability, even when compared with various baseline configurations of similar volume fractions.},

In the proposed approach, low-dimensional spaces, constructed for the healthy structure, are enriched with appropriately selected columns of the flexibility matrix of the system. It can be shown that these spaces contain the solution to the original problem for the static case, while their dimension is much smaller. In order to allow their online construction for arbitrary localised features, the full flexibility matrix of the system should be available. To this end, a hierarchical representation is used for the matrices involved, allowing to compute the flexibility matrix efficiently and with reduced memory requirements. The resulting method offers significant speedups, without sacrificing the flexibility and accuracy of the full order model. The performance and limitations of the approach are studied through a series of examples in structural dynamics.},

However, uncertainties are inevitable in real-world. The structural strength of a design, achieved through deterministic topology optimization, is highly susceptible to these uncertainties, which may result in failure. This article introduces a novel method for topology optimization in stress-constrained thermoelastic structures, taking into account the uncertainties associated with heat sources and loads. We employ the Kieisselmeier–Steinhauser function to aggregate the stress constraint when constructing the performance function. In order to improve optimization efficiency, the sequential optimization and reliability assessment method is used to decouple the double-layer loop reliability-based topology optimization. Initially, we derive the derivative of stress-based performance functions with respect to heat source and load uncertainty variables, thereby facilitating the use of modified chaos control for assessing structural reliability and imposing constraints. The adjoint method and chain rule are utilized to obtain the derivative information of the performance function with respect to density variables, guiding the topology updates. We present five design examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method. Monte Carlo simulations for the optimized results are performed to show that the presented method can obtain a structure that meets reliability requirements.},

Optimal scaling analysis provides the analytical form of the effective material law that models the ductile fracture phenomena at the macroscale. The upscaled model of ductile behavior assumes the form of a cohesive relation—surface traction versus displacement—of the power-law type with well-defined exponents. In the present work, we demonstrate how the effective cohesive law derived from optimal scaling can be conveniently inserted into macroscale calculations by recourse to cohesive elements. The plastic deformation outside the cohesive elements is of moderate size and can be modeled by means of conventional plasticity models. In particular, the mesh size is dictated by accuracy considerations at the macroscale structural level and is not in any way constrained by microscale features and mechanisms, which happen at the subgrid level and are accounted for by the effective cohesive law. We illustrate the multiscale paradigm by means of spall calculations.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving a wide range of numerical problems. Nevertheless, conventional PINNs frequently face challenges in model convergence and stability when optimizing complex loss functions containing complex gradients. In this study, a new mesh-based PINN method, called M-PINN, is proposed drawing the ideas of the finite element method (FEM). By partitioning the solution domain into several subdomains and incorporating finite element data distribution constraints to the prior estimates of the predicted data distribution of PINN on the solution domain, the M-PINN approach effectively reduces the optimization difficulty of conventional PINNs. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to directly obtain precise boundary conditions in some practical applications. This method can be used to solve PINN problems with unknown boundary conditions, thus having wider applicability. In this study, the efficiency of M-PINN was demonstrated through a standard 2D linear elastic solid mechanics simulation experiment, and its applicability was investigated in depth. The results indicate that the M-PINN method outperforms traditional PINN and exhibits superior applicability and convergence, especially in cases involving unknown boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {The material point method is a versatile technique which can be used to solve various types of solid mechanics problems, especially those involving large deformations. However, the capability of the material point method to track a load-displacement response can deteriorate once a limit point, such as snap-through or snap-back, in the response is encountered. One way of overcoming this is to use path following techniques, such as an arc-length method. This technique is well established in finite element analysis but not within any material point method formulation. This paper provides for the first time an arc-length controlled implicit, quasi-static material point method. The modifications to the standard arc-length scheme to allow for the stable execution of an arc-length solver within the material point method are detailed. The capability of the material point-based arc-length method is demonstrated through a number of problems, which include linear elastic, non-linear elastic, linear elastic-perfectly plastic and linear elastic-plastic softening material behaviour under large deformations. The techniques presented in this paper are essential for arc-length techniques to be applied effectively to the material point method and the combination of these techniques makes the method suitable for new problems that cannot be solved with existing implicit material point approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a variational formulation for coupled problems in thermodynamics the most suitable for long-term simulations of plastic behavior. We start with three-field Hu–Washize variational formulation and perform regularization to include non-symmetric stress, we thus recover the formulation that can accommodate any choice of discrete approximation. Such a regularized variational formulation allows us to eliminate the rotation field (as typically less important) and recover the corresponding hybrid stress format for equations of motion and transient heat conduction. The regularized variational formulation is further combined with discrete approximation based upon the Raviart–Thomas vector space for both mechanical and thermal fields, which enforces continuity across element boundaries for stress vector and normal component of heat-flux. The conservation properties are validated with energy-conserving scheme for thermoelastic behavior. The time integration of thermo-viscoplastic behavior is carried out by energy-decaying scheme to provide superior accuracy for computed stress in a long-term simulation. The proposed approach offers higher computational robustness and results accuracy than the classical finite elements and time-integration schemes. Such a performance is illustrated on several numerical simulations in non-stationary problems for thermo-viscoplastic behavior.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic shearing banding and fracturing in unsaturated porous media are significant problems in engineering and science. This article proposes a multiphase micro-periporomechanics ( μ $$ \mu $$ PPM) paradigm for modeling dynamic shear banding and fracturing in unsaturated porous media. Periporomechanics (PPM) is a nonlocal reformulation of classical poromechanics to model continuous and discontinuous deformation/fracture and fluid flow in porous media through a single framework. In PPM, a multiphase porous material is postulated as a collection of a finite number of mixed material points. The length scale in PPM that dictates the nonlocal interaction between material points is a mathematical object that lacks a direct physical meaning. As a novelty, in the coupled PPM, a microstructure-based material length scale is incorporated by considering micro-rotations of the solid skeleton following the Cosserat continuum theory for solids. As a new contribution, we reformulate the second-order work for detecting material instability and the energy-based crack criterion and J-integral for modeling fracturing in the PPM paradigm. The stabilized Cosserat PPM correspondence principle that mitigates the multiphase zero-energy mode instability is augmented to include unsaturated fluid flow. We have numerically implemented the novel PPM paradigm through a dual-way fractional-step algorithm in time and a hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian meshfree method in space. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed PPM paradigm for modeling shear banding and fracturing in unsaturated porous media.},

Its value relies on a proper choice of the distance parameter from the interface. We have derived an optimal distance parameter from the analytical solution of a uniaxial tension problem.

We focus on two-dimensional mixed polygonal finite element formulations with linear displacement and constant pressure approximations in particular. The inf-sup stability of these formulations is assessed and compared with classical mixed finite element formulations. An analytical proof is presented, which concludes that the occurrence of spurious pressure modes depends on the chosen meshing strategy. It is shown that these spurious modes are successfully suppressed on any Voronoi mesh in both linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity without the need for any kind of stabilization. Several linear and nonlinear nearly-incompressible examples with different discretization strategies and boundary conditions are considered to validate the analytical proof. A mixed polygonal finite element formulation based on the scaled boundary parameterization is used to approximate the field variables, however, the derivations presented herein hold for any lowest-order mixed polygonal finite element formulation. The nonexistence of checkerboard modes on linear elastic Voronoi discretizations is shown graphically. By evaluating the incremental pressure in each Newton–Raphson iteration, the stabilization effect of the Voronoi discretization is demonstrated for nonlinear problems. In addition, the analytical proof is validated by the numerical (generalized) inf-sup test.},

Particular attention is given to the correlation between the linearised forms of the fixed-pole and helicoidal interpolation with the linked interpolation. Knowledge of this interdependence is crucial for identifying paths for possible enhancement and extension from the Timoshenko beam of arbitrary order to the new hexahedral finite element of arbitrary order for linear analysis of 3D micropolar continuum. After ensuring the convergence of the newly developed micropolar element through a set of patch tests, three numerical examples of a 3D micropolar continuum in static equilibrium and free vibration of 3D micropolar plates with different geometric properties and boundary conditions have been analysed.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new approach to train physics-augmented neural networks with observable data to represent mechanical constitutive laws. To train the neural network and learn thermodynamics potentials, the proposed method does not rely on strain-stress or strain-free energy pairs but needs only partial strain or displacement measurements inside the structure. The neural network is trained thanks to an unsupervised procedure in which the modified constitutive relation error (mCRE) is minimized. The mCRE functional provides a bias-aware data assimilation framework with a rich physical sense as the constitutive relation error (CRE) part can be interpreted as a modeling error continuously defined over the structure, and can be used as a prediction quality in the inference phase. This article also extends previous works on the mCRE by introducing a new minimization procedure in the case of nonlinear state laws. As typical structural health monitoring applications may require that the neural networks should be trained online, an important focus is thus made on automatic and adaptive tuning of sensitive hyperparameters (learning rate, weighting between losses, number of epochs and initialization). It is shown that when the training database is rich enough with respect to the loading cases, the proposed method achieves remarkable performance regarding the quality of the learned model, noise robustness, and low sensitivity to user-defined hyperparameters. The method is evaluated on two test cases: a non-quadratic potential in the small strain regime with synthetic optic fiber measurements, and a Mooney–Rivlin model in the hyperelastic case with synthetic digital image correlation observations.},

Based on the sparse optimization approach, the framework enables the determination of the minimum number of components with a specified shape error. This method provides an efficient bridge for these two types of geometric descriptions, and promotes the free switching between the topology optimization frameworks with pixel-based and MMC-based design domains. The proposed procedure contains a pre-processing of resolution improvement, symmetry axis extraction with sparse optimization, and variational shape approximation. Two practical applications are demonstrated using the proposed framework. First, it can be applied to the intermediate results of SIMP, to achieve faster optimization convergence. Furthermore, a stress-based shape optimization approach can be applied to the obtained MMCs, and novel progressive continuity constraints are also introduced to maintain boundary continuity. Several examples demonstrate advantages of the proposed framework.},

The fibers are modeled via one-dimensional (1D) partial differential equations based on geometrically exact nonlinear beam theory, while the flow is described by the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The arising truly mixed-dimensional 1D-3D coupling scheme constitutes a novel approximate model and numerical strategy, that naturally necessitates specifically tailored solution schemes to ensure an accurate and efficient computational treatment. In particular, we present a strongly coupled partitioned solution algorithm based on a Quasi-Newton method for applications involving fibers with high slenderness ratios that usually present a challenge with regard to the well-known added mass effect. The influence of all employed algorithmic and numerical parameters, namely the applied acceleration technique, the employed constraint regularization parameter as well as shape functions, on efficiency and results of the solution procedure is studied through appropriate examples. Finally, the convergence of the two-way coupled mixed-dimensional problem solution under uniform mesh refinement is demonstrated, a comparison to a 3D reference solution is performed, and the method&#39;s capabilities in capturing flow phenomena at large geometric scale separation is illustrated by the example of a submersed vegetation canopy.},

  abstract     = {An effective and precise physical model is generally required for the performance assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) components. In this study, a convergence-enhanced Timoshenko beam element considering finite deformation is proposed for the stochastic nonlinear analysis of RC components. The unified framework of the rank 2 correction matrix is obtained by approximating the iterative matrix through the linearly independent basis vectors, and two types of Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) operators are constructed. Then, a consistent solution scheme with superior numerical stability and efficiency is proposed based on the second kind of BFGS operator and improved quasi-Newton method. Accurate discretization of the displacement fields and description of nonlinear sectional behavior are achieved by the high-order Lagrangian interpolation functions, concrete damage-plasticity model and J 2 plasticity model. In an updated Lagrangian formulation, these shape functions and constitutive relationships are used to develop a complete secant stiffness with higher-order terms in the strain tensor and residual force vector. To validate the proposed Timoshenko beam element, numerical applications involving material nonlinearity and geometrical nonlinearity are conducted. The numerical stability and efficiency of the solution scheme, the shear-locking free technique, and the oscillation of axial force are thoroughly examined and discussed by solution of RC columns, cantilever beam and progressive collapse of planar RC frame. Finally, the parametric study considering the geometric and material randomness indicates that the RC column designed for flexural failure mode suffered considerable degradation of loading capacity and a larger scatter of residual load.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with complex shell surfaces using the finite element method, we are often limited to simple geometric meshes such as triangles and quadrangles and have to refine the meshes to meet the calculation accuracy requirements, significantly increasing the calculation cost. The virtual element method (VEM), a new numerical method with high mesh flexibility, has been widely applied to many physical and mechanical problems. To the best of our knowledge, this method has yet to be studied for membrane shell models so far. In this paper, for the first time, we provide an enriched conforming VEM discrete scheme for the two-dimensional three-component (2D-3C) generalized membrane shell (GMS) model proposed by Ciarlet et al. Furthermore, we prove the VEM discrete solution&#39;s existence and uniqueness for the GMS. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this discrete scheme is convergent and stable and can accurately represent the membrane stress state of conical, cylindrical, hyperbolical, and spherical shells clamped along a portion of their lateral faces. At the same time, we show the diversity of the grid subdivision. Thus, we develop the VEM for the GMS model successfully. In the future, we will continue to study the VEM for other shell models.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a study to estimate the possibility of determining the shape and size of a Mannesmann effect crack using the finite element method. Experimental tests were carried out to obtain reference specimens with a crack. A rotational compression test of cylindrical specimens in a channel was used for the experimental studies. Finite element tests were carried out using nine ductile fracture criteria. In the first stage of the study, using the rotational compression test and the finite element method, the limit values of the fracture criteria were determined. In the second stage, the development of a Mannesmann effect crack was simulated using the limit values of the fracture criteria using the finite element method. Based on the analysis, it was found that the greatest agreement in terms of void shape and size obtained in finite element method and experiment was obtained for the Ayada criterion. Analysis of the progression of the shape of the void formed using the Ayada criterion showed that crack initiation occurs as a result of maximum principal stress. The development of the resulting void is the result of the action of the maximum shear stress as well as the maximum principal stress.},

The proposed fractional element-free Garlekin (f-EFG) numerical model is a lighter and more accurate alternative to existing mesh-based finite element solvers for the fractional-order governing differential equations. We demonstrate here that the f-EFG with moving least squares (MLS) interpolants are naturally suitable for the approximation of fractional-order derivatives in terms of the corresponding nodal values, thereby alleviating several issues with FE solvers for such integro-differential governing equations. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed numerical model for numerical solutions with benchmark problems on the linear and nonlinear elastic response of nonlocal elastic solid modeled via fractional-order governing differential equations. However, it must be noted that the proposed f-EFG algorithm can be extended to fractional-order governing differential equations in diverse applications, including multiscale and multiphysics studies.},

  abstract     = {The use of reduced-order models (ROMs) in physics-based modeling and simulation is a popular tool for drastically lowering the computational cost associated with high-fidelity simulations. ROMs use training data from a set of computed high-fidelity simulations with different design parameters that control physical and geometric properties of the full-order model. The quality of the training data dictates the performance of the ROM, making the choice of training design parameters important. A widely used method for generating training parameters for ROMs is Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), a statistical method that aims to maximize the distance and minimize the correlation amongst produced samples. However, LHS fails to account for the physics of the full-order model and can lead to an over-representation of some physical regimes in the training data while neglecting others. In this work, we present a computationally efficient adaptive sampling method for ROMs using Isomap, a versatile algorithm for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Using an initial number of samples, the adaptive sampling algorithm iteratively generates samples based on a low-dimensional manifold of the training data. When applied to two external aerodynamics problems, the proposed adaptive sampling algorithm offers significantly improved performance in predicting physical fields and coefficients of lift and drag for a given computational budget for both non-intrusive and projection-based ROMs.},

Those multiscale heterogeneous lattice structures gain intensive interest in conjunction with the improvement of additive manufacturing as they offer, among many others, excellent stiffness-to-weight ratios. We develop here a dedicated HPC solver that benefits from the specific nature of the underlying problem in order to drastically reduce the computational costs (memory and time) for the full fine-scale analysis of lattice structures. Our purpose is to take advantage of the natural domain decomposition into cells and, even more importantly, of the geometrical and mechanical similarities among cells. Our solver consists in a so-called inexact FETI-DP method where the local, cell-wise operators and solutions are approximated with reduced order modeling techniques. Instead of considering independently every cell, we end up with only few principal local problems to solve and make use of the corresponding principal cell-wise operators to approximate all the others. It results in a scalable algorithm that saves numerous local factorizations. Our solver is applied for the isogeometric analysis of lattices built by spline composition, which offers the opportunity to compute the reduced basis with macro-scale data, thereby making our method also multiscale and matrix-free. The solver is tested against various 2D and 3D analyses. It shows major gains compared to black-box solvers; in particular, problems of several millions of degrees of freedom can be solved with a simple computer within few minutes.},

  abstract     = {Total Lagrangian SPH (TLSPH) offers many advantages that can overcome instability and computational time issues. However, it is not naturally applicable to problems with contact. Many problems in solid dynamics and structural analysis require contact definition. In order to use the total Lagrangian formulation, further development for the contact algorithm is required. This research proposes an algorithm to implement inter-particle contact in TLSPH using an adaptive hybrid-kernel scheme for the first time. A combination of the updated and total Lagrangian formulations at the contact surface is introduced, in which the kernel type change automatically when particles from a different body are detected. In kernel change from the updated to the total Lagrangian formulation, the gradient correction cannot be performed using a common correction method because different frames of reference are used. Therefore, a hybrid-kernel correction technique is proposed to maintain the zeroth- and first-order completeness. Then, the contact force is obtained from the inter-particle force using the conservation of momentum. The proposed method does not require a user-defined parameter that makes the application straightforward. Based on the test, the proposed method agrees well with the data available in published literature and the finite element method. Compared with the contact method in classical SPH, the proposed TLSPH shows a significant stability improvement.},

However, most current approaches rely on numerical mechanics platforms for training which incur significant computation costs. Further, current approaches are not suited for dynamically changing boundary conditions. This is because these deep learning frameworks once trained using results generated with a specific set of boundary conditions do not readily adapt to others. In this article, we present a novel approach to leverage the abilities of deep learning models for TO. We demonstrate that optimization can be achieved using a neural ordinary differential equation. The evolution of the design variable in each iteration of TO is then achieved by numerical integration of this neural differential equation with respect to the starting design. To improve the quality of the results, two levels of generative adversarial networks are also introduced, at the sequence, and image levels, respectively. The proposed machine learning framework is capable of generating full optimization paths relevant to TO in high resolution within seconds and can address novel unseen boundary conditions.},

In an expensive offline phase, the full order model, which reproduces an open water test, is set up in the open-source software OpenFOAM and the same full order setting is used to run the CFD simulations for all the deformed propellers. The collected high-fidelity snapshots and the deformed parameters are used in the online stage to build the nonintrusive reduced-order model.

The multi-material distribution of the macrostructure and the shape of the microstructures are optimized by topology and shape optimization, respectively. The homogenized properties of the porous materials are calculated using the homogenization method, and the homogenized elastic tensor and density are applied to the macrostructure. The optimum distribution of the porous material in the macrostructure is determined by a multi-material topology optimization using the generalized solid isotropic material with penalization (GSIMP) method, which is a method to obtain multi-material topology by implementing the successive binarization. The KS (Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser) function is introduced to solve the repeated natural frequencies issue that lies in the maximization of a specified natural frequency. An area-constrained multiscale optimization problem is formulated as a distributed-parameter optimization problem, and the sensitivity functions are derived using the Lagrange multiplier method and the adjoint variable method. Based on the obtained sensitivity functions, the design variables are updated using the H 1 gradient method (i.e., a nonparametric shape/topology optimization method). The effectiveness of the proposed method for maximizing a specified natural frequency is confirmed through 2D and 3D numerical examples, in which the influences of sub-regions of the macrostructure and anisotropic material of the microstructures are also investigated and the results are discussed.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, matrix-free conjugate gradient (CG) solvers with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration have been effectively used to reduce the execution timings of finite element method (FEM)-based engineering simulations. However, there is not much in the literature that discusses the application of matrix-free CG solvers for elastoplasticity. The primary challenge is the presence of both elastic and plastic states, which introduce branching issues in the parallel computation of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV). The current work proposes an efficient split kernel strategy for elastoplasticity that segregates elements in elastic and plastic zones and allows the application of standard GPU-based matrix-free SpMV strategies in the literature to elastoplastic simulation. The proposed strategy avoids branching issues, facilitates coalesced memory access, allows efficient usage of on-chip memory, and uses minimum storage to realize large-scale simulation on a GPU with limited memory. We also propose matrix-free SpMV strategies for GPU implementation based on an element-by-element technique that makes efficient use of memory hierarchy available in a GPU. The computational efficiency of the proposed strategies is demonstrated over three large-scale benchmark examples from elastoplasticity, and the performance results are compared with GPU optimized node-based and degrees of freedom (DOF)-based matrix-free strategies. The results show that the splitting of computation is most suitable for low plasticity problems, where most of the matrix-free strategies show significant speedups with respect to single kernel strategy for elastoplasticity. The proposed element-by-element strategy using node-wise thread allocation is found to have the best performance, achieving up to 7.16 and 3.35 speedup over node-based and DOF-based strategy, respectively. For problems with higher amounts of plasticity, the proposed strategies perform slightly better and achieve modest speedups due to advantages in the initial stages of Newton iterations. In terms of wall-clock timings, the proposed matrix-free solver is found to be up to 2 faster than GPU optimized assembly-based elastoplasticity solver.},

  abstract     = {In literature, the cost of a partitioned fluid-structure interaction scheme is typically assessed by the number of coupling iterations required per time step, while ignoring the internal iterations within the nonlinear subproblems. In this work, we demonstrate that these internal iterations have a significant influence on the computational cost of the coupled simulation. Particular attention is paid to how limiting the number of iterations within each solver call can shorten the overall run time, as it avoids polishing the subproblem solution using unconverged coupling data. Based on systematic parameter studies, we investigate the optimal number of subproblem iterations per coupling step. In addition, this work proposes a new convergence criterion for partitioned algorithms that is based solely on the number of subproblem iterations required to reach the subproblem residual tolerances and therefore does not require any additional convergence tolerance for the coupling loop.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a higher-order unified shell finite element for the analysis of cylinders made of compressible and nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials. The nonlinear governing equations are derived employing the Carrera unified formulation (CUF), thanks to which it is possible to build shell elements with the capability to capture three-dimensional (3D) transverse and out-of-plane effects. The material and geometric nonlinearities are expressed in an orthogonal curvilinear reference system and the coupled formulation of hyperelastic constitutive law is considered. The principle of virtual work and a total Lagrangian approach is used to derive the nonlinear governing equations, which are solved by a Newton–Raphson scheme. The numerical investigations deal with a curved arch and both thick and thin cylinders subjected to line and point loadings. The obtained results are validated by comparing them with those from the literature. They demonstrate the reliability of the proposed method to analyze compressible and incompressible hyperelastic shell structures.},

First, we illustrate an efficient approach for obtaining joint representations of the robustness and reliability measures, allowing sharper discrimination of Pareto-optimal designs. A specific surrogate model of these objectives and constraints is then proposed to accelerate the optimisation process. Secondly, we propose an adaptive refinement strategy, using these tunable accuracy approximations to drive the computational effort towards the computation of the optimal area. To this extent, an adapted Pareto dominance rule and Pareto optimal probability computation are formulated. The performance of the proposed strategy is assessed on several analytical test-cases against classical approaches.

  abstract     = {Lattice networks are indispensable to study heterogeneous materials such as concrete or rock as well as textiles and woven fabrics. Due to the discrete character of lattices, they quickly become computationally intensive. The QuasiContinuum (QC) Method resolves this challenge by interpolating the displacement of the underlying lattice with a coarser finite element mesh and sampling strategies to accelerate the assembly of the resulting system of governing equations. In lattices with complex heterogeneous microstructures with a high number of randomly shaped inclusions the QC leads to an almost fully-resolved system due to the many interfaces. In the present study the QC Method is expanded with enrichment strategies from the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to resolve material interfaces using nonconforming meshes. The goal of this contribution is to bridge this gap and improve the computational efficiency of the method. To this end, four different enrichment strategies are compared in terms of their accuracy and convergence behavior. These include the Heaviside, absolute value, modified absolute value and the corrected XFEM enrichment. It is shown that the Heaviside enrichment is the most accurate and straightforward to implement. A first-order interaction based summation rule is applied and adapted for the extended QC for elements intersected by a material interface to complement the Heaviside enrichment. The developed methodology is demonstrated by three numerical examples in comparison with the standard QC and the full solution. The extended QC is also able to predict the results with 5% error compared to the full solution, while employing almost one order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than the standard QC and even more compared to the fully-resolved system.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be utilized to predict complex fracture problems, but these approaches require large amounts of data for the training. Therefore, in this paper, to combine the advantages of the numerical methods and the ANNs, an improved back propagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed by introducing the enrichment used in the numerical methods into the activation function utilized in the neural networks. The enrichment is able to represent the crack tip field which can accelerate the convergence. At the field near the crack tip, the improved BP solution can converge to the analytical solutions which validate the high accuracy of the proposed method. Without sufficient data, especially the data are missing in the near field of the crack tip, the improved BP method can also achieve high accuracy and convergence, while the conventional BP method may not converge to the predetermined error bound. Numerical simulations of the quasi-static and fatigue crack problems demonstrate that the improved BP method can accurately predict the crack propagation and its growth rate with relatively little data.},

  abstract     = {A large deformation, coupled finite-element (FE) model is developed to simulate the multiphase response of soft porous materials subjected to high strain-rate loading. The approach is based on the theory of porous media (TPM) at large deformations. Simplifications to the one-dimensional regime studied in the numerical simulations follow. An overview of several different time integration schemes is presented for the purpose of solving the nonlinear dynamic coupled balance of momenta (mixture and fluid) and balance of mass of the mixture equations. Numerical examples are presented for (i) verification against closed-form analytical solutions assuming small loads, (ii) demonstrating large deformation effects at high strain-rate, and (iii) showing differences in deformations between a single-phase elastodynamics model with occluded compressible pore fluid and a multiphase poroelastodynamics model at high strain-rate. The multiphase model shows that the relative motion of the pore fluid significantly dampens the deformation response of the solid skeleton as compared to the single-phase model, and makes it possible to extract quantitative values for the stresses of the different constituents, thereby allowing one to form preliminary conclusions about the onset of damage in the solid skeleton. The novelty of the current work is developing a multiphase, large deformation, mixture theory numerical model for high strain-rate loading of soft porous materials. It was discovered that explicit, adaptive time-stepping Runge–Kutta schemes offer high accuracy at relatively low cost when compared to traditional implicit or explicit central difference time-stepping schemes for shock-like loadings. Shock viscosity is added to the mixture momentum balance equation to regularize the shock front, and a stabilization term is added to the mixture mass balance equation to stabilize equal order interpolation finite elements for the coupled finite element solution of multiphase materials.},

One of the challenges of this field is to improve structural performance by using less material than conventional structures. Therefore, the SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization) is applied to optimize the foundation concerning its deformational behavior. The downstream SKO (soft kill option) then solves for optimality concerning the foundation&#39;s stress distribution. Numerical experiments with the TOSS algorithm reveal great potential for material savings. The coupled solution presents the benefit of reducing emissions due to material savings of more than 20% in comparison to the individual SIMP and SKO algorithms. A positive by-product of the method is that stress peaks under the foundation are reduced due to the homogenization of stresses as a result of SKO optimization, thus creating the conditions for better durability of the foundation.},

By carefully designing the computing primitives, the data flow, and the novel pseudoinverse processing module, we enable our data-driven predictor to satisfy all the essential mathematical criteria of a Roe solver and hence deliver accurate predictions of hyperbolic PDEs.

In this article, we propose an efficient parallel explicit-implicit solution scheme for the phase field approach to dynamic fracture based on a domain decomposition method, specifically, the dual-primal finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) method. In this scheme, the displacement field is updated by an explicit algorithm in parallel, and the phase field is implicitly solved by the FETI-DP method. In particular, Lagrange multipliers are introduced to ensure the interface continuity of the phase field. In the computational process, the information exchange among subdomains merely exists in a few substeps, which renders the cost for communication very small. Moreover, the size of equations to be solved is proportional to the total area of subdomain interfaces, which is significantly reduced compared with a typical single-domain solution procedure. The solution scheme is able to perform phase field simulations with a million of degrees of freedom using only 0.034 core hours per load step, and has flexible extensibility for existing phase field codes. Several numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The virtual element method (VEM) allows discretization of the problem domain with polygons in 2D. The polygons can have an arbitrary number of sides and can be concave or convex. These features, among others, are attractive for meshing complex geometries. VEM applied to linear elasticity problems is now well established. Nonlinear problems involving plasticity and hyperelasticity have also been explored by researchers using VEM. Clearly, techniques for extending the method to nonlinear problems are attractive. In this work, a novel first-order consistent VEM is applied within a static co-rotational framework. To the author&#39;s knowledge, this has not appeared before in the literature with virtual elements. The formulation allows for large displacements and large rotations in a small strain setting. For some problems avoiding the complexity of finite strains, and alternative stress measures, is warranted. Furthermore, small strain plasticity is easily incorporated. The basic method, VEM specific implementation details for co-rotation, and representative benchmark problems are illustrated. Consequently, this research demonstrates that the co-rotational VEM formulation successfully solves certain classes of nonlinear solid mechanics problems. The work concludes with a discussion of results for the current formulation and future research directions.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of fluid flows with free surfaces and interacting with highly deformable structures is a complex problem, attracting considerable attention. The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is one of the various numerical methods recently proposed in the literature to simulate this type of problems. It is a mesh-based Lagrangian approach, particularly suited for problems with fast changes in the domain topology, since the fluid boundaries and the Fluid–Structure Interaction (FSI) interface are naturally tracked by the position of the mesh nodes. However, when nonhomogeneous boundary conditions are imposed on velocities or when there are regions where the topology varies moderately, for example, in confined portions of the fluid domain characterized by fixed boundaries, an Eulerian formulation turns out to be more convenient. To exploit the advantages of both formulations, an adaptive hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian approach is presented in this work. According to the proposed method, nodes on the fluid free-surface and on the FSI interface are treated as Lagrangian, while the remaining nodes can be either Eulerian or Lagrangian. Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of the method, an algorithm to automatically detect runtime the transition zone between the two kinematic descriptions is devised. To validate the proposed approach, several numerical examples are developed and their results are compared to those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of aerodynamic drag on satellites orbiting in the upper atmosphere is critical to the operational success of modern space technologies, such as satellite-based communication or navigation systems, which have become increasingly popular in the last few years due to the deployment of constellations of satellites in low-Earth orbit. As a result, physics-based models of the ionosphere and thermosphere have emerged as a necessary tool for the prediction of atmospheric outputs under highly variable space weather conditions. This paper proposes a high-fidelity approach for physics-based space weather modeling based on the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method, combined with a matrix-free strategy suitable for high-performance computing on GPU architectures. The approach consists of a thermospheric model that describes a chemically frozen neutral atmosphere in nonhydrostatic equilibrium driven by the external excitation of the Sun. A novel set of variables is considered to treat the low densities present in the upper atmosphere and to accommodate the wide range of scales present in the problem. At the same time, and unlike most existing approaches, radial and angular directions are treated in a nonsegregated approach. The study presents a set of numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of the approximation and validate the current approach against observational data along a satellite orbit, including estimates of established empirical and physics-based models of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. Finally, a one-dimensional radial derivation of the physics-based model is presented and utilized for conducting a parametric study of the main thermal quantities under various solar conditions.},

  abstract     = {The level-set-discrete-element-method (LS-DEM) was developed to overcome the shape limitation of traditional discrete element method. LS-DEM&#39;s shape generality relies on a node-based surface discretization of grain boundary, and it has been used to shed new light of a variety of granular mechanics applications with realistically shaped grains and structural assemblies made of unbonded building blocks. Due to the node-based discretization of grain boundary, the original LS-DEM is discretization-sensitive and it suffers from divergence of the response with discretization refinement, particularly for highly compressible problems. Previous studies have identified and addressed this issue in different ways, each with its own advantages and shortcomings. Here, we propose a methodologically-rigorous and computationally-efficient adapted formulation which solves LS-DEM&#39;s discretization-sensitivity issue. It adopts the classical contact description of continuum mechanics, wherein the contact interactions are traction-based. We demonstrate the convergence of the adapted LS-DEM in several highly compressible cases studies, show that it is key to correctly capturing the mechanical response, and compare it to alternative formulations.},

The bottleneck for most industrial applications is evaluating the typically rather expensive constitutive law on the regular grid. In the work at hand, we exploit coarsening strategies to evaluate the material law with the intention of speeding up the overall computation time while retaining the level of achieved accuracy. Inspired by wavelet-compression techniques, we form aggregates of voxels where the local strain tensors are close, and compute the stresses on these coarsened elements. If done naively, such a strategy will lead to intrinsic instabilities whose origin is apparent from a mathematical perspective. As a remedy, we introduce a stabilization technique which is inspired by hourglass control well-known for underintegrated finite elements. We introduce octree as well as sandwich coarsening, discuss the handling of internal variables, report on the efficient implementation of the concepts and demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technology on simple as well as industrial examples.},

Concerning the theory, we extend the material-sink approach by including a viscosity description at finite strains. Concerning numerical methods, we introduce a mixed finite-element formulation based on the relative deformation gradient and implement it in Abaqus. Representative numerical examples show that the proposed approach captures the viscous behavior of material and demonstrates the coupling between viscosity and fracture. Simulations reveal that the viscous dissipation suppresses minor crack branching as compared to the purely hyperelastic case, when the strain rate is relatively small. That said, when the strain rate is relatively large, viscoelastic and hyperelastic materials fracture consonantly.},

  abstract     = {Two-phase flow problems in porous media can be found in several areas, such as Geomechanics, Hydrogeology, Engineering and Biomedicine, for example. Typically, these processes are mathematically modeled by a highly nonlinear system of coupled partial differential equations. The nonlinearity of the system makes the design and implementation of robust numerical solvers a challenging task. In this work we consider the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids within a non-deformable porous medium. A mixed pressure-saturation formulation is adopted, allowing the transition from the unsaturated to saturated zones and maintaining numerical mass conservation. A cell-centered finite volume method and an implicit Euler scheme are considered for the spatial and time discretization of the problem. In this work, we propose a solution method for two-phase flow problems which is based on the combination of the modified Picard linearization method and a very simple cell-centered multigrid algorithm that performs efficiently even for heterogeneous random media. This is shown in the numerical experiments, where two test problems are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed solver.},

They can be geometrically described as surface-to-surface or line-to-line contacts, for instance. The last one is usually the natural choice when addressing beam-to-beam contact. In the present work, a geometrically nonlinear structural formulation is combined with a beam-to-beam C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ spline-based contact formulation with a particular numerical strategy to address challenging contact problems. The numerical strategy consists of introducing criteria to evaluate, characterize and decide about the contact problem solutions. According to these criteria, a contact problem solution may be accepted, rejected, or proceed to a degeneration process (as a simplification of the original tentative for the geometric description). The main advantages of the proposed technique are the lack of special contact formulations for ill-defined contact problems and the automatic switch between degenerated and nondegenerated scenarios. Therefore, one can naturally handle scenarios of pointwise or conformal contact, even in situations of transition between such categories along the model evolution. The adopted spline-based formulation includes normal and tangential contact contributions. To test the proposed strategy, several pointwise and conformal contact examples are proposed.},

Relying on the standard three dimensional elastodynamics equations, our strategy can be applied to any type of material, either isotropic or anisotropic, with or without discontinuities in the thickness direction. Upon the assumption of an extruded mesh of the plate-like geometry, we show that the linear system to be solved at each time step is partially lumped thus efficiently treated. We provide numerical evidence of an adequate convergence behavior, similar to a reference solution obtained using the well-known leapfrog scheme. Further numerical investigations show significant speed up factors compared to the same reference scheme, proving the efficiency of our approach for the configurations of interest.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the behavior of composite materials is an important application of computational homogenization methods. Classical computational homogenization (CCH), based on asymptotic analysis, is such a method. In CCH, equilibrium equations are separated into two length scales and solved numerically. Solving the fine-scale equilibrium equations at every coarse-scale Gauss point, in every iteration of a Newton–Raphson loop, is often too computationally expensive for real engineering applications. In this study, we propose a modified CCH approach that avoids solving the fine-scale equilibrium equations. The proposed method, which we call solver-free CCH, works by pre-computing a set of eigenstrain influence function tensors based on data from a small number of numerical experiments. Then, during the online stage of the computation, these eigenstrain influence tensors are used in the fine-scale problem to evaluate and homogenize strains and stresses. This article begins by formulating the solver-free CCH approach for small-deformation problems involving composites with nonlinear constituent phase material models, including computation of the eigenstrain influence tensors and their application within the online stage.

  abstract     = {A novel material point method called the improved convected particle domain interpolation (ICPDI) is proposed in this paper to simulate large-deformation problems in geotechnical engineering. The ICPDI framework is based on the existing convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) and employs an adaptive orthogonal improved interpolating moving least square (AOIIMLS) shape functions. The AOIIMLS shape functions prevent computational instability problems caused by singular or ill-conditioned matrices through avoiding the direct solving of inverse matrices. Additionally, ICPDI adopts the velocity gradient to calculate the velocity field in particle domains and reduces cell-crossing errors by using AOIIMLS shape functions. To reconstruct the velocity function in the background grid, the velocities of the material points and four related corner points are employed through AOIIMLS shape functions. The bar axis-aligned vibration, ring radial expansion, slope elasto-plastic slumping, and post-failure tunnel collapse behavior examples are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of ICPDI by comparing the results with other numerical methods and experiments. Numerical simulation results show that ICPDI outperforms the material point method (MPM) and CPDI in terms of computational accuracy and convergence while reducing cell-crossing errors. Consequently, this study demonstrates the capability of ICPDI in simulations of large-deformation geotechnical problems.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a new tool for solving boundary value problems by defining loss functions of neural networks based on governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recent investigations have shown that when designing loss functions for many engineering problems, using first-order derivatives and combining equations from both strong and weak forms can lead to much better accuracy, especially when there are heterogeneity and variable jumps in the domain. This new approach is called the mixed formulation for PINNs, which takes ideas from the mixed finite element method. In this method, the PDE is reformulated as a system of equations where the primary unknowns are the fluxes or gradients of the solution, and the secondary unknowns are the solution itself. In this work, we propose applying the mixed formulation to solve multi-physical problems, specifically a stationary thermo-mechanically coupled system of equations. Additionally, we discuss both sequential and fully coupled unsupervised training and compare their accuracy and computational cost. To improve the accuracy of the network, we incorporate hard boundary constraints to ensure valid predictions. We then investigate how different optimizers and architectures affect accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we introduce a simple approach for parametric learning that is similar to transfer learning. This approach combines data and physics to address the limitations of PINNs regarding computational cost and improves the network&#39;s ability to predict the response of the system for unseen cases. The outcomes of this work will be useful for many other engineering applications where deep learning is employed on multiple coupled systems of equations for fast and reliable computations.},

The IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) and induced p -norm aggregation are utilized to develop a stress-minimization topology description model for infill design, which can remove the mesh dependency and offer benefits for improving numerical accuracy and convergence stability. We also introduced global volume constraints to easily control the usage of material and eliminate the over-fine structures affecting the printing accuracy. Several numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed ITO method on porous infill designs with stress minimization. The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique is employed to fabricate several prototypes, and the performance are evaluated by experiments.

The non-differentiability of multiple eigenvalues is addressed by a mean value function which is a symmetric polynomial of the repeated eigenvalues in each cluster. This construction offers accurate control over each cluster of eigenvalues as compared to the aggregation functions such as -norm and Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (K–S) function where only approximate maximum/minimum value is available. This also avoids the two-loop optimization procedure required by the use of directional derivatives (Seyranian et al. Struct Optim . 1994;8(4):207-227.). The spurious buckling modes issue is handled by two approaches—one with different interpolations on the initial stiffness and geometric stiffness and another with a pseudo-mass matrix. Using the pseudo-mass matrix, two new optimization formulations are proposed for incorporating buckling constraints together with the standard approach employing initial stiffness and geometric stiffness as two ingredients within generalized eigenvalue frameworks. Numerical results show that all three formulations can help to improve the stability of the optimized design. In addition, post-nonlinear stability analysis on the optimized designs reveals that a higher linear buckling threshold might not lead to a higher nonlinear critical load, especially in cases when the pre-critical response is nonlinear.},

We refer to this approach as the stress-hybrid virtual element method (SH-VEM). In this method, the Hellinger–Reissner variational principle is adopted, wherein both the equilibrium equations and the strain-displacement relations are variationally enforced. We consider small-strain deformations of linear elastic solids in the compressible and near-incompressible regimes over quadrilateral (convex and nonconvex) meshes. Within an element, the displacement field is approximated as a linear combination of canonical shape functions that are virtual . The stress field, similar to the stress-hybrid finite element method of Pian and Sumihara, is represented using a linear combination of symmetric tensor polynomials. A 5-parameter expansion of the stress field is used in each element, with stress transformation equations applied on distorted quadrilaterals. In the variational statement of the strain-displacement relations, the divergence theorem is invoked to express the stress coefficients in terms of the nodal displacements. This results in a formulation with solely the nodal displacements as unknowns. Numerical results are presented for several benchmark problems from linear elasticity. We show that SH-VEM is free of volumetric and shear locking, and it converges optimally in the norm and energy seminorm of the displacement field, and in the norm of the hydrostatic stress.},

Furthermore, it examines the impact of geometric uncertainties on system responses. The XFEM/FEM can accurately capture the non-smooth solution at the geometrical interface by constructing enriched functions without modifying the original mesh, and it allows the introduction of random parameters to describe the geometrical modifications. The input probability space of the parameters is partitioned, and the Dirac function is smoothed, yielding statistical properties like the probability density function of system responses, which are derived by summing responses from each representative point. The computational performance of the proposed scheme is validated with both single and multiple uncertain geometries, while also discussing the impact of these uncertain geometries on the responses of the vibro-acoustic system.},

  abstract     = {A multiscale model for saturated porous media is proposed, based on the concept of representative volume element (RVE). The physics between macro and micro-scales is linked in terms of virtual power measures given by the general theory of poromechanics. Then, applying the so-called Principle of Multiscale Virtual Power, together with suitable admissible constraints on micro-scale displacement and pore pressure fields, a well-established variational framework is obtained. This setting allows deriving the weak form of micro-scale balance equations as well as the homogenization rules for the macro-scale stress-like variables and body forces. Whenever the micro-scale mechanical constitutive functionals admit, as input arguments, the full-order expansion of the micro-scale pore pressure field, a size effect is inherited on the macro-scale material response. The current literature attributes this issue to the so-called “dynamical” or “second-order” term of the homogenized flux velocity. It has been commonly suggested that the influence of this term is negligible by assuming infinitely small micro-scale dimensions. However, such an idea compromises the fundamental notion of the existence of RVE for highly heterogeneous media. In this work, we show that the micro-scale size dependence can be consistently eliminated by a simple constitutive-like assumption. Accordingly, slight and selective redefinitions in the input arguments of micro-scale material laws are proposed, leading to a constitutive formulation that allows the combination of micro-scale variables with different orders of expansion. Just at this specific (constitutive) level, a reduced-order expansion is selectively adopted for the micro-scale pore pressure field. Thus, the RVE notion is restored while still retaining the major effects of the “dynamical” component of the homogenized flux velocity. The proposed formulation is implemented within a finite element squared (FE ) environment. Some numerical experiments are presented showing the viability of the methodology, including comparisons against analytical, mono-scale and DNS solutions.},

We introduce a simple, computationally cheap, reliable, and efficient a posteriori estimator of the geometrical defeaturing error. Moreover, we also introduce a geometric refinement strategy that accounts for the defeaturing error: starting from a fully defeatured geometry, the algorithm determines at each iteration step which features need to be added to the geometrical model to reduce the defeaturing error. These important features are then added to the (partially) defeatured geometrical model at the next iteration, until the solution attains a prescribed accuracy. A wide range of two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments are finally reported to illustrate this work.},

These procedures are useful as a post-processing step in mesh generation procedures and in applications such as fluid simulations with severely deforming domains. In order to perform high-order mesh optimization, these ingredients must also be extended to high-order (curved) meshes. In this work, we present a method to perform local element operations on curved meshes. The mesh operations discussed in this work are edge/face swaps, edge collapses, and edge splitting (more generally refinement) for triangular and tetrahedral meshes. These local operations are performed by first identifying the patch of elements which contain the edge/face being acted on, performing the operation as a “straight-sided one&quot; by placing the high-order nodes via an isoparametric mapping from the master element, and smoothing the high-order nodes on the elements in the patch by minimizing a Jacobian-based high-order mesh distortion measure. Since the initial “straight-sided guess” from the placement of the nodes via the isoparametric mapping frequently results in invalid elements, the distortion measure must be regularized which allows for mesh untangling for the optimization to succeed. We present several examples in 2D and 3D to demonstrate these local operations and how they can be combined with a high-order node smoothing procedure to maintain mesh quality when faced with severe deformations.},

  abstract     = {To reduce computational time of thermo-mechanical simulation of additive manufacturing processes, the inherent strain (IS) method is quite efficient, but suffers from a lack of predictivity, preventing concurrent quantitative prediction of distortion and stress. In order to investigate the predictive ability of the IS method, a new variant of the method is proposed in which the determination of the IS tensor is based on simulation results from a standard thermo-elastic-viscoplastic simulation applied to a few learning layers of the studied part. More precisely, the inherent strains are determined by a direct resolution performed in each finite element, with a negligible computation cost. Because of these specific features, the predictive ability of this IS method is formulated as its ability to replicate the distortion and stress predicted by the reference standard thermo-elastic-viscoplastic simulation. The proposed IS method provides perfect results in a validation test where full-field inherent strains are used in each added layer: the distortion and stress predicted by the thermo-elastic-viscoplastic simulation are exactly replicated by the IS method. However, when applying the IS method to the simulation of an entire part, here a turbine blade mock-up, the results are degraded with respect to the reference solution obtained by the thermo-elastic-viscoplastic simulation. Results are then discussed to evaluate the limitations of the proposed method, and of the IS method in general.},

  abstract     = {Tensor interpolation is an essential step for tensor data analysis in various fields of application and scientific disciplines. In the present work, novel interpolation schemes for general, that is, symmetric or non-symmetric, invertible square tensors are proposed. Critically, the proposed schemes rely on a combined polar and spectral decomposition of the tensor data , followed by an individual interpolation of the two rotation tensors and and the positive definite diagonal eigenvalue tensor resulting from this decomposition. Two different schemes are considered for a consistent rotation interpolation within the special orthogonal group , either based on relative rotation vectors or quaternions. For eigenvalue interpolation, three different schemes, either based on the logarithmic weighted average, moving least squares or logarithmic moving least squares, are considered. It is demonstrated that the proposed interpolation procedure preserves the structure of a tensor, that is, and remain orthogonal tensors and remains a positive definite diagonal tensor during interpolation, as well as scaling and rotational invariance (objectivity). Based on selected numerical examples considering the interpolation of either symmetric or non-symmetric tensors, the proposed schemes are compared to existing approaches such as Euclidean, Log-Euclidean, Cholesky and Log-Cholesky interpolation. In contrast to these existing methods, the proposed interpolation schemes result in smooth and monotonic evolutions of tensor invariants such as determinant, trace, fractional anisotropy (FA), and Hilbert&#39;s anisotropy (HA). Moreover, a consistent spatial convergence behavior is confirmed for first- and second-order realizations of the proposed schemes. The present work is mainly motivated by the frequently occurring necessity for remeshing or mesh adaptivity when applying the finite element method to complex problems of nonlinear continuum mechanics with inelastic constitutive behavior, which requires the consistent interpolation of tensor-valued history data for the transfer between different meshes. However, the proposed schemes are very general in nature and suitable for the interpolation of general invertible second-order square tensors independent of the specific application.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in the field of machine learning open a new era in high performance computing for challenging computational science and engineering applications. In this framework, the use of advanced machine learning algorithms for the development of accurate and cost-efficient surrogate models of complex physical processes has already attracted major attention from scientists. However, despite their powerful approximation capabilities, surrogate model predictions are still far from being near to the ‘exact’ solution of the problem. To address this issue, the present work proposes the use of up-to-date machine learning tools in order to equip a new generation of iterative solvers of linear equation systems, capable of very efficiently solving large-scale parametrized problems at any desired level of accuracy. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps. At first, a reduced set of model evaluations is performed using a standard finite element methodology and the corresponding solutions are used to establish an approximate mapping from the problem&#39;s parametric space to its solution space using a combination of deep feedforward neural networks and convolutional autoencoders. This mapping serves as a means of obtaining very accurate initial predictions of the system&#39;s response to new query points at negligible computational cost. Subsequently, an iterative solver inspired by the Algebraic Multigrid method in combination with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, termed POD-2G, is developed that successively refines the initial predictions of the surrogate model towards the exact solution. The application of POD-2G as a standalone solver or as preconditioner in the context of preconditioned conjugate gradient methods is demonstrated on several numerical examples of large scale systems, with the results indicating its strong superiority over conventional iterative solution schemes.},

In the enhanced scheme, the crack initiation, propagation, and bifurcation processes are determined from an energy minimization problem based on crack phase-field theory, and the predicted diffusive crack is replaced by the discrete representation using the finite cover method. In the meantime, numerical damping is introduced to maintain computational stability and avoid distortion of the physical mesh in the finite cover context. By taking advantage of the features of the diffusive-discrete crack transition scheme, the proposed approach enables us to stably simulate a series of dynamic fracture events involving crack initiation at an arbitrary location, propagation, and bifurcation in arbitrary directions, arbitrary divisions of an original object into multiple portions, and independent motions of divided portions. After spatial and temporal discretizations by the finite cover method and the Newmark method are described, as well as the simulation algorithm of the enhanced finite cover-based staggered iterative procedure for dynamic fracture, several representative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the developed approach.},

They are implemented as a user-defined element (UEL) and a user-defined MPC subroutine in ABAQUS, respectively. Three cohesive-frictional constitutive relationships are proposed to describe the nonlinear bond-slip behaviour of different fibre–matrix compositions. The new approach is validated by single fibre pullout tests, direct tensile tests and three-point bending tests of SFRC specimens with randomly distributed fibres. The results show that the new approach is capable of effectively capturing typical failure mechanisms in SFRC, such as fibre yielding, matrix failure, and fibre–matrix debonding and slipping.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is a form of metal additive manufacturing in which a laser traces a path on a metal powder bed to heat powder particles and progressively melt and/or fuse them together to form a part. Outcomes of LPBF are functions of the metal&#39;s temperature history and are strongly affected by the path traced by the laser. Using temperature field optimization for LPBF as a motivating application, we focus on a class of combinatorial problems where admissible control policies are a permutation of a set of control actions. We abstract this class of problems as an optimal control problem with the objective of identifying an admissible control policy that minimizes a cost function of a dynamical system&#39;s state. While, in principle, the effect of the control actions on the cost function can last an infinitely long time, we will consider systems in which the effects of these control actions can be considered to last short (finite) periods of time. In this paper, we formalize this class of combinatorial problems as a Traveling Salesperson Problem with History and prove its equivalence to an Equality Generalized Traveling Salesperson Problem (E-GTSP), enabling the use of well-developed E-GTSP solvers. We demonstrate this equivalence by computing the solutions obtained using an E-GTSP solver for an LPBF-inspired application.},

The explicit NURBS element stiffness computation formula is: derived from the Bėzier extraction operator under the combination of scaled and rotational geometric transformations between NURBS elements, and the stiffness matrices of NURBS elements can be computed by the stiffness matrix of a Bėzier element without resorting to the time-consuming integral procedure. As the presented MMITO is a nested optimization framework, we apply the explicit filtering technique to update the multi-phase design variables efficiently in combination with the tensor product decomposition method. With the decomposed weight matrices of the filter and the explicit form of the NURBS stiffness matrix, we obtain the equivalent but much simplified preprocessing procedure and sensitivity analysis for the MMITO method. A comprehensive set of multi-material numerical examples are optimized to verify that, while improving the preprocessing efficiency and reducing the memory overhead, the present MMITO scheme is able to generate semblable two-dimensional and three-dimensional multi-material structures with identical structural performance to the traditional scheme. Therefore, the proposed MMITO method is a promising approach to optimizing multi-material structures.},

The Reissner model is chosen for representing the large elastic and large plastic deformations of such a beam model. The non-local variational formulation is proposed to deal with the softening phenomena characteristic of fracture. The fracture energy is introduced as the main fracture parameter, rather than (in general) ill-defined characteristic length used for previous non-local models. The discrete approximation is built in terms of the embedded-discontinuity finite element method (ED-FEM), which needs no initial crack for optimal performance nor detailed crack kinematics description, such as in the X-FEM or the phase-field approach. This kind of approach builds upon the best approximation property of the FEM discrete approximation in the energy norm and provides the best-approximation property for the dissipated energy computations, and thus optimal computational accuracy if the quantity of interest is inelastic dissipation. The computations are carried out by the operator split method, which separates the computations of global state variables (displacements and stress) from local (internal) variables including the crack opening. Several illustrative examples are provided to confirm an excellent performance of the proposed methodology.},

In this article, we introduce a machine-learning-based asymptotic homogenisation and localisation scheme to formulate such boundary layer effects. To this end, we define a set of boundary layer cells, where external loading conditions are imposed on one side of the cell, and matching conditions with the interior periodic cells are imposed on the opposite side. The formulation is also extended to cover situations where the multi-scale structure is not fully periodic, but spatially varying. Implied from the asymptotic results, neural networks can be trained to memorise the interrelationship between key local quantities, such as the magnitude of the local maximum von Mises stress, and the local mechanical and geometric features. Equipped with the trained neural networks, the online calculation for key (boundary-localised) quantities of interest under arbitrary loading conditions is expected to be accelerated substantially. Numerical examples are further presented to show the reliability of the proposed work for boundary stress prediction.},

The normalized stress functions that satisfy the relevant equilibrium equation and strain compatibility equation a priori are employed to formulate the stress trial function. Since the element has only three displacement, three rotation and the electric potential DOFs per node, it has relatively simple formulation and can be readily incorporated into the existing finite element program. Several benchmarks are examined and the results demonstrate that the new element has good numerical accuracy and captures the size dependence effectively. In addition, the influence of the micro-inertia on electromechanical dynamic responses of flexoelectric solids at small scale are analyzed using the proposed element. It is shown that the nature frequency decreases with the increase of micro-inertia and in general, the influences are more obvious on higher order modes.},

( J Comput Phys . 2018;369:80–102.), considers a solid body discretized by a collection of material points carrying the history of the matter, embedded in an arbitrary grid on which a nodal discontinuous Galerkin approximation is defined, and that serves to solve balance equations. This method has been shown to be promising, especially for solving hyperbolic problems in finite deforming solids (Renaud et al. Int J Numer Methods Eng . 2020;121(4):664–689. Renaud et al. Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng . 2020;365:112987.). The main goal of this research is to extend the first-order DGMPM to arbitrary high-order accurate approximations. This is performed by adapting the ADER (Arbitrary high order DErivative Riemann problem) approach (Busto et al. Front Phys . 2020;8:32.) to the particular spatial discretization of the DGMPM. First, the predictor step permits to design a particle-to-grid projection of arbitrary high order of accuracy, consistent with that of the nodal discontinuous Galerkin approximation defined on the arbitrary grid. This is performed using a moving least square approximation for the ADER predictor field. Second, since the degrees of freedom of the predictor field are now defined at material points, the computation of the constitutive response of the material is ensured to be always performed at these material points. This is of crucial importance for history-dependent constitutive models because it avoids any diffusive transfer of internal variables on a new computational grid. Finally, a total Lagrangian formulation of equations is kept, which allows to precompute once and for all both the nodal discontinuous Galerkin approximation and that of the ADER predictor field, until the arbitrary grid is discarded if required. The method is illustrated on a few two-dimensional numerical examples, on which comparisons are shown with the ADER-DGFEM and Runge–Kutta-DGFEM.},

  abstract     = {The inverse problem of identifying a small unknown inclusion or cavity in an elastic medium is considered. Important applications are structural damage identification, medical imaging and geophysical exploration; the latter is the focus of the present investigation. It is assumed that the (isotropic but possibly heterogeneous) material properties of the medium are known, except for the presence of a small inclusion of a different material or of a small cavity. The goal is to find the location, size and shape of the inclusion or cavity. Identification is performed using full waveform inversion (FWI) and the adjoint method for the efficient calculation of the gradient of the misfit function. The identification is accomplished by considering a single unknown material-property field. The inclusion manifests itself in the inverse solution as a local region where the unknown material property becomes significantly different than the known background property. The limiting case of cavity identification requires special treatment in the minimization process to avoid failure, as Bürchner et al. showed empirically for the scalar wave equation. Their -scaling approach, whose success is explained mathematically here for the first time, is extended to elastodynamics. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical examples, involving two geophysical models: a homogeneous model and the heterogeneous Marmousi model, which is a standard testing model in geophysical research.},

  abstract     = {We consider new semi-hybrid-mixed finite element formulations for Stokes–Brinkman problems. Using H ⁡ ( div ) $$ \mathbf{H}\left(\operatorname{div}\right) $$ -conforming approximate velocity fields, the continuity of normal components over element interfaces is taken for granted, and pressure is searched in discontinuous spaces preserving the divergence compatibility property. Tangential continuity is weakly imposed by a Lagrange multiplier playing the role of tangential traction. The method is strongly mass-conservative, leading to exact divergence-free simulations of incompressible flows. The Lagrange multiplier space requires specific choices according to the velocity approximations implemented in each element geometry. In certain cases, classic divergence-compatible pairs adopted for Darcy flows may require divergence-free bubble enrichment to enforce tangential continuity in some extent, avoiding any extra stabilization technique. Considerable improvement in computational performance is achieved by the application of static condensation: the global system is solved only for a piecewise constant pressure variable, velocity normal trace and tangential traction over interfaces. The remaining solution components are recovered by solving independent local Neumann problems in each element. Numerical results are presented for a set of standard test cases in the field of Stokes–Brinkman–Darcy flows with known analytical solutions. The main convergence properties of the method are verified in the whole range of parameters, from Stokes to Darcy limits, as well as for the combined Stokes–Darcy scenario. The robustness of the method is also demonstrated for more challenging test problems with complex non-conforming meshes with local refinement patterns as well as for curved geometry.},

  abstract     = {The standard material point method (MPM) encounters severe numerical difficulties in simulating shell structures. In order to overcome the shortcomings of locking effects, the discretization size of background grid should be small enough, usually smaller than 1/5 of the shell thickness, which however will lead to prohibitive computational cost. A novel solid shell material point method (SSMPM) is proposed to efficiently model the large deformation of thin structures. The SSMPM describes the material domain of shell structures by shell particles with hexahedral particle domains. The locking treatments of solid shell element are then introduced in SSMPM, which results in the correction of strain field throughout the shell thickness. Namely, the assumed natural strain (ANS) method is adopted to eliminate the shear locking and trapezoidal locking, while the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method is employed to eliminate the thickness locking. With the precise description of bending modes, a single layer of particles and a coarse background grid could be used in shell structure simulations with the SSMPM, which dramatically increases the computational efficiency. A local multi-mesh contact method is presented to naturally couple SSMPM and MPM for the contact situations of shells with other objects. Several numerical examples, including beam vibration, pinched cylinder with free edges and full hemispherical shell, are performed to verify and validate the SSMPM, which shows that the SSMPM considerably outperforms the standard MPM in these situations. A fluid–structure interaction problem and the penetration of a thin plate are investigated based on the contact method and the results are in good agreement with those in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Mechanics-specific recurrent neural network (RNN) models are known for their ability to describe the complex three-dimensional stress–strain response of elasto-plastic solids for arbitrary loading paths. To apply RNN models to real materials, it is crucial to identify a strategy that allows for their training from small datasets that could be obtained from robot-assisted experiments. It is demonstrated that regular training with datasets comprising random walks (RWs) in strain space yield a significantly higher generalization ability than the same number of sequences for smooth loading paths. Moreover, it is found that transfer learning, that is, initializing the weights and biases with the parameters from an already trained material, improves the convergence rates and reduces the required number of stress–strain sequences for training. When leveraging the experience gained for multiple materials through ensemble transfer learning, even more substantial improvements are obtained. For example, the same model accuracy and generalization ability is obtained from training with 400 smooth stress–strain sequences after ensemble transfer as from training with 10,000 RW sequences after regular training.},
