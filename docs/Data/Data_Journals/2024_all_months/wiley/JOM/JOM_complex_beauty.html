  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of Typhoon Lekima, a source of environmental uncertainty, on delivery performance, utilizing data from RiRiShun Logistics. We apply a staggered difference-in-differences model across low-complexity and high-complexity supply chains. The analysis uncovers distinct dynamics throughout the typhoon&#39;s forecast, active, and recovery phases. Notably, the active phase experiences less disruption in delivery performance compared to the forecast phase, owing to RiRiShun&#39;s wait-and-see policy. This approach leads to order accumulation but subsequently enables more effective resource allocation. In the recovery phase, high-complexity supply chains demonstrate significant improvements, surpassing pre-disaster performance levels. The study further emphasizes the critical role of two response mechanisms in managing high-complexity supply chains. Increasing throughput efficiencies at destination centers and implementing transfer centers prove effective in enhancing delivery performance during both the forecast and active phases. However, the simultaneous application of these response mechanisms during the forecast phase unexpectedly reduces performance.},

  abstract     = {This study examines how inventory slack at first- and second-tier suppliers influences buyer performance following an upstream disruption event. We analyze secondary data from buyer, first-tier, and second-tier triads impacted at their upper end by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. By matching buyers in affected triads with similar, largely unaffected firms, we assess post-event performance in relation to triad inventory slack. Results show: (a) inventory slack at the first and second tiers supports buyer performance after the disruption; (b) first-tier inventory slack has a greater impact; (c) buyers with less inventory slack can extract more value from their chains&#39; inventories compared to those with more slack; and (d) first-tier suppliers occupy a pivotal role in bridging the second-tier inventories to the buyer. When competition for the first-tier intensifies, the benefits of having first- and second-tier inventory slack diminish for the buyer. A central contribution of this study is to highlight the importance of resources controlled by chain members with indirect links to the buyer and the bridging role of first-tier suppliers. These insights suggest that for effective risk management, both direct and indirect supply chain resources and their interactions need consideration. Practically, these findings should guide supplier selection, risk management, and investments in supply chain visibility.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how organizations embedded in a supply system collectively respond to risks and seize opportunities arising from crisis events under shifting forms of uncertainty. Using the United Kingdom (UK) medicine supply system as the research context, we explore how decision-makers navigated the effects of an event with knowable implications (UK&#39;s European Union exit, 2016–2020) followed by an event with unknowable implications (COVID-19 global pandemic, 2020–2021). We adopt a longitudinal case research design that incorporates causal loop diagramming, to understand the system&#39;s responses. We find that learning evolves as crisis events unfold, changing from surface (know-what) to deep (know-why and -how) and at the highest level, it is transcendent. Transcendent learning entails understanding system effects into the future (i.e., beyond the past and present) and in relation to other supply systems (i.e., beyond the UK system). Capabilities to absorb, avoid, and accelerate away from shocks are developed sequentially as learning changes. We contribute to prior research by developing a theory of system-level strategic agility and the adaptation processes that underpin it. The latter hinge on dynamic resource (re)allocation and the continuous (re)configuration of processes, protocols, regulations, and structures.},

  abstract     = {The world is witnessing more supply-base disruptions, where multiple suppliers of a buying firm simultaneously experience disturbed operations. Compared to single-supplier disruptions, supply-base disruptions create a more uncertain situation for a purchasing manager, yet they can also reveal improvement opportunities. Hence, it is theoretically and practically valuable to understand why a purchasing manager might not be willing to explore these opportunities. Adopting a sensemaking perspective, we investigate how two dimensions of supply-base disruption severity, breadth and depth, influence managers&#39; perception of disruption severity and post-recovery action (i.e., suggesting supply-base restructuring ideas). We conducted multiple scenario-based experiments with practitioners and triangulated the experimental results with interviews, finding that both breadth and depth have diminishing, positive effects on perceived severity. Interestingly, depth is less influential than breadth. These findings reveal the circumstances under which the severity of a complex, disruptive situation could be misestimated. Our results also show that supply-base structural complexity (a cue of the task environment) amplifies the positive effect of perceived severity on a manager&#39;s inclination to walk into the unknown to propose supply-base restructuring ideas. These findings provide an explanation for management nonresponse after a supply-base disruption.},

Based on large dataset of 830,853 patient discharges in 26 clinical departments across 731 hospitals in five U.S. Midwest states, our results indicate that mix and volume uncertainties each have a significant impact on patient care. We also find that related focus and department utilization levels have a mitigating effect on uncertainty in healthcare settings. Lastly, we find considerable heterogeneity in the effects of uncertainty across hospital types and departments. We discuss key research and managerial implications of our findings.},

The strategy literature discusses the contingencies under which firms can gain an early-mover advantage or a late-mover advantage. This research examines the effect of adoption speed on two types of environmental practices: environmental innovation practices (EIP) and environmental management practices (EMP). The results show that early adoption of EIP increases competitive advantage when firms face intense competition. In comparison, we show that early adoption of EMP increases competitive advantage when firms face extremely low competition or have moderate to high levels of slack resources. The study contributes to the literature by revealing the nuances, contingencies, and boundary conditions of when it pays to be green. Prior research shows mixed results when studying firms&#39; decisions to implement environmental practices, which implies that it may not pay to be green. This study shows that firms can get an early mover advantage from environmental practices, but it depends on the type of environmental practices, the firm&#39;s internal slack resources, and the firm&#39;s external competitive environment.},

Research has shown there is often an economic benefit of such policies in procurement auctions thanks to lower costs for buyers as incentives are offered to disadvantaged sellers. In this paper, we study one type of preferential procurement auction: the subsidy. Using a set of controlled experiments, we compare actual bidder behavior to what is predicted in equilibrium and find consistent (but overly aggressive) patterns overall. By testing a common bid strategy assumption, we also identify a behavioral framing bias that may trap sellers in these suboptimal strategies. Finally, we compare subsidies to another common discriminatory mechanism—the price preference—and find evidence that buyers interested in increasing the welfare of disadvantaged sellers should use subsidies instead of price preference auctions, thanks to a surprising difference in outcomes between preference types. Due to the wide use of bid preference auctions to support both policy and social aims, our findings have both financial and societal implications.},

While prior research has examined product personalization from a customer&#39;s or a manufacturer&#39;s perspective, this study focuses on product personalization from a brand retailer&#39;s perspective. Under product personalization, brand retailers that outsource production to upstream suppliers face two significant challenges: product returns from downstream customers, and personalization costs charged by upstream suppliers. Employing an analysis of transaction data from an online women&#39;s wedding dress firm, this study finds that as product requests increase (i.e., more product features must be modified), personalization costs increase, but the likelihood of product returns decreases. Additionally, as time requests increase (i.e., delivery is more urgent), the likelihood of product returns increases. Furthermore, relationship-specific process control exacerbates (i) the effect of product requests on personalization costs, and (ii) the effect of time requests on the likelihood of product returns. Finally, relationship-specific outcome control and transaction-specific control alleviate the impact of time requests on the likelihood of product returns while exacerbating the effect of product requests on personalization costs. The findings suggest that retailers can realize greater benefits from product personalization by selecting control mechanisms tailored to personalization requests.},

Additionally, this research examines how this project outcome is affected by project managers&#39; active participation in these communication networks. Using a panel dataset of 1599 projects spanning 104 weeks, with a total of 120,243 observations, we find that the density of communication network has an inverted U-shaped relationship with project performance, that is, as the density of the communication network formed by team member interactions increases, project performance initially increases but then starts to decrease. Meanwhile, a project manager&#39;s participation in the communication network has no direct positive impact on project performance, but it flattens the inverted U-shaped relationship, that is, it reduces the rate of decrease in project performance after the density of the communication network formed by project team members crosses the inflection point. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of communication networks in OSS projects and can help develop strategies for improving project performance.},

In this paper, we conceptualize operational excellence from a capabilities perspective. We derive our findings from within- and cross-case analyses based on data gathered from four global banks with varying competitive positions. We posit the microfoundations of operational excellence in services by demonstrating how the cumulative aggregation of constituent capabilities leads to higher competitiveness in firms. We enhance the external validity of the emergent theory by showing its applicability in another service setting (healthcare). Our study demonstrates the importance of shifting managerial thinking from individual operational improvement practices to long-term capability building through the microfoundations of operational excellence.},

  abstract     = {Health promotion and disease prevention requires health systems address the patients&#39; social needs using new care delivery models. Yet, research in this area has stalled for several reasons. We study a partnership model of care that couples clinical care delivered by primary care providers and social services delivered by community-based organizations, and its impact on patients&#39; preventive health outcomes and behaviors. We use data from the Mid-Ohio Farmacy, which is a collaboration across the Mid-Ohio Food Collective (MOFC), a network of 650+ affiliated food pantries, and a large federally qualified health center (FQHC). The FQHC offers primary and preventative healthcare services across eight free clinics, which are co-located with the MOFC-affiliated food pantries. Patients were screened for food insecurity during their clinic visit and, if positive, were referred to the Farmacy. Compliers made at least one visit to the food pantry after referral, while noncompliers did not. Using difference-in-differences, we find that compliers had no discernible change in their body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ), which we refer to as a BMI stabilization effect. Noncompliers&#39; BMI increased after referral. High comorbid and high pantry use compliers experienced a significant reduction in their BMI and a marginally significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, %). These patients had unique compliance behaviors, including greater search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use. Travel costs suggests that high comorbid patients ascribed a greater value to the Farmacy program. In terms of primary care utilization, we find that compliers&#39; clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the Farmacy program may have helped compliers address competing demands that are known to inhibit health behaviors.},

As a result, a firm&#39;s corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices can be influenced by CSR practices of its customers and suppliers—known as CSR diffusion. This study examines how CSR diffuses in a supply chain that encompasses a focal firm, its suppliers, and customers. Adopting a relational view, this research hypothesizes that a firm&#39;s CSR is influenced by its customer-base CSR differently than its supply-base CSR. By analyzing panel data consisting of 1972 firm-year observations integrated from multiple data sources, the results offer evidence for a positive impact of customer-base CSR and a negative impact of supply-base CSR on firm CSR. Interestingly, when customers and suppliers of a focal firm establish direct business connections (i.e., customer–supplier closure), the positive follow-suit effect of customer-base CSR is enhanced. In contrast, the negative free-ride effect of supply-base CSR is diminished. This suggests that a focal firm is more likely to embrace CSR practices from CSR-active supply chain partners when embedded in closed triads. This research shows the need to consider the directionality and closure of relationships in understanding the diffusion of voluntary, ill-defined, costly operational practices within a supply chain.},

  abstract     = {Project-based interorganizational networks are temporary and dynamic, and significantly different from stable networks for mass production. However, empirical studies on project-based interorganizational networks are scant. Drawing upon the network literature and distinguishing between production and distribution networks, we investigate how the centrality of a project in industry networks and tie strength of the project&#39;s member firms affect project performance in terms of product quality and sales. Using data of 821 Chinese movie projects during 2015–2018, we find empirical evidence that a project&#39;s centrality in the production network enhances product quality and that in the distribution network elevates product sales. Interestingly, weak ties in the production team contribute to product quality while strong ties in the distribution team improve product sales. This study advances the literature on project-based industries and interorganizational networks. It highlights the distinction between production and distribution networks in project-based industries and sheds light on the differential roles of a project&#39;s centrality and tie strength in both networks. These findings also offer novel insights to managers in project-based industries.},

In a large-scale and multi-site field experiment, we examine 29,669 machine status reports to assess the productivity effects of providing near real-time feedback to workers via smartwatches. We develop our hypotheses drawing on construal-level theory and its central idea of psychological distance. Initially, we observe production without feedback to establish comparability between treatment groups. Subsequently, we allocate various combinations of feedback to workers in four separate areas in two manufacturing plants. We manipulate whether the feedback is targeted at individuals with psychologically close feedback (“you did…”) or targeted at the team with relatively psychologically distant feedback (“your team did…”). Furthermore, we vary the message framing: positive framing emphasizes completed tasks, while negative framing emphasizes unfinished tasks. Our findings indicate that positively framed feedback, targeting individuals directly, enhances productivity more than other feedback combinations. Our study contributes new theoretical insights into the interplay between feedback framing and targets in fast-paced and highly automated batch production environments.},

Despite the criticality of this issue, there is a scarcity of studies in the field of operations management that investigate factors capable of mitigating these adverse impacts. Taking power outages and transportation obstacles as pivotal examples, our study aims to examine whether national culture can moderate the impact of public utility obstacles on firm labor productivity growth. To achieve this objective, we conduct an empirical analysis using a multi-country dataset from the World Bank Enterprises Survey, which covers detailed firm-level information across 28 industries in 41 countries, with a total of 17,227 firm-year observations. Our findings indicate that the detrimental effects of power outages and transportation obstacles on firm labor productivity growth are contingent on various dimensions of national culture. Specifically, cultural power distance and uncertainty avoidance would amplify the negative impact of power outages, whereas long-term orientation would alleviate this impact. Meanwhile, individualism and masculinity can help mitigate the adverse effects of transportation obstacles. Our results provide valuable insights for managers.},

On the other hand, these governance structures are inherently less stable than dyadic relationships due to their additional complexity and greater opportunities for free riding. We conduct a multi-source, longitudinal study, investigating how a buyer actively manages the dynamics between competition and cooperation during the formation of an MPA consisting of a lead organization and directional relationships between all partners. We contribute to MPA and coopetition literature by exploring cooperation and competition dynamics that are associated with the MPA structure that would largely be absent in dyads, and unpack the process by which a buyer orchestrates these dynamics by sequentially introducing new initiatives that seek to balance coopetition. MPAs have been recommended by governments and industry bodies as one solution for time and cost overruns in the utilities infrastructure sector, our study also provides guidance to buyers on the management of the alliance during the critical formation stage of the relationship lifecycle.},

However, as observational data lacks the benefit of random treatment assignment, estimating causal effects poses challenges. In the specific scenario where one can reasonably assume that all confounding factors are observed—referred to as selection on observables —matching methods and synthetic controls can assist researchers to replicate a randomized experiment, the most desirable setting for drawing causal inferences. In this paper, we first present an overview of matching methods and their utilization in the OM literature. Subsequently, we establish the framework and provide pragmatic guidance for propensity score matching and coarsened exact matching , which have garnered considerable attention in recent OM studies. Following this, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that compares diverse matching algorithms across various scenarios, providing practical insights derived from our findings. Finally, we discuss synthetic controls , a method that offers unique advantages over matching techniques in specific scenarios and is expected to become even more popular in the OM field in the near future. We hope that this paper will serve as a catalyst for promoting a more rigorous application of matching and synthetic control methodologies.},

To date, however, healthcare operations management (OM) literature remains ambiguous about longitudinal empirical associations between mid-level providers and hospital costs, quality, and other performance measures. We analyze how the extent of MLP employment used by a hospital is associated with hospital operational outcomes, as reflected by hospital cost per discharge and Triple Aim Performance (TAP) efficiency metrics. Our findings indicate percent MLP usage is positively associated with efficiency metrics for hospital clinical quality, technical efficiency, and patient experience, but not associated with hospital costs. We also find percent MLP usage is associated with the likelihood that hospitals excel on all TAP metrics simultaneously. Post-hoc exploratory analyses suggest the associations exhibit differential outcomes across hospital efficiency quantiles, while sub-sample analyses motivate boundary conditions for some hypothesized MLP associations. We contribute to healthcare OM research by providing one of the first panel data analyses of MLPs, improving insights relative to extant work. By giving key stakeholders useful findings about outcomes associated with hospital staffing trends, our managerial contribution helps hospital administrators understand empirical consequences of the increasing use of MLPs.},

Employing a combined perspective of resource dependence theory and transaction cost economics, we examine a natural experiment to investigate the effects of the 2018 U.S.–China trade war on the transactional relationships between Chinese suppliers and their U.S. buyers. Our study reveals that the trade war generally adversely affected these buyer–supplier transactional relationships, leading to a negative abnormal transaction value in the affected dyads, which amounted to 18.42% of their pre-event level. However, we find that this adverse impact can be attenuated when Chinese suppliers demonstrate superior innovation capabilities, higher corporate social responsibility performance, or fewer local political ties. These findings yield insights for international suppliers and buyers on strategies to maintain buyer–supplier transactions and minimize the detrimental effects on global supply chain relationships during geopolitical conflicts.},

  abstract     = {Millions of mom-and-pop nanostores dominate the grocery retail landscape in emerging markets. As nanostores are cash and storage space constrained, their suppliers tend to visit them with a high frequency, causing high operational costs. It is unclear if credit could mitigate such costs by allowing for a lower visit frequency. To investigate this, we conduct a randomized field experiment on nanostores that have not made recent use of supplier credit, with the objective to uncover how trade credits interact with the visit frequency and with the available storage space to shape shopkeepers&#39; ordering behavior. We find that trade credits moderate the positive relationship between visit frequency and bi-weekly order size, with credit effects being salient under low frequency visits. Storage space, by contrast, does not directionally shape shopkeepers&#39; ordering behavior. While trade credits may more than offset the negative effect of low frequency visits among adopting nanostores, credit adoption remains challenging, with only 24% of nanostores assigned to the credit condition actually adopting the credit. Remarkably, not a single credit line was defaulted over the entire duration of the intervention. In terms of assortment, trade credit is mostly used to acquire nanostores&#39; core assortment of popular, low-price items with low physical volume. We contribute to the extant literature by showing that the gesture by the supplier to extend trade credit may only partly legitimize a reduction of the visit frequency.},

Drawing on the concepts of identification and helping in organizations, we hypothesized that fostering workers&#39; identification with their own skills could serve as a mechanism to enhance helping behavior on the factory floor, which should improve productivity. We designed a compound skill-fostering treatment consisting of communication, meetings, and exercises regarding individual skills. We treat one large factory area for 2 weeks and keep a similar area in a sister factory as a control group for comparison in a difference-in-difference model. The results show that nudging skill identification increases workers&#39; identification with skills, but we do not find evidence for increased helping behavior or increased productivity.

In this study, we conduct a randomized field experiment with a partner firm to assess gender mismatch and bias in client-consultant exchanges. The experimental design enables us to examine gender bias within dyadic exchanges when there are gender matches (female client-female consultant or male client-male consultant) or gender mismatches (female client-male consultant or male client-female consultant). We find that reporting the consultant&#39;s gender significantly increases the client&#39;s likelihood of leaving more and higher reviews, increases the clickthrough rate on recommended products, and that the effect is stronger for females than for male consultants. We also provide support for the heterogenous effects of client experience depending on the gender (mis)match in client-consultant exchanges, including whether the prior effects hold when there is gender masking or manipulation (e.g., reported female consultant when actually male). Our findings offer important theoretical contributions and practical implications for OM scholars and managers.},

  abstract     = {The use of part-time employees to support operations has been a contentious topic in the literature. While part-time employees add cost-effective flexibility to operations, their impact on operational outcomes has largely been documented as negative. However, there are a number of sectors (e.g., non-profit) which rely heavily on part-time employees, with anecdotal evidence supporting their role in improving outcomes. Through this research, we seek to shed light on these contradicting perspectives. We do so by investigating the impact of the percentage of part-time employees in the workforce dedicated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) outreach efforts at United States (U.S.) food banks on the effectiveness of this initiative. SNAP is the largest domestic hunger program in the U.S., assisting over 42 million individuals, and food banks play a critical role in outreach and enrollment for SNAP. We utilize data on the operational characteristics and SNAP activities of food banks that are members of the Feeding America network and U.S. Census data on the demographic characteristics of their service area. We find that an increased percentage of part-time FTEs (full-time equivalent) in a food bank&#39;s workforce dedicated to SNAP outreach efforts increases its effectiveness, particularly in relation to operational and contextual factors that can benefit from a more flexible workforce. Based on these findings and our review of the literature, we propose a conceptual framework on the effectiveness of part-time employees in different settings .},

  abstract     = {This study empirically examines how induced learning through adopting a set of best practices and learning-by-doing improved a hospital&#39;s care of ischemic stroke patients using ad hoc teams. While previous studies in healthcare operations management conducted in ad hoc team environments predominantly focused on volume-based learning (learning by doing, team familiarity via interactions among team members), our study focuses on induced learning in ad hoc teams through best practice adoptions. The analysis uses secondary data (Data period: January 2009–March 2017) about stroke patients from a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) in a U.S. tertiary teaching hospital as it adopted the U.S. American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Target:Stroke best practices. The ad hoc stroke teams provide the initial care and their performance is measured using “ Door-to-Needle (DTN) ” time and its sub-time segments. The DTN time is measured as the time elapsed between the stroke patient&#39;s arrival at the hospital&#39;s emergency department (ED) and the appropriate infusion of “ Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) ” (i.e., a thrombolytic medication informally referred to as a “clot buster”). We found that adopting these best practices improved ischemic stroke care beyond improvement due to repetition. We also found that the neurologist&#39;s recent experience providing stroke care for the prior patient is positively associated with meeting the time performance goal for the current patient. This study provides insights into the use of management mechanisms to adopt and sustain best practices in healthcare that are generalizable to other organizations with ad hoc team environments.},

  abstract     = {Numerous studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) indicate that firms adopt CSR practices for various reasons related to their supply chain. However, the necessity to conform to a firm&#39;s own industry CSR norm is overlooked. Conforming to one&#39;s industry CSR norm—a herding behavior known as CSR conformity —ensures firm in-group legitimacy and preserves internal resources for core business activities. On the other hand, deviating from industry norms sets a firm apart from its peers, making the firm more appealing to supply chain partners. Motivated by this dilemma, this study draws on middle-status conformity theory and explores how a firm&#39;s network prominence determines its CSR conformity. Panel data analyses of 1650 firm-year observations reveal an inverse U-shaped relationship between firm network prominence and its CSR conformity, indicating that firms with a mid-level network prominence engage in higher CSR conformity. However, the inverse U is flattened when a firm&#39;s supply chain partners (and their respective industries) share similar CSR standards, suggesting that a firm can only prioritize its own industry CSR norms if its supply chain partners share a compatible CSR standard. These findings highlight the importance of understanding CSR from an organizational conformity perspective, especially in the context of supply chain network.},

However, limited understanding exists regarding how information security influences vendor selection. Drawing from the attention-based view (ABV), this study examines the potential impact of data breaches on hospitals&#39; selection of electronic medical record system (EMRS) vendors. To test our hypotheses, we compile a unique dataset spanning 12 years of observations from US hospitals. Utilizing a coarsened exact matching (CEM) technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, our study shows that hospitals tend to replace their EMRS vendors after experiencing data breaches. Moreover, breached hospitals tend to prioritize information security in such a vendor replacement process by switching to star vendors and migrating towards a single-sourcing configuration. Further post-hoc analyses reveal that these impacts of data breaches are mitigated as the relationship between breached hospitals and vendors matures or when hospitals belong to large healthcare systems. Additionally, we find that the effects of data breaches are contingent on the scale of the breach and are short-term in nature. This research underscores the significance of information security as a crucial consideration in vendor selection for both academia and practitioners.},

Despite the fast rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as smart sensoring, internet of things, and machine learning (ML), smart services have failed to keep pace. Combined, these technologies enable CBM to achieve the lean goal of high reliability and low waste for industrial equipment. Equipment located at customers throughout the world can be monitored and maintained by manufacturers and service providers, but so far industry uptake has been slow. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it uncovers industry settings that impede the use of equipment failure data needed to train ML algorithms to predict failures and use these predictions to trigger maintenance. These empirical settings, drawn from four global machine equipment manufacturers, include either under- or over-maintenance (i.e., either too much or too little periodic maintenance). Second, formal analysis of a system dynamics model based on these empirical settings reveals a sweet spot of industry settings in which such inhibitors are absent. Companies that fall outside this sweet spot need to follow specific transition paths to reach it. This research discusses these paths, from both a research and practice perspective.},

This paper begins to address this gap by investigating the choice of procurement contract type by US federal agencies during disaster management operations. The research relies on 47,560 contracts issued by the US federal government in response to 14 major disasters between 2005 and 2016. We build on agency theory to investigate the choice of the contract type made by federal agencies at the different stages of a relief operation. This research provides empirical evidence of the key factors underpinning the choice of contract in the context of disaster management, namely the amount of spend per contract and the type of acquisition (product or service), and reveals the moderating role of the stage of the relief operation.},

Drawing on a multiple-case study of four business areas in a multinational energy firm undergoing a digital transformation, we find that contrary to what the literature predicts, tasks that require skilled work can also benefit from the adoption of algorithmic solutions. To benefit, business areas engaged in two distinct pathways for transforming knowledge work. The first focuses on automating a specific task, replacing human activity with algorithms in a single task. The second involves re-engineering an entire process, whereby sequences of steps adjacent to the task at hand are redesigned on integration of an algorithm. We find that these pathways have different effects on the ability to improve knowledge work, suggesting that alignment between the task and the pathway chosen is crucial to realizing any improvement. We also find that the ability to sustain any improvement depends on the adjustment of the knowledge regime—the practices and structures that sanction knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a general process model for the adoption of algorithmic solutions in knowledge work. In the wider context of the future of work debate, our findings challenge the prevailing notion that a task&#39;s skill requirements determine the extent to which knowledge work can be improved by algorithmic solutions.},

A beneficial moderating effect of leader-worker disability status similarity on team performance is hypothesized and subsequently tested using Prais-Winsten regression. The results show that a leader with a disability has a potentially beneficial impact on team performance as the number of workers with disabilities in the team increases, resulting in improved productivity (measured in labor hours per garment) and quality (measured in operator defects per garment).

Drawing on the relational view and agency theory, we explore the tension between rent generation and agency costs and consider how a firm can design governance mechanisms to effectively leverage customer or supplier representation on the board of directors. The associated hypotheses are tested using a large panel dataset constructed from multiple archival sources, and our findings suggest that supplier and customer board members are a double-edged sword: While they generate value in some instances, they can also be associated with lower performance depending on the levels of two key governance mechanisms—the number of inside directors on the board and the proportion of outcome-based board member compensation.},

Based on a panel dataset comprising hospitals in California from 2012 and 2019, our results find support for competitive-distance-driven progression rates, suggesting that hospitals&#39; competitive positions measured by their distances to benchmarks drive performance improvements. Yet, the effect diminishes as they move closer to performance frontiers. In addition, we find that market competition reduces the progression rate of technical efficiency.

Although suppliers&#39; customers are increasingly signaling their commitment to tackling climate change through environmental disclosure, whether this signal contributes to supplier emissions reduction remains a question. Using signaling theory, this research proposes an emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure on a supplier&#39;s GHG emissions level. Using a 2010–2017 panel dataset from multiple sources, we find empirical evidence supporting the upstream emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure. Further, we identify two customer-base characteristics that affect this relationship: customer base climate innovation and competition. These findings contribute to the sustainable supply chain management literature by illustrating the effects of the customer base on supplier emissions performance. Specifically, customers could motivate a supplier&#39;s engagement in emissions reduction by collectively signaling their environmental commitment through enhanced disclosure. However, the effectiveness of this signaling effect can be contingent on the green innovation and competitive dynamics of the customer base.},

  abstract     = {Climate change, primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), is a pressing environmental and societal concern. Carbon neutrality, or net zero, involves reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the most common GHG, and then balancing residual emissions through removing or offsetting. Particularly difficult challenges have emerged for firms seeking to reduce emissions from Scope 1 (internal operations) and Scope 3 (supply chain). Incremental changes are very unlikely to meet the objective of carbon neutrality. Synthesizing a framework that draws together both the means of achieving carbon neutrality and the scope of change helps to clarify opportunities for research by operations management scholars. Companies must assess and apply promising technologies, form new strategic relationships, and adopt novel practices while taking into account costs, risks, implications for stakeholders, and, most importantly, business sustainability. Research on carbon neutrality is encouraged to move beyond isolated discussions focused on specific tactics and embrace a more, though not fully, holistic examination. Research opportunities abound in both theoretical and empirical domains, such as exploring tradeoffs between different tactics, balancing portfolios, and investigating the strategic deployment of initiatives over time. As a research community, we are critically positioned to develop integrative insights at multiple levels, from individual processes to horizontal and vertical partnerships and ultimately to large-scale systemic realignment and change.},

  abstract     = {Drawing on real options and resource dependence theories, this study examines how firms adjust their innovation investments to address trade policy effect uncertainty (TPEU), a type of firm-specific, perceived environmental uncertainty capturing managers&#39; difficulty in predicting the impacts of potential policy changes on business operations. To develop a context-dependent, time-varying measure of TPEU, we apply bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, an advanced deep learning technique. We analyze the texts of mandatory management discussion and analysis sections of annual reports from 3181 publicly listed Chinese firms. Our sample comprises 22,669 firm-year observations spanning the years 2007 to 2019. The econometric analyses show that firms experiencing higher TPEU will reduce innovation investments. This effect is stronger for firms facing lower competition, involving more foreign sales, and not owned by the state. These findings provide clarity on previously inconclusive results by showcasing the significant influence of policy effect uncertainty, as opposed to policy state uncertainty, on firms&#39; decisions regarding innovation investments. Additionally, these findings underscore the importance of resource dependence factors as crucial contextual factors in this decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {When making decisions about their commitments to environmental practices and performance, suppliers face heterogenous institutional logics and their diverse prescriptions for action. How do suppliers respond to such institutional complexity? We examine this question in the context of suppliers&#39; voluntary public environmental disclosures (disclosure). Specifically, our study assembles a unique panel data set of global manufacturing suppliers and their annual contractual relationships with buyers. Building on the institutional logics perspective and the sustainable supply network literature, we hypothesize that suppliers selectively mimic the disclosure of their buyers by following market, corporate, and sustainability logics. Our study contributes to the institutional logics perspective and the sustainable supply network literature by indicating that in the context of disclosure, market and sustainability logics both actively shape suppliers&#39; responses to institutional complexity. Furthermore, we find support for mimicry as a mechanism of buyer influence that can lead to disclosure heterogeneity across suppliers even when they follow the same logic, which opens new avenues for research. Our findings can be leveraged by buyers, policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in advancing transparency and sustainability in supply networks.},

Based on a case study and resource orchestration theory, this article focuses on configurations of different antecedents regarding supply chain integration and big data analytics capability to develop proactive and reactive SCR. Using survey data from 277 Chinese manufacturing firms, we consider three dimensions of supply chain integration, information integration, operational integration and relational integration, and three dimensions of big data analytics capability, technical skills, managerial skills and data driven-decision culture, and conduct fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore antecedent configurations generating high proactive and reactive SCR. We find that multiple antecedent configurations can achieve high SCR and configurations for high proactive and reactive SCR are not identical, which may involve alternative effects across different antecedents. We further implement propensity score matching analysis and reveal that firms following these configurations for high SCR also have better economic and operational performance. Moreover, we check the robustness of findings by using secondary data and attributes analysis with machine learning. This article complements and extends existing SCR literature from the configurational perspective and provides practical insights for managers to build SCR.},

We find that education does not cause an increase in the appeal of and WTP for remanufactured consumer products. Providing physical exposure to remanufactured products, relative to text and text-plus picture or video modalities, significantly increases both the appeal and WTP as a result of increasing perceived quality and decreasing disgust. Sellers can benefit from marketing remanufactured consumer products through physical channels (i.e., brick-and-mortar, outlet, showroom stores) as opposed to solely through online channels, which is the common practice among many sellers.},

This study addresses this gap by examining the impact of refurbished products in markets characterized by network effects and standards competition, while considering the developmental stage of the technology standard employed by the products. Introducing refurbished products, primarily remanufactured from returned items, can pose challenges such as sales cannibalization and negative perceptions of product quality. We propose that introducing refurbished products can also generate positive effects, because the availability of refurbished products can be perceived as an indication of sizable prior sales of the brand-new counterparts, alleviating consumers&#39; concerns regarding an insufficient user base and limited availability of complementary products. Our empirical and experimental studies consistently demonstrate that the availability of refurbished products adversely affects the market value and purchase intention of the corresponding brand-new products employing established technology standards. In contrast, the introduction of refurbished products does not have such a detrimental effect on products utilizing unestablished standards. Moreover, for a specific group of consumers, this green product strategy increases their purchase intention of brand-new products. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed.},

This study aims to evaluate the practices of fashion brands that currently employ a CLSC to better understand the existing strategies and prevalent issues in comparison to the electronics industry. We developed a framework based on factors that identify the delineating aspects of a CLSC and performed a content analysis of the publicly available sustainability reports of companies.

However, the evidence on the benefits of focus in healthcare is mixed. Our study proposes that a key piece of this puzzle that is been largely missing is an explicit consideration of the complexity of patient care needs. Specifically, our study serves to answer the questions: How does the complexity of care requirements affect care delivery operations? How does focus across the hierarchical levels of care affect care delivery outcomes across complexity regimes? The empirical analysis in the study is based on a large generalizable dataset of 246,663 patient discharges across 26 categories at 154 hospitals. We develop a multi-factor measure of complexity of care requirements. The study results point to the deleterious impact of complexity on the costs of care. Next, our findings highlight the differential impact of focus across hierarchical levels (task-level focus, category-level focus, and selective focus in related areas) on the costs of care. Third, our study findings highlight the role of focus in mitigating the effects of complexity on costs in a healthcare setting. We discuss the implications of the study findings for theory and practice, and the directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {Consumer return policies have been long recognized and studied by operations management scholars as an important managerial lever in a retail environment. Yet, the behavioral aspects of return policy decision-making and interaction of return policy decisions with other common operational decisions have not been investigated to date. We present a behavioral analysis of return policy decision-making in a retail environment with aggregate demand and individual product valuation uncertainties. Leveraging a generalized newsvendor context, we conduct a randomized behavioral experiment to understand how individuals make each of the three key retail decisions—refund amount, price, and order quantity—and the causal effect of salvage value on these decisions. We find that decision-makers exhibit behavioral regularities in making decisions across the three levers and they react to changes in the operating conditions in a boundedly rational manner, suggesting the use of heuristics. Based on behavioral regularities that we observe in our data—that is, responses, time-dependent effects, and decision dependencies—we develop a process theory based on behavioral decision-making tenets that offers a new direction with testable hypotheses for future research. The process theory describes a conditional decision-making heuristic that leads to a propagation of decision errors across different levers as well as lever-specific decision biases.},

Such setbacks may effectively be addressed through adjustments to contractual and relational governance; yet to date, the dynamics of governance adjustments and their interplay in addressing setbacks is not well understood. This research presents a dynamic theory of how parties can effectively address project setbacks through adjustments to contractual and relational governance. The dynamic theory was generated using longitudinal case data from two large public–private projects in the Netherlands that faced comparable project setbacks but deployed opposing governance adjustments, leading to drastically different project outcomes (i.e., collapse vs. recovery). This theory was then elaborated through two more cases and evidence from the literature. A system dynamics simulation model was then built that reproduces the different governance adjustments and outcomes observed in the four projects and serves to extend theory building. The refined theory not only shows under what conditions adjustments to contractual or relational governance are most effective, but also that governance adjustment interplay may trigger unintended side effects. As such, the theory explains why the careful balancing of governance adjustments is critical to project outcomes.},

Prior studies on the governance of PP projects showed the importance of governance mechanisms to deal with major events such as technical or organizational disruptions but paid limited attention to the management of coopetition. At the same time, research on the management of coopetition mostly focused on industrial coopetition, whereas PP projects also entail public-private coopetition. Seeking to better understand how governance mechanisms may help manage coopetition in PP projects, we conducted an in-depth study of Galileo—a large PP project aimed at delivering Europe&#39;s own satellite-based navigation system. The findings show how three core aspects of project governance—(i) mechanisms (joint vs. separate use of contractual and relational mechanisms), (ii) form (lead organization vs. shared governance), and (iii) goals (to promote cooperation and/or prevent competition)—jointly explained the emergence and (mis)management of knowledge- and value-related coopetitive tensions. In turn, these tensions prompted a series of adaptations in the governance of the project. Our study contributes to a co-evolutionary understanding of the governance of PP projects and offers implications for practitioners seeking to (re)design PP project governance.},

Through a 5-year longitudinal case study, we analyzed a large inter-organizational collaborative research program in England, underpinned by the CLAHRC platform, sponsored by the NIHR. The research program attracted clinical academics in universities and clinical practitioners in a range of healthcare providers to collaborate in an ensemble of projects to drive evidence-based care for patients with long-term health conditions. Program managers struggled to facilitate collaboration through the platform, despite a highly decentralized governance approach. Our study identifies three mechanisms through which the platform sponsor and program managers revised the platform&#39;s governance strategies to enhance collaboration: (i) they instituted “interruptive events,” which routinely stopped projects, and analyzed if and why organizations struggle to collaborate; (ii) they expanded, rather than restricted, access rules for collaboration through “platform renting”; (iii) they re-distributed, rather than re-centralized, governance, to reduce unnecessary interdependences across collaborators attracted by the platform.},
