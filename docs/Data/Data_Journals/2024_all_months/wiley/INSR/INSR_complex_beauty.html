  abstract     = {With the rise in popularity of digital Atlases to communicate spatial variation, there is an increasing need for robust small area estimates. However, current small area estimation methods suffer from various modelling problems when data are very sparse or when estimates are required for areas with very small populations. These issues are particularly heightened when modelling proportions. Additionally, recent work has shown significant benefits in modelling at both the individual and area levels. We propose a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical small area estimation approach for proportions that can account for survey design, reduce direct estimate instability and generate prevalence estimates for small areas with no survey data. Using a simulation study, we show that, compared with existing Bayesian small area estimation methods, our approach can provide optimal predictive performance (Bayesian mean relative root mean squared error, mean absolute relative bias and coverage) of proportions under a variety of data conditions, including very sparse and unstable data. To assess the model in practice, we compare modelled estimates of current smoking prevalence for 1,630 small areas in Australia using the 2017–2018 National Health Survey data combined with 2016 census data.},

  abstract     = {We discuss two novel approaches to inter-distributional comparisons in the classical two-sample problem. Our starting point is properly standardised and combined, very popular in several areas of statistics and data analysis, ordinal dominance and receiver characteristic curves, denoted by ODC and ROC, respectively. The proposed new curves are termed the comparison curves. Their estimates, being weighted rank processes on (0,1), form the basis of inference. These weighted processes are intuitive, well-suited for visual inspection of data at hand and are also useful for constructing some formal inferential procedures. They can be applied to several variants of two-sample problem. Their use can help improve some existing procedures both in terms of power and the ability to identify the sources of departures from the postulated model. To simplify interpretation of finite sample results, we restrict attention to values of the processes on a finite grid of points. This results in the so-called bar plots (B-plots), which readably summarise the information contained in the data. What is more, we show that B-plots along with adjusted simultaneous acceptance regions provide principled information about where the model departs from the data. This leads to a framework that facilitates identification of regions with locally significant differences. We show an implementation of the considered techniques to a standard stochastic dominance testing problem. Some min-type statistics are introduced and investigated. A simulation study compares two tests pertinent to the comparison curves to well-established tests in the literature and demonstrates the strong and competitive performance of the former in many typical situations. Some real data applications illustrate simplicity and practical usefulness of the proposed approaches. A range of other applications of considered weighted processes is briefly discussed too.},

Unseen units have a zero count and do not occur in the sample leading to a zero-truncated setting. Because of various mechanisms, one-inflation is often an occurring phenomena that can lead to seriously biased estimates of population size. The current work reviews some recent advances on one-inflation and zero-truncation modelling, and furthermore focuses here on the impact it has on population size estimation. The zero-truncated one-inflated and the one-inflated zero-truncated model is compared (also with the model ignoring one-inflation) in terms of Horvitz–Thompson estimation of population size. The simulation work shows clearly the biasing effect of ignoring one-inflation. Both models, the zero-truncated one-inflated and the one-inflated zero-truncated one, are suitable to model ongoing one-inflation. It is also important to choose an appropriate base-line distributional model. Finally, all models derived in the paper are illustrated on a number of case studies.},

We compare approaches to nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA) in longitudinal studies and illustrate them on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011 (ECLS-K:2011). Wave nonresponse with attrition often yields a monotone missingness pattern, and the missingness mechanism can be missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). We discuss weighting, multiple imputation (MI), incomplete data modelling and Bayesian approaches to NRBA for monotone patterns. Weighting adjustments can be effective when the constructed weights are correlated with the survey outcome of interest. MI allows for variables with missing values to be included in the imputation model, yielding potentially less biased and more efficient estimates. We add offsets in the MAR results to provide sensitivity analyses to assess MNAR deviations. We conduct NRBA for descriptive summaries and analytic model estimates in the ECLS-K:2011 application. The strength of evidence about our NRBA depends on the strength of the relationship between the fully observed variables and the key survey outcomes, so the key to a successful NRBA is to include strong predictors.},

In this paper, we provide a review of several popular inverse regression methods, including sliced inverse regression (SIR) method and principal hessian directions (PHD) method. In addition, we adopt a conditional characteristic function approach and develop a new class of slicing-free methods, which are parallel to the classical SIR and PHD, and are named weighted inverse regression ensemble (WIRE) and weighted PHD (WPHD), respectively. Relationship with recently developed martingale difference divergence matrix is also revealed. Numerical studies and a real data example show that the proposed slicing-free alternatives have superior performance than SIR and PHD.},

To estimate model parameters by maximum likelihood, we consider a two-step procedure carried out through the Expectation–Maximisation algorithm. To address the main computational burden related to the estimation of the matrix of dependence parameters and the number of degrees of freedom of the Student- t copula, we show a novel use of the Lagrange multipliers, which simplifies the estimation process. The simulation study shows that the estimators have good finite sample properties and the estimation procedure is computationally efficient. An application concerning log-returns of five cryptocurrencies shows that the model permits identifying bull and bear market periods based on the intensity of the correlations between crypto assets.},

This article explores the possibility of improving the efficiency of such estimators when continuous auxiliary variables are used in the regression estimation jointly with appropriate power functions of them, provided that the values of the auxiliary variables are known for all units in the population. The efficiency gain is determined analytically in the case of the OR estimator. A practical criterion for choosing the power functions that maximise the efficiency gain, involving the coefficient of determination in the regression fit of the study variable, is proposed for both the OR estimation and the more practicable, but generally less efficient, GR estimation. Furthermore, the effect of adding a power function of a continuous auxiliary variable in regression estimation is investigated when this variable is also used at the design stage. A simulation study shows that the joint use of a continuous auxiliary variable and a power function of it chosen according to the proposed criterion may improve considerably the efficiency of OR estimation, and much more the efficiency of GR estimation.},

Graphical models illuminate connections between many variables and can even describe complex data structures or noisy data. Graphical models have been combined with supervised learning techniques such as regression modelling and classification analysis with multi-class responses. This paper first reviews some fundamental graphical modelling concepts, focusing on estimation methods and computational algorithms. Several advanced topics are then considered, delving into complex graphical structures and noisy data. Applications in regression and classification are considered throughout.},

  abstract     = {Cointegration has shown useful for modeling non-stationary data with long-run equilibrium relationships among variables, with applications in many fields such as econometrics, climate research and biology. However, the analyses of vector autoregressive models are becoming more difficult as data sets of higher dimensions are becoming available, in particular because the number of parameters is quadratic in the number of variables. This leads to lack of statistical robustness, and regularisation methods are paramount for obtaining valid estimates. In the last decade, many papers have appeared suggesting different penalisation approaches to the inference problem. Here, we make a comprehensive review of different penalisation methods adapted to the specific structure of vector cointegrated models suggested in the literature, with relevant references to software packages. The methods are evaluated and compared according to a range of error measures in a simulation study, considering combinations of low and high dimension of the system and small and large sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a fully parametric quantile regression model based on the generalised three-parameter beta (GB3) distribution. Beta regression models are primarily used to model rates and proportions. However, these models are usually specified in terms of a conditional mean. Therefore, they may be inadequate if the observed response variable follows an asymmetrical distribution. In addition, beta regression models do not consider the effect of the covariates across the spectrum of the dependent variable, which is possible through the conditional quantile approach. In order to introduce the proposed GB3 regression model, we first reparameterise the GB3 distribution by inserting a quantile parameter, and then we develop the new proposed quantile model. We also propose a simple interpretation of the predictor–response relationship in terms of percentage increases/decreases of the quantile. A Monte Carlo study is carried out for evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood estimates and the choice of the link functions. Finally, a real COVID-19 dataset from Chile is analysed and discussed to illustrate the proposed approach.},

A thorough investigation of the generalised index paves the way for understanding the influence of the low, middle and high incomes on various income inequality indices and thereby facilitates the choice of multiple indices simultaneously for a better analysis of inequality as advocated by several recent studies. Moreover, two methods for estimating the generalised index in the case of finite populations are shown. A new method for estimating the inequality indices is proposed.},

The forecast accuracy is evaluated mainly through predictive Bayes factors, but energy scores and the probability integral transform are also used. Two empirical studies, for the US and Polish economies, are based on a small model of monetary policy comprising inflation, unemployment and interest rate.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing methods facilitate the production of scientific information by non-experts. This form of citizen science (CS) is becoming a key source of complementary data in many fields to inform data-driven decisions and study challenging problems. However, concerns about the validity of these data often constrain their utility. In this paper, we focus on the use of citizen science data in addressing complex challenges in environmental conservation. We consider this issue from three perspectives. First, we present a literature scan of papers that have employed Bayesian models with citizen science in ecology. Second, we compare several popular majority vote algorithms and introduce a Bayesian item response model that estimates and accounts for participants&#39; abilities after adjusting for the difficulty of the images they have classified. The model also enables participants to be clustered into groups based on ability. Third, we apply the model in a case study involving the classification of corals from underwater images from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that the model achieved superior results in general and, for difficult tasks, a weighted consensus method that uses only groups of experts and experienced participants produced better performance measures. Moreover, we found that participants learn as they have more classification opportunities, which substantially increases their abilities over time. Overall, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of CS for answering complex and challenging ecological questions when these data are appropriately analysed. This serves as motivation for future work to increase the efficacy and trustworthiness of this emerging source of data.},

  abstract     = {The binomial proportion is a classic parameter with many applications and has also been extensively studied in the literature. By contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, or the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays an important role in various fields. To estimate the inverse proportion, the maximum likelihood method fails to yield a valid estimate when there is no successful event in the Bernoulli trials. To overcome this zero-event problem, several methods have been introduced in the previous literature. Yet to the best of our knowledge, there is little work on a theoretical comparison of the existing estimators. In this paper, we first review some commonly used estimators for the inverse proportion, study their asymptotic properties, and then develop a new estimator that aims to eliminate the estimation bias. We further conduct Monte Carlo simulations to compare the finite sample performance of the existing and new estimators, and also apply them to handle the zero-event problem in a meta-analysis of COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical distancing on the infection of coronavirus.},
