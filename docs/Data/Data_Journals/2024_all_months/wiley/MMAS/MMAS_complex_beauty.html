  abstract     = {For the systems modeled by a generalized reaction–diffusion equation with the higher-order quintic nonlinearity, we explore the soliton dynamics via the F-expansion method. By the novel F-base function ansatz, we first derived the bright soliton and kink soliton solutions for the one-dimensional case of the reaction–diffusion equation with quintic nonlinearity. Furthermore, we employed self-similar techniques to analyze the higher-dimensional dynamics of bright soliton and kink soliton solutions supported by the (2+1)-dimensional reaction–diffusion equation system with quintic nonlinearity. Additionally, we conducted stability analysis of derived soliton solutions. Our theoretical results demonstrate that under certain parametric setting, the reaction–diffusion equation model with higher-order nonlinearity supports bright soliton and kink soliton in higher-dimensional as well as lower dimensional setting, which provides guidance for observing and investigating soliton behavior in systems modeled by the reaction–diffusion equation with higher-order quintic nonlinearity.},

Inspired by the works of Chueshov and Lasiecka on the property of quasi-stability of dynamic systems, we show first the quasi-stability property holds for the problem considered here and then prove the existence of global and exponential attractors. We shall also prove the upper semicontinuities of global attractors with respect to the fractional exponents. Finally, we shall show the continuities of global attractors with respect to a small parameter multiplying the delay term in a residual dense set and their upper semicontinuities in a complete metric space.},

  abstract     = {In the region between two closely located stiff inclusions, the stress, which is the gradient of a solution to the Lamé system with partially infinite coefficients, may become arbitrarily large as the distance between interfacial boundaries of inclusions tends to zero. The primary aim of this paper is to give a sharp description in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the stress concentration, as the distance between interfacial boundaries of inclusions goes to zero. For that purpose, we capture all the blow-up factor matrices, whose elements comprise of some certain integrals of the solutions in the case when two inclusions are touching. Then, we are able to establish the asymptotic formulas of the stress concentration in the presence of two close-to-touching -convex inclusions in all dimensions. Furthermore, an example of curvilinear squares with rounded-off angles is also presented for future application in numerical computations and simulations.},

  abstract     = {The present study has focused on the examination of a Holling type III nonlinear mathematical model that incorporates the influence of fear and Michaelis–Menten-type predator harvesting. The incorporation of fear with respect to the prey species has been observed to result in a reduction in the survival probability of the prey population and a concurrent reduction in the reproduction rate of the prey species. The existence and stability of ecologically significant equilibria have been ascertained through mathematical analysis. Emphasis within the proposed model primarily centers on numerical bifurcations of codimensions 1 and 2. Numerical validation has been performed on all simulated outcomes within the feasible range of parametric values. Dynamical characteristics of the model have subsequently undergone investigation through a series of numerical simulations, successfully revealing various forms of local and global bifurcations. In addition to the identification of saddle-node, Hopf, Bogdanov–Takens, transcritical, cusp, homoclinic, and limit point cycle (LPC) bifurcations, the model has also demonstrated bistability and global asymptotic stability. These bifurcation phenomena serve as illustrative examples of the intricate dynamical behavior inherent to the model. Numerical validation through graphical representations has been utilized to elucidate the effects of factors such as fear, nonlinear predator harvesting, and predation rate on the dynamics of the interacting species under different parametric conditions.},

We focused on the numerical experiment that indicates the neural networks whose parameters contain stochastic perturbations gain better performance than ordinary neural networks and explored the approximation property of neural networks with stochastic perturbations.

As such system cannot be exponentially stable, we are interested in polynomial energy decay rates. Our main contributions concern strong abstract and polynomial stability properties based on stability properties of two auxiliary problems: the sole damped equation and the second equation with a damping related to the coupling operator. The main novelty is that the polynomial energy decay rates are obtained in different important situations not covered before; let us mention the case of a coupling operator not partially coercive and not necessarily bounded. The main tools are the use of the frequency domain approach combined with new multipliers technique based on the solutions of the resolvent equations of the two auxiliary problems mentioned before. Finally, our abstract framework is illustrated by several concrete examples not treated before.},

  abstract     = {In this study, our main objective is to address the issue of sampled-data-based synchronization of complex networks subjected to stochastic scaling attacks using a looped-functional approach. To begin with, the design of a Lyapunov functional, which involves tuning parameters and slack variables, considers the error state information of χ ⁡ ( t k ) $$ \chi \left({t}_k\right) $$ and χ ⁡ ( t k + 1 ) $$ \chi \left({t}_{k&amp;amp;amp;#x0002B;1}\right) $$ . Then, the scaling attack is a type of deception attack that is formulated using an interval matrix approach. In addition, the complex networks considered in this study incorporate uncertain inner coupling strengths, which are more general than the existing ones, owing to the presence of uncertainties in the coupling strengths. Using a looped-functional approach to construct an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, we derive a set of sufficient conditions to achieve mean-square asymptotic synchronization for considered complex networks under scaling attacks. In the end, the proposed results are illustrated using three examples, including a practical example that highlights their effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {Real-world traffic flow is influenced by various random factors. Gaussian white noise is employed to describe the inherent randomness of traffic flow. A stochastic optimization velocity model is established for dynamic analysis. To enhance the traffic flow stability, the velocity difference of two successive vehicles ahead is considered. The velocity difference feedback control strategy is proposed, utilizing the velocity differences between the vehicle and the two targeted vehicles as control signals. Stability conditions for both the stochastic optimization velocity model and the feedback control model are derived by using the moment stability theory. The study demonstrates that the random factors can destabilize traffic flow, while the proposed feedback control strategy effectively stabilizes traffic flow. Additionally, the influences of random factors on the stability of traffic flow are discussed extensively, aiding in understanding actual traffic congestion mechanisms and offering insights for traffic control strategies.},

  abstract     = {A dynamical system is considered such that, in this system, particles move on a toroidal lattice of the dimension N 1 × N 2 $$ {N}_1\times {N}_2 $$ according to a version of the rule of particle movement in Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model. We introduce a stochastic case with direction choice for particles. Particles of the first type move along rows, and the particles of the second type move along columns. The goal is to find conditions of self-organization system for any lattice dimension. We have proved that the BML model as a dynamical system is a special case of Buslaev nets. This equivalence allows us to use of Buslaev net analysis techniques to investigate the BML model. In Buslaev nets conception, the self-organization property of the system corresponds to the existence of velocity single point spectrum equal to 1. In the paper, we consider the model version when one notable aspect is that a particle may change its type. Exactly, we assume a constant probability that a particle changes type at each step. In the case where , the system corresponds to the classical version of the BML model. We define a state of the system where all particles continue to move indefinitely, in both the present and the future, as a state of free movement. A sufficient condition for the system to result in a state of free movement from any initial state (condition for self-organization) has been found. This condition is that the number of particles be not greater than half the greatest common divisor of the numbers . It has been proved that, if , and whether or and there are both at least one particle of the first type and at least particle of the second type, then a necessary condition for a state of free movement to exist is the greatest common divisor of and be not less than 3. The theorems are formulated in terms of the algebraic structures and terms of the dynamical system. The spectrum of particle velocities has been found for the net . This approach allows us to hope that the spectrum of dynamical system can be studied for an arbitrary dimension of the net.},

The orthonormal discrete Legendre polynomials, as a well-known family of discrete polynomials basis functions, are used to develop a numerical method to solve this equation. To employ these polynomials in constructing the expressed approach, the operational matrices of the classical integration, differentiation (ordinary, fractional and distributed-order fractional), and stochastic integration of these polynomials are extracted. The established method turns solving the introduced stochastic-fractional equation into solving a more simple linear algebraic system of equations. In fact, by representing the unknown solution in terms of the introduced polynomials and employing the extracted matrices, this system is obtained. The accuracy of the developed algorithm is numerically checked by solving two examples.},

  abstract     = {The global impact of high unemployment rates has significant economic and social consequences. To overcome this, various skill development programs are initiated by governments of developing countries. But the problem of unemployment is still increasing day by day. So, there is a pressing necessity to revise the current policies and models. Therefore, this research proposes a fractional-order mathematical model that examines the impact of various skill development programs for youths. The proposed model incorporates fractional-order differential equations to capture the complex dynamics of unemployment. The main objective of this research is to examine the impact of training programs aimed at enhancing the abilities of unemployed individuals, with the ultimate goal of reducing the overall unemployment rate. The reproduction number is calculated using the next-generation matrix approach, which is crucial for both the existence and stability analysis of the equilibria. When the reproduction number is less than 1, the employment-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. The employment-persistence equilibrium point emerges only when the reproduction number exceeds one. We also explore the possibility of transcritical bifurcation and investigate the impact of skill development on the unemployment rate. We conduct numerical simulations to validate our analytical findings, further supporting our qualitative conclusions. These simulations help illustrate the unemployment dynamics and confirm the stability and behavior of the equilibrium points predicted by the mathematical model.},

  abstract     = {This research article investigates the effects of object&#39;s vibration and fluid movement on the acoustics of subsonic flows, specifically focusing on the scattering of acoustic waves by a vibrating rigid plate submerged in uniform flow. The acoustic plane wave that impacts the plate, coupled with its oscillatory motion, causes a disruption in the fluid medium. This disturbance, in turn, gives rise to a Rayleigh wave that propagates along the boundary separating the plate and the fluid. The study uses the Wiener-Hopf technique to analytically model the acoustic scattering by a rigid barrier of finite dimensions and analyze the relationship between acoustics and structures. The method involves applying Fourier transformations to the governing boundary value problem and resolving the Wiener-Hopf equations using the factorization theorem, Liouville&#39;s theorem, and analytical continuation. The integral equations of scattered potential computed asymptotically are used to describe the acoustic characteristics of structures and their interaction with fluid flow in subsonic conditions. The findings of the study reveal the sharp peaks of the scattered potential at certain angles with more oscillation in high subsonic flow. Also, increasing the frequency of the vibrating plate increases the amplitude of the scattered potential but is attenuated in mean flow whereas enhancing plate vibrations amplifies the scattered sound, and it is more vibrant in high subsonic flow than mean flow and no fluid flow. This research has applications in noise reduction, aeronautical engineering, and the detection of underwater structures using acoustic waves and micropolar elastic media.},

By placing requirements on the elliptic operator and auxiliary points, we characterize the ball limit of a series of elliptic operators in non-divergence form. Considering all dimensions, it becomes apparent that dealing solely with measurable and bounded coefficients for this class of operators is insufficient, necessitating additional regularity assumptions on them. We find the radii of convergence balls using recurrence relations, so as to guarantee the convergence of iterative reconstruction techniques, beginning from any point inside the ball centered on an auxiliary point.},

The fundamental technologies that serve as the foundation for various applications in the field include transducers, beam shaping, pulse compression, tissue harmonic imaging, contrast agents, methodologies for quantifying blood flow and tissue motion, and three-dimensional imaging. This article focuses on the examination of ultrasonic propagation, which involves the transmission of mechanical vibrations within the molecules or particles of a material. It quantifies the velocity of sound propagation in the medium of air. The third-order nonlinear M-fractional Westervelt model has been used as a governing model in the imaging process for securing the different wave structures. The recently developed computational methods have been applied in this study. The different wave structures are secured in various forms of solitary wave solutions including bright, dark, and combo solitons. In the domains of medical imaging and therapy, the investigation of sound wave propagation and high-amplitude phenomena is facilitated by the utilization of wave structures. The effectiveness of these solutions extends to acoustic cavitation, acoustic levitation, underwater acoustics, and facilitating the process of ultrasonic propagation in tissue. Ultrasound imaging technologies currently find application in the medical field, enabling the visualization and examination of internal human tissue. This technology exhibits a wide array of applications in the fields of industry and medicine. A representation of the graphs is produced using the appropriate parametric values. The results suggest that the chosen approaches exhibit effectiveness, viability, and adaptability when implemented in complex systems in various fields, with particular emphasis on ultrasonic imaging.},

We find that a singularity always occurs on the sonic circle near the origin, even in the case of steady flow, regardless of whether the speed of the incoming flow at far field is subsonic or supersonic. This inherent difficulty makes it impossible to extend the solution towards the origin pass across the sonic circle in the sense of classical solutions. To address the singularity, our idea is to fix a delta-wave on the sonic circle in the framework of the Radon measure solution. As a result, we obtain the existence of the Radon measure solution to the initial-boundary value problem and prove that a concentration will form on the sonic circle. More importantly, we deduce an exact formula for pressure distribution on the sonic circle. In particular, there is a concentration at the origin as the Mach number of incoming flow goes to infinity, which corresponds to the case of pressureless gas. Additionally, we investigate the case of Chaplygin gas.},

A well-posedness result within a Sobolev framework for (BP), considering a time dependent bottom, is presented. Then, the inverse problem is reformulated as a nonlinear PDE-constrained optimization one. An existence result of the minimum, under constraints on the admissible set of bottoms, is presented. Moreover, an implementation of the gradient descent approach, via the adjoint method, is considered. For solving numerically both, the forward (BP) and its adjoint system, we derive a universal and low-dissipation scheme, which contains non-conservative products. The scheme is based on the FORCE- method proposed in [Toro, E. F., Saggiorato, B., Tokareva, S., and Hidalgo, A. (2020). Low-dissipation centred schemes for hyperbolic equations in conservative and non-conservative form. Journal of Computational Physics, 416, 109545]. Finally, we implement this methodology to recover three different bottom profiles; a smooth bottom, a discontinuous one, and a continuous profile with a large gradient. We compare with two classical discretizations for (BP) and the adjoint system. These results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to recover bottom profiles.},

Consequently, this has a direct impact on the notable rise in product demand. Conversely, a product cannot be used or repurposed if its maximum useful life has already elapsed. Therefore, the product&#39;s maximum lifespan plays a crucial role in inventory management. Advance payment is a critical component of the supplier–retailer relationship for a seasonal product with high demand. By integrating these issues, an inventory model for perishable goods is created, wherein the demand for the good is impacted by both its selling price and its green level. The model also includes linearly time-dependent holding costs. According to this model, product greenness has an increasing effect on per-unit costs. Different numerical examples are studied for supporting this model. Optimality of the objective function is shown graphically as well as numerically with the help of MATHEMATICA software. Finally, a fruitful conclusion is reached after performing a sensitivity analysis and visually depicting the impact of changing various factors.},

Meanwhile, in the late 1980s, Jan C. Willems proposed an approach that broadened the range of systems studied, now referred to as the behavioral approach. This approach views the behavior of a system as its fundamental element, including all signals that adhere to the system laws (also called system trajectories). More recently, the behavioral framework has also been extended separately to periodic and quaternionic behavioral systems. Our work consists of considering linear periodic input/output quaternionic behavioral systems and using recent developments in order to obtain quasi-minimal and uniform state-space realizations.},

Furthermore, in various fields such as geometry and electromagnetism, split quaternions serve as more convenient research tools than quaternions. This paper aims to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of (anti-) η $$ \eta $$ -Hermitian solutions to a novel system of matrix equations formulated over split quaternions. We also provide the general expression of such solutions when the system is solvable, along with the least squares (anti-) η $$ \eta $$ -Hermitian solution in the case of inconsistency. To illustrate the key findings of this paper, numerical examples are presented.},

Secondly, based on a Lyapunov function and a new discrete fractional inequality, the stability condition is established by employing a linear matrix inequality approach. In addition, by constructing a proper controller, drive–response synchronization is investigated by means of deploying Lyapunov direct method (LDM). Finally, two examples with simulations test the correctness of the acquired results. Moreover, image encryption is considered as an application based on the chaotic DTFODQVNN.},

The article investigates the impact of two interlayer coupling approaches on the robustness of consensus in double-layer ring networks, where the interlayer relationships are denoted as degree positive correlation (PC) and degree negative correlation (NC), respectively. The robustness of network consensus can be derived from network coherence. Two types of network coherence are first described using the Kirchhoff index and the number of spanning trees, providing a new calculation method for network coherence. The number of network nodes and the coupling strength have been shown to impact the coherence of the two types of networks. Combined with numerical simulation experiments, the NC model shows better consensus than the PC model under the same parameter set. In particular, the parameter values when the network consensus is optimal are obtained.},

We validate the method by using simulations of the SDEs. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators; the latter is showed using the Malliavin–Stein method.

  abstract     = {We consider a two-dimensional time-inhomogeneous birth-death process to model the time-evolution of fake news in a population. The two components of the process represent, respectively: (i) the number of individuals (say spreaders) who know the rumor and intend to spread it and (ii) the number of individuals (say inactives) who have forgotten the rumor previously received. We employ the probability generating function-based approach to obtain the moments and the covariance of the two-dimensional process. We also analyze a new adimensional index to study the correlation between the two components. Some special cases are considered in which both the expected numbers of spreaders and inactives are equal to suitable sigmoidal curves, which are often adopted in modeling growth phenomena. Finally, we provide an application based on real data related to the diffusion of fake news, in which the optimal choice of the sigmoidal curve that fit the datasets is based on the minimization of the mean square error and of the relative absolute error.},

We assume that the diffusion parameters can be distinct at each equation of the system, and also, they can have different orders of magnitude, but the convection parameter is the same at both equations of the system. Then, in general, overlapping regular or parabolic boundary layers can appear in the exact solution. The continuous problem is approximated by using the standard upwind finite difference scheme, which is constructed on a special piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh. Then, the numerical scheme is an almost first-order uniformly convergent method with respect to all the perturbation parameters. Some numerical results, obtained with the numerical algorithm for one test problem, are presented, which show the good performance of the proposed numerical method and also corroborate in practice the theoretical results.},

The number of dengue infections is used as a threshold level I c $$ {I}_c $$ to determine whether to implement control, and control measures are triggered only if the number of infected individuals exceeds I c $$ {I}_c $$ . Using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, the dynamic behaviors of the free system and control system are studied. Then, the existence of the sliding mode is verified, and the sliding dynamics are analyzed by using the Utkin equivalent control method. It is shown that model solutions eventually converge to one of two endemic equilibria or the sliding equilibrium depending on I c $$ {I}_c $$ . In addition, by using Ekeland&#39;s principle and maximum principle, the sufficient and necessary conditions for near-optimal controls of this model are obtained.

The present contribution focuses on the mutliscale modeling of hydrogels that are treated by the enzymatic mineralization and thus enriched with calcium phosphate. More specifically, the calcium phosphate forms spherical or honeycomb structures in the hydrogel matrix, which significantly improves effective material properties such as stiffness and strength. The chosen multiscale finite element method (FEM) homogenization strategy uses the Hill–Mandel macrohomogeneity condition for bridging two scales: the macroscopic boundary value problem (BVP) simulates the specimen behavior, whereas the microscopic BVP investigates the representative volume element (RVE) depicting the heterogeneous multiphase microstructure. The approach proposed uses the Ogden model to simulate the hydrogel and the neo-Hooke model for the calcium phosphate phase. It varies the RVE type and the macroscopic tests in order to study the influence of the microstructure on the effective behavior and uses experimental data to determine missing microscopic material parameters. Chosen numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the numerical tool for the estimation of the optimal microscopic arrangement of phases.},

We further establish the existence, uniqueness, and stability estimate of solutions to the PML problem. Finally, we prove the exponential convergence of the PML problem in terms of the thickness and parameter of the PML, based on establishing an error estimate between the DtN operators of the original problem and the PML problem.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework for derivation of closed-form continuum equations governing mesoscale dynamics of large particle systems. Balance equations for spatial averages such as density, linear momentum, and energy were previously derived by a number of authors. These equations are exact, but are not in closed form because the stress and the heat flux cannot be evaluated without the knowledge of particle positions and velocities. Recently, we proposed a method for approximating exact fluxes by true constitutive equations, that is, using nonlocal operators acting only on the average density and velocity. In the paper, constitutive operators are obtained by using filtered regularization methods from the theory of ill-posed problems. We also formulate conditions on fluctuation statistics which permit approximating these operators by local equations. The performance of the method is tested numerically using Fermi–Pasta–Ulam particle chains with two different potentials: the classical Lennard–Jones and the purely repulsive potential used in granular materials modeling. The initial conditions incorporate velocity fluctuations on scales that are smaller than the size of the averaging window. Simulation results show good agreement between the exact stress and its closed-form approximation.},

The temporal convolutions of order 1/2 shifted fractional derivatives are involved in the time-domain Biot-JKD model, causing the problem to be stiff and challenging to be implemented numerically. Based on the best relative Chebyshev approximation of the square-root function, we design an efficient algorithm to approximate and localize the convolution kernel by introducing a finite number of auxiliary variables that satisfy a local system of ordinary differential equations. The imperfect hydraulic contact condition is used to describe the interface boundary conditions and the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method together with the splitting method is applied to compute the numerical solutions. Several numerical examples are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Let a particle start at some point in the unit interval I : = [ 0,1 ] $$ I:&amp;#x0003D; \left[0,1\right] $$ and undergo Brownian motion in I $$ I $$ until it hits one of the end points. At this instant, the particle stays put for a finite holding time with an exponential distribution and then jumps back to a point inside I $$ I $$ with a probability density μ 0 $$ {\mu}_0 $$ or μ 1 $$ {\mu}_1 $$ parametrized by the boundary point it was at. The process starts afresh. The same evolution repeats independently each time. Many probabilistic aspects of this diffusion process are investigated in the paper by Peng and Li listed in the reference. The authors in the cited paper call this process diffusion with holding and jumping (DHJ). Our simple aim in this paper is to analyze the eigenvalues of a nonlocal boundary problem arising from this process. In particular, we answer a question on the spectral gap of the DHJ process raised at the end of the paper by Peng and Li.},

In this paper, we discuss a special unique continuation for Helmholtz equations on a sphere in ℝ 3 $$ {\mathbb{R}}&amp;#x0005E;3 $$ , which is different with the classical unique continuation. The unique continuation holds only on the sphere and may not be extended to the domain in ℝ 3 $$ {\mathbb{R}}&amp;#x0005E;3 $$ . A Hölder type conditional stability of unique continuation is proved by complex extension method. Then a Tikhonov regularized scheme is proposed and the convergence rate is obtained by using the conditional stability estimate. Numerical examples are presented to show the performance of the scheme. It should be remarked here that our results may be applied to the problem of recovering a far field pattern with its local information.},

The focus is on the inverse problem of the retrieval of the layer mass density. The data are the transmitted pressure field, obtained by simulation (resolution of the forward problem) in exact, explicit form via the domain integral form of the Bergman wave equation. This solution is exact and more explicit in terms of the mass-density contrast (between the host and layer) than the classical solution obtained by separation of variables. A perturbation technique enables the solution (in its form obtained by the domain integral method) to be cast as a series of powers of the mass density contrast, the first three terms of which are employed as the trial models in the treatment of the inverse problem. The aptitude of these models to retrieve the mass density contrast is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically.},

The problem is hardly solved by computation since it is severely ill-posed in Hadamard&#39;s sense. Using the Fourier transform and the truncation of high-frequency components, we construct a regularized solution for the problem from the data given inexactly. As usual for ill-posed problems, the rate of convergence can be obtained under additional smoothness assumptions on the regularity of the exact solution, the so-called source conditions. By using a source condition in a generalized form, we prove a convergence estimate in a Sobolev space H q ( ℝ n ) $$ {H}&amp;amp;#x0005E;q\left({\mathrm{\mathbb{R}}}&amp;amp;#x0005E;n\right) $$ . Corresponding to different levels of the source condition, the convergence rates are improved gradually. We apply our theory to the backward problem with a convection–diffusion operator and a cubic nonlinearity. Finally, the numerical results are presented to test the validity of the proposed regularization method.},

Then, with the help of the dynamic analysis for the finite dimensional equations, the key parameters for determining the direction and stability of the Hopf bifurcation are given.

In this paper, we propose a novel wave equation model with Markovian switching to represent complex systems with state-jumping phenomena better, and the well-posedness of the model is proved. In addition, a numerical method with non-uniform grids is also proposed for the proposed model to simulate the data in realistic situations, which is based on the use of finite element discretization in space and central difference discretization in time. Finally, we conduct several experiments to analyze the errors and stability of the proposed model and the traditional model. The results show that the Markov switching model proposed in this paper has a smaller error than the traditional models while ensuring stability and can more accurately simulate the state jump phenomena of real-world systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are concerned with the nonlinear Love equation, which describes some sort of “propagation process” in physics. Firstly, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of the solution by using the contraction mapping principle and the regularity theory for the elliptic problem. Secondly, we construct a family of potential wells to obtain a threshold for the existence of global solutions and blowup in a finite time of the solution in both cases with subcritical and critical initial energy. Additionally, we provide the decay rate of the global solution and estimate the lifespan of a blow-up solution. Moreover, at the supercritical initial energy level, we provide a sufficient condition for initial data leading to blow-up results. This paper, along with the previous work of A. N. Carvalho, J. Cholewa, Local well-posedness, asymptotic behavior, and asymptotic bootstrapping for a class of semilinear evolution equations of the second order in time, Trans. Amer. Math.

  abstract     = {The influence of Rayleigh friction and chemical reaction on the onset of double-diffusive convection in a Navier–Stokes–Voigt (NSV) fluid layer is investigated by conducting linear instability and nonlinear stability analyses. The fluid layer is subjected to isothermal conditions and chemical equilibrium at the boundaries. The solubility of the dissolved component exhibits a linear dependency on temperature. The analysis is conducted for two distinct cases: the fluid layer is heated and salted from the bottom ( case-1 ), and the fluid layer is heated from the bottom and salted from the top ( case-2 ). Analytical expressions for the thermal Rayleigh number are obtained for both linear and nonlinear theories, and these expressions depend on Kelvin–Voigt, Rayleigh friction, solutal Rayleigh, Lewis, Prandtl, and Damkohler numbers. Including the Rayleigh friction term in the NSV fluid model improves the stability of the system and hence instability occurs with less ease. For lower solutal Rayleigh numbers, convection commences in the stationary mode and subsequently transitions to the traveling wave mode occurred in case-1 . The Damkohler number plays a significant role in the linear instability thresholds. It is also found that the Kelvin–Voigt number acts as a stabilizing factor for oscillatory mode convection. The comparison between linear and nonlinear thresholds unveils the region characterized by subcritical instability.},

  abstract     = {In this review paper, we discuss some of our recent results concerning the rigorous analysis of initial boundary value problems (IBVPs) and newly discovered effects for certain evolution partial differential equations (PDEs). These equations arise in the applied sciences as models of phenomena and processes pertaining, for example, to continuum mechanics, heat-mass transfer, solid–fluid dynamics, electron physics and radiation, chemical and petroleum engineering, and nanotechnology. The mathematical problems we address include certain well-known classical variations of the traditional heat (diffusion) equation, including (i) the Sobolev–Barenblatt pseudoparabolic PDE (or modified heat or second-order fluid equation), (ii) a fourth-order heat equation and the associated Cahn–Hilliard (or Kuramoto–Sivashinsky) model, and (iii) the Rubinshtein–Aifantis double-diffusion system. Our work is based on the synergy of (i) the celebrated Fokas unified transform method (UTM) and (ii) a new approach to the rigorous analysis of this method recently introduced by one of the authors. In recent works, we considered forced versions of the aforementioned PDEs posed in a spatiotemporal quarter-plane with arbitrary, fully non-homogeneous initial and boundary data, and we derived formally effective solution representations, for the first time in the history of the models, justifying a posteriori their validity. This included the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary conditions, which required careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula was utilized to rigorously deduce the solution&#39;s regularity properties near the boundaries of the spatiotemporal domain. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for proving (non)uniqueness of solution. These works extend previous investigations. The usefulness of our closed-form solutions will be demonstrated by studying their long-time asymptotics. Specifically, we will briefly review some asymptotic results about Barenblatt&#39;s equation.},

  abstract     = {One hundred ninety years ago, Lamé introduced the celebrated ellipsoidal system, which is an orthogonal curvilinear system that incorporates any anisotropic characteristics of three-dimensional space. Since then, the theory of ellipsoidal harmonics has been successfully developed, but almost nothing has been achieved for ellipsoidal waves. This is due to the fact that, in order to deal with the ellipsoidal harmonics, Lamé introduced some ingenious arguments that led to a complete spectral theory for the Kernel space of the Laplacian, but no such arguments have been proposed for the Kernel space of the d&#39;Alembert operator. So, one possible approach to develop a method that will give us ellipsoidal wave functions is to try to generalize the Lamé arguments (to the extent that this is possible) to four-dimensional ellipsoidal harmonics. This procedure will give us the hyperellipsoidal harmonics. Then we can replace the fourth coordinate by ict in order for the four-dimensional Laplace operator to become the three-dimensional wave operator of d&#39;Alembert and the four-dimensional harmonics to become three dimensional waves. The present work is the first stage of this project. It develops the geometry of a four-dimensional ellipsoidal system and calculates the Laplace operator in this hyperellipsoidal system.},

Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.},

Our new approach is based on the classical potential method and has several essential advantages compared with the existing approaches. We look for a solution to the mixed BVP in the form of a linear combination of the single-layer and double-layer potentials with densities supported on the Dirichlet and Neumann parts of the boundary, respectively. This approach reduces the mixed BVP under consideration to a system of boundary integral equations, which contain neither extensions of the Dirichlet or Neumann data nor the Steklov–Poincaré-type operator involving the inverse of a special boundary integral operator, which is not available explicitly for arbitrary boundary surface. Moreover, the right-hand sides of the resulting boundary integral equations system are vector functions coinciding with the given Dirichlet and Neumann data of the problem in question. We show that the corresponding matrix integral operator is bounded and coercive in the appropriate -based Bessel potential spaces. Consequently, the operator is invertible, which implies unconditional unique solvability of the mixed BVP in the class of vector functions belonging to the Sobolev space and satisfying the Sommerfeld–Kupradze radiation conditions at infinity. We also show that the obtained matrix boundary integral operator is invertible in the -based Besov spaces and prove that under appropriate boundary data a solution to the mixed BVP possesses -Hölder continuity property in the closed domain with , where is an arbitrarily small number.},

We thus employ a multiscale expansion method to study, in the weakly nonlinear regime, the evolution of small-amplitude perturbations around the equilibrium state. This way, we derive a spherical nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation that governs the envelope of the perturbations. The effective NLS description allows us to predict a “nonlinear instability” (occurring in the nonlinear regime of the system), namely, the modulational instability, which, in turn, may give rise to spherical soliton states. The latter feature a very slow (polynomial) curvature-induced decay in time. The soliton profiles may be used to describe the shape of dark matter halos at the rims of the galaxies.},

Moreover, the inverse problem of determining the shape of a human vocal tract also reduces to the considered inverse problem. The proposed method is based on special Neumann series of Bessel functions representations for solutions of Sturm–Liouville equations. With their aid the problem is reduced to the classical inverse Sturm–Liouville problem of recovering q ( x ) $$ q(x) $$ from two spectra, which is solved again with the help of the same representations. The overall approach leads to an efficient numerical algorithm for solving the inverse problem. Its numerical efficiency is illustrated by several examples.},

In this study, we aim to elucidate the structures of flow field under the influence of condensation. To achieve this, we present a mathematical model, which is formulated using Euler equations with a singular source term. Given the difficulties posed by both weak solution theory and the Dal Maso–LeFloch–Murat (DLM) theory (J. Math. Pures Appl. 483-548 (1995)) in defining solutions to the Riemann problem, we propose a novel approach. This involves the coupling of weak solutions within two subregions, taking into consideration the discontinuity of source term. Firstly, we identify two stationary discontinuities originating from the singular source term—namely, stationary waves and composite waves. Admissibility criterions are developed for these discontinuities to facilitate the selection of physically meaningful solutions. Secondly, we employ a double classical Riemann problems (CRPs) framework to analyze the structures of Riemann solution. Our analysis reveals that the Riemann solution may exhibit seven structures with stationary wave and four structures with composite wave. Finally, the proposed model and its theoritical results are applied to validate the structure of the flow field with condensation discontinuities. For the pure heat addition problem, we successfully demonstrate all wave patterns of the flow field, perfectly matching the outcomes of numerical experiments.},

The existence is proved by the method of successive approximations. To show the existence with the lowest possible regularity the special Besov spaces called the Sobolev–Slobodetskii spaces are used. The inflow and outflow are prescribed on the parts of the boundary which are perpendicular to the x 3 $$ {x}_3 $$ -axis. Since the inflow and outflow are positive the crucial point of this paper is to verify that x 3 $$ {x}_3 $$ -coordinate of velocity is also positive.

The study aims to derive exact solutions and explore qualitative properties through dynamical analysis. Exact solutions of the nonlinear differential equation model can provide insights into the behavior of bosonic atoms in complex optical lattice configurations, allowing researchers to simulate and study phenomena such as quantum phase transitions, many-body localization, and exotic states of matter. The invariant analysis has been performed for the first time on the specified equation, yielding a reduced system of equations with forms that are easier to handle. Novel techniques are applied to extract solutions from the reduced system of equations obtained via invariant analysis. The results reveal a rich set of solutions, including various traveling wave solutions and doubly periodic functions in the form of Jacobian elliptic functions. Bifurcation analysis, conducted through phase portraits, provides insights into the system&#39;s long-term behavior under different parameter values. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices via 2D and 3D plots of obtained solutions depicting the change in the behavior of soliton solutions with fractional derivative parameter.},

Unlike time-dependent delay discussed in the previous literature, we introduce SDD in impulsive stochastic differential systems, where SDD is a stochastic variable associated with system state, consequently leading to an indeterminate delay boundary. Our findings reveal that when destabilizing delayed impulses satisfying specific conditions are generated, the stability of stochastic differential systems with destabilizing delayed impulses and stable continuous stochastic dynamics can still be maintained. Additionally, if stable delayed impulses satisfy certain conditions, stability of the systems under consideration can also be achieved, irrespective of the stable status on the continuous stochastic dynamics. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the validity of theoretical results.},

Using high-order Bäcklund transformation, we derive the leading order term of the determinant solution to obtain the asymptotic representation for the high-order soliton solution. Furthermore, this method is also extended to the construction of more general high-order cases with multiple poles. We further find that if a soliton propagates along the logarithm characteristic curve, the high-order soliton can be decomposed into individual solitons with the same amplitude and velocity. Finally, these solutions are theoretically and graphically analyzed in detail.},

We explore the influence of energy variation in an amplitude-modulated (AM) force-driven Ueda oscillator through numerical simulations. Our investigation reveals the emergence of transient chaos, chaotic dynamics, and regular behaviors, underscoring the significant role played by the energy variable, denoted as ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ , in the system.

  abstract     = {This article deals with designing and analyzing a higher order stable numerical analysis for the time-fractional Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (K-S) equation, which is a fourth-order non-linear equation. The fractional derivative of order γ γ ∈ ( 0,1 ) $$ \upgamma \in \left(0,1\right) $$ present in the considered problem is taken into Caputo sense and approximated using the L ⁢ 1 − 2 $$ L1-2 $$ scheme. In space direction, the discretization process uses quintic B $$ \mathfrak{B} $$ -spline functions to approximate the derivatives and the solution of the problem. The present approach is unconditionally stable and is convergent with rate of accuracy O ⁢ ( h 2 + k 2 ) $$ \mathcal{O}\left({h}&amp;amp;#x0005E;2&amp;amp;#x0002B;{k}&amp;amp;#x0005E;2\right) $$ , where h $$ h $$ and k $$ k $$ denote the space and time step sizes, respectively. We have also noted that the linearized version of the K-S equation leads the rate of accuracy to . The present approach is also highly effective for the time-fractional Burgers&#39; equation. We have shown that the present approach provides better accuracy than the scheme with the same computational cost for several linear/non-linear problems, with classical as well as fractional time derivatives.},

Considering the competition-exclusion process between two different strains, it is possible to obtain a cooperative system in proper domain after taking a linear transformation. However, the corresponding cooperative system is not always subhomogeneous and the invariant region is not always a rectangle. Using the propagation theory for monotone semiflows, we obtain a unique threshold no matter whether it is linearly selected, which allows us to numerically estimate the speed. The threshold is proved to be linearly selected under certain conditions by constructing proper upper solutions. Moreover, we numerically show that the threshold may be nonlinearly selected.},

Firstly, in this article, we suggest a novel analytical technique for creating the exact solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). In order to study the dynamical behaviors of various wave phenomena, we can construct the several exact solutions in the form of Jacobi elliptic solutions, hyperbolic solutions, trigonometric solutions, and exponential solutions by using this method. Secondly, we consider a more generalized form of the (2+1)-dimensional Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations that plays an important role in describing the shallow water. We successfully extract several soliton solutions for the examined equation. By choosing the appropriate parameters, some graphs of the discovered solutions have been represented in the figures. Every obtained solution has been demonstrated to satisfy the corresponding equation. The findings demonstrate that the method can be applied to solve a number of nonlinear evolution equations. The new solutions and the paper&#39;s findings could improve our understanding of how the waves move through shallow water and open up new research avenues.},

After some well-posedness results, we derive several properties of the control-to-state mapping. We establish the existence of at least one optimal control and derive the first and the second conditions for optimality, giving the local uniqueness of an optimal control. Finally, we prove that we may expect the global uniqueness of the optimal control under additional assumptions.},

Our secondary method incorporates variable step-size, updated at each iteration based on some previous iterates. A notable advantage of these algorithms is their ability to operate without prior knowledge of Lipschitz-type constants and without the need for any line-search procedure. We establish the convergence theorem of the proposed algorithms under mild assumptions. To illustrate the numerical behavior of the algorithms and to make comparisons with other methods, we conduct several numerical experiments. The results of these evaluations are showcased and thoroughly examined to exemplify the practical significance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The interaction among the species is considered as Holling type III functional response. Firstly, existence and local stability of all the fixed points are derived under certain parametric conditions. Furthermore, a special consideration is made to global asymptotic stability of the interior fixed point. Then, we have shown that the system undergoes different types of bifurcations including transcritical bifurcation, flip bifurcation, and Neimark–Sacker bifurcation by using center manifold theorem, bifurcation theory, and normal form method. Also, Feigenbaum&#39;s constant of the system is calculated. It is observed that both harvesting and refuge have a stabilizing effect on the system, and the stabilizing effect of harvesting dominates the stabilizing effect of refuge. Of most interest is the finding of coexisting attractors and multistability. In particular, optimal harvesting policy has been obtained by extension of Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle to discrete system. Finally, some intriguing numerical simulations are provided to verify our analytic findings and rich dynamics of the three species system.},

First, since fast and slow dynamics coexist in Markov jump singularly perturbed systems, it may lead to ill-conditioned numerical problems during the controller design process. Therefore, the original system can be decomposed into independent subsystems at different time-scales by employing the reduced order method. In addition, two model-free parallel reinforcement learning algorithms are designed to obtain the optimal controllers for the fast and slow subsystems, respectively. Moreover, within the framework of reinforcement learning, the controllers of the Markov jump singularly perturbed systems can be acquired without the systems dynamics.

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, there has been a significant focus on computational methods for periodic systems. In some of these works, various considerations were outlined to establish and categorize algorithms for designing periodic discrete-time state-space systems. In a recent work, a direct algorithm was proposed to obtain low-dimensional realizations from a proper lifted system in state-space form. This algorithm, which lies in a category often called “fast” algorithms, takes advantage on the structure of lifted representations being highly efficient. In a 1993 work by Ching-An Lin and Chwan-Wen King, another direct algorithm was proposed that appears to be quite similar to the algorithm outlined recently. These two algorithms generate state-space periodic realizations that are both uniform, meaning that the dimension of the state remains constant at each time instant. The algorithms proposed in these two works require both a rank test applied to two different types of matrices, and , respectively (in chronologic order). Although the former algorithm establishes an upper bound for the state dimension à priori, by determining the maximum rank of the matrices , the latter obtains an upper bound à posteriori, based on the rank of matrices . In this work, we proved that these matrices and have the same rank for all , and we use this information to revise the latter algorithm and assess whether it represents an improvement. The algorithm presented as well its modified versions that were coded using the Python programming language. Surprisingly, the revised algorithm did not demonstrate any significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency.},

Moreover, the Jacobi elliptic method is used to solve the NODE, where many novel double periodic, kink, and solitary wave solutions are obtained. Additionally, we have chosen to plot periodic, kink, and soliton QDAWs solutions according to some choices for the variable coefficients. According to the a chieved results, we can conclude that the choices of the functional forms of the variable coefficients can control the QDAWs propagation.

Our method extends the recently proposed fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) by using fractional derivatives in all directions. For the special separable case in three dimensions, we obtain completely explicit representations for the fundamental solution. This allows us to interpret and to understand the appearance of spatial steady-state solutions or spatial blow-ups of the fractional Helmholtz equation in a better way. More precisely, we were able to present explicit conditions for the parameters in the representation formulas of the fundamental solutions under which we obtain bounded or spatial decreasing steady-solutions and when spatial blow-ups occur. We also illustrate this with some representative numerical examples. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to recover the recently studied cases as well as the classical cases as particular limit cases within our more general setting. Using the hypercomplex operator approach also allows us to factorize the fractional Helmholtz operator and obtain some interesting duality relations between left and right derivatives, Caputo and Riemann–Liouville derivatives, and eigensolutions of antipodal eigenvalues in terms of a generalized Borel–Pompeiu formula. This factorization, in turn, allows us to tackle inhomogeneous fractional Helmholtz problems.},

  abstract     = {Protein structure prediction (PSP) is the prediction of the three-dimensional (3D) folding of a protein (its tertiary structure) starting from its amino acid sequence (its primary structure). The state of the art in PSP is achieved by deep learning pipelines that require several input features extracted from amino acid sequences. It has been demonstrated that features that grasp the relative orientation of amino acids positively impact the prediction accuracy of the 3D coordinates of atoms in the protein backbone. In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of geometric algebra (GA) in instantiating orientational features for PSP problems. We do so by proposing two novel GA-based metrics which contain information on relative orientations of amino acid residues. We then employ these metrics as additional input features to a graph transformer (GT) architecture to aid the prediction of the 3D coordinates of a protein, and compare them to classical angle-based metrics. We show how our GA features yield comparable results to angle maps in terms of accuracy of the predicted coordinates. This is despite being constructed from less initial information about the protein backbone. The features are also fewer and more informative and can be (i) closely associated to protein secondary structures and (ii) more easily predicted compared to angle maps. We hence deduce that GA can be employed as a tool to simplify the modeling of protein structures and pack orientational information in a more natural and meaningful way.},

After a brief introduction of rationalized Haar functions (RHFs), the computational matrices of integration and fractional integral are applied to reduce the approximation of integral equations to some matrix algebraic equations. Next, the error analysis of the problem by using the two-dimensional iterated projection operator is offered. We will prove that the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm is , where h is the iteration number and β is the contraction constance.

Based on the image spaces of Riemann–Liouville fractional integral operators on L p ([ a , b ]) space discussed in our previous work, after a step by step deduction, three kinds of Galerkin spectral formulations are proposed, the final obtained corresponding scheme of which shows to be well-conditioned—the condition number of the stiff matrix can be reduced from O ( N 2 α ) to O ( N α ), where N is the degree of the polynomials used in the approximation. Another point is that the obtained schemes can also be applied successfully to approximate fractional Laplacian with generalized homogeneous boundary conditions, whose fractional order α ∈ (0, 2), not only having to be limited to α ∈ (1, 2). Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived schemes. Besides, based on the numerical results, we can observe the behavior of mean first exit time, an interesting quantity that can provide us with a further understanding about the mechanism of abnormal diffusion.},

Zika has been associated with congenital anomalies, like microcephalus.

The model consists of four compartments: susceptible individuals are x 1 ( t ), infected individuals are x 2 ( t ), x 3 ( t ) shows susceptible mosquitos, and x 4 ( t ) shows the infected mosquitos. The fractional parameter is used to develop the system of complex nonlinear differential equations by using Caputo and Atangana–Baleanu derivative. The stability analysis as well as qualitative analysis of the fractional-order model has been made and verify the non-negative unique solution. Finally, numerical simulations of the model with Caputo and Atangana Baleanu are discussed to present the graphical results for different fractional-order values as well as for the classical model. A comparison has been made to check the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed technique for our obtained results. This investigative research leads to the latest information sector included in the evolution of the Zika virus with the application of fractional analysis in population dynamics.},

Two examples of applications are given at the end.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a numerical scheme for a class of singularly perturbed quasilinear problems with integral boundary conditions. The quasilinear equation is discretized using a hybrid scheme, and the composite trapezoidal rule is used to discretize the boundary condition. We construct a general error analysis framework for the discrete scheme. Within this framework, the discrete scheme is shown to be uniformly convergent of O ⁡ ( N − 2 ⁢ ln 2 ⁡ N ) on Shishkin meshes and O ⁡ ( N − 2 ) on Bakhvalov meshes. Further, we propose adaptive generation of meshes based on a suitable monitor function and the mesh equidistribution principle. We prove that on these meshes the discrete scheme is uniformly convergent of O ⁡ ( N − 2 ) . Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical results obtained through experiments.},

By generalizing a previous approach of ours for the case of a single open wing, we obtain existence and uniqueness results for the problem solution in a product of weighted Sobolev type spaces. This system is then solved by applying to it a collocation-quadrature method. For this, we prove stability and derive corresponding error estimates.

This adaptation perfectly captures the rapid transition of the solutions which contain sharp boundary layers even with coarse meshes. The accuracy and stability of the scheme are rigorously analyzed. Numerical examples are shown to verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed scheme.},

FDIQM unifies the solution of multi-integer fractional-order differential equations leading to significant simplification in the implementation. Numerous examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the operators. Other examples are presented to solve various fractional differential equations including time-fractional sub-diffusion equation, linear/nonlinear, and multiorder fractional differential equations. In addition, numerous boundary conditions are considered including mixed fractional derivatives. Further, a nonlinear fractional eigenvalue problem is solved efficiently, and its bifurcation diagrams are obtained.

Ψ∘ ϕ remains a Bernstein function for every Ψ. We complete their work and illustrate how the class of internal function is rich from the stochastic point of view. It is well known that every ϕ ∈ B F corresponds to (i) a subordinator ( X t ) t ≥ 0 (or equivalently to transition semigroups ( ℙ ⁢ ( X t ∈ d ⁢ x ) ) t ≥ 0 and (ii) a Lévy measure μ (which controls the jumps of the subordinator). It is also known that, on (0, ∞ ), the measure ℙ ⁢ ( X t ∈ d ⁢ x ) / t converges vaguely to d δ 0 ( d x )+ μ ( d x ) as t →0, where d is the drift term, but rare are the situations where we can compare the transition semigroups with the Lévy measure. Our extensive investigations on the composition of Lévy-Laplace exponents Ψ with Bernstein functions show, for instance, these remarkable facts: ϕ is internal is equivalent to (a) or to (b) is a positive measure on (0, ∞ ). We also provide conditions on μ insuring internality for ϕ and illustrate how Lévy-Laplace exponents are closely connected to the class of Thorin Bernstein function.},

As a conclusion for our main result, we deduce the results of H. Fazli, J.J. Nieto, Fractional Langevin equation with anti-periodic boundary conditions, Chaos Soliton Fract , 114 (2018),332–337 under less restrictive conditions. The consistency of the main results is demonstrated by two numerical examples. For the sake of completeness, we end the paper by a concluding discussion.},

We consider here a cumulative model where, instead of a renewal process (as in the Poisson case), a linear birth (or Yule) process is used. This corresponds to the assumption that the frequency of “damage” increments accelerates according to the increasing number of “damages”. We start from the partial differential equation satisfied by its transition density, in the case of exponentially distributed addends, and then we generalize it by introducing a space derivative of convolution type (i.e., defined in terms of the Laplace exponent of a subordinator). Then we are concerned with the solution of integro-differential equations, under proper initial conditions, which, in a special case, reduce to a fractional one. Correspondingly, we analyze the related cumulative jump processes under a general infinitely divisible distribution of the (positive) jumps. Some special cases (such as the stable, tempered stable, gamma, and Poisson) are presented.},

A general criterium for the nonexistence of global weak solutions is established. In the particular case w = ω ( x ), we obtain the critical exponent in the sense of Fujita (first critical exponent) and the critical exponent in the sense of Lee and Ni (second critical exponent) for the considered problem. Namely, we show that, if 1 &lt; p &lt; p ∗ ⁡ ( N ) : = N N − 2 ( p ∗ ( N )= ∞ if N ∈{1,2}) and ω ≥ 0, then the problem admits no global weak solution; if p &gt; p ∗ ( N ), then a global solution exists, for some ω &gt;0 and suitable initial values.

The fractional order derivative is taken in the Atangana-Baleanu (AB) sense. The physical behaviours of achieved solution for FGNS equation are discussed and sketch out graphically. The existence of the solution for the FGNS equation is presented through theorems 4.1 to 4.3. The proposed numerical simulations confirm the advantages of the AB derivative through q -HATM. Few numerical experiments were carried out to validate the proposed method. Moreover, numerical simulations are carried out to verify efficiency and robustness of the derived results by considering two cases.},

  abstract     = {This study offers a comparative study of the analytical and numerical methods for investigating a contact problem. The contact problem comprises a functionally graded layer supported by a half-plane and loaded with a distributed load from the top surface. First, the analytical and numerical solutions to the problem are acquired by utilizing a theory of elasticity and finite element method, respectively. The problem is transformed into a system of integral equations in which the contact stress is an unknown function. The solution of the integral equation was achieved with Gauss–Jacobi integration formulation. The finite element model of the problem is created using ANSYS software, and the two-dimensional analysis of the problem is performed. Results were obtained from the samples for different material properties and loading conditions. The distributed load width and non-homogeneity parameters significantly impact on contact mechanics. The results indicate that the contact area and the contact stress obtained from finite element method (FEM) are close to the analytical results. As a result, acceptable error rates were obtained. Finally, this study provides evidence of a good agreement between the two methods.},

  abstract     = {Runge–Kutta (RK) pairs are widely used for numerically solving initial value problems (IVPs), but dealing with step rejections during integration is a common occurrence. Conventionally, when a step is rejected, all calculations made during that step are discarded, and a completely new set of computations is initiated. In our research, we propose a method to address this inefficiency by repurposing the previously computed RK stages from rejected steps. Our primary focus is on the renowned RKF45 pair, consisting of fifth- and fourth-order methods. When a step rejection occurs, we leverage the stages computed in prior steps and introduce just three additional stages. These stages are then used to evaluate the results with a smaller step size. This approach effectively reduces computational costs in various challenging IVPs where RK algorithms with different step sizes encounter difficulties},

  abstract     = {Stable generalized finite element method (SGFEM) for interface problem is based on simple mesh independent of interface curves and possesses merits of optimal convergence rates, conditioning of same order as that of finite element method (FEM), robustness, and freedom from any penalty parameters or stability schemes. This paper investigates mass lumping of SGFEM for parabolic interface problems. The mass lumping is important for computational reduction and maximum principle preserving. The difficulty in the mass lumping of conventional generalized FEM (GFEM) and SGFEM consists in their incorporation of extra enriched functions. The existing mass lumping methods of GFEM cannot work properly due to features of SGFEM that enriched shape functions vanish on mesh nodes, and the nodes are enriched partially rather than totally. In this study, we propose two mass lumping schemes for the SGFEM. The first one is to only lump the FEM part, and enriched parts are kept fixed. This scheme enables us to execute a rigorous optimal convergence analysis. It is noted that a theoretical analysis on the mass lumping of GFEM has not been available yet in the GFEM field. The second scheme is to further compress the enriched part and intersection part of mass matrix separately. The lumped mass matrix is almost diagonal, and there is only a line of nonzero entries in the intersection part of mass matrix. Numerical experiments indicate that two schemes both produce the optimal convergence rates; their errors are almost the same as those of SGFEM without using the mass lumping.},

An analytical solution is acquired for the modified ESR fractional model in addition to presenting some new interesting results. The best possible suitable range for the concentration gradient is found for the model whose use will be helpful in approximating the clinical data from laboratory tests in a profound and accurate manner and also in diagnosing the ESR rate more accurately. Further, an appropriate range is proposed for the uniform velocity of blood as well as the fractional order of the time derivative to construct the feasible model. In addition, it is also shown what value of the fractional order gives a closer resemblance to the clinical data. Validation and verification of the obtained results against earlier results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The continuous SIR epidemic model is a widely used mathematical tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases. We derive the system of differential equations that describe the rates of change in the number of individuals in each compartment and discuss the key parameters that influence the dynamics of the model. Next, we use the Euler method to discretize the continuous SIR epidemic model and obtain a discrete-time version. We analyze the dynamics of the discrete SIR epidemic model using both analytical and numerical methods. We derive the positively invariant set of the model and discuss the initial conditions of the model and how they relate to the total population. We compare the behavior of the continuous and discrete SIR epidemic models and show that the discretized model captures the essential features of the continuous model. We also investigate the impact of key parameters such as the transmission rate, recovery rate, and death rate on the dynamics of the model. Our findings suggest that the discrete SIR epidemic model is a powerful mathematical tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and developing effective strategies for their control. By studying the behavior of the model under different scenarios, researchers can gain insights into the transmission and prevalence of infectious diseases and develop interventions that reduce their impact on public health.},

Being a nonlinear equation, it is of great importance to develop efficient numerical methods for investigating the solution behavior of the CH equation. We present a few important linear and nonlinear schemes for the CH equation and obtain error estimates for those schemes. The integrators that we present here are of first and second order in time.

So, the stability of a neural network system is dealt with in the present paper. First, a theorem that asserts the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the system is proven. Later, the conditions that ensure the Mittag-Leffler stability of the equilibrium point is obtained by using the Lyapunov&#39;s direct method.

  abstract     = {In this research, we study certain characteristics of the solution for an equation involving uniformly elliptic nonlocal operator by establishing various maximum principles in bounded and unbounded regions. Additionally, we don&#39;t need the conditions that the narrow region principle&#39;s bound assumption and decay in the unbounded domain. In order to get the monotonicity of the solution, we use several maximum principles and averaging effects to overcome the challenges that generated by the uniformly elliptic nonlocal operator and fractional-order variable t $$ t $$ . Of course, while investigating the qualitative characteristics of the equation, we also provide some estimates of auxiliary function. For the study of additional nonlocal operators, we believe the method of uniformly elliptic nonlocal operators will also be helpful.},

  abstract     = {This paper uses the analytical method with arbitrary boundary conditions to model and analyze the free vibrations of multi-directionally functionally graded porous (MFGP) doubly-curved shallow shells resting on the Pasternak foundation in a temperature environment. It is anticipated that all mechanical parameters, except Poisson&#39;s ratio, will change in the direction of length, width, and thickness. To comprehensively describe the shell&#39;s displacement, strain, and stress fields, a modified first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) with an assumption of cosine distribution shear stresses has been developed. The fact that the enhanced FSDT theory does not require the use of shear correction and that the shear stress at the two free faces of the shells is zero are two of the theory&#39;s most significant advantages. Using Hamilton&#39;s principle and improved FSDT, one may get the governing equation for free vibration analysis of MFGP doubly-curved shallow shells. The Galerkin approach is proposed to solve the governing equation of MFGP doubly-curved shallow shells with various boundary conditions. The trustworthiness of the article is evaluated via its publication in the article model&#39;s several special cases. From this point on, a collection of findings about the natural frequency of MFGP doubly-curved shallow shells is identified and shown in the form of tables and graphs. The results provided in this manuscript can be used as a benchmark solution for further studies as far as the vibration behavior of the MFGP doubly-curved shallow shells is concerned.},

  abstract     = {An in-depth understanding of the mechanism concerning the parasitic disease called visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains challenging. Thus, we modeled the dynamics of this illness using two fractional-order operators, including Caputo–Fabrizio and Atangana–Baleanu. In the proposed dynamical model, the endemic and disease-free equilibrium points were considered the symmetrical components. The fractional Euler method was applied to simulate the developed model, thus determining the equilibrium points&#39; stability. The numerical simulation results were compared with the measured data to validate the model. The results obtained from the optimum fractional operator disclosed the minimum absolute and relative errors. The primary outcome of our study is the successful application of fractional-order operators, specifically the Atangana–Baleanu operators with = 0.98, in modeling the dynamics of VL. Notably, the numerical simulation results, validated against real data from Sudan, demonstrated that the Atangana–Baleanu operators with = 0.98 yielded the best performance, with minimum absolute and relative errors. This underscores the precision of our fractional calculus-based dynamical model in predicting VL dynamics compared to the classical framework, particularly for fractional-order values of = 0.99 and = 0.98.},

Research on the corresponding virus models is of great significance to tackle the challenges of understanding HTLV-1 development and treatment. This paper focuses on the dynamic analysis for a stochastic model with nonlinear cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is driven by Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process to model the progression of HTLV-1 in vivo. Rich dynamic behaviors such as the extinction of infected CD4 + T cells (ITCs), stationary distribution (SD), probability density, and finite-time stability (FTS) of the model are established to reveal the interaction of cell populations. The optimal therapeutic strategy based on the cost-benefit viewpoint is further obtained. Finally, illustrative numerical simulations are represented to corroborate the effectiveness of treatment and the ambient perturbation&#39;s impact that strengthening the noise strength can lead to rapid virus clearance.},

There are two time delays in the model to describe the time needed for infection of cell and CTL immune response generation, respectively. We obtain two thresholds and three possible equilibria from the model. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, we study the stabilities of equilibrium and the effect of delays on CTL immune response. The results indicate that when immune delay is present, the steady state of equilibrium is disrupted and leads to a Hopf bifurcation. Finally, we use sensitivity analyses to show the effect of parameters on thresholds and numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results.},

For the description of long-wave traveling waves, we derive the KdV equation and establish the validity of this formal approximation by providing estimates for the error. The proof is based on suitable energy estimates. As a consequence of the approximation result, the soliton dynamics present in the KdV equation can approximately be seen for the original system, too. There are no serious obstacles to transfer the analysis to other dispersive systems or to other periodic quantum graphs for which the KdV equation can be derived. However, a general KdV validity theory on quantum graphs would be extremely abstract and of minor use.},

We calculate the model&#39;s control reproduction number and equilibria and perform a global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium point. The mathematical analysis reveals that, depending on the model&#39;s demography, the model can exhibit forward, backward, and even some unconventional types of bifurcation, where disease elimination can occur for both small and large values of the reproduction number. We also conduct a numerical analysis to explore the short-time behavior of the model. A key finding is that for one type of demographic growth, the population experienced a significantly higher disease burden than the others, and when exposed to high levels of treatment with TBDs, only this population succeeded in effectively eliminating the disease within a reasonable timeframe.},

The expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ is derived by a linear approximation method, and it is concluded that if R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ , the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable; if R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ , the model has a unique endemic steady state which is locally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. Further, the uniform persistence of disease is proved using the persistence theory of the infinite-dimensional dynamical system when . In additional, the issue of optimal control problem according to this model is investigated, and the representation of optimal control with respect to state variables and adjoint variables is obtained which also imply the existence and uniqueness of optimal control. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to interpret the theoretical results and to discuss the impact of age and control measures in disease transmission.},

  abstract     = {A survey of the existing results in the literature shows that several of the results on variational inequality problem were established under some stringent conditions and employed some form of linesearch technique even in the framework of Hilbert spaces. However, due to the loop nature of the linesearch technique, the implementation of such algorithms might be economically nonviable. In this article, we study the pseudomonotone variational inequality problem. We propose a new inertial-like Tseng&#39;s extragradient method with non-monotonic self-adaptive step size that does not involve any linesearch technique for finding the solution of the problem in reflexive Banach spaces. Under some mild conditions, we prove a strong convergence result for the proposed method without the sequentially weakly continuity condition often assumed by authors to guarantee convergence when studying the pseudomonotone variational inequality problems. Moreover, we apply our result to study a constrained convex minimization problem. Finally, we present several theoretical and real applications to optimal control numerical experiments to illustrate and show the performance of our method in comparison with related methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the probabilistic analysis of a class of compartmental models formulated via a system of linear differential equations with time-dependent non-homogeneous terms. For the sake of generality, we assume that initial conditions and rates between compartments are random variables with arbitrary distributions while the source terms defining the flows entering the compartments are stochastic processes. We then take extensive advantage of the so-called random variable transformation (RVT) technique to determine the first probability distribution of the solution of such a randomized model under very general hypotheses. In the simplest but relevant case of time-independent source terms, we also obtain the probability distribution of the equilibrium, which is a random vector. Furthermore, we first particularize the aforementioned results for different types of integrable source terms that permit obtaining an explicit solution of the compartmental model: random constants, a train of Dirac delta impulses with random intensities, and a Wiener process. Secondly, we show an alternative approach based on the Liouville–Gibbs equation, which is useful when dealing with source terms that do not admit a closed-form primitive. All the previous theoretical results are first illustrated through several numerical examples and simulations where a wide range of different probability distributions are assumed for the model parameters. The paper concludes by applying a compartmental model that describes the dynamics of oral drug administration through multiple chronologically spaced doses using synthetic data generated according to pharmacological references.},

  abstract     = {Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is widely spread in China Mainland, seriously threatening the health of infants and young children. We develop a meta-population model that includes both local and ecdemic populations to study the impacts of fomites and immigration on the transmission of HFMD in Shanghai. The model includes both direct transmission between susceptible and infected individuals (asymptomatic or symptomatic) and indirect transmission via fomites. The forward bifurcation shows that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, the epidemic will die out; otherwise, the epidemic will spread. The fitting results show that the basic reproduction numbers of the local population and the ecdemic population are 1.4696 and 1.7288, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number showed that there was a high correlation between the basic reproduction number and the transmission rate of asymptomatic infected individuals, as well as the parameters related to the fomites (such as indirect transmission rate and virus shedding rate). Hence, asymptomatic infected individuals and fomites have a significant impact on the new HFMD infection. The numerical simulations on the prevention and control strategy show that reducing the transmission rate between susceptible and asymptomatic infected individuals or reducing the fomites can delay the outbreak of the epidemic and weaken the severity of HFMD. Our findings can provide guidance for the eradication of HFMD epidemic in the presence of indirect transmission and other factors.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) are two respiratory viruses and are similar concerning seasonal occurrence, transmission routes, clinical manifestations, and related immune responses. Recent studies showed that a substantial number of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were also coinfected with IAV. In this paper, we study the global properties of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV coinfection model in vivo. The role of humoral (antibody) immunity in controlling the coinfection is modeled. The model tracks uninfected epithelial cells, latent SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells, latent IAV-infected epithelial cells, active SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells, active IAV-infected epithelial cells, free SARS-CoV-2 particles, free IAV particles, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and IAV-specific antibodies. The model includes six distributed-time delays, two delays for the formation of latent SARS-CoV-2-infected and latent IAV-infected cells; two delays for the reactivation of latent SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and latent IAV-infected cells; and two delays for the maturation of new released SARS-CoV-2 and IAV virions. The regeneration and death of the uninfected epithelial cells are considered. We first examine the basic qualitative properties of the model, then we calculate all equilibria and prove their global stability. The global stability of equilibria is established using the Lyapunov method. The theoretical findings are demonstrated via numerical simulations. The importance of considering humoral immunity in the coinfection dynamics model is discussed. It is found that without modeling the humoral immunity, the case of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coexistence will not occur. We discuss the effect of time delays on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV coinfection. It is noted that increasing the time delay length has similar impact as antiviral therapies.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that investigation on exact solutions of nonlinear fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) is a very difficult work compared with integer-order nonlinear PDEs. In this paper, based on the separation method of semifixed variables and integral bifurcation method, a combinational method is proposed. By using this new method, a class of generalized time-fractional thin-film equations are studied. Under two kinds of definitions of fractional derivatives, exact solutions of two generalized time-fractional thin-film equations are investigated respectively. Different kinds of exact solutions are obtained and their dynamic properties are discussed. Compared to the results in the existing references, the types of solutions obtained in this paper are abundant and very different from those in the existing references. Investigation shows that the solutions of the model defined by Riemann–Liouville differential operator converge faster than those defined by Caputo differential operator. It is also found that the profiles of some solutions are very similar to solitons, but they are not true soliton solutions. In order to visually show the dynamic properties of these solutions, the profiles of some representative exact solutions are illustrated by 3D graphs.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with a class of singularly perturbed semilinear parabolic convection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous source function. Solutions of these PDEs usually exhibit a weak interior layer at one side of the point of discontinuity along with a boundary layer at one side of the spatial domain. We begin our study by proving existence of the analytical solution of the considered nonlinear PDE by means of the upper and lower solutions approach; and the ε $$ \varepsilon $$ -uniform stability of the analytical solution is established by using the comparison principle for the continuous nonlinear operator. In order to realize the asymptotic behavior of the analytical solution, we derive a priori bounds of the solution derivatives via decomposition of the solution into the smooth and the layer components. For an efficient numerical solution of the nonlinear PDE, the time-derivative is approximated by the Crank–Nicolson method on an equidistant mesh, and we approximate the spatial derivative by a finite difference scheme on a suitable layer-adapted mesh. We establish the comparison principle for the nonlinear difference operator to prove the -uniform stability of the discrete solution and further construct a suitable decomposition of the discrete solution for pursuing the convergence analysis. The computational method is proven to be parameter-robust with second-order time accuracy in the discrete supremum norm. The theoretical estimate is finally verified by the numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the cluster synchronization of fractional-order complex networks. Considering that impulsive control can reduce the update of controller, and the appearance of impulse is always dependent on each node in the networks instead of appearing at fixed instant, thus we design a variable-time impulsive controller to control the considered networks. Foremost, several assumptions are proposed to guarantee the every solution of coupled error networks intersect each discontinuous impulsive surface exactly once. In addition, by utilizing the B-equivalence method and the theory of fractional calculus, the variable-time impulsive fractional-order system is reduced to a fixed-time impulsive fractional-order system, which can be regarded as the comparison system of the former. Next, under the framework of 1-norm, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure that fractional-order system and target trajectory ultimately achieve cluster synchronization. In the end, a numerical example is designed to illustrate the validity and feasibility of theoretical results.},

It includes the memory-dependent and non-local system&#39;s behaviors while fractal–fractional derivatives is the generalization of fractional-order derivatives which refers to a combination of fractional calculus and fractal geometry. In this article, we have considered the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow of Casson hybrid nanofluid through a vertical open channel with the effect of viscous dissipation and Newtonian heating. The problem is modeled in terms of non-linear and coupled integer-order PDEs which is further generalized through fractal–fractional derivative of power law kernel. Due to non-linearity and complexities, we have adopted the numerical procedure as it is used when the analytical solutions of PDEs are frequently difficult or impossible for complicated situations. We have established the numerical algorithms for both the classical and fractal–fractional-order model and compared the results. The existence and uniqueness of the model&#39;s solution has been shown theoretically. The effect of various embedded parameters on the heat transfer and fluid flow has been simulated and presented through various figures while skin friction and Nusselt number are tabulated. The effect of fractional and fractal parameter is also shown. As the present model is taken for the hybrid nanofluid flow and for the heat transfer applications, we have considered mineral transformer oil as a base fluid while titania and cadmium telluride nanoparticles are dispersed in it. From the results, it is observed that hybrid nanofluid have a better heat transfer enhancement up to 19.71% while the unitary nanofluids are only capable to enhance the heat transfer up to 9%.},

An important step is to select the filling order and local intensity smoothness, as well as to ensure that the structure is not destroyed. We employ a two-stage structure tensor-based priority for the filling order: finding the candidate patches and determining the appropriate weight of each candidate patch under the constraint of local patch consistency, then applying a blend of a sparse linear combination of candidate patches to fill in the missing region of the image. In addition, this technique may also be used for object removal. The proposed method yields results that are visually natural and qualitative.},

The model consists of ODEs describing the evolution and interaction of prey, predator, and top predator populations in a biological system. We assume that the intrinsic growth rate of the prey is much smaller than a threshold value determined by other biological parameters of the model. Consequently, the model is transformed into a singularly perturbed system that acts on two different time scales, ranging from slow for both prey and predator to fast for the top predator. Positivity and boundedness of the solutions of the model along with the stability for its equilibria are investigated. The model possesses the exact invariant manifold with changing stability (black swan) and exhibits the canard phenomenon. Some numerical simulations are performed to validate our analysis.},

We model delays in labor market responses to past unemployment and vacancies creation and capture the effect on unemployment through a non-linear dynamic system. We observe not only job separation and matching but also movement into and out of underemployment. The model allows for migration in an open economy context.

For macroscopic models based on hyperbolic conservation laws, there exist nowadays many ad-hoc models describing this behavior. Based on real-world car trajectory data we propose a new class of data-driven models with the requirements of being consistent to networked hyperbolic traffic flow models. To this end, the new models combine artificial neural networks with a parametrization of the solution space to the half-Riemann problem at the junction. A method for deriving density and flux corresponding to the traffic close to the junction for data-driven models is presented. The model parameters are fitted to obtain suitable boundary conditions for macroscopic first- and second-order traffic flow models. The prediction of various models are compared considering also existing coupling rules at the junction. Numerical results imposing the data-fitted coupling models on a traffic network are presented exhibiting accurate predictions of the new models.},

The whole structure is placed on a three-parameter Kerr elastic medium. Hamilton&#39;s principle is used to develop fundamental equations of motion. Then, a Navier closed-form solution is employed to tackle propagating wave equations. By comparing the current findings with those found in the literature, the precision and validity of the suggested approach are proven. In addition, comprehensive parametric research is conducted to demonstrate the impact of the material-graded value and shear connection on the propagation in the structure.

We pursue two critical ideas for the success of the drug delivery system to the patient: minimizing the normalized global population density of cancer cells during treatment and at the end of treatment and minimizing side effects during treatment. The optimal control problem is considered with two linear and quadratic objective functions. These models are solved by a well-established numerical method with high accuracy and a low discretization cost. The numerical results have confirmed that reducing the total dose of the cytotoxic drugs during the treatment period leads to a rapid recurrence of cancer shortly after the end of the treatment period.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we will present new and more general traveling-wave solutions for the Dodd–Bullough–Mikhailov equation based on the extended Fan sub-equation method. The two-dimensional affine sphere&#39;s intrinsic geometry is determined by Dodd–Bullough in the three-dimensional unimodular affine space. The most significant accomplishment of our method is that we are able to provide all forms of the previously obtained solutions in one action, using at least four different approaches. As a result, the general elliptic equation with five parameters can be connected to other sub-equations with three parameters that already exist, such as the Riccati equation, the first sort of elliptic equation, the auxiliary ordinary equation, and the modified Riccati equation. The extended Fan sub-equation method is utilized to construct traveling-wave solutions, solitary wave solutions, dark soliton solutions, and bell soliton solutions for the nonlinear Dodd–Bullough–Mikhailov equation. Mathematica is utilized to depict the dynamics of various wave structures in 3D, 2D, and contour formats, utilizing a specific set of parameters. Our graphical comparative analysis suggests that the employed method is both reliable and powerful for obtaining exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. The approach employed in this study may also be applicable in enhancing the understanding of numerous other complex physical phenomena.},

Our model is more realistic than traditional epidemic models, as it accounts for the random fluctuations in disease transmission and the impact of media coverage on public behavior. We use Lyapunov functions and stopping times to prove the existence of a global positive solution to our model. We also derive sufficient conditions for the extinction and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we develop a numerical scheme to validate our theoretical findings and to analyze the influence of various parameters on the model&#39;s dynamics. Our model can be used to guide policymakers in developing and implementing effective disease control measures.},

  abstract     = {In a lot of engineering applications, one has to recover the temperature of a heat body having a surface that cannot be measured directly. This raises an inverse problem of determining the temperature on the surface of a body using interior measurements, which is called the sideways problem. Many papers investigated the problem (with or without fractional derivatives) by using the Cauchy data u ⁡ ( x 0 , t ) , u x ⁡ ( x 0 , t ) $$ u\left({x}_0,t\right),{u}_x\left({x}_0,t\right) $$ measured at one interior point x = x 0 ∈ ( 0 , L ) $$ x&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;{x}_0\in \left(0,L\right) $$ or using an interior data u ⁡ ( x 0 , t ) $$ u\left({x}_0,t\right) $$ and the assumption lim x → ∞ ⁡ u ⁡ ( x , t ) = 0 $$ {\lim}_{x\to \infty }u\left(x,t\right)&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;0 $$ . However, the flux u x ⁡ ( x 0 , t ) $$ {u}_x\left({x}_0,t\right) $$ is not easy to measure, and the temperature assumption at infinity is inappropriate for a bounded body. Hence, in the present paper, we consider a fractional sideways problem, in which the interior measurements at two interior point, namely, and , are given by continuous data with deterministic noises and by discrete data contaminated with random noises. We show that the problem is severely ill-posed and further constructs an a posteriori optimal truncation regularization method for the deterministic data, and we also construct a nonparametric regularization for the discrete random data. Numerical examples show that the proposed method works well.},

First, we establish the well-posedness of the COVID-19 stochastic model in terms of existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution. After that, we investigate the results of the stochastic extinction and persistence in mean of the COVID-19 disease. The findings show that both strains of COVID-19 pandemic extinct, when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. If the latter is not achieved, then the infection related to the strain with higher stochastic basic reproduction number will persist. Additionally, both strains can persist at the same time, if their related stochastic basic reproduction numbers are both greater than one. Finally, various numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the theoretical findings concerning the extinction and persistence in mean of the disease. As an application of our work, we have chosen to compare our deterministic and stochastic results with COVID-19 clinical data.},

This paper examines a predator–prey interaction to study its complex dynamics due to its slow–fast effect on predator populations. The occurrence and stability of equilibria are analyzed. The stability of positive fixed point is dependent on the slow–fast effect parameter ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ , which must fall within a specific range when the generation gap is larger. The positive fixed point becomes unstable for bigger values of ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ because the growth of predators is faster, resulting in the extinction of all prey. Smaller values of cause the positive fixed point to become unstable since the prey grows more quickly while the predator grows more slowly, ultimately causing the extinction of the predator. Moreover, it is shown that Leslie–Gower model experiences Neimark–Sacker and period-doubling bifurcations at positive equilibrium point. In order to control bifurcation, hybrid control and feedback control methods are employed. Finally, analytical results are confirmed by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we establish the closedness and convexity of the set of fixed points of equally continuous and asymptotically demicontractive mapping in the intermediate sense. We proposed an inertial hybrid projection technique for determining an approximate common solution to three significant problems. The first is the system of generalized mixed equilibrium problems with relaxed η − ζ $$ \eta -\zeta $$ monotone mappings, the second is the problem of fixed points of a countable family of equally continuous and asymptotically demicontractive mappings in the intermediate sense, and the third is of determining a point in a null space of a countable family of inverse strongly monotone mappings in Hilbert space. Based on these problems, we formulate a theorem and establish its strong convergence to their common solution. Additionally, we studied the applications of our algorithm to variational inequality problems and convex optimization problems. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our scheme. Several results available in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our result.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are very useful in modeling many problems in biology, economic data, turbulence, and medicine. Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and variable-order fractional Brownian motion (vofBm) are suitable alternatives to standard Brownian motion (sBm) for describing and modeling many phenomena, since the increments of these processes are dependent of the past and for H &gt; 1 2 $$ \mathcal{H}&amp;amp;gt;\frac{1}{2} $$ these increments have the property of long-term dependence. Classical mathematical techniques such as Ito&#39;s calculus do not work for stochastic computations on fBm and vofBm due to they are not semi-Martingale for H ⁡ ( ξ ) ≠ 1 2 $$ \mathcal{H}\left(\xi \right)\ne \frac{1}{2} $$ . Therefore, solving these equations is much more difficult than solving SDEs with sBm. On the other hand, these equations do not have an analytical solution, so we have to use numerical methods to find their solution. In this paper, a computational approach based on hybrid of block-pulse and parabolic functions (HBPFs) has been introduced for simulating vofBm and solving a modern class of SDEs. The mechanism of this approach is based on stochastic and fractional integration operational matrices, which transform the intended problem to a nonlinear system of algebraic equations. Thus, the complexity of solving the mentioned problem is reduced significantly. Also, convergence analysis of the expressed method has been theoretically examined. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm have been experimentally investigated through some test problems and comparison of obtained results with results of previous papers. High accurate numerical results are obtained by using a small number of basic functions. Therefore, this method deals with smaller matrices and vectors, which is one of the most important advantage of our suggested method. Also, presenting an applicable procedure to construct vofBm is another innovation of this work. To gain this aim, at first, discretized sBm is generated via fundamental features of this process, and afterward, block-pulse functions (BPFs) and HBPFs are utilized for simulating discretized vofBm. Finally, spline interpolation method has been employed to provide a continuous path of vofBm.},

Further, we prove geometrically that the fractional derivatives are inversely proportional to the classical integration in some sense. The established results are verified numerically for non-monotonic, trigonometric, and power functions. Further, this article establishes a significant connection between the area of the projected fence and the area of triangles. As the area of triangles decreases, the area of the projected fence increases, and vice versa. We calculate the turning points of the fractional derivative values of different functions with respect to order , including non-monotonic, trigonometric, and power functions. In particular, we demonstrate that for the power function , with being a positive real number, the value is a turning point when .

In this paper, we first consider an iteration class defined on Banach spaces, which is prominent in the literature in terms of both speed and convergence rate. Then, we consider the transformation constituting the iteration class as chaotic and obtain the stability and unstability behaviors of the iterations according to the operator norm by using Gâteaux and Fréchet derivatives representing the direction-dependent derivative. In this way, we aimed to obtain the chaos control intervals obtained with functions in real space with the help of operators in Banach spaces. Using the operator norm obtained with the Fréchet derivative, we derive interesting dynamical system intervals from a chaotic system with parameter variables of iteration algorithms. It is noteworthy that the parameter variables of the studied iteration classes are the same in some transformation classes. In addition, analytical proofs are followed by computer simulations of parameter-dependent control intervals considering the logistic operator with a chaotic structure. At the same time, the periodic behavior of the iteration algorithms used in our study is illustrated by the Lyapunov exponent with parameter-dependent control intervals according to operator norm. Finally, as a real-life problem, it has been shown that the chaos of the logistic population growth model with dynamic features can be controlled by chaos control mechanisms established by fixed point iteration methods.},

  abstract     = {The Weibull tail-coefficient (WTC) plays a crucial role in extreme value statistics when dealing with Weibull-type tails. Several distributions, such as normal, Gamma, Weibull, and logistic distributions, exhibit this type of tail behavior. The WTC, denoted by θ $$ \theta $$ , is a parameter in a right-tail function of the form F ‾ ⁡ ( x ) : = 1 − F ⁡ ( x ) = : e − H ⁡ ( x ) $$ \overline{F}(x):&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D; 1-F(x)&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;: {\mathrm{e}}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{-H(x)} $$ , where H ⁡ ( x ) = − ln ⁡ ( 1 − F ⁡ ( x ) ) $$ H(x)&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;-\ln \left(1-F(x)\right) $$ represents a regularly varying cumulative hazard function with an index of regular variation equal to 1/ θ , θ ∈ ℝ + $$ \theta, \theta \in {\mathrm{\mathbb{R}}}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{&amp;amp;amp;#x0002B;} $$ . The commonly used WTC-estimators in literature are often defined as functions of the log-excesses, making them closely related to estimators of the extreme value index (EVI) for Pareto-type tails. For a positive EVI, the classical estimator is the Hill estimator. Generalized means have been successfully employed in estimating the EVI, leading to reduction of bias and of root mean square error for appropriate threshold values. In this study, we propose and investigate new classes of WTC-estimators based on power of the log-excesses within a second-order framework. The performance of these new estimators is evaluated through a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation study, comparing them with existing WTC-estimators available in the literature.},

Using the zero number argument, we first show the general convergence to stationary solution for any nonnegative global solutions, and then we prove a spreading–transition–vanishing trichotomy result for the asymptotic behavior of global solutions. The key point is to find a quite special stationary solution to distinguish the spreading and transition solutions.

  abstract     = {This paper presents numerical analysis of the discrete fundamental solution of the discrete Laplace operator on a rectangular lattice. Additionally, to provide estimates in interior and exterior domains, two different regularisations of the discrete fundamental solution are considered. Estimates for the absolute difference and l p -estimates are constructed for both regularisations. Thus, this work extends the classical results in the discrete potential theory to the case of a rectangular lattice and serves as a basis for future convergence analysis of the method of discrete potentials on rectangular lattices.},

In Clifford analysis, the Euclidean version of these equations has been dealt with, but it is not clear, even in dimension 4, what should be the right analogue of massless field equations for fields with values in a general irreducible S p i n (4)-module. The main aim of the paper is to explain that a good possibility is to take the so-called generalized Cauchy–Riemann equations proposed a long time ago by Stein and Weiss. For this choice of the equations, we show that their polynomial solutions form different irreducible S p i n (4)-modules. This is an important step in developing the corresponding function theory.},

In this paper, we first construct the Π-operator on a general Clifford–Hilbert space. This Π-operator is also an L 2 isometry. Further, it can also be used for solving certain Beltrami equations when the Hilbert space is the L 2 space of a measure space. Then, we show that this technique can be applied to construct the classical Π-operator in the complex plane and some other examples on some conformally flat manifolds, which are constructed by U /Γ, where U is a simply connected subdomain of either ℝ n + 1 or 𝕊 n − 1 , and Γ is a Kleinian group acting discontinuously on U . The Π-operators on those manifolds also preserve the isometry property in certain L 2 spaces, and their L p norms are bounded by the L p norms of the Π-operators on or , depending on where U lies. The applications of the Π-operator to solutions of the Beltrami equations on those conformally flat manifolds are also discussed.

In this paper, we extend this line of investigation by developing explicit formulas for the Szegö kernel of strip domains of the form S : = { z ∈ 𝕆 | 0 &lt; ℜ ⁡ ( z ) &lt; d } from which we derive by a limit argument considering d → ∞ the Szegö kernel of the octonionic right half-space.

The main result of this article is the statement that in case the negative integers are even, i.e., k = − 2 ⁢ ℓ , ℓ ∈ ℕ , we still have a Fischer-type decomposition. For k = 0 , the classical harmonic functions, this decomposition is well known. But also in case k ∈ ℕ , a Fischer-type decomposition holds true, a Fischer-type decomposition holds true. Surprisingly in case k = − 3 , k = − 5 , or k = − 7 and probably in all higher negative odd cases, the decomposition doesn&#39;t hold.

When we rewrite our system into the symmetric hyperbolic form in the multidimensional case, it is important to take the constraint conditions into account. Indeed, the stability condition with the constraint conditions guarantees the dissipative property for our system in some cases. In this paper, we introduce the stability condition with constraints for the general problem and apply this argument to the system of MGT thermoelasticity.

  abstract     = {Recently, many scholars have discovered that fractional calculus possess infinite memory and can better reflect the memory characteristics of neurons. Therefore, this paper studies the Hopf bifurcation of a fractional-order network with short-cut connections structure and self-delay feedback. Firstly, we use the Laplace transform to obtain the characteristic equation of the model, which is the transcendental equation containing four times transcendental item. Secondly, by selecting the communication delay as the bifurcation parameter and the other delay as the constant in its stability interval, the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation are established; the bifurcation diagrams are provided to ensure that the derived bifurcation findings are accurate. Thirdly, in the case of identical neurons, the crossing curves method is exploited to the fractional-order functional function equation to extract the Hopf bifurcation curve. Finally, two numerical examples are employed to confirm the efficiency of the developed theoretical outcomes.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problems of passivity and robust passivity for a class of stochastic switched inertial neural networks (SSINNs) with time-varying parametric uncertainties. First, the original inertial neural networks can be converted into first-order differential systems using a suitable variable transformation approach. Moreover, by using a proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) theory, Jensen&#39;s inequality, and the state-dependent switching (SDS) law approach, several adequate criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure passivity and robust passivity analysis of SSINNs with parametric uncertainties and time-varying delays. It is demonstrated that the developed SDS law may guarantee the passivity requirements of the above-considered system made up of all unstable subnetworks. Furthermore, the gains are obtained by solving a set of LMIs that can be easily verified by some standard numerical packages. Ultimately, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the suggested method.},

In the present work, we deal with the minimality of isoquants of production functions with arbitrary number of inputs, this being a key concept used in making the best decision for optimizing the production costs. In the main result of the article, we give the complete classification of quasi-product production functions whose isoquants are minimal, showing that there are exactly nine production models with such a property. Among them, we can identify a particular classic model already widely used in economic analysis (viz., a Cobb–Douglas model with unit output elasticities with respect to some production factors) and various production models completely unknown until now and which will open new opportunities for applied research in the field of mathematical economics.},

The chirped solutions of the extended nonlinear Schrödinger equations are obtained by using the complete discrimination system for polynomial method, and under specific parameter conditions, three types of optical wave patterns are obtained to visualize the model.

Unlike many existing studies, this paper assumes that both types of delays are bounded and continuous, without requiring differentiability. Additionally, the analysis combines the inequality approach and comparison method, while neither a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed nor the finite-time stability theorem is involved. The finite-time stability of the addressed networks is then ensured by several suitable algebraic criteria. Some extended results are deduced for networks without considering reaction–diffusion and distributed delays effects as special cases.

More precisely, the new control law consists of linear and nonlinear functions of tracking errors, in which the former is for the nominal stability and the latter is to ensure the robust stability of the resulting closed-loop systems. The nonlinear function can be interpreted as an extended version of conventional SMC approach, and the reaching phase corresponding to a pregiven sliding surface is shown to be completed in a finite time; the tracking errors arrive at the sliding surface in a finite time and do not deviate from it after the arrival. In the sliding phase, the tracking errors are also ensured to converge to the origin.

The framework of this model accommodates the nonlocal diffusion of the pathogen within cells. Our investigation showcases the well-posed nature of the model and establishes the compactness of the solutions. We derive the basic reproduction number, denoted as , and substantiate that when is less than 1, the disease-free equilibrium ( ) achieves global asymptotic stability.

  abstract     = {The Helmholtz oscillator is a nonlinear mixed-parity oscillator that models the asymmetric vibrations of many engineering and scientific systems. This paper investigated a general and completely integrable form of the Helmholtz oscillator and derived its exact periodic solution from the first integral of the governing differential equation. The considered Helmholtz oscillator has general linear and nonlinear stiffness constants, is subject to a constant force, and has arbitrary initial conditions. Its exact time period was derived in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, while the exact displacement was derived in terms of the Jacobi elliptic sine function. The validity of the exact solutions was verified for various combinations of the system parameters and initial conditions by comparing with numerical solutions. The exact solutions and numerical solutions were found to match perfectly. Furthermore, the exact solution was applied to analyze the vibration response of real-world systems that could be modeled as Helmholtz oscillators. The present exact solutions provide benchmark solutions that could be used to determine the accuracy of new and existing approximate solutions for the Helmholtz oscillator.},

  abstract     = {The inverse problem of recovery of a potential on a quantum tree graph from the Weyl matrix given at a number of points is considered. A method for its numerical solution is proposed. The overall approach is based on the leaf peeling method combined with Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions of Sturm–Liouville equations. In each step, the solution of the arising inverse problems reduces to dealing with the NSBF coefficients. The leaf peeling method allows one to localize the general inverse problem to local problems on sheaves, while the approach based on the NSBF representations leads to splitting the local problems into two-spectrum inverse problems on separate edges and reduces them to systems of linear algebraic equations for the NSBF coefficients. Moreover, the potential on each edge is recovered from the very first NSBF coefficient. The proposed method leads to an efficient numerical algorithm that is illustrated by numerical tests.},

The involved delays include multiple time-varying transmission delays and unbounded distributed delays. Existence and uniqueness of equilibrium point of the considered neural networks are investigated by using the homeomorphism theory between topology spaces. To show sufficient conditions for global exponential stability of the unique equilibrium point, a method based on estimation of solutions is presented. The acquired stability conditions contain only several simple linear scalar inequalities, which can be easily solved. The availability of theoretical results is shown by a numerical example. A point worth emphasizing is that the method based on estimation of solutions is applicable for models of many time-delay systems after a minor modification.},

In addition, we establish a relationship between the norm retrievability of a frame and its duals. We also show that, unlike the phase retrieval property, the set of all norm retrievable dual frames is generally not dense in the set of all dual frames. Then, we present numerical results to illustrate the potentiality of the NRF approach in signal recovery with respect to the classical framework in frame theory, and finally, we raise some perspectives and problems concerning NRF.},

The shock position is uniquely determined by the exit normal momentum when we fix one point of the shock. This problem can be reduced to solve a nonlinear free boundary value problem for a hyperbolic–elliptic coupled system and the key ingredient is to solve a second-order quasilinear elliptic equation with a nonlocal term by the method of separation of variables.},

The technique (ATIM) combines the new iterative method with the Aboodh transform. The convergence analysis of the approximate solution is discussed using the Cauchy convergence theorem. The validity of the ATIM is shown by numerical simulation and graphs. Also, the preference for nonsingular kernel over singular kernel is shown with the help of tables and graphs.

  abstract     = {The propagation of nonlinear solitary and shallow water waves can be examined by nonlinear evolution equations. The dynamics of nonlinear behavior are described by exact solutions having parametric functions. The integrability of nonlinear equation discloses various characteristics of real phenomenon with continuous and fluctuating background. This work aims to generate symmetry reductions and exact solutions of KdV-mKdV equation, which is a completely integrable system of nonlinear equations and describes combined solitary wave effects in inhomogeneous medium. The infinitesimal generators and their commutative relations are deduced under invariance property of Lie groups. The invariance property provides a symmetry reduction of governing system. Therefore, a continuous process of reductions transmutes the KdV-mKdV equation to an equivalent system of ODEs. This system of ODEs leads to the exact solutions involving several arbitrary constants and functions. Such obtained results are generalized than earlier works and never reported in literature. Furthermore, adjoint equation and conserved quantities associated with Lagrangian formulation are constructed under Lie symmetries. To reveal the significance of governing phenomenon, the exact solutions are traced via numerical simulation and thus the graphical structures demonstrate line multisoliton, single soliton, lumps, parabolic and stationary wave profiles.},

  abstract     = {Studying Arctic ice formation stays in the focus of research groups over the past decades in the context of ice cover changes, thermal budget and climate agenda in general. Nevertheless, the phenomenon&#39;s underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood and described. The main reason for the lack in understanding is the limited experimental access to the field data when it comes to the processes that occur below the ice floe. Thus, there is a need to build competent analogies between the natural (ocean water–ice) and laboratory (here: binary alloy) conditions of the experiment as a step of data preparation for the verification of the mathematical model. In the current paper, the existing qualitative models describing the process of melting and crystallization were expanded and the experimental method was developed copying the layering of the natural ocean water–ice mixture. The experimental set-up for studying the solidification within the intermediate zone was designed for Al–Cu alloys being the system with appropriate solidus line for creating a sufficient concentration gradient and by that temperature dependent phase fraction under isothermal conditions. The gained experimental data were used for validating a binary phase-field model for solidification considering moving boundaries. The model includes the description of the free energy of both phases and their respective diffusion coefficients. It allows modeling a binary system at a mesoscopic spatial level by including the concentration-driven phase transition and resolidification in the two-phase region. The novel results will help the quantitative understanding of solidification phenomena and are highly-evaluated from interdisciplinary point of view, including glaciology and geosciences, being ultimately significant for the understanding the global climate change landscape.},

This equation determines the evolution of the interface function and the equation for crystallization driving force - the melt undercooling at the crystal surface. Our calculations carried out for a dendritic vertex in the form of a paraboloid of revolution have shown that the growth rate of the dendritic tip and its diameter substantially depend on the nonlinear effects under study. In particular, the velocity and diameter of the dendrite tip respectively become greater and narrower with increasing deviation of the liquidus equation from the linear relationship. Also, the dendrite tip velocity can be significantly affected by variations in the exponent of atomic kinetics.},

The framework of the flow is divided into two regions, in which the non-Newtonian characteristics of the couple stress fluid are governed by classical Stokes equations and the permeable region is governed by Darcy&#39;s law. The asymptotic series expansion involves the stream functions in terms of modified Bessel&#39;s function and Gagenbauer&#39;s polynomials for the inner and outer regions. The graphical analysis demonstrating the superior outcomes of numerous parameters such as the couple stress parameter, the permeability parameter, and the couple stress viscosity ratio on the drag coefficient is conducted, and the outcomes are discussed comprehensively. The present study discovered that the drag of a semipermeable sphere is greater than that of a couple stress fluid sphere. A continuous reduction in the pressure distribution is observed with the rising value of the couple stress parameter. However, an increasing value of the couple stress parameter in the semipermeable medium contributes to increasing the tangential stress with respect to the distance from the surface. The current study&#39;s findings could be useful in analyzing significant clinical and industrial applications such as the filtration process for wastewater treatment, the design of the digestive system, fluid–solid disperse systems, and the petroleum industry. However, experimental verification is required for the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by an important geophysical application, we analyze the nonlinear dynamics of the number of earthquakes per unit time in a given Earth&#39;s surface area. At first, we consider a dynamical model of earthquakes describing their rhythmic behavior with time delays. This model comprises different earthquake scenarios divided into three types (A, B, and C) accordingly to various system dynamics. We show that the deterministic system contains stable equilibria and a limit cycle whose size drastically depends on the production rate α $$ \alpha $$ of earthquakes and their time delay effect. As this takes place, the frequency of earthquakes possesses an oscillatory behavior dependent on α $$ \alpha $$ . To study the role of α $$ \alpha $$ in more detail, we have introduced a white Gaussian noise in the governing equation. First of all, we have shown that the dynamical system is stochastically excitable, that is, it excites larger-amplitude noise-induced fluctuations in the frequency of earthquakes. In addition, these large-amplitude stochastic fluctuations can alternate with small-amplitude fluctuations over time. In other words, the frequency of earthquakes can change its amplitude in an irregular manner under the influence of white noise. Another important effect is how close the current value of is to its bifurcation point. The closer this value is, the less noise generates large-amplitude fluctuations in the earthquake frequency.},

An exact analytical solution to this integrodifferential equation is found in a parametric form. This solution behaves as a decaying exponent with respect to the particle volume (fluorescence intensity in the case of coagulation of endosomes). We demonstrate that our exact solution substantially depends on coagulation kernels (fusion and fission rates) as well as the influx and outflux processes of cargo.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the exact delay range making input-delay systems unstabilizable. The exact range means that the systems are unstabilizable if and only if the delay is within this range. Contributions of this paper are to characterize the exact range and to present a computation method to derive this range. It is shown that the above range is related to unstable eigenvalues of the system matrix. In the discrete-time case, if none of the eigenvalues of the system matrix is a unit root, then the above range is a finite set. If there exist some eigenvalues which are unit roots, this range may be a finite set or may be composed of several arithmetic progressions. When this range contains finite elements, the number of these elements is bounded by the geometric multiplicities of eigenvalues. When this range contains arithmetic progressions, the number of such progressions is bounded by the above multiplicities. On the other hand, our results can provide an upper bound for the well-known delay margin, which is the maximal delay value achievable by a robust controller to stabilize systems.},

We find that both the uninfected and immune-free equilibria are globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions which are not affected by time delay. However, the time delay makes one immune equilibrium always unstable for τ ≥ 0 $$ \tau \ge 0 $$ and also makes another immune equilibrium appear stability switches; meanwhile, the system will exhibit local Hopf bifurcation, global Hopf bifurcation, and saddle-node-Hopf bifurcation.

The sufficient conditions to achieve MPS of unified chaotic system have derived. The mechanics of unified chaotic system have been examined in contrast with Kolmogorov system, Euler equation, and Hamiltonian function. The Casimir energy function is also introduced to analyze the system dynamics. The unified chaotic system has been transformed into Kolmogorov type system and decomposed into four types of torques: inertial, internal, dissipation, and external torque. In order to view the mechanics behind the unified chaotic system, different particular cases have been discussed. Five scenarios are examined using combinations of various torques in order to identify the key elements in chaos creation and their physical significance. The bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent and Lyapunov dimension validates the generation of chaos for different particular cases.},

The performance of the method is also observed against other methods performing well in these types of differential equations and is found to be comparable in terms of accuracy.

  abstract     = {The prediction of the evolution of epidemics plays an important role in limiting the transmissibility and the burdensome consequences of infectious diseases, which leads to the employment of mathematical modeling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic particle filtering extended SEIRS model with repeated vaccination and time-dependent parameters, aiming to efficiently describe the demanding dynamics of time-varying epidemics. The validity of our model is examined using daily records of COVID-19 in Italy for a period of 525 days, revealing a notable capacity to uncover the hidden dynamics of the pandemic. The main findings include the estimation of asymptomatic cases, which is a well-known feature of the current pandemic. Unlike other proposed models that employ extra compartments for asymptomatic cases, which force the estimation of this proportion and significantly increase the model&#39;s complexity, our approach leads to the evaluation of the hidden dynamics of COVID-19 without additional computational burden. Other findings that confirm the model&#39;s appropriateness and robustness are its parameter evolution and the estimation of more ICU-admitted cases compared to the official records during the most prevalent infection wave of January 2022, attributed to the intensified increase in admissions that may have led to full occupancy in ICUs. As the vast majority of datasets contain time series of total recovered and vaccinated cases, we propose a statistical algorithm to estimate the currently recovered and protected through vaccination cases. This necessity arises from the attenuation of antibodies after vaccination/infection and is necessary for long-time interval predictions. Finally, we not only present a novel stochastic epidemiological model and test its efficiency but also investigate its mathematical properties, such as the existence and stability of epidemic equilibria, giving new insights to the literature. The latter provides additional details concerning the system&#39;s long-term behavior, while the conclusions drawn from the index provide perspectives on the severity and future of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

As a result, we extend, generalize, and unify various fixed-point conclusions for a single-valued map and come up with examples to exhibit the theoretical conclusions. Further, we solve a mathematical model of the spread of specific infectious diseases as an application of one of the conclusions. In the sequel, we explain the significance of 𝒷 𝓋 M v b $$ {\mathcal{M}}_{\mathcal{v}}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\mathcal{b}} $$ -metric space because the underlying map is not necessarily continuous even at a fixed point in 𝒷 𝓋 M v b $$ {\mathcal{M}}_{\mathcal{v}}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\mathcal{b}} $$ -metric space thereby adding a new answer to the question concerning continuity at a fixed point posed by Rhoades.

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to analyzing a kind of fractional stochastic neutral system (FSNS). Firstly, by introducing the notion of newly defined two-parameter Mittag–Leffler matrix function, we derive the solution of the corresponding linear stochastic system. Subsequently, for the linear case, by virtue of the Grammian matrix, we give a suffcient and necessary condition to guarantee the relatively exact controllability for the addressed case. Furthermore, for the nonlinear one, the relatively exact controllability is obtained by fixed point and explore it via Banach contraction principle. Finally, two examples are provided to intensify our theoretical conclusions.},

Our innovation offers a novel approach to accelerate the convergence rate of the Kaczmarz algorithm significantly. Based on greedy rules for selecting work row, we prove that the Kaczmarz method with momentum can achieve global linear convergence rates. Furthermore, we extend a constrained version of the Kaczmarz algorithm with Nesterov momentum for improved image reconstruction and prove its convergence.

In order to overcome the limitations of the ℓ 1 $$ {\ell}_1 $$ penalty, we design an effective and new randomized sparse Kaczmarz algorithm (RSK-MCP) based on the non-convex minimax-concave penalty (MCP) in sparse signal reconstruction. Additionally, we prove that the RSK-MCP algorithm is equivalent to the randomized coordinate descent method for the corresponding dual problem. Based on this result, we demonstrate that the RSK-MCP algorithm exhibits linear convergence, meaning it converges to a sparse solution of the MCP model when the regularization of MCP is a strongly convex function. Numerical experiments indicate that the RSK-MCP algorithm outperforms RSK-L1 in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {All biological forms of life rely on plants for many of their basic needs. Nonetheless, viruses can often infect plants. The ecosystem that depends on it could be destroyed as a result. An insect vector may be responsible for the virus&#39;s spread from plant to plant. A fractional order epidemic model is developed since it gives the more realistic solutions as the epidemics always persists in some or the other region and never becomes zero. The dynamics of the plant virus propagation model with effect from seasonality (PVP-S) and intraspecific competition among predators are investigated in terms of existence of solutions, boundedness, and uniqueness. Analysis of plant virus propagation with effect from seasonality and intraspecific competition among predators in terms of fractional order is the novelty of this model. Here, we observe that the infection almost becomes zero in case of integral value, whereas it always persists as the fractional order is introduced, which is more realistic in nature. The occurrence of transcritical bifurcation for the model has been investigated. The proposed nonlinear model is numerically studied by the Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method. This study reveals the effectiveness of the numerical technique as well as the effect of the fractional order derivative on PVP-S dynamics.},

We study the dynamical behavior of this model and define the basic reproductive number, R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ . It is proved that the disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable if R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ , and it is unstable if R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ . Also, we investigate the existence and stability of the endemic equilibrium point analytically. For the system of differential equations of the SHIRV model, we give an approximating solution by using the Legendre-Ritz-Galerkin method. Finally, we study the influence of vaccination on measles and smallpox, two cases of the epidemic, using the proposed method in this paper. Numerical results showed that choosing high-risk people for vaccination can prevent them from getting infected and reduce mortality in the community.},

The study explored the existence and uniqueness of solutions and established the presence of a global solution. The investigation focused on assessing the boundedness, extinction, and persistence of MRSA strains in terms of their means. The analysis of the model revealed a noteworthy phenomenon known as competitive exclusion, where the community-acquired MRSA strain gradually out-competes the hospital-acquired strain within hospital settings. In conclusion, effective interventions and preventive measures, such as improving hand hygiene compliance, implementing decolonization strategies, and enhancing disinfection rates, emerge as critical factors in controlling the transmission of these strains within hospital environments.},

The uniqueness results of the interaction problem are established for small frequencies or all frequencies except a discrete set in both the absorbing and nonabsorbing medium, and then the existence of solutions is derived by the classical Fredholm alternative. The perfectly matched layer (PML) method is proposed to truncate the unbounded scattering domain to a bounded computational domain. We prove the well-posedness of the solution for the truncated PML problem, where a homogeneous boundary condition is imposed on the outer boundary of the PML. The exponential convergence of the PML method is established in terms of the thickness and parameters of the PML. The proof is based on the PML extension and the exponential decay properties of the modified fundamental solution.},

Therefore, we consider the following methods to overcome this difficulty. For the merged fully NPDEs and 2BSDEs system, combined with the time forward discretization and ReLU function, we use multiscale deep learning fusion and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to obtain two numerical approximation schemes, respectively. Finally, three practical high-dimensional test problems involving Allen–Cahn, Black–Scholes–Barenblatt, and Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations are given so that the first proposed method exhibits higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing method, while the second proposed method can extend the dimensionality of the completely NPDEs–2BSDEs system over 400 dimensions, from which the numerical results highlight the effectiveness of proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of modeling biological systems with memory, particularly those involving intricate interactions like tumor-immune responses, the utilization of multiple time delays and Caputo-type fractional-order derivatives represents a cutting-edge approach. In this research paper, we introduce a novel fractional-order model to investigate the dynamic interplay between tumors and macrophages, a key component of the immune system, while incorporating multiple time delays into our framework. Our proposed model comprises a system of three Caputo-type fractional-order differential equations, each representing distinct cell populations: tumor cells, anti-tumor cells (specifically M 1 $$ {M}_1 $$ -type macrophages with pro-inflammatory properties), and pro-tumor cells ( -type macrophages with immune-suppressive characteristics). The stability of equilibria is discussed by analyzing the characteristic equations for each case, and the existence conditions for the Hopf bifurcation are obtained according to the critical values of delay parameters. Furthermore, numerical simulations are presented in order to verify the analytical results obtained for stability and Hopf-bifurcation with respect to the two-time delay parameters and . The analysis shows the rich dynamics of the model according to the fractional-order parameter and the time delay parameters.},

Moreover, we give a priori estimates and obtain the existence of the positive constant steady state by applying the comparison theorem. Sufficient conditions for the global stability are established by Barbǎlat lemma and the Lyapunov function.

Matrix decomposition is of great concern in the theoretical study and numerical calculation of commutative quaternion. Two kinds of disadvantages of commutative quaternion make the decomposition of commutative quaternion matrix extremely difficult. On one hand, commutative quaternion is not a kind of complete four dimensional division algebra because of the zero divisors. On the other hand, computing the inverse of commutative quaternion is very complicated. In this paper, the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices will be used to overcome the above two kinds of shortcomings. And we will propose a real structure-preserving algorithm based on STP of matrices for commutative quaternion LU decomposition, which makes full use of high-level operations, relation of operations between commutative quaternion matrices and their -representation matrices. Numerical experiments will be provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the real structure-preserving algorithm based on STP of matrices.

Employing a Beverton–Holt type functional response to capture the impact of additional food sources on predator growth, our numerical findings affirm the destabilizing influence of hunting cooperation, excessive predation, and supplementary food sources. Conversely, the system demonstrates stabilization in response to increased prey species growth. We unveil the occurrence of both forward and backward bifurcations in the system due to the predator growth attributed to additional food sources, contingent on the degree of hunting cooperation. To broaden the scope, we extend our proposed model to its stochastic counterpart, introducing environmental white noises. Our numerical results anticipate that higher intensities of white noises lead to fluctuations of greater amplitude, while smaller intensities exhibit a more modest impact. Additionally, we elucidate the dynamics of prey and predator populations through histogram plots. The theoretical and numerical insights derived from this study provide a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics within predator–prey systems of ecological communities, emphasizing the significance of additional food sources for cooperative predators subject to harvesting in both constant and fluctuating environments.},

Three generators for the Lie algebra are obtained, and three reductions are explored by combining vector generators. These algebraic structures provide a powerful framework for simplifying complex mathematical and physical problems by revealing underlying symmetries and patterns. The graphical representations of obtained solutions are rendered. Besides, the influence of parameters within the equation on the behavior of the solutions has been demonstrated in the figures.

  abstract     = {The human inclination to value rarity contributes to the exploitation of many wildlife species by driving up their market value when their numbers are scarce. This research investigates a model to explore how the value attached to rarity impacts the harvesting of predator species and subsequently influences the dynamics of predator–prey interactions in an ecological system. To broaden the model&#39;s scope, it&#39;s extended to its nonautonomous form by allowing the harvesting rate of predator species and the degree of neutrality in consumers to respond for the rarity of predator species to change over time. Both the autonomous and nonautonomous systems are explored through analytical and numerical investigation. Numerical findings reveal that as the prey population&#39;s growth rate gradually increases, the unforced system shifts from stable boundary equilibrium (harvesting absent) to stable interior equilibrium, then to oscillatory interior equilibrium, followed by period doubling oscillations leading to chaotic behavior. The autonomous system exhibits limit cycle oscillations around the boundary equilibrium when predator species are minimally harvested. Moderate harvesting stabilizes the system, while excessive harvesting induces instability. However, the chaotic oscillations can be eliminated through period-halving route upon decreasing the consumers&#39; response to predator rarity. Furthermore, the seasonally forced model demonstrates periodic solutions, higher order periodic solutions, and chaotic dynamics contingent upon different settings of prey growth rate, the strength of seasonality in predator harvesting, and the consumers&#39; response to predator rarity.},

For this purpose, we apply Cartan&#39;s theorem and use reflections as basic isometries, which allows the use of Clifford algebra as a powerful tool to handle reflections and products of reflections, leading to explicit expressions for coincidence indices and the basis of coincidence lattices. The three possible cases were studied: simple reflections, the product of two reflections (rotations), and the product of three reflections, where a factorization that produces improper rotations was provided. In the case of rotations, it is formally proven that Ranganathan&#39;s well-known generating function of coincidence indices for cubic systems under rotations yields all possible coincidence lattices. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mathematical properties of coincidence site lattices and the use of Clifford algebras to describe orthogonal transformations.},

Our innovative coupled ODE-PDE model offers explicit invasion simulations, a significant leap beyond traditional integro-difference matrix models. With robust theoretical properties, including solution positivity, and drawing upon PDE theory, our model offers deeper insights into invasion behavior. Our model reveals that invasions undergo a prolonged quiescent phase before rapidly transitioning to a consistent rate of advancement after a critical point. This study not only sheds light on invasion dynamics but also charts a course for future exploration and potential model extensions.},

First, the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution are built. Then, the long-term behaviors of the prey and predator populations are obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stochastic ultimate boundedness of all species and the ergodic stationary distribution without Lévy jump. Finally, numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a study of the coupled Schrödinger Maxwell-Bloch equations, which described the propagation of two optical pulses in an optical medium with coherent three-level atoms, is presented via the Riemann-Hilbert approach. First, we performed a spectral analysis on the basis of Lax pair with the negative flow, and then the Jost function, scattering matrix, and their analytic and symmetric properties are given. Second, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is established successfully through a standard dressing procedure via the Riemann-Hilbert approach, and then the potential function related to the solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is reconstructed. By introducing the special matrix functions, we can transform the irregular Riemann-Hilbert problem into the regular one, which can be solved by the Plemelj formula. Finally, some applications are given to solve the Riemann-Hilbert problem without reflection for the coupled Schrödinger Maxwell-Bloch equation, and the multi-soliton solutions are obtained explicitly. Moreover, the dynamic behaviors of some soliton solutions are discussed graphically by choosing appropriate parameters.},

One particular application involves describing moisture transfer dynamics in subsoil layers using pseudo-parabolic equations. This manuscript examines the inverse problem (IP) of identifying the moisture transfer function, along with the time-varying potential and source control terms, in a linear pseudo-parabolic equation from known moisture moments. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the inverse problem for sufficiently small times by employing the contraction principle. The inverse problem is reformulated as a nonlinear least-squares minimization problem, with the unknowns subjected to simple bounds. To guarantee stability, the Tikhonov regularization technique is utilized. For the numerical discretization, we develop the Crank–Nicolson finite-difference method to solve the direct problem. To solve the nonlinear least-squares minimization problem, we utilize the built-in subroutine lsqnonlin from the MATLAB optimization toolbox. We present and thoroughly discuss numerical outcomes for a benchmark test example, providing insights into the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Memory-based root-seeking algorithms may look back to expedite convergence and enhance computational efficiency. Real-time systems, complicated simulations, and high-performance computing demand frequent, large-scale calculations. This article proposes two unique root-finding methods that increase the convergence order of the classical Newton–Raphson (NR) approach without increasing evaluation time. Taylor&#39;s expansion uses the classical Halley method to create two memory-based methods with an order of 2.4142 and an efficiency index of 1.5538. We designed a two-step memory-based method with the help of Secant and NR algorithms using a backward difference quotient. We demonstrate memory-based approaches&#39; robustness and stability using visual analysis via polynomiography. Local and semilocal convergence are thoroughly examined. Finally, proposed memory-based approaches outperform several existing memory-based methods when applied to models including a thermistor, path traversed by an electron, sheet-pile wall, adiabatic flame temperature, and blood rheology nonlinear equation.},

The present study introduces a new model that demonstrates the novelty of the paper and provides the advancement of knowledge in the area of nonlinear optics by solving a challenging problem known as the extended ( 3 + 1 ) $$ \left(3&amp;amp;amp;#x0002B;1\right) $$ -dimensional nonlinear conformable Kudryashov&#39;s equation (CKE) with generalized anti-cubic nonlinearity, which is a generalization of the NLSE to three spatial dimension and one temporal dimension for the first time. This work is significant because it advances our understanding of nonlinear optics and its applications to solve complex equations in physics and related disciplines. The extended hyperbolic function method (EHFM) and Nucci&#39;s reduction method are applied to the extended -dimensional nonlinear CKE with generalized anti-cubic nonlinearity. The equation is solved by using the concept of conformable derivative, a recently developed operator in fractional calculus, which has advantages over other fractional derivatives in terms of accuracy and flexibility. The attained solutions include periodic singular, dark 1-soliton, singular 1-soliton, and bright 1-soliton which are visualized using 3D and contour plots. This study highlights the potential of using conformable derivative and the applied techniques to solve complex nonlinear differential equations in various fields. The obtained solutions and analysis will be useful in the design and analysis of optical communication systems and other related fields. Overall, this study contributes for the understanding of the dynamics of the extended -dimensional nonlinear CKE and offers new insights into the use of mathematical techniques to tackle complex problems in physics and related fields.},

First of all, it was considered the initial boundary value problem. By the Fourier method, this problem is reduced to equivalent integral equations. Then, using the Mittag-Leffler function and the generalized singular Gronwall inequality, we get a priori estimate for solution via unknown coefficient which we will need to study of the inverse problem.

In addition, the behavior of solutions at initial time is analyzed with respect to the final data.

We investigate the existence of a mild solution for the Atangana–Baleanu Caputo fractional neutral-type delay integrodifferential stochastic system while taking into account the non-instantaneous impulses. For this purpose, the Atangana–Baleanu Caputo fractional neutral-type impulsive delay stochastic system is transferred into an equivalent fixed point problem via an integral operator, and then, the Bohnenblust–Karlin fixed point approach is applied. Further, the approximate controllability results of the proposed nonlinear stochastic impulsive control system are established under the consideration that the corresponding linear system is approximately controllable. The set of sufficient conditions is established by using the concepts of stochastic analysis, fractional calculus, fixed point technique, semigroup theory of bounded linear operators, and the theory of multivalued maps. To illustrate the abstract results, we provide an example at the end of the paper.},

For the next main goals, we are going not only to prove the global well-posedness property of small data solutions but also to indicate blow-up results for solutions to the semilinear problem. In this concern, the novelty which should be recognized is that the application of a modified test function combined with a judicious choice of test functions gives blow-up phenomena and upper bound estimates for lifespan in both the subcritical case and the critical case, where is assumed to be any fractional number. Finally, lower bound estimates for lifespan in some spatial dimensions are also established to find out their sharp results.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses design of an adaptive controller for nonlinear fractional-order (FO) systems in the strict-feedback form. The system is subject to unknown dynamics, unavailable state variables, quantized input and output, and input nonlinearity. The fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to estimate the unknown dynamics, and instead of updating all the regressor weights, only the maximum of their norms is updated, which significantly reduces the computational load. Limitations imposed by data transmission bandwidth have been addressed by incorporating sector-bounded quantizers, which include both logarithmic and hysteresis quantizers at the system input and output, and their errors have been considered in the controller design. It is assumed that system states are not measured. To estimate the system states, a linear observer has been used. Because of output quantization, the continuous output signal is not available, and therefore the observer has been designed based on the quantized output signal. In addition, the constraints of input nonlinearities, including symmetric and asymmetric saturation, backlash, hysteresis, and dead-zone, have been considered in the controller design. Input nonlinearity and input quantization have been investigated simultaneously, which makes the analysis more challenging. Moreover, it is assumed that the type of input nonlinearity and its characteristics are not known, which makes the controller design more difficult. These problems have been resolved by using two novel adaptive laws. The adaptive backstepping method and the direct Lyapunov stability analysis have been used to construct the controller, and a nonlinear modified FO filter is used to avoid the explosion of complexity occurring in the traditional backstepping technique. Stability of the closed loop system has been established, and it has been shown that the tracking and state estimation errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the proposed controller performance has been demonstrated via three simulation examples.},

We prove the nonnegativity, boundedness, and stability of equilibrium points and finally find the release threshold, denoted as r 1 ∗ $$ {r}_1&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\ast } $$ and k 1 ∗ $$ {k}_1&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\ast } $$ , for the successful suppression in these two release strategies. In addition, we demonstrate that the model that adopts the constant release strategy, respectively, has a saddle node bifurcation when and a stable period-doubling bifurcation when . While in the case of proportional release strategy, the model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation when and a stable period-doubling bifurcation when . Finally, we substantiate the conclusions through numerical simulations.},

The difficulty of the problem is that the control end is noncollocated with the regulated output. The so-called feedforward control is designed by introducing an regulator, which is determined by infinite-dimensional equation. A state observer is proposed based on the measurement output to recover the original and the external systems. The suitable feedback control has to be integrated by replacing the states in the expression of feedforward control law. As a result, exponential convergence of the error between the reference signal and the output, and the closed-loop stability are established.

Optical soliton generation in nonlinear optical fibers is a topic of great contemporary interest because of the numerous applications of ultrafast signal routing systems and short light pulses in communications. This analysis&#39;s main goal is to create a large number of soliton solutions for the dynamical model using a variety of contemporary analytical methods. This paper studies different soliton solutions to the perturbed NLSE with Kerr law nonlinearity using two sets of two distinct integration strategies: the mapping approach and the unified auxiliary equation method. The majority of solutions have been found as Jacobi elliptic functions with limiting ellipticity modulus values. Solitons like dark, bright, optical, lonely, and others are also retrieved. We were able to create various single-type solutions with the help of these strategies. As a result, there is a variety of optical, bell-shaped, single periodic, and multi-periodic solutions. In order to validate the computations, the stability of the acquired findings must also be proven. The study provides a highly stunning and suitable strategy for combining numerous exciting wave demonstrations for more advanced models of the present era. Furthermore, we can assert that the outcomes reported here are unique and novel.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the approximate controllability, under positivity constraints on the control and state, of a size-structured population system with time-delayed behavior. In this model, the birth term is non-local in size and time, which describes the time-delay in the recruitment process in newborn individuals population. Our control function is localized at birth and corresponds to a supply of newborn individuals. First, we establish the well-posedness and positivity property of the model. Second, and more importantly, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate controllability under positivity constraints. The method relies on the feedback theory of infinite-dimensional positive systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a free boundary model of tumor growth with drug application including the heterogeneity or different types of tumor cells (caused by mutations and different values of drug and nutrient concentrations inside the tumor) is studied. Heterogeneity is included in the model by a variable − 1 ≤ y ≤ 1 $$ -1\le y\le 1 $$ . It is assumed that converting from mutation y 1 $$ {y}_1 $$ to mutation y 2 $$ {y}_2 $$ happens with probability P ⁡ ( y 1 , y 2 ) $$ P\left({y}_1,{y}_2\right) $$ . A Caputo time fractional-order hyperbolic equation describes the evolution of tumor cells depending on y $$ y $$ . It also includes two Caputo time fractional-order parabolic equations describing the diffusions of nutrients (e.g., oxygen and glucose) and drug concentrations. Instead of integer-order time derivatives, the fractional ones are considered. In this study, it is aimed to employ the least squares curve fitting method to fit the order of fractional derivatives, coefficient, and rates of the model. For this purpose, using the mathematical model, we have considered the boundary densities of the tumor cells of different types and near-boundary concentrations of drug and nutrient as the functions of the unknown orders, coefficients and rates (unknown variables). Due to the complexity of the problem, we have obtained the functions numerically. For this, using a change of variable, we have changed the free boundary problem to a problem with fixed domain. Thus, Riemann–Liouville fractional-order integrals are added to the problem. In the spatial domain, the problem is discretized using the collocation method. In the temporal domain, the fractional derivatives and integrals (with order ) are approximated in mesh points (with step size ) applying a method with error . Then, the unknown variables are obtained by fitting the functions for unknown variables to the data. In order to obtain the variables, a quadratic objective function is considered. The discretized function is substituted into the objective function, then the objective function is minimized using the trust-region reflective algorithm. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to verify the efficiency of the method. In the examples, we have added noises generated from Gaussian distributions to the data and the effects of noise on the fitted coefficients, and rates are illustrated using some figures and tables. The noisy data are also plotted to have a clear vision of the effects of noises on the data. It is shown that despite the noise, the prediction of the radius of the tumor is acceptable.},

To construct this method, the operational matrices of fractional and stochastic integrals of these basis functions are obtained and used in the established method. By approximating the solution of the problem with a finite expansion of the expressed basis functions (in which the expansion coefficients are unknown), a system of algebraic equations is obtained. By solving this system, the expansion coefficients and subsequently the solution of the original stochastic fractional problem are obtained. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is investigated, theoretically and numerically. The accuracy of the established procedure is illustrated by solving several numerical examples.},

It is shown that the variation of the characteristic coefficients that describe the coupling of the various mechanical effects involved in the model in concern does not destroy its structure. This means that any small variation of these coefficients leads to small variations in the corresponding solutions of the associated initial boundary value problems. For this purpose, more mathematical estimates are presented describing precisely the continuous dependence of the solutions with respect to all external given data of the initial boundary value problem, as well as with respect to appropriate measures of the set of coupling parameters. This allows the conclusion that the model of the mixture of porous materials is consistent. In particular, it is believed that the estimates obtained in terms of structural stability are particularly meaningful with regard to the materials used in building contexts and the related decay phenomena.},

  abstract     = {To be a quantitative and testable tectonic model, plate tectonics requires spherical geometry and spherical kinematics in terms of finite rotations conveniently parametrized by their angle and axis and described by unit quaternions. In treatises on “Plate Tectonics” infinitesimal, instantaneous, and finite rotations, absolute and relative rotations are said to be applied to model the motion of tectonic plates. Even though these terms are strictly defined in mathematics, they are often casually used in geosciences. Here, their definitions are recalled and clarified as well as the terms rotation, orientation, and location on the sphere. For instance, infinitesimal rotations refer to a mathematical limit, when the angle of rotation tends to zero. Their rules do not apply to finite rotations, no matter how small their finite angles of rotation are. Mathematical approaches applying appropriate and feasible assumptions to model spherical motion of tectonic plates over geological times of hundreds of millions of years are derived including (i) sequences of incremental finite rotations, (ii) sequences of accumulating successive concatenations of finite rotations, and (iii) continuous rotations in terms of fully transient quaternions. The incremental and the accumulating approaches provide complementary views. While the relative Euler pole appears to migrate in the latter, it appears fixed in the former. Path, mean, and instantaneous velocity of the migrating Euler pole are derived as well as the angular and trajectoral velocity of the rotational motion about it. The approaches are illustrated by a geological example with actual data and a numerical yet geologically inspired example with artificial data. The former revisits the three-plate scenario with stationary axes of two “absolute” rotations implying transient “relative” rotations about a migrating Euler pole and employs a proper plate-circuit argument to determine them numerically without resorting to approximations. The latter applies an involved interplay of incremental and accumulating modeling inducing split–join cycles to approximate sinusoidal trajectories as reported to record plates&#39; motion during the Gondwana breakup.},

To this end, we introduce a new mathematical concept of biosystem stability, where we take into account a signal transduction by deep gene networks. Using this concept and known results on approximations by deep networks, we find asymptotic estimates of the size and the depth of gene regulation networks that define the stress response. We propose a new algorithm to find the gene network approximating a prescribed output. It allows us, with the help of Kolmogorov -entropy and the deep neural network theory, to estimate the number of genes involved in regulation of responses on a stress (for example, a heat shock). We show that the main factors that increase the sensitivity of the systems with respect to a stress are the number of biochemical network parameters affected by the stress and sensitivities of kinetic rates with respect to these parameters.},

We take the complete discrimination system for polynomial method and the trial equation method to implement qualitative and quantitative studies for the equation. We verify that the Hamiltonian of the dynamic system is conserved and apply the complete discrimination system of polynomial method to give the associated global phase diagrams, which are qualitatively analyzed to illustrate the presence of periodic solutions and solitons. In addition, we gain a classification of all single traveling wave solutions, provide optical wave patterns with specific parameters and validate the above findings.},

The importance of using ANN in popular and large-scale fields such as environmental pollution studies is known. Studies are carried out considering the need to develop ANNs, which can be an alternative to the data obtained as a result of the analyses made with instrumental devices that require high costs and trained human labor. This study, which was carried out using real data and samples showing biomonitoring properties such as soil and plants, is an example to fill the gaps in the literature. In this study, tools that can model both linear and nonlinear relationships were used. The simulation of the dynamic ecological system containing Fe, Mn, and Ni heavy metals was carried out from the point of view of artificial intelligence. It is revealed that ANN systems are supportive methods in studies of determining environmental pollution, especially in biomonitoring studies.},

The model is used to analyze influenza data from 2016 to 2017 in China. By comparing various prevention and control measures, it can be found that by wearing masks to reduce contact between different age groups, while increasing vaccine coverage and reducing vaccine failure rates, the prevention and control goals can be achieved in the shortest time. However, if only the vaccine coverage rate is increased and the vaccine protection rate is strengthened, the time to reach the control target is 8 months later than the above case, and the cost is the lowest.},

Based on the singular point condition that the normal vector of the enveloping surface is zero, the equation of the curvature interference limit line is obtained. By employing the resultant elimination method and the geometric construction, the existence of the solutions of the curvature interference limit line is determined, and the reasonable initial values for the iteration program are afforded. The numerical outcomes show that there is one meaningful curvature interference limit line on each flank of single tooth of the worm gear, which usually does not enter the worm gear tooth surface. Both flanks of the worm gear are all settled in the side of the limit line, the curvature interference does not happen on the worm gear tooth surface.

The conservation laws describe generalized momentum and boost momentum, conformal momentum, generalized energy, dilational energy, and light cone energies. Both the conformal momentum and dilational energy have no counterparts for nonlinear undamped wave equations in one dimension. All of the conservation laws are obtainable through Noether&#39;s theorem, which is applicable because the damping term can be transformed into a time-dependent self-interaction term by a change of dependent variable. For several of the conservation laws, the corresponding variational symmetries have a novel form which is different than any of the well-known variational symmetries admitted by nonlinear undamped wave equations in one dimension.},

The importance of the weighted integral modulus of symmetric smoothness lies in its ability to capture the local behavior of a function. So we obtain the results in terms of the weighted integral modulus of symmetric smoothness. In addition, we introduce the concept of the weighted Lipschitz and Zygmund classes as an extension of the existing Lipschitz classes L ⁢ i ⁢ p ⁡ ( α , β ) $$ Lip\left(\alpha, \beta \right) $$ and L ⁢ i ⁢ p ⁡ ( α , β ; p ) $$ Lip\left(\alpha, \beta; p\right) $$ and Zygmund classes Z ⁡ ( α , β ) $$ Z\left(\alpha, \beta \right) $$ and Z ⁡ ( α , β ; p ) $$ Z\left(\alpha, \beta; p\right) $$ , respectively. These weighted classes allow us a more detailed analysis of the approximation rates of functions by assigning the weights to different regions of the domain of function. Further, we prove two theorems about the degree (error) of approximation of functions belonging to these classes using double matrix means. We also discuss some corollaries from our results.},

  abstract     = {In the present research, an analytical solution is presented for unsteady heat transfer in a two-dimensional finite cylinder made of functionally graded Materials (FGM). The governing equation, as an unsteady partial differential equation (PDE), is solved with general boundary conditions (BCs). The thermal conductivity coefficients are considered as a power function of the radius, both in the longitudinal and radial directions of the FGM cylinder. The presence of non-constant coefficients and general BCs will confront us with the challenge of solving an unsteady problem with high complexity. A combination of Laplace transform, Fourier transform, and meromorphic functions are utilized to deal with this complex PDE. The Laplace transform was applied to transform to the frequency domain, the Sturm–Liouville equation was used to extract the orthogonal basis Fourier series, and the meromorphic function was deployed to transform back from the frequency domain to the time domain. Results were well verified against previous research works. Results showed that the proposed analytical solution could well predict the temperature distribution. The current analytical solution is useful to better understand unsteady heat transfer in FGMs.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we extend previous research on exponential integrators for stiff semilinear delay differential equations to the nonlinear case. In addition to the stiffness, there are two new issues that should be handled properly: nonlinear term and delay term. For nonlinear problems, a badly chosen linearization can cause a severe step size restriction. In this work, we linearize the equation along the numerical solution in each step. For the delay term, the interpolation based on the numerical values at the mesh points rather than inner stage values is adopted to significantly reduce the number of stiff order conditions. We focus on the construction and convergence analysis of high-order exponential Rosenbrock methods for nonlinear stiff delay differential equations. The main result of this paper is that under the framework of strongly continuous semigroup, the explicit exponential Rosenbrock method is proved to be stiffly convergent of order even if the order conditions of order hold in a weak form. Moreover, by pointing that there does not exist fifth-order method with less than or equal to four stages, we present the construction of a fifth-order method with five stages. Finally, numerical tests are carried out to validate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the superiority of high-order methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the problem of indefinite stochastic linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control by piecewise constant controls in an infinite horizon case. By restricting the set of admissible controls to the class of piecewise constant stochastic processes, we reformulated the above control problem under the setting of systems modeled by Itô differential equations controlled by impulses. We show that the solution in a state feedback form of the indefinite stochastic LQ control problem is equivalent to the existence of a global stabilizing solution associated to a class of backward matrix linear differential equations with a Riccati type jumping operators.},

  abstract     = {Some e-platforms such as Amazon and JD.com are increasingly active in financing business, but theoretical research on this business is not comprehensive enough. This paper uses game theory model to compare the equilibrium of e-platform financing (EPF) and bank financing (BF) in terms of pricing, quality, suppliers&#39; competition, participants&#39; profits, and consumer welfare. We find that a monopolistic supplier can always enjoy a lower loan interest rate and borrow more loans to improve production quantity or quality under EPF, which benefits to the participants and consumers. Interestingly, the e-platform provides free loans and only profits from commission fee under some conditions. When there are two suppliers competing for the market share, the absolute advantage of EPF will change. If the supply chain or market environment is bad (production cost or commission rate is high; the potential market or initial budget is low), the e-platform will offer lower interest rates than bank to reduce the strength gap between the suppliers; thus, the capital-constrained supplier prefers EPF, which shows that the EPF business is an effective means to regulate upstream competition. However, when there are more competitive suppliers, the preferences of the suppliers with less initial capital are the same as the scenario of the two competitive suppliers, while the preference of the supplier with more initial capital is just the opposite. Finally, if the commission rate is endogenous, we demonstrate that the e-platform will offer free loans but charge a relatively high commission fee.},

In this paper, the mentioned dynamics is introduced based on a fourth-order parabolic operator, together with coupled non-linear reaction terms. The fourth-order operator allows us to model a heterogeneous diffusion, as introduced by the Landau–Ginzburg free energy approach. The reaction terms are given by a coupled non-linear effect in the invasive species, to account for the action of the invaded species and limited resources, and by a non-Lipschitz term in the invaded species, to account for possible sprouts, once the invasion occurs. The analysis starts by the proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions, making use of the semi-group theory and a fixed point argument. Asymptotic solutions to the invasive species are explored with an exponential scaling. Afterward, the problem is analyzed with traveling wave profiles, for which a region of positive solutions is explored.},

This novel approach enables the investigation of the exact closed-form solutions to dynamical systems of first-order and second-order ODEs that can be written as a nonstandard Hamiltonian system by utilizing common methods feasible to the nonstandard Hamiltonian systems. The first integrals and associated invariant solutions of the aforementioned biological and population models for some cases under the constraint of system parameters via the artificial Hamiltonian method for not only two-dimensional but also four-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems are considered.

It can provide recommendations for rail transit network planning and phased construction by evaluating the degree of evolution of the urban rail transit network and dividing the evolution stages precisely. Starting from the allometric growth relationship between transfer nodes and ordinary nodes in the urban rail transit network, this paper defines the evolution level of the rail transit network and the growth rate difference between transfer nodes and ordinary nodes and deduces the dynamic logistic equation of URT network evolution level using the mathematical derivative and logarithmic relationship. This paper reveals the dynamic law of the evolution process of the urban rail transit network at a theoretical level, analyzes the dynamic evolution process on this basis, determines the threshold for phasing the evolution stage, and divides it into four evolution stages. Finally, the results of the theoretical derivation are validated by the evolution data of the Beijing Rail Transit Network (1984–2020) over 45 years. The verification results are substantially congruent with the conclusions of the theoretical derivation, demonstrating the accuracy of the theoretical model and its practical usefulness in directing the building of the rail transit network.},

Then, we develop the method of upper and lower solutions and the monotone iterative technique in order to deduce the existence of solutions in a certain region (and find their approximations) for a class of boundary value problems, which include the periodic case. In the approximation process, since the sequences of the derivatives for the approximate solutions are, in general, not monotonic, we also give some estimates for these derivatives.

The solver depends on the truncated Fourier series expansion, where the differential equations of the Fourier coefficients are solved by an ultraspherical spectral method. Because this problem is seriously ill-posed, the Cauchy data with noise will lead to ill-conditioned linear system. Hence, we apply Tikhonov regularization to solve the obtained linear system and use generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to select regularization parameters. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated by several numerical results of different regions.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a tremendous threat to the public and health authorities. Wuhan, as one of the cities experiencing the earliest COVID-19 outbreak, has successfully tackled the epidemic finally. The main reason is the implementing of Fangcang shelter hospitals, which rapidly and massively scale the health system&#39;s capacity to treat COVID-19 confirmed cases with mild symptoms. To give insights on what degree Fangcang shelter hospitals have contained COVID-19 in Wuhan, we proposed a piecewise smooth model regarding the patient triage scheme and the bed capacities of Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals. We used data on the cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, and data on the number of hospitalized individuals in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals in Wuhan to parameterize the targeted model. Our results showed that diminishing the bed capacity or delaying the opening time of Fangcang shelter hospitals, both would result in worsening the epidemic by increasing the total number of infectives and hospitalized individuals and the effective reproduction number . The findings demonstrated that Fangcang shelter hospitals avoided 17,013 critical infections and 17,823 total infections while it saved 7 days during the process of controlling the effective reproduction number . Our study highlighted the critical role of Fangcang shelter hospitals in curbing and eventually stopping COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may provide a valuable reference for decision-makers in regarding ramping up the health system capacity to isolate groups of people with mild symptoms in areas of widespread infection.},

The model equilibrium solutions are obtained, and it is found that the model exhibits forward bifurcation and the effective basic reproduction number ( R o ⁢ c ) $$ \left({R}_{oc}\right) $$ governing the spread of the disease is computed by the use of the next generation matrix method. The sensitivity results of model parameters reveal that the rates describing the recruitment of humans, blackflies, onchocerciasis disease transmission, and the biting rate of blackflies are positively sensitive to , which necessitate the need for controls to be implemented in order to curtail the infectious contact between humans and blackflies in the host environment. To this effect, the model is further transformed into an optimal control problem by applying control strategies of personal protection of using treated bednets and wearing of permethrin-treated cloths , surgical care for humans with body deformation and impaired vision , education campaign , and the use of insecticide , respectively. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal control model are established, and the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) is employed to characterize the controls. The optimal control model is solved using the Runge–Kutta numerical scheme via MATLAB, and the simulations under different control combinations show that each of the controls have its own effect in minimizing onchocerciasis transmission, but the combined effects of the four control strategies proved to be more beneficial towards the elimination of the disease in human and blackfly host community. Also, the simulations of the control profiles reveal that each of these controls are sustained at maximum until 3 months before gradually declining to zero in terminal time of 12 months.},

To achieve these goals, we take extensive advantage of the so-called random variable transformation technique. The theoretical results extend their deterministic counterpart, and then, they have many applications in real-world problems where uncertainty plays a key role.

In this paper, a new mathematical model has been proposed to describe rogue waves in arterial vessels.

Further, by employing multiscale analysis and perturbation expansion method, the ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation is derived to describe the envelope solitary waves propagation of blood vessels. Different from the previous model, the ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional NLS model takes into account the propagation of blood flow along the vessel axis and radius. In order to further study, the integer-order model is generalized to the time-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger (TF-NLS) equation by use of the semi-inverse method and Agrawal&#39;s method, and the conservation laws are also investigated. Moreover, the rogue wave solution of the fractional model which can directly describe the behavior of the rogue waves in arterial vessels is obtained. Rogue wave and fractional parameter effect on blood flow volume is analyzed and discussed, which can provide some help for the study of cardiovascular diseases.},

In order to estimate the obtained numerical reliability parameters, a multilayer artificial neural network model has been developed. Seven different reliability parameter values have been obtained from the artificial neural network model designed with four input parameters. The prediction values obtained from the artificial neural network model developed with five neurons in the hidden layer have been compared with numerical data, and the performance of the model has been analyzed comprehensively. The mean squared error (MSE) value for the network model has been calculated as 1.98E-08 and the R value as 0.99991.

In this paper, we present a two-step Landweber-type iteration method and its accelerated version for sparse reconstruction of Jacobian-based EIT problem. We aim at reconstructing a finite number of simply and small inclusions embedded at the homogeneous background conductivity. The sparsity of the inclusions with respect to the spacial domain is a prior assumed. This method we propose here contains the two-step line searches, corresponding to the Landweber step and the approximate Landweber step equipped with a novel step parameter, respectively. To validate the advantage of the proposed method, numerical simulations have been carried out. Also, qualitative and quantitative comparisons are conducted. The results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of iterations and computational time needed to match an appropriate stopping criterion, relative to the conventional (one-step) Landweber method. The performed numerical simulations show that our method is promising.},

At the first step, a difference formula of L 1 type is employed to get a semi-discrete algorithm in the temporal variable with a accuracy of order 2 − α in the case of smooth solutions, where 0 &lt; α ≤  1 is the fractional-order derivative. At the second step, a localized radial basis function finite difference is adopted to derive a full-discrete scheme. Moreover, the unconditional stability and convergence of the proposed method are analyzed based on energy norm. The exact expressions for the weights of the first and second derivatives are used by imposing a multiquadric function generated by finite difference.

  abstract     = {In this paper, inspired by the concept of nonlinear elastic matching, generalized metrics, and multiplicative triangle inequality, we propose a b g -multiplicative metric space in which we propose a generalized notion of a distance function, b g , with degree 2 is a distance of 3 points in generalizing the ordinary distance between 2 points and G -metric between 3 points. We first discuss b g -multiplicative metric space mapping and later on the fundamental properties of b g -multiplicative metric are also discussed. Fundamental properties and several examples for the b g -multiplicative metric are also given. Moreover, topological properties on the b g -multiplicative metric space including the convergence of sequences and the continuity of mappings on the b g -multiplicative metric space are studied. Finally, we generalize some well-known fixed point theorems including Banach contraction mapping as -multiplicative contraction mapping and proved some fixed point theorems on complete -multiplicative metric spaces. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a system of -multiplicative integral equations as an application. Our results generalize many pre-existing results in literature.},

The Van den Dool and Kratz equation results have the potential to be used not only in the chemical compositions of the oils but also in applied mathematics and other fields. Moreover, we construct a new special finite sum. A lower bound and inequality are also given for the finite special sum involving the dead time associated with the isocratic step. Some applications and criticisms are given that include this lower bound and inequality for these sums and its effects on the chemical compositions of essential oil and the Van den Dool and Kratz equation.},

Inside the duct, the salts of distinct compositions are diffused. Non-Darcy approach is used to describe the porous material influence on transport processes. Symmetric and asymmetric heating conditions are considered for the ambient temperatures close to the vertical channel borders. Heat is exchanged between the vertical plates and the external fluid. Initially, the solutions are found without an influence of viscous dissipation and buoyancy forces. Inclusion of these two effects leads to nonlinear equations and adopting Brinkman parameter as the perturbation characteristic for the solutions is procured. Owing to the limitation on the perturbation characteristic, the conservation relations are solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta procedure combined with shooting technique. The flow patterns are depicted for the properties of the heat and mass Grashof numbers, porous parameter, inertial parameter, Brinkman number, Biot numbers, and chemical reaction characteristics. The effects of these parameters are explored on the skin frictions and Nusselt numbers. In the case of dissipations caused by viscosity and Forchheimer drag term, the perturbation results and numerical solutions are equal for low magnitudes of perturbation characteristic.},

In this article, we use spectral clustering algorithm to cluster 15 cities in the Pearl River Delta. On this basis, we propose a special difference equation model, especially the use of nonlinear diffusion equations to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of PM 2.5 propagation between and within clusters for real-time prediction. For example, through the analysis of PM 2.5 concentration data for 91 consecutive days in the Pearl River Delta, and according to different accuracy definitions, the average prediction accuracy of the difference equation model in all city clusters is 97 % or 88 % . The mean absolute error (MAE) of the forecast data for each urban agglomeration is within 7 units ( ). Experimental results show that the difference equation model can effectively reduce the prediction time and improve the prediction accuracy. Therefore, based on the spectral clustering algorithm and the difference equation model, the fastest prediction speed and the best prediction result can be obtained, and the problem of PM 2.5 concentration prediction can be effectively solved. The research can provide decision support for local air pollution early warning and urban integrated management.},

We also compare our results to those achieved from the ordinary model and the numerical implementation using the Caputo derivative definition. Results prove that the proposed model describes the dynamic of this mechanical system better than the ordinary and numerical models.

Such unprecedented outbreak was proved to be lethal for about 1,069,513 individuals based upon information released by Worldometers on October 09, 2020. In order to fathom transmission dynamics of the virus, different kinds of mathematical models have recently been proposed in literature. In the continuation, we have formulated a deterministic COVID-19 model under fractional operators using six nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Using fixed-point theory and Arzelá Ascoli principle, the proposed model is shown to have existence of unique solution while stability analysis for differential equations involved in the model is carried out via Ulam–Hyers and generalized Ulam–Hyers conditions in a Banach space. Real COVID-19 cases considered from July 01 to August 14, 2020, in Pakistan were used to validate the model, thereby producing best fitted values for the parameters via nonlinear least-squares approach while minimizing sum of squared residuals. Elasticity indices for each parameter are computed. Two numerical schemes under singular and non-singular operators are formulated for the proposed model to obtain various simulations of particularly asymptomatically infectious individuals and of control reproduction number . It has been shown that the fractional operators with order generated which is smaller than the one obtained under the classical case ( ). Interesting behavior of the virus is explained under fractional case for the epidemiologically relevant parameters. All results are illustrated from biological viewpoint.},

By applying the generalized Itô isometry, we further show that each of the proposed estimators can converge to QV, at a rate of O ( n −1/2 ), almost surely and in mean square sense, both of which are stronger than the existing convergence in probability. Moreover, the error of approximation is also provided for each estimation.

It is shown that the system exhibits rich and complex dynamics like bistability, local and global bifurcations such as transcritical bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, cusp bifurcation, Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation, Bautin bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycle, and heteroclinic bifurcation. Next, we separately explore the influences of Allee effect and density-dependent mortality on the dynamics of the same model. The results show that the strong Allee effect induces the occurrence of heteroclinic bifurcation and the reduction of the number of limit cycles, while the density-dependent mortality stabilizes the system. Since the analytical expressions of the interior equilibria are difficult to derive, the results are verified numerically.},

Multistationarity may appear in the parameter space as a consequence of saddle-node bifurcations, which necessarily require an algebraically simple eigenvalue zero of the Jacobian, at the bifurcating equilibrium. Matrices with a simple eigenvalue zero are generic in the set of singular matrices. Thus, one would expect that in applications singular Jacobians are always with a simple eigenvalue zero. However, chemical reaction networks typically consider a fixed network structure, while the freedom rests with the various choices of kinetics. Here, we present an example of a chemical reaction network, whose Jacobian is either nonsingular or has an algebraically multiple eigenvalue zero. This in particular constitutes an obstruction to standard saddle-node bifurcations. The presented structural obstruction is based on the network structure alone, and it is independent of the value of the positive concentrations and the choice of kinetics.},

Initially, the governing differential equations for the transverse vibrations of the beams are derived through Hamiltonian principle.

The models consist of four types: susceptible individuals, acutely infected hepatitis B individuals, chronically infected hepatitis B individuals and recovered individuals. This study focuses on the transmission dynamics of acute and chronic hepatitis B epidemics problems and the development of optimal control strategies to control the transmission of hepatitis B in the population. To this end, we first calculate the equilibrium point and basic reproduction number of the deterministic hepatitis B model to study the stability of the above model at the equilibrium point. Secondly, we give the basic reproduction number of the stochastic model of hepatitis B virus. A suitable Lyapunov function is constructed, and the solvability of the stochastic model is confirmed using the Itô formula. By using a series of stochastic inequalities and strong number theorems, the extinction and stationary distribution of hepatitis B in this stochastic model are obtained. Finally, the optimal control theory is used to develop an optimal control strategy for eliminating hepatitis B virus transmission. The Runge–Kutta method is used to simulate the above models to verify the rationality of our main theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Of concern, the present article is a theoretical investigation on the reaction–diffusion interacting species model system including prey harvesting and the alternative food source for the predator maintained partially by Beverton–Holt-like food. Major attention is focused on the influence of alternative food source for the predator in the event of prey harvesting on the dynamical complexity of the system. The existence of equilibria together with their topological classification concerning positive coexisting equilibria of the system is thoroughly explored. The threshold of extinction for interacting species, the stability of feasible equilibria, and the persistence scenario as well are examined analytically. The parametric constraint for subcritical Hopf bifurcation emerging from altering harvesting efforts is established through normal form setting. The perception of the local bifurcation structure of codimensions 1 and 2 depending on the model parameters of significance is also explored. Special emphasis is paid on the sensitivity analysis of the model system so as to examine the effect of harvesting and alternative food source for sustaining biomass balance. The existence and stability of nonnegative equilibria together with Turing instability corresponding to spatiotemporal system are, however, not ruled out from the present pursuit. The evolution of diffusion-driven pattern formation with the inclusion of spots, stripes, labyrinthine, stripe-hole mixtures, and hole replication is well-depicted in space influenced by both the harvesting and additional food source of the dynamical system. Extensive numerical simulations are performed in order to establish all the theoretical outcomes in terms of stability of the system and its sustainable development.},

With the help of Cauchy convergence criterion, the exponential stability inequality is derived. The system has [ ∏ A ( K A + 1 ) ] n $$ {\left[\prod \limits_A\left({K}_A&amp;amp;amp;#x0002B;1\right)\right]}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;n $$ locally exponentially stable equilibrium points and periodic solutions, which greatly increases the number of solutions compared with the existing Cohen–Grossberg neural networks, where the K A $$ {K}_A $$ is a Clifford-valued and there is no limitation of linearity and monotonicity for activation functions. Furthermore, the attraction basins of stable periodic solutions are obtained, and it is proved that the basins can be enlarged. It is worth mentioning that the results can also be used to discuss the multistability of equilibrium points, periodic solutions, and almost periodic solutions for real-valued, complex-valued, and quaternion-valued memristive Cohen–Grossberg neural networks. Finally, two numerical examples with simulations are taken to verify the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The present research article delves into the application of machine learning techniques in the study of entropy generation arising from the electro-MHD Casson nanofluid flow in a symmetric microchannel. The inertial effect on fluid flow through a non-Darcy porous medium is considered where we have taken into account the velocity, thermal, and concentration slips at boundaries. The resulting system of PDEs is converted to system of ODEs using appropriate wave frame transformations. The metamorphosed system is solved using bvp4c routine of MATLAB. The impact of several factors represented by respective parameters on velocity, nanofluid temperature, fraction of nanoparticles, entropy generation, and Bejan number are shown through graphs. This study also employs a machine learning technique in which Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used in conjunction with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a predictive model capable of optimizing entropy generation within this specific fluidic context. Such an analysis could be useful in determining the optimum entropy generation in pulsatile transport of physiological fluid through intestine. With the use of above mentioned machine learning technique, the considered model offers the minimum entropy generation for specific values of the electroosmotic parameter, dimensionless temperature difference, and velocity slip parameter. It is observed that the flow with minimum electroosmosis effect and maintained at a specific velocity slip gives the optimal entropy generation.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns the fractional-order dual-mode nonlinear Schrödinger equation (FDMNLSE), which portrays the augmentation or absorption of dual waves. This model dissects the concurrent generation of two characteristic waves dealing with dual modes and introduces three physical parameters: nonlinearity, phase velocity, and dispersive factor. In the context of photonics, NLSE models the propagation of soliton pulses over intercontinental distances. Throughout this work, the fractional derivative is given in terms of time and space conformable sense. We analyze the multi-waves method, homoclinic breather approach, and interactional solution with the double -functions procedure, and their applications for this equation are obtained using logarithmic transformation. The multi-wave method is a well-known phenomenon in nonlinear science that describes the interaction of three waves that satisfy certain resonance conditions. A breather wave is a localized and oscillatory solution that maintains its shape over time. Finally, we will discuss the dynamics of our newly obtained solutions with the help of graphs by assigning appropriate values to the parameters. The proposed methods are straight and aggressive, so the approved form can be extended for more nonlinear models. The findings are exceptional in comparison to previous findings in the literature. These outcomes may have significance for additional investigation of such frameworks to handle the nonlinear issues in applied sciences. The obtained results help us understand fluid propagation and incompressible fluids.},

The model is used to investigate whether incorporating these two processes can induce new epidemiological insights. Analytical findings reveal coexistence of multiple endemic equilibria on either regions divided by the fundamental threshold (control reproduction number). Numerical findings conducted to validate analytical results show that heterogeneity in infection-acquired immunity among recovered individuals can induce various bifurcation structures such as reversed backward bifurcation , forward bifurcation , backward bifurcation , and reversed hysteresis effect. Moreover, numerical results show that reversed backward bifurcation is annihilated or switches to the usual forward bifurcation if infection-acquired immunity among recovered individuals with strong immunity is assumed to be everlasting. However, this is only possible if primary infection is more likely than reinfection. In case reinfection is more likely to occur than primary infection, reversed backward bifurcation structure switches to a backward bifurcation phenomenon. Further, longer duration of infection-acquired immunity does lead to COVID-19 decline over time but does not lead to flattening of the COVID-19 peak.},

The solution of the underlying problem exhibits a weak singularity at time t = 0 $$ t&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;0 $$ . The methods are designed on both graded and adapted grids, in which the temporal derivative is approximated on the nonuniform grid, in order to tackle the singularity. In the case of adaptive mesh technique, the mesh is constructed adaptively via equidistribution of a positive monitor function. The resulting semi-discretized equation is further discretized by a high-order compact finite difference (CFD) scheme to obtain a fully discrete scheme. Stability and convergence of the method on graded mesh are analyzed. Numerical results for one test problem subjected to nonsmooth analytical solution are presented which shows the robustness and efficiency of the proposed numerical schemes. The elapsed computational time (CPU time) for the proposed methods are provided. Numerical results obtained from the methods on graded and adapted grids are compared with those from the scheme on uniform grid. Finally, as an application, the TFCD model and the suggested numerical techniques were employed to price options of a European butterfly spread. The effect of fractional order (FO) derivative on the option price profile is investigated.},

Further, we study semi discrete formulation of the problem by discretizing the space domain using a conforming finite element method (FEM) and keeping the time variable continuous. The semi discrete error analysis is carried out by modifying the standard Ritz-Volterra projection operator in such a way that it reduces the complexities arising from the Kirchhoff type nonlinearity. Finally, we develop a new linearized L1 Galerkin FEM to obtain numerical solution of the problem under consideration. This method has a convergence rate of , where is the fractional derivative exponent and and are the discretization parameters in the space and time directions, respectively.

By developing the methods into memory methods, their efficiency indices are increased. Then, the methods are extended to the multi-step methods for finding the solutions to systems of problems. The formula for the order of convergence of the multi-step iterative methods is 2 ⁢ p $$ 2p $$ , where p $$ p $$ is the step number of the methods. It is clear that computing the Jacobian matrix derivative evaluation and its inversion are expensive; therefore, we compute them only once in every cycle of the methods. The important feature of these multi-step methods is their high-efficiency index. Numerical examples that confirm the theoretical results are performed. In applications, some nonlinear problems related to the numerical approximation of fractional differential equations (FDEs) are constructed and solved by the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {The transient analysis of viscoelastic functionally graded porous (FGP) nanoplate resting on the viscoelastic medium using the finite element method (FEM) is studied in this work. The nanoplate is made from a material that varies in thickness and has mechanical qualities that change depending on the porosity. The whole of the mechanical system rests on a Pasternak medium, which is modeled in accordance with a Kelvin–Voigt viscoelastic model. The general plate motion balance equations are developed by the application of the higher-order shear plate theory (HSDT) with a new inverse hyperbolic function, the nonlocal hypothesis, and Hamilton&#39;s principle. In order to develop a four-node quadrilateral element, Lagrangian and Hermitian interpolation functions are used. These functions are employed to define the main variables that correspond to the in-plane displacements and the transverse displacements, respectively. The direct integration method developed by Newmark is used to calculate the dynamic responses of the plate. The outcomes that were anticipated by the essay have been confirmed by reputable sources. The dynamic response characteristics of a viscoelastic FGP nanoplates that is placed on a viscoelastic medium are explored, and a number of factors that influence these features are discovered and explained.},

The sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed in order to determine the impact of related parameters on outbreak severity. We further study various cases for the investment rate upon critical value of the investment in order to describe the effect of poverty on the infected individuals over time. The results we obtained show that increasing of the stock of capital per effective units of labor and the implementation of strategies combining awareness programs and therapeutic treatments will reduce the proportion of the infected population.

An analytical solution and approximate solution are obtained. Some numerical examples show that the exact solution and MC simulation fit well. It is worth mentioning that the difference between the approximate solution and the exact solution is small when the parameters are selected appropriately. By the mean time, the parameter of the long-term mean has an important impact on the solution, which implies that the introduction of a multi-factor model is necessary.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we extend the approach used to study the oscillatory behavior of delay differential equations to neutral equations. In the noncanonical case, we establish a new one-condition criterion that guarantees the oscillation of a class of second-order Emden-Fowler neutral differential equations. The symmetry between the positive and negative solutions of the studied equation plays an important role in the proof of our results. Finally, we present an example to compare our results with previous relevant results.},

This paper deals with a stochastic predator–prey model that considers the distribution delay and assume that the intrinsic growth rate and the death rate in the model are governed by Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to simulate the random factors in the environment. Based on the existence and uniqueness of the global solution to the model and the boundedness of the p $$ p $$ order moments of the solution, several conditions are established to analyze the survival of the species. Specifically, a criteria for the existence of the stationary distribution to the stochastic system is established by constructing some suitable Lyapunov functions. And the analytical expression of the probability density function of the model around the quasi-equilibrium is obtained. Furthermore, the extinction of species in the model is also explored.

  abstract     = {When the sparse regularizer is convex and its proximal operator has a closed-form, first-order iterative algorithms based on proximal operators can effectively solve the sparse optimization problems. Recently, plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms have achieved significant success by incorporating advanced denoisers to replace the proximal operators in iterative algorithms. However, convex sparse regularizers such as the ℓ 1 $$ {\ell}_1 $$ -norm tend to underestimate the large values within the sparse solutions. In contrast, the convex non-convex (CNC) sparse regularization enables the non-convex regularizer while preserving the convexity of the objective function. In this paper, we propose several PnP algorithms for solving the CNC sparse regularization model and discuss their convergence properties. Specifically, we first derive the proximal operator for CNC sparse regularization in iterative form and subsequently integrate it with several first-order algorithms to yield different PnP algorithms. Then, based on the monotone operator theory, we prove that the proposed PnP algorithms are convergent under the condition that the data-fidelity term is strongly convex and the residuals of the denoisers are contractive. We also emphasized the significance of strong convexity in the data-fidelity term for the CNC sparse regularization model. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PnP algorithms through extensive image restoration tasks.},

Using the Damkohler relation, the system of two nonlinear differential equations is reduced to a single differential equation subject to the algebraic constraint. We derive the novel semi-analytical and closed-form explicit approximate solutions for the reactant concentration and temperature in catalyst pellets of planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometries. The derived semi-analytical and explicit approximations give insight into the effect of process parameters on concentration and temperature profiles. The proposed methods are verified numerically for isothermal and non-isothermal steady-state problems with power-law kinetics. They can serve as a practicable alternative to numerical schemes.},

We establish the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions corresponding to two different initial data assumptions. We derive global results of a unique mild solution with small initial data using some Sobolev/Sobolev-Orlicz embeddings, a weighted Banach space, and the fixed point theorem. In the absence of any smallness assumptions, the Cauchy iteration method demonstrates that the mild solution blows up at a finite time or exists globally in time. Finally, we consider some illustrated examples to test the results obtained in theory.},

  abstract     = {Different ways of representing the group S ⁢ U ⁡ ( 3 ) $$ SU(3) $$ within a Geometric Algebra approach are explored. As part of this, we consider characteristic multivectors for S ⁢ U ⁡ ( 3 ) $$ SU(3) $$ and how these are linked with decomposition of generators into commuting bivectors. The setting for this work is within a 6d Euclidean Clifford Algebra. We then go on to consider whether the fundamental forces of particle physics might arise from symmetry considerations in just the 4d geometric algebra of spacetime—the STA. As part of this, a representation of S ⁢ U ⁡ ( 3 ) $$ SU(3) $$ is found wholly within the STA, involving preservation of a bivector norm. We also show how Octonions can be fully represented within the Spacetime Algebra, which we believe will be useful in making them understandable and accessible to a new community in Physics and Engineering. The two strands of the paper are drawn together in showing how preserving the octonion norm is the same as preserving the timelike part of the Dirac current of a particle. This suggests a new model for the symmetries preserved in particle physics. Following on from work by Günaydin and Gürsey on the link between quarks, and octonions, and by Furey on chains of octonionic multiplications, we show how both of these fit well within our scheme and give some wholly STA versions of the operations involved, which in the cases considered have easily understandable equivalents in terms of 4d geometry. Links with larger groups containing , such as and , are also considered.},

  abstract     = {Under the spin–position decoupling approximation, a vector with a phase in 3D orientation space endowed with geometric algebra substitutes the vector–matrix spin model built on the Pauli spin operator. The standard quantum operator-state spin formalism is replaced with vectors transforming by proper and improper rotations in the same 3D space—isomorphic to the space of Pauli matrices. In the single-spin case, the novel spin 1/2 representation (1) is Hermitian, (2) shows handedness, (3) yields all the standard results and its modulus equals the total spin angular momentum S tot = 3 ⁢ ℏ / 2 , (4) formalizes irreversibility in measurement, and (5) permits adaptive imbedding of the 2D spin space in 3D. Maximally entangled spin pairs (1) are in phase and have opposite handedness, (2) relate by one of the four basic improper rotations in 3D: plane reflections (triplets) and inversion (singlet), (3) yield the standard total angular momentum, and (4) all standard expectation values for bipartite and partial observations follow. Depending on whether proper and improper rotors act one—or two—sided, the formalism appears in two complementary forms, the “spinor” or the “vector” form, respectively. The proposed scheme provides a clear geometric picture of spin correlations and transformations entirely in the 3D physical orientation space.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a geometric algebra-based variation of a well-known threshold secret-sharing scheme introduced by Adi Shamir in 1979. Secret sharing is a cryptographic primitive which allows a secret input to be divided into multiple shares which are then sent to a collection of parties. The shares are generated so that only “authorized” sets of shares can reconstruct the secret. In Shamir&#39;s scheme, any sufficiently large set of shares can reconstruct the secret. The minimum number of shares which can obtain the secret is called the threshold , and any number of shares smaller than the threshold reveals nothing about the secret. The shares are generated such that each party can perform computations, generating a new set of shares that, when reconstructed, are equivalent to performing those exact computations directly on the secret input data. Our variant changes the domain from which secrets are taken: A finite field with prime order is replaced by a geometric algebra over a finite field of prime order. This change preserves the important security properties of Shamir&#39;s scheme, namely, idealness (secrets and shares are chosen from the same space) and perfectness (“unauthorized” sets of shares learn nothing about the secret). Our scheme allows secret sharing to be seamlessly added to the arsenal of GA-based applications. Our extension of Shamir&#39;s secret scheme was first worked out for geometric algebras. It appears, however, that in fact it works for other algebras, a situation worthy to be explored in future work. For definiteness, in this paper, we restrict the analysis to the case of geometric algebras.},

More precisely, we develop a switching path searching algorithm for a two-dimensional linear dynamical switched system with a non-singular matrix whose integral curves are formed by two sets of centralized ellipses. It is natural to represent them as elements of Geometric Algebra for Conics and construct the switching path by calculating switching points, i.e., intersections and contact points. For this, we use symbolic algebra operations or, more precisely, the wedge and inner products that are realizable by sums of products in the coordinate form. Therefore, no numerical solver to the system of equations is needed. Indeed, the only operation that may bring in an inaccuracy is vector normalization, i.e., square root calculation. The resulting switching path is formed by pieces of ellipses that are chosen, respectively, from the two sets of integral curves. The switching points are either intersections in the first or final step of our algorithm, or contact points. This choice guarantees the optimality of the switching path with respect to the number of switches. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the search for the intersections of the conics and, consequently, a description is presented of the construction of a switching path in both cases.},

This problem can be straightforwardly solved using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Nevertheless, to avoid numerical methods, we present two new closed-form methods. One relies on the direct minimization of the mentioned Frobenius norm, and the other on the passage to double quaternion representation. A comparison of these two methods with respect to the SVD reveals that the method based on a double quaternion representation is superior in all aspects.},

One very common example is finding a rotor or orthogonal matrix representing rotation, given knowledge of initial and transformed points. In this paper, we discuss methods in the literature for recovering such rotors and then outline a GA method, which generalises to cases of any signature and any dimension, and which is not restricted to orthonormal sets of vectors. The proof of this technique is both concise and elegant and uses the concept of characteristic multivectors as discussed in the book by Hestenes and Sobczyk, which contains a treatment of linear algebra using geometric algebra. Expressing orthogonal transformations as rotors, enables us to create fractional transformations and we discuss this for some classic transforms. In real applications, our initial and/or final sets of vectors will be noisy. We show how to use the characteristic multivector method to find a ‘best fit’ rotor between these sets and compare our results with other methods.},

  abstract     = {Many problems in computer vision today are solved via deep learning. Tasks like pose estimation from images, pose estimation from point clouds or structure from motion can all be formulated as a regression on rotations. However, there is no unique way of parametrizing rotations mathematically: matrices, quaternions, axis-angle representation or Euler angles are all commonly used in the field. Some of them, however, present intrinsic limitations, including discontinuities, gimbal lock or antipodal symmetry. These limitations may make the learning of rotations via neural networks a challenging problem, potentially introducing large errors. Following recent literature, we propose three case studies: a sanity check, a pose estimation from 3D point clouds and an inverse kinematic problem. We do so by employing a full geometric algebra (GA) description of rotations. We compare the GA formulation with a 6D continuous representation previously presented in the literature in terms of regression error and reconstruction accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that parametrizing rotations as bivectors outperforms the 6D representation. The GA approach overcomes the continuity issue of representations as the 6D representation does, but it also needs fewer parameters to be learned and offers an enhanced robustness to noise. GA hence provides a broader framework for describing rotations in a simple and compact way that is suitable for regression tasks via deep learning, showing high regression accuracy and good generalizability in realistic high-noise scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A novel easy-to-use similarity technique for spatial fractional partial differential equations is introduced to solve the flow and heat transfer of fractional viscoelastic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid over a permeable stretching sheet. The proposed method represents a new technique for deriving similarity transformations, which allows the conversion of the fractional partial differential equations to fractional ordinary differential equations. Moreover, using the Grünwald–Letnikov formula, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is adopted here to solve the obtained similarity equations, using the shooting method. The transformed governing equations were found to be dependent on six physical parameters, namely, fractional parameter, magnetic field parameter, generalized local Reynolds number, generalized Prandtl number, the wall suction/injection parameter, and the wall stretching exponential. The results reveal that maximums of the skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are obtained for fractional-order derivative of about 0.5. Moreover, application of a magnetic field on electrically conducting fractional fluid thins the velocity boundary layer and thickens the thermal boundary layer; therefore, the skin friction coefficient increases whereas the local Nusselt number decreases. Furthermore, an increase in any parameters of the local Reynolds number, suction parameter, or the wall stretching exponential leads to thinner boundary layers and higher values of skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number, whereas imposing injection has opposite effects. Finally, increasing the generalized Prandtl number leads to a thinner thermal boundary layer and higher local Nusselt number for the fractional viscoelastic fluid. It would be of interest to extend the proposed method to other practical problems in the same field.},

This system describes the flow of a two-phase immiscible heat-conducting viscous incompressible mixture. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by the derivatives of double-well potential and the nonlinear terms, we rewrite the Cahn–Hilliard part of the system as a new equivalent equation with “good” linear principle parts. Then, on the basis of the higher order norm estimates of solutions and the mollifier technique, we obtain the local well-posedness of strong solutions. Moreover, by using pure energy method and standard continuity argument together with negative Sobolev norm estimates, one proves the global well-posedness and time decay estimates provided that the initial data are sufficiently small.},

Variational λ $$ \lambda $$ -symmetries are determined for a family of potential functions, which lead to a one-parameter family of exact solutions.

It is assumed that there are two cracks in a nonhomogeneous medium. The problem is formulated in the view of the basics of the elasticity theory and boundary conditions of the problem. By using the method of singular integral equation, the problem is converted to a system of first kind Cauchy type singular integral equations. It is aimed to determine the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of the crack problem. It is seen that Lobatto–Chebyshev quadrature has many advantages in determining SIFs. To verify the validity of the method, the obtained results corresponding to the one crack case are compared with the results in literature.},

The issue of applicability of the exact solution for describing steady-state convective flows of a liquid and a co-current gas flux under the conditions of inhomogeneous evaporation of the diffusive type in a flat horizontal channel is discussed. Algorithms for obtaining analytical representations of the required functions for various types of the boundary conditions for the temperature function on the outer channel wall are proposed. The influence of the external thermal load and boundary thermal conditions on the structure of the velocity and temperature fields, evaporation mass flow rate, and vapor content in the gas layer is investigated at an example of the HFE-7100–nitrogen system. The solution correctly predicts hydrodynamical, temperature, and concentration parameters of convective regimes appearing in the two-phase system. The main characteristics are compared with the characteristics of the system in the case of uniform evaporation with a constant intensity.},

Due to the nonsmoothness of the initial function, the variable step-size extrapolated Crank–Nicolson (CN) method, which explicitly discretizes the jump term and implicitly the rest, is proposed to solve this model. The finite difference method is used to discretize the spatial differential operator, the composite trapezoidal rule to calculate the jump integral, and then a linear system with a nine-diagonal coefficient matrix is obtained, which is easy to solve. The stability of the variable step-size extrapolated CN method is then proved. Based on realistic regularity assumptions on the data, the consistency error and global error bounds of the variable step-size extrapolated CN method are derived in norm. Compared with the variable step-size IMEX BDF2 method and the variable step-size IMEX MP method, the numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed variable step-size extrapolated CN method.},

The sub-model consisting of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is investigated for possible equilibria, and qualitative aspects of the model are rigorously presented. In order to control the spread of the disease, we considered two age- and time-dependent non-pharmaceutical control measures in the age-structured model, and an optimal control problem using a general maximum principle of Pontryagin type is achieved. Finally, sample simulations are plotted which support our theoretical work.},

In the current work, a class of the fourth-order parabolic equations with the third Neumann boundary conditions is concerned, where the values of the second and third spatial derivatives of the unknown function are given at the boundary. A novel average is defined to get the compact approximation near the boundary. Then a compact difference scheme is derived by using the weighted average and the method of order reduction. Due to the special and highly accurate discretization at the boundary, the related terms have to be handled skillfully during the analysis. By the energy method, the unique solvability, unconditional stability, and convergence of the derived compact difference scheme are strictly proved. The analytical difficulties caused by the boundary approximation are successfully overcome. As far as we know, this is the first time that the global pointwise fourth-order convergence in space of the difference approach for this problem is achieved. In addition, the generalization to solve the case with a space-dependent reaction coefficient is discussed. Finally, two numerical examples are computed to verify the accuracy of proposed numerical schemes.},

Consequently, by considering different values of m $$ m $$ , different expressions for the lower bound of RCI can be obtained. Furthermore, by utilizing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals based on m $$ m $$ , improved stability conditions have been achieved. After that, a new theorem has been presented, effectively addressing the shortcoming of existing stability conditions that have not been unified in a manner that covers the orders m = 1,2 , $$ m&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;1,2, $$ and 3.

We focus on the case the diffusivity makes the parabolic equation of forward–backward–forward type and the reaction term models a strong Allee effect, with the Allee parameter lying between the two internal zeros of the diffusion. In such a case, the unbiased equation (i.e., without convection) possesses no smooth traveling-wave solutions; on the contrary, in the presence of convection, we show that traveling-wave solutions do exist for some significant choices of the parameters.

By combining ideas from algebraic splitting of linear saddle point solvers with incremental Picard-type iterations and grad-div stabilization, IPY improves on the standard Picard method by allowing for easier linear solves at each iteration—but without creating more total nonlinear iterations compared to Picard. This paper extends the IPY methodology by studying it together with Anderson acceleration (AA). We prove that IPY for Navier–Stokes and regularized Bingham fits the recently developed analysis framework for AA, which implies that AA improves the linear convergence rate of IPY by scaling the rate with the gain of the AA optimization problem. Numerical tests illustrate a significant improvement in convergence behavior of IPY methods from AA, for both Navier–Stokes and regularized Bingham.},

Using the topological derivative method, we perform a noniterative algorithm for numerically recovering the location and shape of the unknown domain. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reconstructing multiple subdomains of varying shapes and sizes, considering noisy data, through numerical experiments.},

There, a given volume under or aside of a building is filled with soil and insulated to the surrounding ground. The thermal energy is stored by raising the temperature of the soil inside the storage. It is charged and discharged via pipe heat exchangers filled with a moving fluid. Simulations of geothermal energy storages aim to determine how much energy can be stored in or taken from the storage within a given period of time. The latter depends on the dynamics of the spatial temperature distribution in the storage, which is governed by a linear heat equation with convection and appropriate boundary and interface conditions. We consider semidiscretization and full discretization of that PDE using finite difference schemes and study associated stability problems. Finally, we present numerical results.},

With respect to the fact that model uncertainties occurring from the framework could make the overall system unstable although the resulting nominal plant is stabilized, this paper develops a readily applicable method for estimating such uncertain elements. More precisely, we propose a time-delay compensation method, by which prior values relevant to the model uncertainties in a sufficiently small time instant are used for such an estimation. The theoretical effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by establishing the two different arguments on operator-theoretic exponential stability and Lypaunov-based disturbance input-to-state stability.

In actuality, the aleatory fluctuations factors present in the natural environment like storm surges, weather changes, and seismic tremors make the dissemination of epidemics susceptible to some randomness. This calls for a stronger mathematical formulation that takes into consideration this stochasticity effect. From this perspective, and in order to highlight in the same time the effect of the vaccination strategy, we survey in this paper an SVIR model with general incidence rates that is disturbed by both Brownian motions and Lévy jumps. Initially, we establish its well-posedness in the sense that it has a unique positive and global-in-time solution. Then, we rely on some assumptions and nonstandard analytic techniques, to derive sufficient and almost necessary conditions for extinction, persistence in the mean, and also weak persistence. More explicitly, we identify firstly under some hypotheses a threshold between extinction and persistence in the mean. In other phrases, if , the infected population dies out while it persists in the mean when . Then, and by modifying the hypothetical framework in order to cover more incidence rates, we prove that can act also as a threshold between extinction and weak persistence. At last, we provide some numerical simulations to corroborate our findings and cover some particular cases of response functions.},

Secondly, by combining Faedo–Galerkin approximations with the compactness argument, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of weak solution. Finally, under a broader class of kernel functions, by constructing Lyapunov functionals and new equations and applying some technical lemmas, we establish the optimal and explicit energy decay results for two cases, namely, initial values and without imposing initial values equal to 0, that is, .

Since dispersion is one of the key parameters in solute transport, its accurate modeling is essential to avoid wrong predictions of flow and transport behavior. In this research, we investigate novel effective dispersion models for reactive transport of electrically charged chemical species in a thin, potentially evolving strip taking into account Taylor–Aris and electroosmotic-induced dispersion as well as their cross-coupling effects. We prove positivity of the dispersion coefficient and the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in the fixed geometry setting. Moreover, we numerically investigate scenarios for both the fixed and evolving geometry situation. The simulation results illustrate the possibility of separating charged species, such that the findings of this study can lead to a better understanding of mixing and separation processes of charged solutes and an improved prediction of breakthrough curves. Finally, we study the limits of vanishing channel width, precipitation layer thickness, and molecular diffusion. We show convergence of the solutions to the corresponding limit cases such as a hyperbolic model or the fixed geometry case. From these results, we can rate the impact of distinct dispersion mechanisms and evaluate the necessity of a detailed modeling for different parameter regimes.},

Media awareness brought individual behavioral changes among the people, which in turn helped reduce the infection rate. Motivated by this, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a media compartment to mitigate measles disease transmission. In this paper, the SEIR model is used to study measles disease in three cases: one with a delay in vaccination, the second with regular vaccination, and the third with the impact of media awareness on the spreading of measles disease. Further, the dynamical behavior of the models is studied in terms of positivity, boundedness, equilibrium, and basic reproduction number (BRN). The sensitivity analysis of the models is conducted, which verifies the importance of the BRN ( ) to be less than one for disease eradication. The numerical study confirms the impact of media awareness on exposed and infected populations.},

We obtain the twofold results in subcritical and critical cases, which is a meaningful addition and completeness to the known results about Kirchhoff equation. At the same time, this paper also gives a method to deal with p $$ p $$ -Laplacian, Kirchhoff equation, and some Kirchhoff type equation in a unified variational framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we apply the basic one-way propagator in order to introduce complex regularized long wave (RLW) equation. The complex RLW can be transformed into a system of nonlinear equations. By adopting a consequence nonlinear system, we can derive an energy conservation law of a complex regularized long wave equation. We then investigate how the Ansatz method may be applied to find a class of solitary wave solutions. Simultaneously, a numerical scheme for solving the model is implemented using a finite difference method based on the energy-preserving Crank–Nicolson/Adams–Bashforth technique. It is worth mentioning that the obtained system is nonlinear. However, by using the present algorithm, we are able to linearize this system and solve it because of the implicit nature of the system of equations. An a priori estimate of the numerical solutions is derived to obtain a convergence and stability analysis; this yields second-order accuracy in both time and space. Additionally, some numerical experiments verify computational efficiency. The results indicate that this method is an excellent way to preserve energy conservation, providing second-order accuracy both in time and space with a maximum norm. In addition, we use the proposed scheme to study the effects of dispersive parameters when proceeding with an initial complex Gaussian condition.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the Riemann problem for two-layered blood flow model, which is represented by a system of quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from the Euler equations by vertical averaging across each layer. We consider the Riemann problem with varying velocities and equal constant density through arteries. For instance, the flow layer close to the wall of vessel has a slower average speed than the layer far from the vessel because of the viscous effect of the blood vessel. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Riemann solution by a thorough investigation of the properties of elementary waves, namely, shock wave, rarefaction wave, and contact discontinuity wave. Further, we extensively analyze the elementary wave interaction between rarefaction wave and shock wave with contact discontinuity and rarefaction wave and shock wave. The global structure of the Riemann solutions after each wave interaction is explicitly constructed and graphically illustrated towards the end.},
