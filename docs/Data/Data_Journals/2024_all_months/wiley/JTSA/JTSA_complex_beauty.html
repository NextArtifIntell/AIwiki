  abstract     = {When we observe a stationary time series with observations missing at periodic time points, we can still estimate its marginal distribution well, but the dependence structure of the time series may not be recoverable at all, or the usual estimators may have much larger variance than in the fully observed case. We show how non-parametric estimators can often be improved by adding unbiased estimators. We focus on a simple setting, first-order Markov chains on a finite state space, and an observation pattern in which a fixed number of consecutive observations is followed by an observation gap of fixed length, say workdays and weekends. The new estimators perform astonishingly well in some cases, as illustrated with simulations. The approach extends to continuous state space and to higher-order Markov chains.},

Hence, it is important to pretest the existence of such serial correlation. Nevertheless, in the presence of embedded endogeneity, which is a common problem in the predictive regression setting, traditional serial correlation tests such as Box–Pierce (BP) and Ljung–Box (LB) tests are found to perform poorly. Motivated by this, we develop a new portmanteau test in this article as a pretest for serial correlation in predictive regression under possible embedded endogeneity. This test is based on the sample splitting idea and the jackknife empirical likelihood method. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test has been derived, and the Monte Carlo simulations confirm good finite sample performances. As an illustration, we apply our proposed test in pretesting the serial correlation in predictive regression, where financial variables are used to predict the excess return of S&amp;P 500.},

We devise a noise-calendar-effect estimator by an appropriately scaled average of high-frequency returns that precede a time of day across a large number of trading days. Feasible central limit theorem for the estimator is established under a joint infill and long-span asymptotics. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

In this article, we propose a multi-variate GARCH-type model that can simplify the parameterization by utilizing the network structure that can be appropriately specified for certain types of high-dimensional data. The asymmetry in the dynamics of volatilities is also considered as our model adopts a threshold structure. To enable our model to handle data with extremely high dimension, we investigate the near-epoch dependence (NED) of our model, and the asymptotic properties of our quasi-maximum-likelihood-estimator (QMLE) are derived from the limit theorems for NED random fields. Simulations are conducted to test our theoretical results. At last we fit our model to log-returns of four groups of stocks and the results indicate that bad news is not necessarily more influential on volatility if the network effects are considered.},

However, this article comes to an opposing conclusion. In particular, we show that Breitung&#39;s (2002, Journal of Econometrics 108, 343–363) nonparameteric variance ratio unit root test applied to regression residuals serves as a no-cointegration test but is inferior to its competitors from a local asymptotic power perspective. Nevertheless, in finite samples, the variance ratio test has good size properties, competitive power, and the convenience of being tuning parameter free. In general, we find that short-run dynamics in the error process can have considerably larger detrimental effects on the performance of residual-based no-cointegration tests in finite samples than changes in the only nuisance parameter affecting local asymptotic power of the tests. The results serve as a warning for practitioners and lead to interesting directions for future research.},

In this article, we first propose a simulation and/or bootstrap algorithm to construct optimal point predictors under an L 1 or L 2 loss criterion. In addition, we construct bootstrap prediction intervals in the multi-step ahead prediction problem; in particular, we develop an asymptotically valid quantile prediction interval as well as a pertinent prediction interval for future values. To correct the undercoverage of prediction intervals with finite samples, we further employ predictive – as opposed to fitted – residuals in the bootstrap process.

We focus on an SDPD model with heterogeneous coefficients both in the spatial and exogeneous regression components. We propose a strategy to identify the specific structure of the SDPD model through a multiple testing procedure that allows to choose between a general version of the model and a nested version derived from the general one by imposing restrictions on the parameters. Our proposal can be used to test the homogeneity of the model parameters as well as the absence of specific components, such as spatial effects, dynamic effects or exogenous regressors. It is also possible to use the proposed testing procedure for the identification of relevant locations. The theoretical results highlight the consistency of the testing procedure in the high-dimensional setup, when the number of spatial units goes to infinity and exceeds the number of time-observations per spatial unit. Further, we also conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study, which gives empirical evidence of the good performance of the testing procedure in finite samples.},

One is for discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs), while the other two pertain to generalized spectral means (GSMs). The asymptotic joint normality and independence of the DFT at any finite number of standard frequencies are derived. Additionally, the asymptotic normalities of two GSMs are set up, with asymptotic variances given in different forms, according to the Gaussian or non-Gaussian model assumption.

We state consistency requirements among the finite-dimensional collections of the elements of a regularly varying time series and show that the TPDF&#39;s value does not depend on the dimension of the random vector being considered. So that our models take non-negative values, we use transformed-linear operations. We show existence and stationarity of these models, and develop their properties such as the model TPDFs. We fit models to hourly windspeed and daily fire weather index data, and we find that the fitted transformed-linear models produce better estimates of upper tail quantities than a traditional ARMA model, classical linear regularly varying models, a max-ARMA model, and a Markov model.},

This model is named GQARCH-Itô-Jumps model. Quasi-likelihood functions for the low-frequency GQARCH structure are developed for the parametric estimations. In the quasi-likelihood functions, for high-frequency financial data, the realized range-based estimations are adopted as the ‘observations’, rather than the realized return-based volatility estimators which entail the loss of intra-day information of the price movements. Meanwhile, the asymptotic properties are mainly established for the proposed estimators in the case of finite activity jumps. Moreover, simulation studies and some financial data are implemented to check the finite sample performance of the proposed methodology.},

Quantile double-autoregression is very useful for time series analysis but faces challenges with model fitting of streaming data sets when estimating other quantiles in subsequent batches. This article proposes a renewable estimation method for quantile double-autoregression analysis of streaming time series data due to its ability to break with storage barrier and computational barrier. Moreover, the proposed flexible parametric structure of the quantile function enables us to predict any interested quantile value without quantile curve crossing problem or keeping the desirable monotone property of the conditional quantile function. The proposed methods are illustrated using current data and the summary statistics of historical data. Theoretically, the proposed statistic is shown to have the same asymptotic distribution as the standard version computed on an entire data stream with the data batches pooled into one data set, without additional condition. Simulation studies and an empirical example are presented to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.},

We provide modular investigation into their theoretical properties and show that the combined methodology, named WCM.gSa, achieves consistency in estimating both the total number and the locations of the change points. The good performance of WCM.gSa is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies, and we further illustrate its usefulness by applying the methodology to London air quality data.},

However, in some applications economic forecasts need to be made based on information provided merely by a portion of variates (e.g., removal of a listed stock due to halting, suspension or delisting). This requires a new formulation of forecast based on an embedded subprocess of VAR, whose theoretical properties are often difficult to obtain. To avoid the issue of identifying the VAR subprocess, we propose a computation-based approach so that sophisticated predictions can be made by utilizing a reduced variable information set estimated from sampled data. Such estimated information set allows us to develop a suitable statistical hypothesis testing procedure for characterizing all designated Granger causal relationships, as well as a useful graphical tool for presenting the causal structure over the prediction horizon. Finally, simulated data and a real example from the stock markets are used to illustrate the proposed method.},

It is of interest to estimate the long-memory, long-run covariance and general phase parameters of time series generated by this wide class of models although they are not necessarily Gaussian nor stationary. This estimation is thus not directly possible using real wavelets decomposition or Fourier analysis. Our purpose is to define an inference approach based on a representation using quasi-analytic wavelets. We first show that the covariance of the wavelet coefficients provides an adequate estimator of the covariance structure including the phase term. Consistent estimators based on a local Whittle approximation are then proposed. Simulations highlight a satisfactory behavior of the estimation on finite samples on multivariate fractional Brownian motions.

Moreover, a Bayesian information criterion is introduced for order selection, and a multi-variate mixed portmanteau test is constructed for checking the adequacy of fitted models. All asymptotic properties for estimation, model selection, and portmanteau test are established without any moment restrictions imposed on the data process, which makes the new model and its inference tools applicable for heavy-tailed data.

Under assumptions, empirical versions of the autocovariance and cross-covariance are asymptotically normal with covariance structure depending on the second- and fourth-order spectra. Under non-restrictive assumptions, we derive a bound for the Wasserstein distance of the finite-sample distribution of the estimator of the autocovariance and cross-covariance to the Gaussian limit. An error of approximation to the second-order moments of the estimator and an -dependent approximation are the key ingredients to obtain the bound. As a worked example, we discuss how to compute the bound for causal autoregressive processes of order 1 with different distributions for the innovations. To assess our result, we compare our bound to Wasserstein distances obtained via simulation.},

  abstract     = {Variance estimation is an important aspect in statistical inference, especially in the dependent data situations. Resampling methods are ideal for solving this problem since these do not require restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we develop a novel resampling method in the Jackknife family called the stationary jackknife . It can be used to estimate the variance of a statistic in the cases where observations are from a general stationary sequence. Unlike the moving block jackknife, the stationary jackknife computes the jackknife replication by deleting a variable length block and the length has a truncated geometric distribution. Under appropriate assumptions, we can show the stationary jackknife variance estimator is a consistent estimator for the case of the sample mean and, more generally, for a class of nonlinear statistics. Further, the stationary jackknife is shown to provide reasonable variance estimation for a wider range of expected block lengths when compared with the moving block jackknife by simulation.},

This can lead to d -dimensional VAR( k ) models that are closed with respect to a given partition { S 1 , … , S n } of { 1 , … , d } by specifying marginal serial dependence and some cross-sectional dependence parameters. The special closure property allows one to fit the subprocesses of multi-variate time series before assembling them by fitting the dependence structure between the subprocesses. We revisit the use of the Gaussian copula of the stationary joint distribution of observations in the VAR( ) process with non-Gaussian univariate margins but under the constraint of closure under margins. This construction allows more flexibility in handling higher-dimensional time series and a multi-stage estimation procedure can be used. The proposed class of models is applied to a macro-economic data set and compared with the relevant benchmark models.},

Based on the bias-corrected cross-covariance estimator, we propose a bias-adjusted long run covariance (LRCOV) estimator. We derive the asymptotic relations between the bias-corrected estimators and their conventional Counterparts in both the small- and the fixed- limit. Simulation results show that: (i) our bias-corrected cross-covariance estimators are very effective in eliminating the finite sample bias of their conventional counterparts, with potential mean squared error reduction when the data generating process is highly persistent; and (ii) the bias-adjusted LRCOV estimators can have superior performance to their conventional counterparts with a smaller bias and mean squared error.},

The estimation process is built on a kernel-based objective function with a constant bandwidth (tuning parameter) that is independent of sample size and can be adjusted to maximize efficiency. The asymptotic distribution of the resultant estimator is established under suitable conditions, and the convergence rate is demonstrated to be the same as that in nonlinear mean regression. To numerically estimate the kernel mode-based regression, we develop a modified modal-expectation-maximization algorithm in conjunction with Taylor expansion. A robust Wald-type test statistic derived from the resulting estimator is also provided, along with its asymptotic distribution for the null and alternative hypotheses. The local robustness of the proposed estimation procedure is studied using influence function analysis, and the good finite sample performance of the newly suggested model is verified through Monte Carlo simulations. We finally combine the recommended kernel mode-based regression with neural networks to develop a kernel mode-based neural networks model, the performance of which is evidenced by an empirical examination of exchange rate prediction.},

We classify the stochastic departures into two types: local and moderate. This classification task is completed by investigating the asymptotic behavior of unit root tests that assume the stochastic unit root (STUR) processes as the alternative hypothesis. The stochastic local-to-unity model arises when β = 3 / 4 ; in this case, the test statistics have limiting distributions different from those under the unit root null, and their asymptotic powers are greater than size. Moderate deviations emerge when , in which case the test statistics diverge. We also propose new tests for a unit root against an STUR, whose construction is based on the limit theory developed in this article. To evaluate the performance of these new tests, we derive the limiting Gaussian power envelope under the local alternative from an approximate model.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a multiplicative integer-valued time series model, which is defined as the product of a unit-mean integer-valued independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence, and an integer-valued dependent process. The latter is defined as a binomial thinning operation of its own past and of the past of the observed process. Furthermore, it combines some features of the integer-valued GARCH (INGARCH), the autoregressive conditional duration (ACD), and the integer autoregression (INAR) processes. The proposed model has an unspecified distribution and is able to parsimoniously generate very high overdispersion, persistence, and heavy-tailedness. The dynamic probabilistic structure of the model is first analyzed. In addition, parameter estimation is considered by using a two-stage weighted least squares estimate (2SWLSE), consistency and asymptotic normality (CAN) of which are established under mild conditions. Applications of the proposed formulation to simulated and actual count time series data are provided.},
