Based on this equivalence, we extend the framework of network reconstruction, conditional on row and column sums, toward regression, which allows the inclusion of exogenous covariates and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. More specifically, the mean of the regression model leads to the observed row and column margins. To exemplify the approach, we provide a simulation study and investigate interbank lending data, provided by the Bank for International Settlement. This dataset provides full knowledge of the real network and is, therefore, suitable to evaluate the predictions of our approach.

A novel conditional quasi-likelihood inference procedure is developed, utilizing a stochastic process and the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) to form estimating equations for regression parameters. Our proposal employs conditional inference based on a penalized quasi-likelihood to address within-cluster correlation without need to specify the frailty distribution, bringing the method closer to what suffices for real-world applications. By adopting the Buckley–James estimator in the IPCW, the method further allows for dependent censoring. We establish asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and evaluate its finite sample performance via simulation studies.

We then develop a variational approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter inference and node clustering, and derive a statistical criterion for model selection.

We extend these results to additional Bayesian nonparametric priors such as Gibbs-type processes and finite-dimensional representations thereof. The latter include the Dirichlet multinomial process, the recently proposed Pitman–Yor, and normalized generalized gamma multinomial processes. We show that mixture models based on these processes are also inconsistent in the number of clusters and discuss possible solutions.

Equipped with an efficient algorithm, our proposed reduced additive model outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in numerical studies. However, the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators have not been explored and the empirical findings are short of theoretical explanation. In this work, we fill in the theoretical gap by showing the resulting estimator has faster convergence rate than the estimation without subspace learning; and this is true even when the reduced additive model is only an approximation, provided that the subspace approximation error is small. Moreover, the proposed method is able to consistently identify the relevant predictors. The developed theoretical results back up the earlier empirical findings.},

The scoring rules allow for evaluating the calibration of a model to specific aspects of a point process, such as its spatial distribution or tendency toward clustering. Using simulations, we analyze the sensitivity of our scoring rules to different aspects of the forecasts and compare it to the logarithmic score.

Using adaptive Huber regression (AHR) to achieve the bias and robustness tradeoff, in this paper we propose a robust transfer learning algorithm with high-dimensional covariates, then construct valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests based on the debiased lasso approach. When the transferable sources are known, a two-step ℓ 1 -penalized transfer AHR estimator is firstly proposed and the error bounds are established. To correct the biases caused by the lasso penalty, a unified debiasing framework based on the decorrelated score equations is considered to establish asymptotic normality of the debiased lasso transfer AHR estimator. Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for each component can be constructed. When the transferable sources are unknown, a data-driven source detection algorithm is proposed with theoretical guarantee. Numerical studies verify the performance of our proposed estimator and confidence intervals, and an application to Genotype-Tissue Expression data is also presented.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, various exact balancing-based weighting methods were introduced to the causal inference literature. It eliminates covariate imbalance by imposing balancing constraints in a certain optimization problem, which can nevertheless be infeasible when there is bad overlap between the covariate distributions in the treated and control groups or when the covariates are high dimensional. Recently, approximate balancing was proposed as an alternative balancing framework. It resolves the feasibility issue by using inequality moment constraints instead. However, it can be difficult to select the threshold parameters. Moreover, moment constraints may not fully capture the discrepancy of covariate distributions. In this paper, we propose Mahalanobis balancing to approximately balance covariate distributions from a multivariate perspective. We use a quadratic constraint to control overall imbalance with a single threshold parameter, which can be tuned by a simple selection procedure. We show that the dual problem of Mahalanobis balancing is an norm-based regularized regression problem, and establish interesting connection to propensity score models. We derive asymptotic properties, discuss the high-dimensional scenario, and make extensive numerical comparisons with existing balancing methods.},

The present article discusses these contributions, how they helped shape multivariate analysis as we see it today, and what we may learn from reviewing his works. Topics include his extension of linear discriminant analysis, Rao&#39;s perimeter test, Rao&#39;s U statistic, his asymptotic expansion of Wilks&#39; Λ statistic, canonical factor analysis, functional principal component analysis, redundancy analysis, canonical coordinates, and correspondence analysis. The examination of his works shows that interdisciplinary collaboration and the utilization of real datasets were crucial in almost all of Rao&#39;s impactful contributions.},

This minimax problem typically has a multitude of solutions and the focus of this paper are the statistical properties of these solutions. We address two key statistical issues for the generator and discriminator network parameters, consistent estimation and confidence sets. We first show that the set of solutions to the sample GAN problem is a (Hausdorff) consistent estimator of the set of solutions to the corresponding population GAN problem. We then devise a computationally intensive procedure to form confidence sets and show that these sets contain the population GAN solutions with the desired coverage probability. Small numerical experiments and a Monte Carlo study illustrate our results and verify our theoretical findings. We also show that our results apply in general minimax problems that may be nonconvex, nonconcave, and have multiple solutions.},

The new estimation procedure provides a sparse estimator for the parametric component and achieves the semiparametric efficiency as the oracle maximum likelihood estimator as if the error distribution was known. By employing the penalized estimation and the semiparametric efficiency theory for ultra-high-dimensional partial linear model, the procedure enjoys the oracle variable selection property and offers efficiency gain for non-Gaussian random errors, while maintaining the same efficiency as the least squares-based estimator for Gaussian random errors. Extensive simulation studies and an empirical application are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

The metric tensor is built from symmetric positive semidefinite log-density gradient covariance (LGC) matrices, which are also proposed and further explored here. The LGCs generalize the Fisher information matrix by measuring the joint information content and dependence structure of both a random variable and the parameters of said variable. Consequently, positive definite Fisher/LGC-based metric tensors may be constructed not only from the observation likelihoods as is current practice, but also from arbitrarily complicated nonlinear prior/latent variable structures, provided the LGC may be derived for each conditional distribution used to construct said structures. The proposed methodology is highly automatic and allows for exploitation of any sparsity associated with the model in question. When implemented in conjunction with a Riemann manifold variant of the recently proposed numerical generalized randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo processes, the proposed methodology is highly competitive, in particular for the more challenging target distributions associated with Bayesian hierarchical models.},

We present such a causal parameter that is based on principal stratification and is identified under the exclusion of a treatment effect among the nonresponders. We focus on time-to-event outcomes allowing for right censoring, and construct a doubly robust and efficient estimator based on the associated efficient influence function.

A main challenge of this design is that data are a biased dependent sample due to stratification and sampling without replacement. Most literature on regression approximates this design by Bernoulli sampling but variance is generally overestimated. Even with this approximation, the limiting distribution of the inverse probability weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator involves a general Gaussian process, and hence quantiles of its supremum is not analytically available. In this paper, we provide a rigorous asymptotic theory for the weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator accounting for dependence in the sample. We propose the novel hybrid method to both simulate and bootstrap parts of the limiting process to compute confidence bands with asymptotically correct coverage probability. Simulation study indicates that the proposed bands are appropriate for practical use. A Wilms tumor example is presented.},

For design comparison, the notion of evenness of two-dimensional grid designs is developed. The mathematical relationship between the design and the supremum of the mean squared prediction error (SMSPE) function is studied and then optimal designs are explored for both prospective and retrospective design scenarios. In the case of prospective designs, the new design is developed before the experiment is conducted and the regularly spaced grid is shown to be the G-optimal design. Retrospective designs are constructed by adding or deleting points from an already existing design. Deterministic algorithms are developed to find the best possible retrospective designs (which minimizes the SMSPE). It is found that a more evenly spread design under the G-optimality criterion leads to the best possible retrospective design. For all the cases of finding the optimal prospective designs and the best possible retrospective designs, both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks have been considered. The proposed methodology for finding retrospective designs is illustrated with a spatiotemporal river water quality monitoring experiment.},

We propose an LGC-based bootstrap test for examining whether the dependence structure between two variables is equal across different regimes. We examine this test in a Monte Carlo study, where it shows good level and power properties. We argue that this approach is more intuitive than competing approaches, typically combining regime-switching models with copula theory. Furthermore, LGC is a semi-parametric approach, hence avoids any parametric specification of the dependence structure. We illustrate our approach using financial returns from the US–UK stock markets and the US stock and government bond markets, and provide detailed insight into their dependence structures.},

  abstract     = {In survival analysis, cure models have been developed to account for the presence of cured subjects that will never experience the event of interest. Mixture cure models with a parametric model for the incidence and a semiparametric model for the survival of the susceptibles are particularly common in practice. Because of the latent cure status, maximum likelihood estimation is performed via the iterative EM algorithm. Here, we focus on the cure probabilities and propose a two-step procedure to improve upon the maximum likelihood estimator when the sample size is not large. The new method is based on presmoothing by first constructing a nonparametric estimator and then projecting it on the desired parametric class. We investigate the theoretical properties of the resulting estimator and show through an extensive simulation study for the logistic-Cox model that it outperforms the existing method. Practical use of the method is illustrated through two melanoma datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspherical kernel density estimators (KDE), which use a parametric distribution as a guide, are studied in this paper. The main benefit is that these estimators improve the bias of nonguided kernel density estimators when the parametric guiding distribution is not too far from the true density, while preserving the variance. When using a von Mises-Fisher density as guide, the proposal performs as well as the classical KDE, even when the guiding model is incorrect, and far from the true distribution. This benefit is particular for the hyperspherical setting given its compact support, and is in contrast to similar methods for real valued data. Moreover, we deal with the important issue of data-driven selection of the smoothing parameter. Simulations and real data examples illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method, also in comparison with other recently proposed estimation methods.},

We show that the quadratic inference function estimators do not always exist and propose a way to handle this. We then show that they have unbounded influence functions and can be more or less asymptotically efficient than generalized estimating equations estimators. We also present empirical evidence to demonstrate these results. We conclude that the choice of working correlation can have surprisingly large effects.},

In this work, we propose a bootstrap-based estimator for this limit and establish its consistency, in particular, by Le Cam&#39;s third lemma. As an application, we consider in simulation studies adjustments to existing robust tests for treatment effects with survival data by the proposed estimator. It shows that the adjusted tests achieve a size close to the nominal level, and unlike other designs, the robust tests without adjustment may have an asymptotic size inflation issue under the minimization method.},

Up to now, however, the set of valid auxiliary functions for vMR has neither been characterized completely nor separated from those for VR . We contribute to the current literature by introducing “universal” auxiliary functions which are valid for both VR and vMR representations for the entire MDA distribution families. Then we identify exactly the sets of valid auxiliary functions for both VR and vMR .

In high dimensions, however, the construction of flexible and parsimonious models is challenging. We propose to combine bivariate max-stable distributions into a Markov random field with respect to a tree. Although in general not max-stable itself, this Markov tree is attracted by a multivariate max-stable distribution. The latter serves as a tree-based approximation to an unknown max-stable distribution with the given bivariate distributions as margins. Given data, we learn an appropriate tree structure by Prim&#39;s algorithm with estimated pairwise upper tail dependence coefficients as edge weights. The distributions of pairs of connected variables can be fitted in various ways. The resulting tree-structured max-stable distribution allows for inference on rare event probabilities, as illustrated on river discharge data from the upper Danube basin.},

Furthermore, we use the approximations to derive estimators of the mean squared error (MSE) which are correct to order o ⁢ ( 1 / n ) . Since the variance of many estimators is of order O ⁢ ( 1 / n ) , this level of precision is needed for the MSE estimator to properly take the variance into account.

Lastly, we illustrate the methods on data containing the number of battle deaths in all major inter-state wars between 1823 and the present day.

Focusing on distance-based outcomes that preserve information without truncating any features, a class of semiparametric regression has been developed, which encapsulates multiple sources of high-dimensional variables using pairwise outcomes of between-subject attributes. Further, we propose a strategy to address the interlocking correlations among pairs via the U-statistics-based estimating equations (UGEE), which correspond to their unique efficient influence function (EIF). Hence, the resulting semiparametric estimators are robust to distributional misspecification while enjoying root- n consistency and asymptotic optimality to facilitate inference. In essence, the proposed approach not only circumvents information loss due to feature selection but also improves the model&#39;s interpretability and computational feasibility. Simulation studies and applications to the human microbiome and wearables data are provided, where the feature dimensions are tens of thousands.},

The truncation is based on a decreasing sequence of random weights, thus having a lower approximation error compared to the popular truncated stick-breaking process. We develop an exact simulation algorithm to sample from the approximation process and provide an alternative MCMC algorithm for the parameter regime where the exact simulation algorithm becomes slow. The effectiveness of the simulation algorithms is demonstrated by the estimation of the functionals of a Pitman–Yor process. Then we adapt the approximation process into a Pitman–Yor process mixture model and devise a blocked Gibbs sampler for posterior inference.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of estimating the mixing time of a Markov chain from a single trajectory of observations. Unlike most previous works which employed Hilbert space methods to estimate spectral gaps, we opt for an approach based on contraction with respect to total variation. Specifically, we estimate the contraction coefficient introduced in Wolfer (2020), inspired from Dobrushin&#39;s. This quantity, unlike the spectral gap, controls the mixing time up to strong universal constants and remains applicable to nonreversible chains. We improve existing fully data-dependent confidence intervals around this contraction coefficient, which are both easier to compute and thinner than spectral counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel analysis beyond the worst-case scenario by leveraging additional information about the transition matrix. This allows us to derive instance-dependent rates for estimating the matrix with respect to the induced uniform norm, and some of its mixing properties.},

It is proved that a proper normalization of the NU-INARCH process weakly converges to a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross diffusion in the Skorohod topology. The asymptotic distribution of the conditional least squares estimator of the correlation parameter is established as a functional of certain stochastic integrals. Numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations are provided to verify the behavior of the asymptotic distribution under finite samples. These simulations reveal that the nearly unstable approach provides satisfactory and better results than those based on the stationarity assumption even when the true process is not that close to nonstationarity. A unit root test is proposed and its Type-I error and power are examined via Monte Carlo simulations. As an illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the daily number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.},

First, we allow the covariate effects to be quantile-dependent and nonlinear. Second, we allow parameterizing the conditional quantile functions by appropriate basis functions, rather than parametrically. We are thereby able to test for general functional forms, while retaining linear effects as special cases. In both cases, the induced class of conditional distribution functions is tested with a Cramér–von Mises type test statistic for which we derive the theoretical limit distribution and propose a bootstrap method. Third, a modified test statistic is derived to increase the power of the tests. We highlight the merits of our tests in a detailed MC study and two real data examples. Our first application to conditional income distributions in Germany indicates that there are not only still significant differences between East and West but also across the quantiles of the conditional income distributions, when conditioning on age and year. The second application to data from the Australian national electricity market reveals the importance of using interaction effects for modeling the highly skewed and heavy-tailed distributions of energy prices conditional on day, time of day and demand.},

In this paper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between the conventional notions of missing at random and missing not at random in generalized linear models in the presence of instrumental variables. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy measures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when missing at random does not hold. We show that our testing approach achieves an objective data-oriented choice between missing at random or not.

The proposed estimator acts on the empirically accessible binary digital images of the excursion regions and computes the length of a piecewise linear approximation of the excursion boundary. The estimator is shown to be consistent as the pixel size decreases, without the need of any normalization constant, and with neither assumption of Gaussianity nor isotropy imposed on the underlying random field. In this general framework, even when the domain grows to cover ℝ 2 $$ {\mathbb{R}}^2 $$ , the estimation error is shown to be of smaller order than the side length of the domain. For affine, strongly mixing random fields, this translates to a multivariate Central Limit Theorem for our estimator when multiple levels are considered simultaneously. Finally, we conduct several numerical studies to investigate statistical properties of the proposed estimator in the finite-sample data setting.},

The methods are favoured because their intervals have a shorter average length than the Clopper–Pearson (gold-standard) method, whose intervals really are confidence intervals. As the definition of a confidence interval is not being adhered to, another criterion for forming interval estimates for a binomial proportion is needed. In this paper, we suggest a new criterion for forming one-sided intervals and equal-tail two-sided intervals. Methods which meet the criterion are said to yield locally correct confidence intervals . We propose a method that yields such intervals and prove that its intervals have a shorter average length than those of any other method that meets the criterion. Compared with the Clopper–Pearson method, the proposed method gives intervals with an appreciably smaller average length. For confidence levels of practical interest, the mid- method also satisfies the new criterion and has its own optimality property. It gives locally correct confidence intervals that are only slightly wider than those of the new method.},

The concept of a noncase is introduced to allow for the imputation of the missing genuine cases. The odds ratio parameter of the genuine cases compared to controls is of interest. The imputation procedure predicts the probability of being a genuine case compared to a noncase semiparametrically in a dimension reduction fashion. This procedure is flexible, and vastly generalizes the existing methods. We establish the root- n $$ n $$ asymptotic normality of the odds ratio parameter estimator. Our method yields stable odds ratio parameter estimation owing to the application of an efficient semiparametric sufficient dimension reduction estimator. We conduct finite sample numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of our approach, and apply it to a dilated cardiomyopathy study.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of absorption time distributions of Markov jump processes is an important task in various branches of statistics and applied probability. While the time-homogeneous case is classic, the time-inhomogeneous case has recently received increased attention due to its added flexibility and advances in computational power. However, commuting sub-intensity matrices are assumed, which in various cases limits the parsimonious properties of the resulting representation. This paper develops the theory required to solve the general case through maximum likelihood estimation, and in particular, using the expectation-maximization algorithm. A reduction to a piecewise constant intensity matrix function is proposed in order to provide succinct representations, where a parametric linear model binds the intensities together. Practical aspects are discussed and illustrated through the estimation of notoriously demanding theoretical distributions and real data, from the perspective of matrix analytic methods.},

  abstract     = {The statistical design for order-of-addition (OofA) experiments has received much recent interest as its potential in determining the optimal sequence of multiple components, for example, the optimal sequence of drug administration for disease treatment. The traditional OofA experiments focus mainly on the sequence effects of components, that is, the experimenters fix the factor level of each component and observe how the response is affected by varying the sequences of components. However, the components may also have factorial effects in that changing their factor levels in a given sequence can affect the response. In view of this, we consider the design problem for OofA experiments where each component is experimented at two levels. A systematic method is given to construct OofA designs that jointly considers the sequence design and factorial design for all components. By appropriately choosing the sequence and factorial designs, we show that the combination of the two parts results in a balanced design with an economical run size. Moreover, the constructed designs enjoy a number of optimality properties such as -, - and -optimalities under some empirical models. The design method proposed can be extended to some other practical situations like the number of process variables is different from the number of components, and OofA experiments with multilevel components.},

  abstract     = {Isotonic regression or monotone function estimation is a problem of estimating function values under monotonicity constraints, which appears naturally in many scientific fields. This paper proposes a new Bayesian method with global–local shrinkage priors for estimating monotone function values. Specifically, we introduce half shrinkage priors for positive valued random variables and assign them for the first-order differences of function values. We also develop fast and simple Gibbs sampling algorithms for full posterior analysis. By incorporating advanced shrinkage priors, the proposed method is adaptive to local abrupt changes or jumps in target functions. We show this adaptive property theoretically by proving that the posterior mean estimators are robust to large differences and that asymptotic risk for unchanged points can be improved. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed methods through simulations and applications to a real data set.},

  abstract     = {In multiple regression, when covariates are numerous, it is often reasonable to assume that only a small number of them has predictive information. In some medical applications for instance, it is believed that only a few genes out of thousands are responsible for cancer. In that case, the aim is not only to propose a good fit, but also to select the relevant covariates (genes). We propose to perform model selection with additive models in high dimensions (sample size and number of covariates). Our approach is computationally efficient thanks to fast wavelet transforms, it does not rely on cross validation, and it solves a convex optimization problem for a prescribed penalty parameter, called the quantile universal threshold. We also propose a second rule based on Stein unbiased risk estimation geared toward prediction. We use Monte Carlo simulations and real data to compare various methods based on false discovery rate (FDR), true positive rate (TPR) and mean squared error. Our approach is the only one to handle high dimensions, and has a good FDR–TPR trade-off.},

In the finite case, the graph can be recovered with probability one. In contrast, we can recover any finite subgraph with probability one in the countable infinite case by allowing the candidate neighborhoods to grow as a function o ⁡ ( log ⁡ n ) $$ o\left(\log n\right) $$ , with n $$ n $$ the sample size. Our method requires minimal assumptions on the probability distribution, and contrary to other approaches in the literature, the usual positivity condition is not needed.

Such methods, and their Bayesian counterparts, are not invariant to scalar multiplication of the variables, unless one standardizes the observed data to unit sample variances. We show that such standardization can have a strong effect on inference and introduce a new family of penalties based on partial correlations. We show that the latter, as well as the maximum likelihood, and logarithmic penalties are scale invariant. We illustrate the use of one such penalty, the partial correlation graphical LASSO, which sets an penalty on partial correlations. The associated optimization problem is no longer convex, but is conditionally convex. We show via simulated examples and in two real datasets that, besides being scale invariant, there can be important gains in terms of inference.},

By applying the conditional expectation directly to the kernel-weighted least squares of the deviations between the local linear approximation and the observed responses, the proposed algorithm successfully bypasses the simulation step in the classical simulation extrapolation, thus significantly reducing the computational time. It is noted that the proposed method also provides an exact form of the extrapolation function, although the extrapolation estimate generally cannot be obtained by simply setting the extrapolation variable to negative one in the fitted extrapolation function, if the bandwidth is less than the SD of the measurement error. Large sample properties of the proposed estimation procedure are discussed, as well as simulation studies and a real data example being conducted to illustrate its applications.},
