  abstract     = {In this study, it is aimed to establish a novel method based on a deep-learning-guided surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique to achieve rapid and accurate classification of vaginal cleanliness levels. We proposed a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach to enhance spectral quality, coupled with a deep learning algorithm long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze SERS spectra produced by vaginal secretions. The performance of various machine learning (ML) algorithms is assessed using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, the reliability of the optimal model is tested using blind test data ( N = 10/group for each cleanliness level). The data quality of the SERS fingerprints of four types of vaginal secretions is significantly improved after VAE decoding and reconstruction. The signal-to-noise ratio of the generated spectra increased from the original 2.58–11.13. Among all algorithms, the VAE–LSTM algorithm demonstrates the best prediction ability and time efficiency. Additionally, blind test datasets yielded an overall accuracy of 85%. In this study, it is concluded that the deep-learning-guided SERS technique holds significant potential in rapidly distinguishing between different levels of vaginal cleanliness through human vaginal secretion samples. This contributes to the efficient diagnosis of vaginal cleanliness levels in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of skin cancer ensures the survival of many cases. There are still challenges in segmenting dermoscopic skin lesion images. Artifacts in the lesion images, such as various dirt, hairs, low contrast, and unclear boundaries, are challenges that affect segmentation accuracy. Convolutional neural networks have brought success in skin lesion segmentation. U-shaped and V-shaped deep learning-based segmentation architectures learn boundary information in the first layers. However, this information becomes weaker in the following layers. Herein, the Edge-aTtention module is added to the V-Net architecture to move edge information to the last layer, and the spatial and channel squeeze-excitation module is added to emphasize high-level features by recalibrating the channel information to learn lesion boundaries better. The scSEETV-Net is supported by fusing the binary cross-entropy, which calculates the loss on a pixel-based, and the focal Twersky loss function, which has significant success in class imbalances. The proposed architecture achieves 0.9212 Jaccard and 0.9552 Dice in the ISIC2016 dataset, 0.8273 Jaccard and 0.8949 Dice in the ISIC2017 dataset, and 0.8070 Jaccard and 0.8831 Dice in the ISIC2018 dataset.

Nevertheless, the automated navigation of multiple optical microrobots in intricate, dynamic environments over extended distances remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile control strategy aimed at navigating optical microrobotic swarms to distant targets under obstacles of varying sizes, shapes, and velocities is introduced. By confining all microrobots within a manipulation domain, swarm integrity is ensured while mitigating the effects of Brownian motion. Obstacle&#39;s elliptical approximation is developed to facilitate efficient obstacle avoidance for microrobotic swarms. Additionally, several supplementary functions are integrated to enhance swarm robustness and intelligence, addressing uncertainties such as swarm collapse, particle immobilization, and anomalous laser–obstacle interactions in real microscopic environments. We further demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our proposed strategy by achieving autonomous long-distance navigation to a series of targets. This strategy is compatible with both optical trapping- and nudging-based microrobotic swarms, representing a significant advancement in enabling optical microrobots to undertake complex tasks such as drug delivery and nanosurgery and understanding collective motions.},

However, it remains difficult for existing methods to achieve the trade-off of the three key criteria in interpretability, namely, reliability, understandability, and usability, which hinder their practical applications. In this article, we propose a self-supervised automatic semantic interpretable explainable artificial intelligence (AS-XAI) framework, which utilizes transparent orthogonal embedding semantic extraction spaces and row-centered principal component analysis (PCA) for global semantic interpretation of model decisions in the absence of human interference, without additional computational costs. In addition, the invariance of filter feature high-rank decomposition is used to evaluate model sensitivity to different semantic concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that robust and orthogonal semantic spaces can be automatically extracted by AS-XAI, providing more effective global interpretability for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generating human-comprehensible explanations. The proposed approach offers broad fine-grained extensible practical applications, including shared semantic interpretation under out-of-distribution (OOD) categories, auxiliary explanations for species that are challenging to distinguish, and classification explanations from various perspectives. In a systematic evaluation by users with varying levels of AI knowledge, AS-XAI demonstrated superior “glass box” characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic computing systems promise high energy efficiency and low latency. In particular, when integrated with neuromorphic sensors, they can be used to produce intelligent systems for a broad range of applications. An event-based camera is such a neuromorphic sensor, inspired by the sparse and asynchronous spike representation of the biological visual system. However, processing the event data requires either using expensive feature descriptors to transform spikes into frames, or using spiking neural networks (SNNs) that are expensive to train. In this work, a neural network architecture is proposed, reservoir nodes-enabled neuromorphic vision sensing network (RN-Net), based on dynamic temporal encoding by on-sensor reservoirs and simple deep neural network (DNN) blocks. The reservoir nodes enable efficient temporal processing of asynchronous events by leveraging the native dynamics of the node devices, while the DNN blocks enable spatial feature processing. Combining these blocks in a hierarchical structure, the RN-Net offers efficient processing for both local and global spatiotemporal features. RN-Net executes dynamic vision tasks created by event-based cameras at the highest accuracy reported to date at one order of magnitude smaller network size. The use of simple DNN and standard backpropagation-based training rules further reduces implementation and training costs.},

This strategy leverages the periodic motion characteristics of the LIPM, deriving the correct footstep compensation based on the conditions for model stability restoration. The module generates the zero moment point planning trajectories based on the footstep compensation. In the motion optimization module, motion optimization based on reactive planning is performed. To make motion constraint based on capture point applicable to motion optimization, the impact of different truncation points on stability constraints to determine the appropriate truncation point is quantified.

These intricate formations frequently appear during the nitriding treatment of medium- to high-carbon alloy steels. To navigate the multifaceted characteristics of such architectures, CNN-based methodologies are synergized with high-throughput thermodynamic computations via Thermo-Calc. This integration aims to quantify both the theoretical upper bounds and the actual values of the VLSs. By establishing deep neural network models for both theoretical upper bounds and actual measurements, the gap between thermodynamics and thermokinetics in the nitriding process is bridged. Applying this amalgamated predictive schema to 8Cr4Mo4V steel, a groundbreaking departure from conventional paradigms that exclusively depend on thermodynamic calculation-based diffusion models is effectuated. The emergent model yields transformative implications for the metallurgical sector, paving the way for the refinement of future nitriding algorithms and enhancements in nitriding methodologies.},

  abstract     = {The cluster analysis of materials categorizes them according to similarities based on the features of materials, providing insight into the relationship between the materials. Conventional cluster analyses typically use basic features derived from the chemical composition and crystal structure without considering target material properties such as the bandgap and dielectric constant. However, such approaches do not meet demands for grading materials according to properties of interest simultaneously with chemical and structural similarities. Herein, a clustering method grouping similar materials in terms of both the target properties and basic features is proposed. The clustering is compared considering the cohesive energy with that considering the bandgap of metal oxides, showing that their categorizations are clearly different. Further, several clusters classified by the bandgap are analyzed, and coordination environments related to each range of the bandgap are revealed. The clustering for the electronic static dielectric constant identifies a cluster involving several perovskite-type oxides and balancing with the bandgap near the Pareto front. The method enables analyses with different viewpoints from those of the conventional clustering and feature importance analyses by taking the relationship between the target property and the basic features into account.},

  abstract     = {Morphing origami has numerous potential engineering applications owing to its intrinsic morphing features from 2D planes to 3D surfaces. However, the current 1D hinge deformation-driven transformation of foldable origami with rigid or slightly deformable panels cannot achieve a 3D complex and large curvilinear morphing. Moreover, most active origami structures use thin hinges with soft materials on their creases, thus resulting in a lower load capability. This study proposes a novel origami morphing method demonstrating large free-form surface morphing, such as Euclidean to non-Euclidean surface morphing with shape-locking. Tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels is embedded during the extrusion-based 3D printing of shape memory polymers. The extrusion-based 3D printing of isotropic SMPs can produce tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels during fabrication, which can realize significant non-Euclidean surface morphing with multiple deformation modes. The connecting topology of the origami unit cells influences the global morphing behavior owing to the interaction of the deformation of adjacent panels. Non-Euclidean morphing integrated with 4D printing can provide multimodal shape locking at material and structural levels.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic microrobots have the potential for anti-cancer drug delivery; however, using dual-drug to counter drug resistance, a critical issue in cancer research, has only been briefly investigated. This study introduces the double-layered metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs)-based microswimmers for sustained dual-drug delivery. These microswimmers are made up of ZIF-8 and MIL-100, biocompatible MOFs, that can selectively adsorb two types of drugs. The MOFs increase the surface area of the microswimmers by ≈2.42 times, which greatly enhances drug adsorption, and improves hydrophilicity, which reduces adhesion for surface locomotion. Their biocompatibility and dual-drug adsorption are verified through cell viability and drug-loading tests. The microswimmers have remarkable versatility in loading different drug combinations (DHA + 5-FU, CPT-11, or DOX), indicating the potential for adaptive therapy. They can inhibit cancer cells for up to 72 h through the sustained release of dual drugs. In contrast, drug treatments without microswimmers only inhibit cell proliferation for 24 h, leading to a significant rebound. This study provides a method to mass fabricate fully biocompatible microrobots with dual drug loading versatility and high drug adsorption capacity; thus, suggests a powerful platform for sustained adaptive dual-drug therapy.},

Herein, event–visual–inertial state estimation and 3D dense mapping (EVI-SAM) are introduced to tackle the problem of pose tracking and 3D dense reconstruction using the monocular event camera. A novel event-based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment. Specifically, an event-based 2D–2D alignment is developed to construct the photometric constraint and tightly integrated with the event-based reprojection constraint. The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image-guided event-based mapping method. Subsequently, the appearance, texture, and surface mesh of the 3D scene can be reconstructed by fusing the dense depth map from multiple viewpoints using truncated signed distance function fusion. To the best of knowledge, this is the first nonlearning work to realize event-based dense mapping. Numerical evaluations are performed on both publicly available datasets, which qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method. EVI-SAM effectively balances accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing superior pose tracking and dense mapping performance in challenging scenarios.},

In this work, SmokeNav, a novel system that combines data from an inertial sensor and millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, is proposed to enhance situational awareness for first responders in smoky environments. SmokeNav utilizes an inertial positioning module that exploits the human motion constraints with a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit to provide accurate user localization. By integrating this location information with mmWave radar data, it employs a probabilistic occupancy map construction to reconstruct an accurate metric map. To enable semantic understanding of the environment, a DNN-based semantic segmentation model that incorporates radar reflectivity and employs focal loss to improve performance is introduced. Herein, extensive real-world experiments in smoky environments is conducted to demonstrate that SmokeNav precisely localizes the user and generates detailed maps with semantic segmentation. In this work, potentials are held for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of first responders in hazardous conditions.},

While most docking programs usually manage to produce at least a near-native pose for a bioactive molecule inside its binding pocket, their integrated classical scoring functions (SFs) generally fail to prioritize this pose. Many studies have been carried out to tackle this SF problem, offering multiple pose refinement and/or classification methods, albeit with limitations. This study presents a new support vector machine model for pose classification, called “ClassyPose”, which predicts the probability that a receptor-bound ligand conformation could be near-native, without any additional pose optimization step. Trained on protein-ligand extended connectivity features extracted from over 21 600 crystal and docking poses of diverse ligands, this model outperformed other machine-learning algorithms and three existing SFs in terms of docking power, identifying the native ligand pose as top-ranked solution for more than 90% of entries in two test sets. It also achieved high specificity (above 0.96), and improved VS performance when used for pose selection.

The ocean is of particular interest as the monitoring of microplastics presents a challenge in that in situ fluid stream solutions are not readily available and traditional sampling methods are labor-intensive and costly. This study introduces an imaging-based lensless polarization-sensitive fluid stream analyzer (FSA) for automated, label-free, and cost-effective detection and classification of microplastics. The FSA incorporates digital in-line holography and birefringence computation, enabling quantitative polarization-sensitive imaging and machine-learning-based activities including sample classification. Birefringent textures of synthetic polymers are investigated owing to their optical anisotropy. A microplastic classifier is developed for the FSA and integrated to form an end-to-end workflow capable of sampling fluid streams and determining marine and microplastic particle presence. Cultures of two phytoplankton species form a simplified marine environment for FSA evaluation. The device is tested in a two-class configuration for marine microorganisms and microplastics, as well as a five-class configuration for marine microorganisms and four individual microplastic types (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene). The results demonstrate high classification accuracy, supported by experiments in the simulated marine environment that validate the proposed implementation&#39;s efficacy.},

Soft capsule microrobots that integrate capabilities such as magnetic navigation, autonomous maneuverability, in situ biodegradation, biosafe imaging, and drug delivery are reported. These microrobots are fabricated within the range of 20–120 μm, with a notable throughput of ≈10 2 –10 3 microrobots per second. Furthermore, their locomotion performance has been demonstrated to remain stable for a period exceeding 10 h, all while employing real-time optical closed-loop control. The incorporation of ultrasound contrast agents not only amplifies imaging resolution but also ensures imaging contrast stability in a biological environment for over a period of 3 h. Second, the intentional integration of enzyme-loaded nanometric polymersomes establishes a self-contained, biodegradable system, accentuating the microrobots’ capacity to degrade without the addition of high enzyme concentrations.

While an increasing number of studies adopt identical pulse programming (IPP) with short width to update the conductance of HfO 2 -based FTJs synaptic devices, conventional ferroelectric switching models fall short in describing updates the conductance with the IPP scheme. Consequently, studies achieving conductance updates via IPP lack an underlying mechanism explanation, potentially limiting the application of HfO 2 -based FTJs as synaptic devices. This study explores the potential of ferroelectric Zr-doped HfO 2 (HZO) FTJs to undergo learning through the IPP scheme. Synaptic characteristics, including the number of conductance states, symmetry, linearity, write energy, and latency by modulating IPP scheme conditions are optimized.

Recently, AI-based classification of colorimetric assays has been increasingly reported.

Therefore, in this study, an AI-based regression model with enhanced accuracy is developed and integrated into a microfluidic paper-based analytical device for simultaneous colorimetric measurements of glucose, cholesterol, and pH. The model is also embedded into a smartphone via a custom-designed Android application named ChemiCheck to complete on-site colorimetric quantification without internet access in under 1 s. The results demonstrate that the integrated system is able to sensitively detect both glucose (limit of detection [LOD]: 131 ) and cholesterol (LOD: 217 ), concluding the entire analysis within minutes while maintaining a maximum root mean square error of 0.386. Overall, the integrated platform holds great promise for point-of-care testing and offers numerous advantages, including easy-to-use operation, rapid response, low-cost, high selectivity, and consistent repeatability, particularly in nonlaboratory and resource-limited environments.},

  abstract     = {To solve the problems of existing hybrid networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers, we propose a new encoder–decoder network FI-Net based on CNN-Transformer for medical image segmentation. In the encoder part, a dual-stream encoder is used to capture local details and long-range dependencies. Moreover, the attentional feature fusion module is used to perform interactive feature fusion of dual-branch features, maximizing the retention of local details and global semantic information in medical images. At the same time, the multi-scale feature aggregation module is used to aggregate local information and capture multi-scale context to mine more semantic details. The multi-level feature bridging module is used in skip connections to bridge multi-level features and mask information to assist multi-scale feature interaction. Experimental results on seven public medical image datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our method. In future work, we plan to extend FI-Net to support 3D medical image segmentation tasks and combine self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to alleviate the overfitting problem of limited data training.},

  abstract     = {Surgical simulators are valuable educational tools for physicians, enhancing their proficiency and improving patient safety. However, they typically still suffer from a lack of realism as they do not emulate dynamic tissue biomechanics haptically and fail to convincingly mimic real-time physiological reactions. This study presents a dynamic tactile synthetic tissue, integrating both sensory and actuatory capabilities within a fully soft unit, as a core component for soft robotics and future hybrid surgical simulators utilizing dynamic physical phantoms. The adaptive surface of the tissue replica, actuated via hydraulics, is assessed by an embedded carbon black silicone sensor layer using electrical impedance tomography to determine internally or externally induced deformations. The integrated fluid chambers enable pressure and force measurements. The combination of these principles enables real-time tissue feedback as well as closed loop operation, allowing optimal interaction with the environment. Based on the concepts of soft robotics, such artificial tissues find broad applicability, demonstrated via a soft gripper and surgical simulation applications including a dynamic, artificial brain phantom as well as a synthetic, beating heart. These advancements pave the way toward enhanced realism in surgical simulators including reliable performance evaluation and bear the potential to transform the future of surgical training methodologies.},

In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This article proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT is developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow .},

  abstract     = {Automated live embryo imaging has transformed in vitro fertilization (IVF) into a data-intensive field. Unlike clinicians who rank embryos from the same IVF cycle cohort based on the embryos visual quality and determine how many embryos to transfer based on clinical factors, machine learning solutions usually combine these steps by optimizing for implantation prediction and using the same model for ranking the embryos within a cohort. Herein, it is established that this strategy can lead to suboptimal selection of embryos. It is revealed that despite enhancing implantation prediction, inclusion of clinical properties hampers ranking. Moreover, it is found that ambiguous labels of failed implantations, due to either low-quality embryos or poor clinical factors, confound both the optimal ranking and even implantation prediction. To overcome these limitations, conceptual and practical steps are proposed to enhance machine learning-driven IVF solutions. These consist of separating the optimizing of implantation from ranking by focusing on visual properties for ranking and reducing label ambiguity.},

A technique to provide insulation and mechanical resistance using thermoplastic polyurethane and polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene/barium titanate composite is developed. Such insulated conductive elastics are then used to fabricate highly sensitive twisted yarn capacitive sensors. A textile glove is subsequently embedded with such sensors. The wireless measurement and transmission system demonstrate efficacy in capturing capacitance variations upon strain and monitoring hand motions.

  abstract     = {As robotics and intelligence increasingly integrate into surgery, the pivotal role of human–robot interaction (HRI) in surgical procedures and outcomes becomes evident. However, debate rages over whether increasing robot autonomy will result in less human involvement. Some scholars assert that autonomy will reduce human participation, whereas others contend it will result in more complex interactions. To reveal the role of HRI in the evolution of autonomous surgery, this review systematically explores the HRI of robotic surgery with various levels of autonomy. The HRI is examined from both robotic science and clinical practice perspectives, incorporating relevant case studies. Two key components, intention detection and situation awareness, are especially concerned with a brief description of the interfaces and control strategies they rely on. Additional insights are drawn from analogous technologies in aviation, industrial robotics, and autonomous vehicles. The analysis suggests that HRI complexity tends to increase as the robot transitions from no autonomy to conditional autonomy and is predicted to subsequently decrease with a substantial shift in the interaction form when moving toward full autonomy. It is concluded by highlighting challenges from technical and clinical perspectives and delineating research trends in this rapidly evolving field.},

Herein, threshold switching in oxyvanite (V 3 O 5 ) memristors and their application as a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron are explored. The spiking response of individual neurons is examined as a function of circuit parameters, input pulse train, and temperature and reveals a pulse height-dependent spike rate in which devices exhibit excitatory spiking behavior under low input voltages and protective inhibition spiking under high voltages. Resistively coupled LIF neurons are shown to exhibit additional neural functionalities (i.e., phasic, regular and adaptation, etc.) depending on the input voltage and circuit parameters. The behavior of both individual and coupled neurons is shown to be described by a physics-based lumped element circuit model, which therefore provides a solid foundation for exploring more complex systems. Finally, the performance of a perceptron SNN employing these LIF neurons is assessed by simulating the classification of image recognition algorithm. These results advance the development of robust solid-state neurons with low power consumption for neuromorphic computing.},

At present, the variable-stiffness design of robotic fish still suffers from structural complexity, severe deformation, and small variation range, which limits the application of variable-stiffness theory in robotic fish. In this article, a variable-stiffness tail is designed based on layer-jamming for robotic fish, which can conveniently achieve online stiffness adjustment while maintaining the optimal stiffness distribution and the shape is unaffected. A modeling method for the tail is proposed by combining the mechanical characteristics of the layer-jamming structure with the pseudo-rigid body model. To validate the performance of the tail, a series of experiments are conducted, which show that the stiffness variation range of the tail is around 10 times, and the accuracy of the model in predicting the kinematics of the tail is also verified. Moreover, the thrust tests demonstrate that stiffness adjustment is beneficial for fish swimming at different frequencies. The proposed variable-stiffness tail will promote the development of efficient underwater biomimetic robots.},

Experimental results show the significant advantages of the ECFD model over existing models. The best integration of feature extraction is determined and the superiorities of robust stability in the face of new and small samples are highlighted. In addition, the methodological framework highlights the explainability of the model, the mechanisms of drug resistance and drug combination treatment strategies based on explainable analyses and biological networks.

NetDRm is designed for datasets of multidimensional points that can be either structured (e.g., images) or unstructured (e.g., point clouds, tabular data). It starts by training a collection of deep residual encoders that learn the embeddings induced by multiple dimension reduction methods applied to the input dataset. Subsequently, a dense neural network integrates the generated encoders by emphasizing topological preservation or cluster induction. Experiments conducted on widely used multidimensional datasets (point-cloud manifolds, image datasets, tabular record datasets) show that the proposed method yields better results in terms of topological preservation ( curves), cluster induction ( V measure), and classification accuracy than the most relevant dimension reduction methods.},

  abstract     = {In nature, wind can transport objects of diverse shapes and materials over long distances spanning meters or beyond. In contrast, most noncontact manipulation methods are effective only over centimeter-scale distances and require the manipulated objects to have specific magnetic, electrical, or other material properties and shapes. Herein, a meter-scale distance manipulation method is presented for controlling the motion of objects of diverse shapes and materials on a plane surface using a jet-induced airflow field. The airflow field is varied by controlling the direction of a single air jet projected onto a surface based on the positions of objects to steer the objects to follow desired trajectories up to 2.7 m away. A wide variety of objects can be automatically manipulated, from regularly shaped polystyrene hemispheres and sticks to irregularly shaped cotton wads and face masks as well as deformable tissue papers and plastic bags. The method is also robust, effectively manipulating objects under challenging conditions, e.g., external airflow disturbances, surface obstacles, and air–water interface. Finally, three application cases are demonstrated: collecting diverse objects into a target receptacle, hooking and retrieving heavy objects with a tethered mobile agent, and closing an electrical circuit with an untethered soft agent.},

  abstract     = {Insects flap their wings through a highly specialized musculoskeletal system that allows the wings to rotate about three degrees of freedom. Consequently, the wingtip trajectory is adjustable in 3D, and accompanied with appropriate wing feathering (wing pitch). Remarkably, the complex flapping motion is achieved by thoracic muscles acting on the wing hinge. The wings themselves do not possess muscles but adjust their shape and orientation by elastically deforming due to the loads applied on them during flapping. Previous attempts to develop insect-inspired flapping drones have mostly focused on simplified linear flapping mechanisms, which do not utilize the interaction between the wing flexibility and flapping kinematics to its full potential. Here, the aim is to improve flapping drones’ performance by introducing mechanisms that mimic insects’ flight. The first is an elastic beam mechanism, allowing the wing root to swing during flapping, and the second is a passive wing pitch mechanism that allows the wing to rotate at stroke reversals. The two mechanisms are tested using high-fidelity insect-inspired 3D-printed wings and show a sixfold improvement of aerodynamic performance compared to linear flapping kinetics of the same flexible wings. This underscores the necessity of bioinspired flapping mechanisms in future flapping drones.},

  abstract     = {Fluid-driven artificial muscles exhibit a behavior similar to biological muscles which makes them attractive as soft actuators for wearable assistive robots. However, state-of-the-art fluidic systems typically face challenges to meet the multifaceted needs of soft wearable robots. First, soft robots are usually constrained to tethered pressure sources or bulky configurations based on flow control valves for delivery and control of high assistive forces. Second, although some soft robots exhibit untethered operation, they are significantly limited to low force capabilities. Herein, an electrohydraulic actuation system that enables both untethered and high-force soft wearable robots is presented. This solution is achieved through a twofold design approach. First, a simplified direct-drive actuation paradigm composed of motor, gear-pump, and hydraulic artificial muscle (HAM) is proposed, which allows for a compact and lightweight (1.6 kg) valveless design. Second, a fluidic engine composed of a high-torque motor with a custom-designed gear pump is created, which is capable of generating high pressure (up to 0.75 MPa) to drive the HAM in delivering high forces (580 N). Experimental results show that the developed fluidic engine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in mechanical efficiency and suggest opportunities for effective deployment in soft wearable robots for human assistance.},

However, when the robot needs to interact with the environment, the softness may affect the performance of the robot. Especially in transport tasks, the softness of continuum robots can lead to handling failures and drastic drops in precision. The variable stiffness continuum robot combines the advantages of flexibility and rigidity, which is conducive to expanding the application scenarios of flexible continuum robots. This article proposes a flexible continuum robot that simultaneously realizes variable stiffness, shape-aware, and self-heating functions using liquid metal. The low-temperature phase transition property of liquid metal is utilized to realize the variable stiffness function; the overall stiffness of the robot can reach the range of 18.5–183 N m −1 , which can realize a tenfold stiffness gain. The conductivity of liquid metal is utilized to develop the shape-aware function, and the monitoring accuracy is within 5%. At the same time, this article utilizes the liquid metal&#39;s resistive thermal effect to realize heating function, so that the robot no longer needs heating systems such as heating wires and can realize the phase transition by energizing itself. Based on this design, the robot arm can realize the transition between maximum and minimum stiffness within 240 s.},

Paralleled reservoir computers with redesigned mixing inputs based on spatial relationships are implemented to cope with the multiple time series, whose core idea originates from the principle of the celebrated Granger causality.

Several AI optimization techniques have been recently proposed that aim at reducing the complexity of deep neural networks and hence expedite their execution and eventually allow the use of low-power, low-cost computing devices with limited computation and memory resources. These methods include parameter pruning and sharing, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and resource efficient architectures. Rather than pruning network structures including filters, layers, and blocks of layers based on a manual selection of a significance metric such as l 1 - norm and l 2 - norm of the filter kernels, novel highly efficient AI-driven DL optimization algorithms using variations of the squeeze and excitation in order to prune filters and layers of deep models such as VGG-16 as well as eliminate filters and blocks of residual networks such as ResNet-56 are introduced. The proposed techniques achieve significantly higher reduction in the number of learning parameters, the number of floating point operations, and memory space as compared to the-state-of-the-art methods.},

Current methods address the problem primarily from a 2D perspective, which limits the efficient utilization of 3D information. Herein, a novel approach, called pose orientation-aware network (POANet), which leverages normal maps for orientation information embedding, providing abundant and robust head pose information, is introduced. POANet incorporates the axial signal perception module and the rotation matrix perception module, these lightweight modules make the approach achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with few computational costs. This method can directly analyze various topological 3D data without extensive preprocessing. For depth images, POANet outperforms existing methods on the Biwi Kinect head pose dataset, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by ≈30% compared to the SOTA methods. POANet is the first method to perform rigid head registration in a landmark-free manner. It also incorporates few-shot learning capabilities and achieves an MAE of about on the Headspace dataset. These features make POANet a superior alternative to traditional generalized Procrustes analysis for mesh data processing, offering enhanced convenience for human phenotype studies.},

Utilizing the unique encoding properties of speckle patterns, DeepSLM facilitates license editing within the modulation phase, pioneering a layered authentication encryption system. Our empirical studies confirm DeepSLM&#39;s superior performance on key metrics.

  abstract     = {Imitation learning (IL) facilitates intuitive robotic programming. However, ensuring the reliability of learned behaviors remains a challenge. In the context of reaching motions, a robot should consistently reach its goal, regardless of its initial conditions. To meet this requirement, IL methods often employ specialized function approximators that guarantee this property by construction. Although effective, these approaches come with some limitations: 1) they are typically restricted in the range of motions they can model, resulting in suboptimal IL capabilities, and 2) they require explicit extensions to account for the geometry of motions that consider orientations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel stability loss function that does not constrain the function approximator&#39;s architecture and enables learning policies that yield accurate results. Furthermore, it is not restricted to a specific state space geometry; therefore, it can easily incorporate the geometry of the robot&#39;s state space. Proof of the stability properties induced by this loss is provided and the method is empirically validated in various settings. These settings include Euclidean and non-Euclidean state spaces, as well as first-order and second-order motions, both in simulation and with real robots.

However, the use of MWs for MDOF control of robots has so far remained a challenge. This article first presents examples of wireless driving and controlling millimeter-scale peristaltic pipeline robots (diameter, 4 mm; length, 30 mm; weight, 0.39 g) utilizing multifrequency MWs in complex nonmetal channel environments. Herein, shape memory alloy springs combined with passive wires, whose length depends on the frequencies of MWs, are adopted to form selectively controlled robot components, and silicon rubber replica technology is utilized to achieve miniaturization of the robot. The monopole antenna model is developed for the actuator, and its structure is refined using antenna theory. This allows the successfully achievement of MDOF control of the robot at several MW frequencies (2.4, 4, and 5.9 GHz). Powered by MWs from outside the pipe, the pipeline robot achieves horizontal, vertical, and curved motions in a pipe with a diameter of 5 mm.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a flexure-based supernumerary robotic finger (FBSF) inspired by the proportions of the human thumb, aiming to overcome existing limitations in robotic finger design. In pursuit of seamless cooperation with the user&#39;s hand, human finger proportions are replicated. Finite element analysis of all five fingers indicates that the thumb-mimicking configuration offers the largest workspace and bending angle. The FBSF, featuring a polycarbonate paired crossed flexural hinge structure and high impact polystyrene links, closely mirrors the human thumb. Weighing 59 g (main body) and 170 g (control box), the FBSF enables user-driven control and decoupled actuation based on user intent, utilizing the electromyographic signal of the extensor carpi ulnaris via isometric contractions. An experimental protocol, including task blocks (releasing, clenching), confirms the FBSF&#39;s responsiveness to user intentions. When utilizing FBSF, it has been verified using a motion capture camera system that it is possible to extend the existing hand workspace by approximately 29.72%. Performance tests demonstrate the FBSF&#39;s capability to grasp various objects and assist in tasks, with a maximum load-bearing capacity of 2.6 kg experimentally verified. This study demonstrates the potential of the developed FBSF to augment hand functionality in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Automated drug delivery systems (ADDS) improve chronic disease management by enhancing adherence and reducing patient burden, particularly in conditions like type 1 diabetes, through intraperitoneal insulin delivery. However, periodic invasive refilling of the reservoir is needed in such a class of implantable devices. In previous work, an implantable ADDS with a capsule docking system is introduced for non-invasive reservoir refilling. Yet, it encounters reliability issues in manufacturing, sealing, and docking design and lacks evidence on intestinal tissue compression effects and chronic in vivo data. This work proposes an optimization of the different components featuring this ADDS. The ingestible capsule is designed, developed, and tested following ISO 13485, exhibiting high insulin stability and optimal sealing for six days in harsh gastrointestinal-like conditions. A magnetic docking system is optimized, ensuring reliable and stable capsule docking at a clinically relevant distance of 5.92 mm. Histological tests on human intestinal tissues confirm safe capsule compression during docking. Bench tests demonstrate that the integrated mechatronic system effectively docks capsules at various peristalsis-mimicking velocities. A six-week in vivo test on porcine models demonstrates chronic safety and provides hints on fibrotic reactions. These results pave the way for the further evolution of implantable ADDS.},

This article presents a pioneering approach to the development of auxetic smart metamaterials using shape memory alloy (SMA) as the core material. As SMAs can be Joule heated to change between their low- and high-temperature phases to trigger the actuation of the structure, the auxetic smart metamaterial can actively modify its shape and stiffness to produce bidirectional actuation with a single power input and using a single bias mechanical element. The proposed active auxetic metamaterial consists of an SMA plate patterned with auxetic cuts, creating hinges that modulate the deformation of the structure to produce an auxetic behavior. This work looks at the impact of different geometric parameters on the behavior of the structure, including its generated force, its maximum strain, and its Poisson&#39;s ratio. The study also investigates the effect of the number of segmented units, revealing that designs with more segmented units suffer from stress concentrations near attachment points, limiting their advantages. This article shows that smart materials can help imbue metamaterials such as auxetic metamaterials with active properties to facilitate their implementation in future robotic applications.},

Despite their importance, a focused discussion of these generators is rare, and a comprehensive description of the design process is currently lacking. This work presents a methodology for the design and optimization of selection field generators operating with soft magnetic materials outside the linear regime in the context of MPI. Key elements are a mathematical model of magnetic field generators, a formalism for defining field sequences, and a relationship between power consumption and field sequence. These are used to define the design space of a field generator given its system requirements and constraints. The design process is then formulated as an optimization problem. Subsequently, this methodology is then utilized to design a new magnetic field generator specifically for cerebral imaging studies. The optimization result outperforms our existing MPI field generator in terms of power consumption and field of view size, providing a proof-of-concept for the entire methodology. As the approach is very general, it can be extended beyond the MPI context to other areas such as magnetic manipulation of medical devices and micro-robotics.},

Limited by the inherent property of organic materials, the performance and lifetime of the swimming microrobots are still deficient. Facing this challenge, inspired by sperms, swimming microrobots based on the inorganic phase transition driving material vanadium dioxide are developed. In liquid environments, the linear and rotary motion of these sperm-like micro-robots could be controlled by changing the laser modulation frequency. The highest linear speed attained is 56 μm s −1 , and the highest rotary speed attained is 14° s −1 . The microrobot is able to undergo more than 10 5 cycles in a liquid environment without degradation of its performance. Considering its high performance and controllability, the swimming microrobot is expected to be helpful in medical applications such as precision drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery.},

The actuator linearly extends upon applying torque from a servo motor; the rubber bellows shaft is stretchable but resistant to torsional deflection, allowing it to transmit torque from the servo motor to the other end of the HSA. The high flexibility of the HSA and rubber bellows shaft enable the actuator to adaptively extend even when bent. The actuator&#39;s two components and its performance are mechanically characterized. Actuation strains of 45% elongation and a maximum blocked pushing force of about 8 N are demonstrated. The actuator&#39;s capabilities are showcased in two separate demonstrations: a crawling robot and a sensorized artificial muscle that integrates a microfluidic, liquid metal strain sensor. The architected material design approach for a robust, motor-driven soft actuator provides several unique features—including a compact form factor and ease of use—over other motorized soft robotic actuators based on HSA assemblies or cable tendon mechanisms.},

Liquid metals (LMs), known for their high deformability and tunable morphology, demonstrate remarkable actuating capabilities through controllable surface tension. Inspired by the predation method of chameleons, this work introduces a bioinspired LM actuator (BLMA) by modulating the morphology of LM. This BLMA enables high-strain (up to 170%) actuation by precisely directing LM droplets toward an electrode. Various parameters affecting the BLMA&#39;s actuating performance are explored. Notably, the application of a reductive voltage induces rapid solidification of supercooled LM, facilitating phase transition at room temperature. The solidified LM enhances its holding force of BLMA by over 1000 times. To underscore the superior capabilities of the BLMA, diverse applications, such as a complex two-dimensional plane actuator, a stepper motor with adjustable step intervals, a phase transition-controlled relay, and a laser code lock actuation gate set, are presented. It is anticipated that the exceptional characteristics of the BLMA will propel advancements in the realms of soft robotics and mechatronics.},

  abstract     = {In response to increasing demand for robotics manipulation, accurate vision-based full pose estimation is essential. While convolutional neural networks-based approaches have been introduced, the quest for higher performance continues, especially for precise robotics manipulation, including in the Agri-robotics domain. This article proposes an improved transformer-based pipeline for full pose estimation, incorporating a Depth Refinement Module. Operating solely on monocular images, the architecture features an innovative Lighter Depth Estimation Network using a Feature Pyramid with an up-sampling method for depth prediction. A Transformer-based Detection Network with additional prediction heads is employed to directly regress object centers and predict the full poses of the target objects. A novel Depth Refinement Module is then utilized alongside the predicted centers, full poses, and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated poses. The performance of this pipeline is extensively compared with other state-of-the-art methods, and the results are analyzed for fruit picking applications. The results demonstrate that the pipeline improves the accuracy of pose estimation to up to 90.79% compared to other methods available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Tactile sensing in the human body is achieved via the skin. This has inspired the fabrication of synthetic skins with pressure sensors for potential applications in robotics, bio-medicine, and human–machine interfaces. Tactile sensors based on magnetic elements are promising as they provide high sensitivity and a wide dynamic range. However, current magnetic tactile sensors mostly detect pressures of solid objects and operate at relatively high forces about 100 mN. Herein, these limitations are addressed by manufacturing soft, stretchable, and hair-like structures that are permanently magnetized to achieve high-resolution, cost-effective, and high-resolution pressure sensing. Combining these hair-like structures with advances in 3D magnetic-field measurements allows us to monitor directional tactile pressures without solid contact. To prove the concept of this technology, a bio-inspired soft device is built with a hairy structure that senses and reports environmental mechanical stresses, similar to that of human skin. Simple self-assembly of the soft magnetic hair structure makes our approach easy to scale for large-area applications.},

To partially reconstruct the shape, proprioceptive techniques use built-in sensors, resulting in inaccurate results and increased fabrication complexity. Exteroceptive methods so far rely on expensive tracking systems with reflective markers placed on all components, which are infeasible for deformable robots interacting with the environment due to marker occlusion and damage. Here, a regression approach is presented for three-dimensional key point estimation using a convolutional neural network. The proposed approach uses data-driven supervised learning and is capable of online markerless estimation during inference. Two images of a robotic system are captured simultaneously at 25 Hz from different perspectives and fed to the network, which returns for each pair the parameterized key point or piecewise constant curvature shape representations. The proposed approach outperforms markerless state-of-the-art methods by a maximum of 4.5% in estimation accuracy while being more robust and requiring no prior knowledge of the shape. Online evaluations on two types of soft robotic arms and a soft robotic fish demonstrate the method&#39;s accuracy and versatility on highly deformable systems.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir computing (RC) possesses a simple architecture and high energy efficiency for time-series data analysis through machine learning algorithms. To date, RC has evolved into several innovative variants. The next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) variant, founded on nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) distinguishes itself due to its fewer hyperparameters and independence from physical random connection matrices, while yielding comparable results. However, NGRC networks struggle with massive Kronecker product calculations and matrix-vector multiplications within the read out layer, leading to substantial efficiency challenges for traditional von Neumann architectures. In this work, a hybrid digital-analog hardware system tailored for NGRC is developed. The digital part is a Kronecker product calculation unit with data filtering, which realizes transformation of nonlinear vector of the input linear vector. For matrix-vector multiplication, a computing-in-memory architecture based on resistive random access memory array offers an energy-efficient hardware solution, which markedly reduces data transfer and greatly improve computational parallelism and energy efficiency. The predictive capabilities of this hybrid NGRC system are validated through the Lorenz63 model, achieving a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.00098 and an energy efficiency of 19.42TOPS W −1 .},

Current solutions for achieving variable stiffness or implementing lock mechanisms tend to involve complex structures. Additionally, passive solutions like bistable and multistate mechanisms lack spatial stable characteristics. This study presents a novel shape memory alloy (SMA) modular robot with spatially stable structure, by utilizing gooseneck as the backbone. This is the first time that a concept of spatially stable structure is proposed. When the power is off, the robot can still maintain its current posture in three-dimensional space and resist external disturbance. The SMA spring and gooseneck are characterized, elucidating the mechanism behind achieving spatial stability. Then, a controller based on the inverse kinematics is designed, and validated by experiments. The results demonstrate the structural stability of the robot. Specifically, it can withstand a maximum external force of 2.5 N (0.0875 Nm) when bent at an angle of 20° without consuming energy. Moreover, with the assistance of the SMA spring, this resistance capacity surpasses 5 N (0.175 Nm).},

  abstract     = {Designing actuators that can modulate power, achieve high energy efficiency, and ensure safe collision remains a challenge, especially for dynamic energy robot systems (DERS) with high-performance requirements. Herein, a novel multi-configuration elastic actuator (MCEA) is proposed based on a controllable planetary differential mechanism (PDM) with one power port from three springs. These springs, positioned between the inner gear ring and the fixed housing shell, are regulated by a single servo motor through a ratchet–pawl mechanism. This setup enables the springs to absorb energy during collisions, reducing impact and subsequently releasing this energy to boost power output. The inner gear ring functions as a controllable one-way rotating element, acting either as an input or output for power. The MCEA&#39;s ability to manage power modulation and energy flow is demonstrated through experiments that highlight its potential for safe collision management, energy recycling, and power modulation. Experiment results indicate that the maximum output power of the MCEA in the proposed hybrid elastic actuation (HEA) mode is 8.05 times higher than that in the traditional actuation (TA) mode. A single-legged robot with a four-link mechanism is also built to validate the considerable performance in the application of legged robots, showing considerable adaptability and prospects for DERS.},

A novel adhesive material is developed inspired by the adhesion mechanism and locomotion of the Gekko gecko. This material exhibits exceptional adhesion across various materials and surface roughness. A variable-stiffness gecko-inspired paw is engineered, generating substantial adhesion forces while minimizing detachment forces. Impressively, this paw generates up to 180 N of adhesion force on smooth surfaces and achieves detachment without external forces. By integrating such variable-stiffness paws with a wall-climbing robot, a gecko-inspired robot effectively operating in a microgravity environment is created. The robotic satellite surface climbing experiments and robotic satellite capture experiments are conducted using a simulated microgravity environment and a satellite model. The results unequivocally demonstrate the gecko-inspired robot&#39;s proficiency in executing various functions, including stable motion and capture on both smooth and rough spacecraft surfaces within a microgravity environment.

Human studies revealed that involuntary behavior affects how others perceive communicative intentions. Therefore, mimicking human involuntary behavior may positively affect HRI. This article extends our previous work on equipping robots with involuntary behavior with a user study that evaluates the use of bioinspiration for complementing gestures. A preliminary test is conducted with 15 participants to determine if they can perceive the intensities of the involuntary processes heart rate, pupil size, blink rate, breathing rate, and motor activity. 63 new participants interacted with a robot with bioinspired behaviors or a robot only showing predefined gestures to evaluate the robots’ warmth, competence, and discomfort. The results show that the preliminary test participants differentiated the intensities of the involuntary processes. Participants in the second study find the robot with bioinspired behaviors significantly warmer and more competent than the robot with predefined gestures, with no discomfort difference.},

  abstract     = {Microrobotic platforms hold significant potential to advance a variety of fields, from medicine to environmental sensing. Herein, minimally functional robotic entities modeled on readily achievable state-of-the-art features in a modern lab or cleanroom are computationally simulated. Inspired by Dou and Bishop ( Phys Rev Res . 2019;1(3):1–5), it is shown that the simple combination of unidirectional steering connected to a single environmental (chemical) sensor along with constant propulsion gives rise to highly complex functions of significant utility. Such systems can trace the contours orthogonal to arbitrary chemical gradients in the environment. Also, pairs of such robots that are additionally capable of emitting the same chemical signal are shown to exhibit coupled relative motion. When the pair has unidirectional steering in opposite directions within the 2D plane (i.e., counter-rotating), they move in parallel trajectories to each other. Alternatively, when steering is in the same direction (corotation), the two move in the same epicyclical trajectory. In this way, the chirality of the unidirectional steering produces two distinct emergent phenomena. The behavior is understood as a ratchet mechanism that exploits the differential in the radii of curvature corresponding to different spatial locations. Applications to environmental detection, remediation, and monitoring are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to solve multi-objective problems and reduce the turnaround times of semiconductor processes. However, only brief AI explanations are available for process/device/circuit engineers to provide holistic feedback on the manufactured results. Herein, linear/nonlinear variation decomposition (LVD/NLVD) of neural networks is demonstrated to quantitatively evaluate the influence of unit processes on the figure of merit (FoM) and co-analyze the unit process influences with device characteristic behaviors. The NLVD can evaluate the output variation from each input of neural networks in an individual sample, although neural networks are not available in an analytic form. The NLVD is successfully verified by confirming that a) the output and summation of all decomposed output variations perfectly coincide and b) the process influences on the FoM are decomposed to 6.01–54.86% more accurately compared with those of LVD in 1Y nm node dynamic random-access memory test vehicles with a baseline and split tests introducing high-k metal gates with a minimum gate length of 1 A nm node for further node scaling. The approaches identify defective processes and defect mechanisms in each sample and wafer, which enhance causal analyses for individual cases in diverse fields based on regression artificial neural networks.},

However, these characteristics create challenges for precise modeling and control. This study proposes a hybrid offline and online data-driven scheme to achieve high-precision tracking control of a soft continuum manipulator. First, a novel multiscale deep neural network learns the manipulator model offline. Specifically, the feature fusion module extracts highly discriminative features and captures long-term dependencies from the temporal trajectory data. The self-attention module strengthens the ability to represent fusion features and enhances the model prediction accuracy. Then, the learnt model is updated using multisensor data online, and the proposed controller further compensates for the updated model and enhances the tracking accuracy in the movement stage. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in motion accuracy under different trajectory-tracking scenarios (i.e., deviations of &lt;1 mm in position and &lt;0.8° in orientation). The example of the multiwire cable sorting proves the feasibility of the proposed scheme in high-precision industrial applications.},

Herein, a shared control method is proposed for master–slave robot systems, utilizing tubular guidance constraints based on a novel potential field function to optimize the commands of the surgeon. Within the tube, attractive constraints intensify with increasing task error and approach infinity at the boundary of the tube. This ensures that the surgery is confined within a closed tubular space. Haptic feedback provides force cues to inform the surgeon about the feasibility of the input commands. Theoretical derivations demonstrate that the entire closed-loop system is passive. Two simulation experiments are conducted on the ophthalmic surgery robot platform to evaluate the functionality of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that translational errors are kept less than certain predefined values. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the comparison method in terms of task accuracy and efficiency.},

Neural networks (NNs) for DL are tailored to specific application domains by varying in their topology and activation nodes. Nevertheless, the major operation type (with the largest computational complexity) is commonly multiply-accumulate operation irrespective of their topology. Recent trends in DL highlight the evolution of NNs such that they become deeper and larger, and thus their prohibitive computational complexity. To cope with the consequent prohibitive latency for computation, 1) general-purpose hardware, e.g., central processing units and graphics processing units, has been redesigned, and 2) various DL accelerators have been newly introduced, e.g., neural processing units, and computing-in-memory units for deep NN-based DL, and neuromorphic processors for spiking NN-based DL. In this review, these accelerators and their pros and cons are overviewed with particular focus on their performance and memory bandwidth.},

Specifically, defenders aim to maximize the collection of identity information from intruders possessing anti-tracking and evading capabilities, while simultaneously preventing their entry into protected areas. Game theory is employed to determine the optimal confrontation paths for defenders against the intruders. The probability perception model is utilized for evaluating the dynamic target tracking capability and designing a tracking merit function to assess tracking performance, taking into account both the target&#39;s position and the perception relative angle. Furthermore, considering the dynamic interactive behaviors between intruders and defenders, the iterative linear quadratic game (ILQG) algorithm is employed to solve the Nash equilibrium of the non-cooperative target tracking game. Through simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in accomplishing multi-agent dynamic target tracking tasks is demonstrated and the performance of the algorithm under varying parameters in the intruder&#39;s cost function is evaluated, which represent different intrusion intentions.},

Herein, fully 3D printed capacitive pressure sensors comprising polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam-based dielectric layer, sandwiched between the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate and silver nanowire-based electrodes, are presented. The printed electrodes exhibit excellent electrical properties (1.6 Ω sq −1 , 20.35 kS m −1 ) and bendability. Various ratios of PDMS to ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3 ) are evaluated to obtain dielectric layer with optimum pore sizes for better performance and ease of fabrication. The device with a PDMS:NH 4 HCO 3 ratio of 4:0.8 exhibits a linear response with a sensitivity of 0.0055 kPa −1 in the tested pressure range of 5–170 kPa. The fully 3D printed sensors also show excellent repeatability over 500 cycles with an average hysteresis of 1.53%, and fast response and recovery times of 89 and 195 ms, respectively. The superiority of the presented 3D printed foam-based device is confirmed by 30% higher sensitivity in comparison with PDMS-based sensors.

The flexible piezoresistive sensory arrays with 25 sensor units which can be arranged on five fingers of the soft prosthetic hand are fabricated. According to the collected large-scale tactile dataset (including pressure distribution and pressure magnitude) during different grasping tasks, a learning-based classification model that can reveal the correspondences between tactile information and object attributes while interacting with touched objects is developed. To transfer tactile information extracted from tactile sensor arrays, a wearable vibrotactile feedback band with a spatial coding feedback strategy is implemented by selectively activating vibrotactile motors located on the skin of the upper arm. In a set of tests performed by an individual with transradial amputation and eight able-bodied subjects, the soft prosthetic hand integrated with tactile sensor arrays can help the users regain finger tactile sensation, discriminate grasped objects, and achieve real-time dynamic rolling detection.},

These scaffolds, doped with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and obtained through 2-photon polymerization, can be remotely manipulated thanks to an external magnet, thus obtaining biomimetic 3D organization recapitulating the brain cancer microenvironment. From a geometric point of view, the structure is functional to both cell culture on individual unit scaffolds and to tailored cocultures fostered by magnetic-driven unit assembly, also allowing for cell migration thanks to passages/fenestrations on adjacent structures. Leveraging magnetic dragging, for which a mathematical model is introduced, multiple cocultures are achieved, highlighting the high versatility and the user-friendly character of the proposed platform that can help overcome the current challenges in 3D cocultures handling, and open the way to the construction of increasingly biomimetic artificial systems.},

Remarkably, even insects with limited neural systems adeptly respond to looming stimuli while in motion at high speeds. Existing insect-inspired looming detection models typically rely on either motion-pathway or feature-pathway signals, yet both are susceptible to dynamic visual scene interference. Coordinating interneuron signals from both pathways can enhance the looming detection performance under dynamic conditions. An artificial neural network is employed to construct a combined-pathway model based on Drosophila anatomy. The model outperforms state-of-the-art bio-inspired looming-detection models in tasks involving dynamic backgrounds, simulated by animated 2D-moving natural scenes or recorded in reality when an unmanned aerial vehicle performs obstacle collision avoidance tasks. Notably, by combining neural anatomy architecture and appropriate multiobjective tasks, the model exhibits convergent neural dynamics with biological counterparts post-training, offering network explanations and mechanistic insights. Specifically, a multiplicative interneuron operation enhances looming signal patterns and reduces background interferences, generalizing to more complex scenarios, such as AirSim 3D environments and real-world situations. The work introduces testable biological hypotheses and a promising bioinspired solution for looming detection in dynamic visual environments.},

  abstract     = {Loading individual oocytes is a critical step for injecting RNA, expressing heterologous proteins, performing electrophysiological measurements, and so on. However, existing methods remain a challenge for automatically loading multiple single oocytes into different locations. Herein, a novel microfluidic chip on a robotic manipulator (chip-on-robot) with feedback control for flexible manipulation of multiple oocytes within a large spatial range is proposed. The manipulator automatically controls the microfluidic chip to reach different locations based on imaging feedback. The microfluidic chip then utilizes the hydrodynamic focusing effect of the main channel to separate oocytes for individual loading or reloading under capacitive sensor feedback. The separation distance reaches approximately 16 times the oocyte diameter. Moreover, capacitive signal feedback on the number of oocytes for flow direction control ensures the separation of all oocytes. For close-loop control of the loading/reloading process, image-based oocyte detection is combined using deep learning to calculate the target position of the oocyte. Finally, an automatic sequence is achieved to load multiple single oocytes into a well chip by using the chip-on-robot. As a demonstration, the oocytes are reloaded into a specified location based on the conditions. The proposed chip-on-robot with feedback control has significant advantages in the micromanipulation of oocytes.},

  abstract     = {As the third-generation network succeeding artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer high robustness and low energy consumption. Inspired by biological systems, the limitations of low robustness and high-power consumption in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are addressed by introducing SNNs. The Brain Q-network (BrainQN) is proposed, which replaces the neurons in the classic Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm with SNN neurons. BrainQN is trained using surrogate gradient learning (SGL) and ANN-to-SNN conversion methods. Robustness tests with input noise reveal BrainQN&#39;s superior performance, achieving an 82.14% increase in rewards under low noise and 71.74% under high noise compared to DQN. These findings highlight BrainQN&#39;s robustness and superior performance in noisy environments, supporting its application in complex scenarios. SGL-trained BrainQN is more robust than ANN-to-SNN conversion under high noise. The differences in network output correlations between noisy and original inputs, along with training algorithm distinctions, explain this phenomenon. BrainQN successfully transitioned from a simulated Pong environment to a ball-catching robot with dynamic vision sensors (DVS). On the neuromorphic chip PAICORE, it shows significant advantages in latency and power consumption compared to Jetson Xavier NX.},

Herein, a novel robotic rotating microjoint controlled by an exogenous magnetic field based on magnetic programmable soft materials, which brings more dexterity to the micromanipulation task is proposed. First, the magnetic soft material is synthesized and the microjoint is manufactured. The maximum rotation angle and response time are characterized. Then the force analysis of the microjoint in a uniform magnetic field is performed and the relationship between the deformation bending angle of a microjoint and the magnetic field magnitude is first proposed. A sliding mode controller based on the deformation mechanism of microjoints and radial basis function neural network (DMRSMC) is proposed to achieve robust deformation control of the microjoint. The experiment that depicts the microjoint is able to achieve a maximum rotation angle of 22.16° and a response time of 16 ms. The DMRSMC controller performs angle control with higher accuracy than conventional SMC and PID controllers. Finally, a dexterous suction mechanism is developed by combining the microjoint with a soft micropipette needle to achieve dexterous grasping of zebrafish embryos with a 97% success rate and an orientation adjustment error is 1.36°.},

Herein, a novel design and rapid fabrication by 3D printing of a mechano-optic force sensor with a large dynamic range, sensitivity, and linear response, enabled by metamaterials-based structures, is presented. A simple approach for programming the metamaterial&#39;s behavior based on mathematical modeling of the sensor under dynamic loading is proposed. Machine learning models are utilized to predict the complete force–deformation profile, encompassing the linear range, the onset of nonlinear behavior, and the slope of profiles in both bending and compression-dominated regions. The design supports seamless integration of the sensor into soft grippers, enabling 3D printing of the soft gripper with an embedded sensor in a single step, thus overcoming the tedious and complex and multiple fabrication steps commonly applied in conventional processes. The sensor boasts a fine resolution of 0.015 N, a measurement range up to 16 N, linearity (adj. R 2 –0.991), and delivers consistent performance beyond 100 000 cycles. The sensitivity and range of the embedded mechano-optic force sensor can be easily programmed by both the metamaterial structure and the material&#39;s properties.},

  abstract     = {Studying the behavior of electroactive cells, such as firing dynamics and chemical secretion, is crucial for developing human disease models and therapeutics. Following the recent advances in cell culture technology, traditional monolayers are optimized to resemble more 3D, organ-like structures. The biological and electrochemical complexity of these structures requires devices with adaptive shapes and novel features, such as precise electrophysiological mapping and stimulation in the case of brain- and heart-derived tissues. However, conventional organ-on-chip platforms often fall short, as they do not recreate the native environment of the cells and lack the functional interfaces necessary for long-term monitoring. Origami-on-a-chip platforms offer a solution for this problem, as they can flexibly adapt to the structure of the desired biological sample and can be integrated with functional components enabled by chosen materials. In this review, the evolution of origami-on-a-chip biointerfaces is discussed, emphasizing folding stimuli, materials, and critical findings. In the prospects, microfluidic integration, functional tissue engineering scaffolds, and multi-organoid networks are included, allowing patient-specific diagnoses and therapies through computational and in vitro disease modeling.},

The investigation involves the hard X-Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X-Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200 nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology. Regions of high concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, and iron are found in the samples. These regions are also observed in the STXM results as spots of low transmission that typically are associated with calcium deposits only.},

From the individual station on a production line to the global supply chain, everything is connected, making regulation and control a complex task. Biological molecular processes, such as the metabolism of living organisms or the cell cycle, are also extremely complex processes that can be compared to industrial production processes, both of which involve a series of intermediate steps and products. Thanks to (self-)regulatory mechanisms that have evolved over time, these biological mechanisms are very efficient and robust in the face of perturbations. This article proposes an explanatory representation of these complex processes, considering both biological and technical aspects. The aim is to facilitate biomimetic transfer of biological regulation mechanisms into the technical domain. It presents concepts for biomimetic regulation of production lines and sourcing strategies and introduces a workflow for generating digital twins. This workflow is inspired by the cell cycle checkpoints, which ensure that only perfect copies of DNA are passed on during cell replication. By leveraging this understanding, the production industry can potentially improve its own processes and efficiency.},

Though memory-efficient, convolutional capsules impose geometric constraints that fundamentally limit the ability of capsules to model the pose/deformation of objects. Further, they do not address the bigger memory concern of class capsules scaling up to bigger tasks such as detection or large-scale classification. Herein, a new family of capsule networks, deformable capsules ( DeformCaps ), is introduced to address object detection problem in computer vision. Two new algorithms associated with our DeformCaps , a novel capsule structure ( SplitCaps ), and a novel dynamic routing algorithm ( SE-Routing ), which balance computational efficiency with the need for modeling a large number of objects and classes, are proposed. This has never been achieved with capsule networks before. The proposed methods efficiently scale up to create the first-ever capsule network for object detection in the literature.

Existing research focuses more on the mechanical properties of the exosuit (e.g., torque and speed), but less on its wearability (e.g., appearance and comfort). This work presents a new design concept for fabric-based pneumatic exosuits: volume transfer, which means transferring the volume of pneumatic actuators beyond the garment&#39;s profile to the inside. This allows for a concealed appearance and a larger stress area while maintaining adequate torques. In order to verify this concept, a fabric-based pneumatic exosuit is developed for knee extension assistance. Its profile is only 26 mm and its stress area wraps around almost half of the leg. A mathematical model and simulation is used to determine the parameters of the exosuit, avoiding multiple iterations of the prototype. Experiment results show that the exosuit can generate a torque of 7.6 Nm at a pressure of 90 kPa and produce a significant reduction in the electromyography activity of the knee extensor muscles. It is believed that volume transfer can be utilized prevalently in future fabric-based pneumatic exosuit designs to achieve a significant improvement in wearability.},

  abstract     = {Integration of both actuation and proprioception into the robot body leads to a single integrated system that can deform and sense. Within this work, liquid rope coiling is used to 3D-print soft graded porous actuators. By fabricating these actuators from a conductive thermoplastic elastomer, piezoresistive sensing is directly integrated. These sensor-integrated actuators exhibit nonlinearities and hysteresis in their resistance change. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach that uses identified Wiener–Hammerstein (WH) models is proposed to estimate the strain based on the resistance change. Three actuator types were investigated, namely, a bending actuator, a contractor, and a three degrees of freedom bending segment. By using the design freedom of additive manufacturing to set the porosity, the actuation and sensing behavior of a contracting actuator can be programmed. Furthermore, the WH models can provide strain estimation with on average high fits (83%) and low root mean square (RMS) errors (6%) for all three actuators, which outperformed linear models significantly (76.2/9.4% fit/RMS error). In these results, it is indicated that combining 3D-printed graded porous structures and system identification can realize sensor-integrated actuators that can estimate their strain but also tailor their behavior through the porosity.},

Planar fluidic textile-based actuators exhibit low profile and high conformability, and can seamlessly integrate additional components (e.g., soft sensors or variable stiffness structures [VSSs]) to create advanced, multifunctional smart textile actuators. In this article, a new class of programmable, fluidic soft textile muscles (STMs) that incorporate multilayered silicone sheets with embedded fluidic channels is introduced. The STMs are scalable and fabricated by apparel engineering techniques, offering a fabrication approach able to create large-scaled multilayered structures that can be challenging for current microfluidic bonding methods. They are also highly automation compatible due to no manual insertion of elastic tubes/bladders into textile structures. Liquid metal is employed for creating fluidic channels. It is not only used for actuation but also used as channels for additional features such as soft piezoresistive sensors with enhanced sensitivity to STMs’ pressure-induced elongation, or VSSs of either low-melting-point alloys or a new thermo-responsive epoxy with low viscosity and transition temperature. The STMs hold promising prospects for soft robotic and wearable applications, which is demonstrated by an example of a textile-based wearable 3D skin-stretch haptic interface.},

  abstract     = {Soft and lightweight grippers have greatly enhanced the performance of robotic manipulators in handling complex objects with varying shape, texture, and stiffness. However, the combination of universal grasping with passive sensing capabilities still presents challenges. To overcome this limitation, a fluidic soft gripper is introduced based on the buckling of soft, thin hemispherical shells. Leveraging a single fluidic pressure input, the soft gripper can grasp slippery and delicate objects while passively providing information on this physical interaction. Guided by analytical, numerical, and experimental tools, the novel grasping principle of this mechanics-based soft gripper is explored. First, the buckling behavior of a free hemisphere is characterized as a function of its geometric parameters. Inspired by the free hemisphere&#39;s two-lobe mode shape ideal for grasping purposes, it is demonstrated that the gripper can perform dexterous manipulation and gentle gripping of fragile objects in confined spaces and underwater environments. Last, the soft gripper&#39;s embedded capability of detecting contact, grasping, and release conditions during the interaction with an unknown object is proved. This simple buckling-based soft gripper opens new avenues for the design of adaptive gripper morphologies with tactile sensing capabilities for applications ranging from medical and agricultural robotics to space and underwater exploration.},

Our study is driven by the goal of applying and testing the limits of OR-Tools capabilities by integrating Reinforcement Learning techniques for the first time. This enables us to compare these methods with OR-Tools, assessing their computational effectiveness and real-world application efficiency. Our analysis seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness and practical application of each technique.

Due to imperfect observations, the TP coalition has uncertain information of the evader&#39;s state, while the evader is assumed to have perfect observation. The game model is constructed by formulating the optimization problems for each player in a receding horizon fashion. Then, to counter the evader effectively, the TP coalition constructs a virtual evader using the belief information from a Kalman filter. And a chance constraint optimization problem is constructed to predict the virtual evader&#39;s trajectory under uncertainties. The TP coalition can capture the actual evader by generating a robust counter-strategy against the virtual evader with a chance constraint feasible set. Next, to compute the Nash equilibrium of the TP coalition&#39;s subjective game, an iterative algorithm is designed that combines the iterative best response and the distributed alternating direction method of multiplier algorithms. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies have emphasized the potential of threshold image segmentation for early breast cancer detection. However, traditional methods encounter challenges regarding low segmentation efficiency and accuracy. Addressing this, the ant colony optimization algorithm for continuous optimization (ACOR) shows promise. Yet, existing ACOR variants still grapple with poor initial population quality, affecting convergence speed and avoiding local optimization. These issues impact segmentation efficiency and accuracy. To tackle them, this study introduces RESACO, an enhanced ACOR version integrating three novel optimization strategies: resampling initialization (RIS), elite exploration (EES), and strengthened convergence mechanism (SCM). RIS enhances initial population quality by resampling regions with individuals demonstrating superior fitness and segmentation efficiency. EES promotes exploration across the search space, preventing local optima entrapment and enhancing model stability. SCM expediting convergence, segmentation efficiency, and precision. RESACO&#39;s performance is assessed through extensive experiments using IEEE CEC 2014 and IEEE CEC 2022 benchmark functions, including ablation experiments and comparisons with basic and improved algorithms and ACOR variants. Subsequently, the threshold image segmentation model based on RESACO is compared with other models using metaheuristic algorithms for segmenting realistic breast cancer medical images. Results demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s faster convergence and higher segmentation accuracy, preserving more lesion tissue details.},

This article presents an innovative solution by integrating model predictive contouring control (MPCC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for real-time trajectory planning of multiple mobile robots. Based on the datasets generated by MPCC, a customized LSTM network is constructed to learn the collaborative planning behavior from these datasets offline, subsequently producing smooth and efficient trajectories online with a low computational burden. Moreover, a hybrid control scheme, incorporating a lidar-based safety evaluator, avoids unexpected collision risks by switching to MPCC when necessary, ensuring the overall safety and reliability of the multi-robot system. The proposed hybrid LSTM method is implemented and tested in the robot operating system (ROS) within diverse constrained scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid LSTM method achieves ≈6% enhancements in trajectory productivity and a reduced computational burden of roughly 75% compared to MPCC, thereby providing a promising solution for local multi-robot trajectory planning in logistics transportation tasks.},

Nonetheless, existing underwater soft robots are primarily designed to mimic the movements of marine organisms or for specific functions, and little attention is paid to the camouflage ability. To address these challenges, in this study, a reconfigurable transparent soft robot with variable stiffness for underwater operations is presented. The design and fabrication methodology of the robot module is presented, followed by the kinematic analysis and stiffness characterization. Leveraging the proposed robot module, a soft manipulator and a soft gripper are designed for underwater operations. The soft manipulator excels in underwater pipeline detection and obstacle avoidance, while the soft gripper showcases considerable load-bearing capacity (about 71 times its weight), making it suitable for tasks such as retrieving aquatic biological samples or garbage fishing.

Herein, a waterbomb origami ring antenna is introduced, integrating the waterbomb origami principle, 3D-printed liquid metal (LM) hinges, and robotic shape morphing. The approach, combining 3D printing, robotic actuation, and innovative antenna design, enables various origami folding patterns, enhancing both portability and EM performance. This antenna&#39;s functionality has been successfully demonstrated, displaying its communication capabilities with another antenna and its ability to navigate narrow spaces on a remote-controlled wheel robot. The 3D-printed LM hinge exhibits low DC resistance (200 ± 1.6 mΩ) at both flat and folded state, and, with robotic control, the antenna achieves less than 1° folding angle accuracy and a 66% folding area ratio. The antenna operates in two modes at 2.08 and 2.4 GHz, ideal for fixed mobile use and radiolocation. Through extensive simulations and experiments, the antenna is evaluated in both flat and folded states, focusing on resonant frequency, gain patterns, and hinge connectivity. The findings confirm that the waterbomb origami ring antenna consistently maintains EM performance during folding and unfolding, with stable resonant frequencies and gain patterns, proving the antenna&#39;s reliability and adaptability for use in portable and mobile devices.},

This article presents an approach to achieve simple and controllable morphing onto multiple stable complex 3D surfaces—a long sought after goal in the field. The method is based on interconnected multistable straw-like deformable tubes, constrained by rigid links that can be assembled and connected in many different ways. By leveraging the director-field theory, the links and their assembly process are modeled and designed to reach a variety of desired final operational shapes from a single base-structure. The use of viscous-fluid actuation enables precise control and predictable shape-morphing while facilitating a wide range of configurations through inflation and deflation sequences, all with a single input.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of soft robotic technology emphasizes the growing importance of tactile perception. Soft grippers, equipped with tactile sensing, can gather interactive information crucial for safe human–robot interaction, wearable devices, and dexterous manipulation. However, most soft grippers with tactile sensing abilities have limited modes of tactile perception, restricting their dexterity and safety. In addition, existing tactile systems are often complicated, leading to unstable perception signals. Inspired by various organisms, a novel multimodal tactile-sensing soft robotic finger is proposed. This finger, based on a modified fin ray structure, integrates a distributed fiber optic sensing system as part of its tactile sensory neural system. It replicates human finger capabilities, discerning contact forces as low as 0.01 N with exceptional sensitivity (106.96 mN nm −1 ). Through training neural networks models, the finger achieves an accuracy exceeding 96% in recognizing roughness, material stiffness, and finger pad position. Assembled into two-finger parallel gripper, it demonstrates precise manipulation capabilities for fragile items like strawberries and potato chips. Moreover, through synergistic interplay of multimodal tactile sensing, this finger can successfully grasp an underwater transparent sphere, mitigating limitations of visual perception. The developed soft finger holds promise in various scenarios including hazardous environment detection and specialized grasping tasks.},

Revolutionizing the conventional deployable systems, the proposed design methodology can realize configuration variation-locking integration, and reusing of multi-stability property. To realize rapid configuration switching with the lowest energy input, a nested origami actuation, called trigger structure, is given. Furthermore, advanced design for the trigger structure is carried out, broadening the bistable state to four-stable geometric configurations for enhanced reachable space of the flexible gripper. By combining the design of the advanced trigger structure, the flexible gripper enables an energy-free switching behavior between deployed and curled configurations in symmetrical and asymmetrical planes. The asymmetrical configurations, induced by the multi-stability property of the advanced trigger structure, make the flexible gripper appropriate for various moving velocities capture. The proposed kirigami multi-stable flexible gripper has significant capture capability for moving targets with different types and motion attitudes.

This work demonstrates the effect of temperature impact on single-gate (SG) Fe-TFT reliability. SG Fe-TFTs have limitations such as read-disturbance and small memory windows, constraining their use. To mitigate these, dual-gate (DG) Fe-TFTs are modeled using technology computer-aided design, comparing their performance. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures with SG and DG Fe-TFTs are investigated for deep neural networks (DNN) accelerators, revealing heat&#39;s detrimental effect on reliability and inference accuracy. DG Fe-TFTs exhibit about 4.6x higher throughput than SG Fe-TFTs. Additionally, thermal effects within the simulated M3D architecture are analyzed, noting reduced DNN accuracy to 81.11% and 67.85% for SG and DG Fe-TFTs, respectively.

Electromechanical tests are carried out to characterize the sensor, applying pressures up to 22 kPa. The 3D-printed pressure sensors demonstrate tunable mechanical and electrical sensitivities at different infill values, with the highest value of −6.3 kPa −1 achieved by using a pyramid layer at 100% infill.

Learning-based controllers that leverage efficient mechanical models are promising for solving complex interaction tasks.

Force tests investigate the mechanical properties of a soft robot module, resulting in orthogonal forces of 9 − 13 $9 - 13$ N. Then, the policy is trained in simulation leveraging a dynamic Cosserat rod model of the soft robot. Domain randomization mitigate the sim-to-real gap while careful reward engineering induced pose and force control even without explicit force inputs. Despite the approximate simulation, the sim-to-real transfer achieved an average reaching distance of mm ( ), an average orientation error of rad ( ) and applied pushing forces up to N. Such performance is reasonable for the intended assistive tasks of the manipulator. The experiments uncovered that the soft robot interacting with the environment exhibited torsional and counter-balancing movements. Although not explicitly enforced, they emerged from the mechanical intelligence of the manipulator. The results demonstrate the potential of soft robotic manipulation via reinforcement learning.},

This work introduces a new textile-based pouch motors with the capacity for biaxial actuation and capacitive sensory functions, achieved through the application of computerized knitting technology using ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene yarn (Spectra) and conductive silver yarns. This method enables the rapid and scalable mass fabrication of robust pouch motors. The resulting pouch motors exhibit maximum lifting capacity of 10 kg, maximum contraction of 53.3% along the y -axis, and transverse extension of 41.18% along the x -axis at 50 kPa pressure. Finite element analysis closely matches the experimental data. The capacitance signals in relation to contraction motion are well suited for detecting air pressure levels and hold promise for applications requiring robotic control. Notably, it effectively elevates an ankle joint simulator at a 20° angle, highlighting its potential for applications such assisting individuals with foot drop.

However, training a clinically applicable segmentation algorithm requires pathologists to engage in labor-intensive labeling. In contrast, weakly supervised learning methods, which only require coarse-grained labels at the image level, can significantly reduce the labeling efforts. Unfortunately, while these methods perform reasonably well in slide-level prediction, their ability to locate cancerous regions, which is essential for many clinical applications, remains unsatisfactory. Previously, CAMEL is proposed, which achieves comparable results to those of fully supervised baselines in pixel-level segmentation. However, CAMEL requires 1280 × 1280 image-level binary annotations for positive WSIs. Here, CAMEL2 is presented, by introducing a threshold of the cancerous ratio for positive bags, it allows one to better utilize the information, consequently enabling us to scale up the image-level setting from 1280 × 1280 to 5120 × 5120 while maintaining accuracy. The results with various datasets demonstrate that CAMEL2, with the help of 5120 × 5120 image-level binary annotations, which are easy to annotate, achieves comparable performance to that of a fully supervised baseline in both instance- and slide-level classifications.},

A multiagent system composed of autonomous surface vehicles is proposed herein to efficiently monitor the water quality. To achieve a safe control of the fleet, the fleet policy should be able to act based on measurements and fleet state. It is proposed to use local Gaussian processes and deep reinforcement learning to jointly obtain effective monitoring policies. Local Gaussian processes, unlike classical global Gaussian processes, can accurately model the information in a dissimilar spatial correlation which captures more accurately the water quality information. A deep convolutional policy is proposed, that bases the decisions on the observation on the mean and variance of this model, by means of an information gain reward. Using a double deep Q-learning algorithm, agents are trained to minimize the estimation error in a safe manner thanks to a Consensus-based heuristic. Simulation results indicate an improvement of up to 24% in terms of the mean absolute error with the proposed models. Also, training results with 1–3 agents indicate that our proposed approach returns 20% and 24% smaller average estimation errors for, respectively, monitoring water quality variables and monitoring algae blooms, as compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

A significant enhancement in the memristor&#39;s on/off ratio, surpassing 10 3 , achieved by integrating both an overshoot suppression layer (OSL) and an ultra-thin AlN oxygen barrier layer (OBL) is also reported. The concurrent insertion of an AlO x OSL is essential for manifesting the self-compliance attribute in 4F 2 memristor arrays. Evaluations of a 24 × 24 array embedded with OSL and OBL reveal a substantial reduction in retention variation. In terms of functionality, a 7.13-fold decline in vector-matrix multiplication error is observed, accentuating the potential of this approach for neural network synapse applications. The analog reset characteristics of the OBL memristor facilitate over 25 multilevel states. Furthermore, the adoption of nonnegative weights presents an avenue to potentially double synaptic integration density. Through simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis simulations, the necessity of nonnegative and 16-level quantized conductance in balancing power consumption without accuracy loss at the image classification is validated.},

Herein, methods and strategies harnessed in these parts for performance improvement of soft grippers are systematically reviewed, particularly clarifying how to exert the coupling enhancement effects of the somatic parts for functional synergy.

However, its clinical application is hindered by complex data analysis and expert review requirements. It is hypothesized that machine learning (ML) models can automate data analysis to accelerate the clinical application of MS. The approach involves an ML-driven pipeline that extracts statistical and morphological features from an MS target region and feeds these features into ML algorithms to generate and assess predictive models. The findings demonstrate ML prediction models exhibit superior performance when trained on extracted features versus raw spectra intensity data and that random forest models exhibit robust classification performance in both internal and external validation datasets. These models remain effective across varying training dataset sizes and positive sample rates and are enhanced by a nested active learning approach. This approach can thus revolutionize clinical MS applications.},

  abstract     = {Nanomaterial properties and functionalities are influenced by their shape, size, and chemical composition. The importance of these parameters highlights the need for a statistically robust analysis of a large particle population, necessitating automation. This study introduces a neural network-empowered smart scan technique that achieves a relative increase in speed compared to traditional energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. The main advantage is that it reduces the required dose, decreasing potential damage to the sample by avoiding unnecessary exposure. It holds potential use in other multimodal scanning transmission electron microscopy or scanning-based imaging approaches. In the first example, identifying particles in a matrix with a trained neural network reduces the acquisition time by two orders of magnitude. This acceleration enables a statistical compositional analysis of thousands of particles in less than 1 h. Similar improvements are observed for atomic resolution. The discrete positions of atoms identified by the trained network allow for selective EDX sampling at these centers, thereby identifying the atomic species of the column with much-reduced sampling. Consequently, a lower sampling dose is required, enabling mapping of more delicate materials with high lateral resolution and at a high statistical confidence interval. Even though manual training is still required, this approach greatly benefits repetitive quality control tasks.},

However, the supervised contrastive learning model trained on the natural language inference (NLI) dataset is insufficient to elucidate the semantics of sentences since it is prone to make a prediction based on heuristics. Herein, by using the ParsEVAL and the word overlap metric, it is shown that sentence pairs in the NLI dataset have strong syntactic similarity and propose a framework to compensate for this problem in two aspects. 1) Apply simple syntactic transformations to the hypothesis and 2) expand the objective to SupCon Loss to leverage variants of sentences. The method is evaluated on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and transfer tasks. The proposed methods improve the performance of the BERT-based baseline in STS Benchmark and SICK Relatedness by 1.48% and 2.2%. Furthermore, the model achieves 82.65% on the HANS benchmark dataset, to the best of our knowledge, which is a state-of-the-art performance demonstrating that our approach is effective in grasping semantics without heuristics in the NLI dataset at supervised contrastive learning.

  abstract     = {In nature, gliding birds frequently execute intricate flight maneuvers such as aerial somersaults, perched landings, and swift descents, enabling them to navigate obstacles or hunt prey. It is evident that birds rely on different wing–tail configurations to accomplish a wide range of aerial maneuvers. For traditional fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), pitch control primarily comes from the tail&#39;s elevators, while adjusting flight lift and drag involves deploying wing flaps. Although these designs ensure reliable flight, they compromise the drones’ maneuverability to maintain longitudinal stability. Therefore, the study introduces a biomimetic morphing wing UAV, and presents a pitch control strategy that simultaneously engages morphing wings, ailerons, and tail elevators. The pull-up maneuver tests indicate that the proposed control method results in a pitch rate that is approximately 2.5 times greater than when using only the elevator control. A closed-loop control system for the drone is also established. The closed-loop flight experiment, which tracks a 45° pitch angle, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed coupled control method in adjusting the flight attitude. In addition, during cruising, the UAV employs three configurations, straight wing, forward-swept wing, and back-swept wing, to cater to different mission objectives and augment its flight capabilities.},

In contrast to preparing permanent sections for histopathology, a time-consuming process, preparing frozen sections is significantly faster and can be performed during surgery, where the sample scanning time should be optimized. Super-resolution techniques allow imaging of histopathalogical samples in lower magnification, thus sparing scanning time. Herein, a new approach is presented to super-resolution of histopathological frozen sections, with focus on achieving better distortion measures, rather than pursuing photorealistic images that may compromise critical diagnostic information. Our deep-learning architecture focuses on learning the error between interpolated images and real images; thereby generating high-resolution images while preserving critical image details, which reduces the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation. This is done by leveraging the loss functions in the frequency domain and assigning higher weights to the reconstruction of complex, high-frequency components. In comparison with existing methods, significant improvements are obtained in terms of distortion metrics, improving the pathologist&#39;s clinical decisions. This approach has a great potential to provide faster frozen-section imaging, with less scanning, speeding up intraoperative decisions, while preserving the high-resolution details in the imaged sample.},

This model exhibits the remarkable capability to accurately predict peptide sequences with a high potential for facilitating silica formation. A selection of artificially designed peptides can catalyze the biomimetic synthesis of nanosilica, some of which demonstrate better catalytic activity with a wider pH range and faster reaction rate compared with the peptide R5. Additionally, the designed peptide is used to wrap the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum with nanosilica coatings, resulting in a significant enhancement in the UV resistance of cells.

Other locations that are well-suited for wearables, such as the wrists and arms, suffer from lower perceptual sensitivity. The emergence of textile-based wearable devices introduces new techniques of fabrication that can be leveraged to address these constraints and enable new modes of haptic interactions. This article formalizes the concept of “multiscale” interaction, an untapped paradigm for haptic wearables, enabling enhanced delivery of information via textile-based haptic modules. In this approach, users choose the depth and detail of their haptic experiences by varying their interaction mode. Flexible prototyping methods enable multiscale haptic bands that provide both body-scale interactions (on the forearm) and hand-scale interactions (on the fingers and palm). A series of experiments assess participants’ ability to identify pressure states and spatial locations delivered by these bands across these interaction scales. A final experiment demonstrates the encoding of three-bit information into prototypical multiscale interactions, showcasing the paradigm&#39;s efficacy. This research lays the groundwork for versatile haptic communication and wearable design, offering users the ability to select interaction modes for receiving information.},

  abstract     = {Gait, fundamental to human movement, becomes compromised in cerebral palsy (CP), a childhood-onset central nervous system motor disorder. Precise assessment of patients’ gait is crucial for tailored rehabilitation interventions. Currently, clinical scales assessing CP gait dysfunction mostly, while valuable, rely on subjective clinician observations. To enhance objectivity and efficiency in CP diagnosis and rehabilitation, there is a need for more objective assessment procedures. This study introduces a multi-modal and multi-scale feature fusion (MMFF) framework, a new framework for automating gait dysfunction assessment in children with CP. By utilizing surface electromyography and acceleration signals recorded during children&#39;s walking, MMFF generates a feature vector enriched with adaptively refined feature maps, cross-mode correlations, and both local and global information. Validation of MMFF&#39;s effectiveness is evident through an accomplished classification accuracy of 99.13%. The mean values for precision, recall, and F1-score in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)-1, GMFCS-2, and GMFCS-3, reaching 99.00%, 99.00%, and 98.33%, respectively, further reflect the accuracy of functional assessments at each level.

  abstract     = {The 6G network, the next-generation communication system, is envisaged to provide unprecedented experience through hyperconnectivity involving everything. The communication should hold artificial intelligence-centric network infrastructures as interconnecting a swarm of machines. However, existing network systems use orthogonal modulation and costly error correction code; they are very sensitive to noise and rely on many processing layers. These schemes impose significant overhead on low-power internet of things devices connected to noisy networks. Herein, a hyperdimensional network-based system, called N ⁢ e ⁢ t ⁢ H ⁢ D $N e t H D$ , is proposed, which enables robust and efficient data communication/learning. exploits a redundant and holographic representation of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to design highly robust data modulation, enabling two functionalities on transmitted data: 1) an iterative decoding method that translates the vector back to the original data without error correction mechanisms, or 2) a native hyperdimensional learning technique on transmitted data with no need for costly data decoding. A hardware accelerator that supports both data decoding and hyperdimensional learning using a unified accelerator is also developed. The evaluation shows that provides a bit error rate comparable to that of state-of-the-art modulation schemes while achieving 9.4 faster and 27.8 higher energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art deep learning systems.},

  abstract     = {Currently, cables are manually installed in aircraft manufacturing scenarios. The utilization of robots in cable assemblies can enhance efficiency and ensure quality, presenting great promise for the future. However, the assembly process must control the shape of the cables, which is a significant challenge for robots. On the one hand, cables have high degrees of freedom in space, making accurate modeling of cable dynamics for robotic arm manipulation difficult; on the other hand, cable deformation has uncertainty, and the applied forces cause simultaneous deformation and motion, which is difficult to control. To address these problems, this study proposes a cable-shape control method based on graph neural networks and online visual shape-servoing. The method first approximates cable dynamics with a graph neural network. Then, in practice, the learnt model is used alongside visual-based shape-servoing to generate optimal robotic arm movements, controlling the cable to attain the desired shape. In the experiments, precise control of three different cable types is realized, and an example of a completed cable assembly is shown.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging living muscle as an efficient and adaptive actuator for soft robots has been of increasing interest over the past decade, with a focus on proof-of-concept demonstrations of function. Reproducible design and scalable manufacturing of biohybrid machines requires methods to increase the stroke output of strain-limited muscle actuators and enable accurate and precise quality control and performance monitoring. Compliant mechanical elements, termed flexures, are designed to enhance muscle contractile stroke to ≈5× previously reported values and decode contraction dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. Combining rigid and flexible elements within a linear elastic flexure enables us to outperform the sensitivity of gold standard elastomeric beam-based measurements of muscle contraction at both low- and high-frequency stimulations. Flexures are leveraged to make quantitative comparisons of force, work, and power outputs in muscle actuators, driving us to discover a new observation of frequency-dependent fatigue in muscle, and also develop a novel method for tuning muscle contractile dynamics in a frequency-independent manner. By enhancing the contractile stroke of muscle actuators and precisely tuning contractile dynamics and endurance with unprecedented precision, this study sets the stage for leveraging flexures to improve robust, reproducible, and predictive design and manufacturing of next-generation biohybrid robots.},

Moreover, technologies to introduce dynamic functionalities with high precision and at high resolution after the development of a continuous phase microfluidic chip remain scarce. Herein, two-photon polymerization direct laser writing is introduced as a suitable approach to equip continuous phase microfluidic chips with structurally defined thermoresponsive poly( N- isopropyl-acrylamide) (pNIPAM) microactuators. Harnessing the lower critical phase transition temperature of pNIPAM, and upon controlling specific design parameters, the efficient catch and release of polystyrene beads of different sizes using a pNIPAM micropillar brush array is demonstrated. Moreover, a biocompatible pNIPAM microgripper array is designed to subsequently capture and release differently sized (single) cell populations. Overall, the method offers great flexibility and a high degree of freedom toward the fabrication of dynamic microfluidic devices with great adaptability to experimental conditions in real time.},

Herein, a solar cells-based energy generating e-Skin is presented and how the energy outputs of solar cells can be innovatively processed for multimodal sensing is demonstrated. By reading the variations and energy output patterns of the e-Skin, present on a robotic arm, multiple parameters can be sensed including object motion, color detection, and ambient temperature. With the accurate tracking of shadow sensing, for an object moving in horizontal and vertical directions with respect to the solar skin, information can be obtained such as the velocity and acceleration of moving object. In this regard, the presented e-Skin can also be seen to have vision capability. The presented multifunctional energy-generating e-Skin shows an energy surplus of &gt;1 mW (effective module area of 20 cm 2 ) under white light illumination of 4,450 lux, which is sufficient for continuous powering of portable low-powered devices.

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) has been harnessed as a promising modelling tool for materials research. However, small data, or data scarcity, is a bottleneck when incorporating ML in studies involving experimentation. Current experiment planning methods show several disadvantages: one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experimentation became impractical due to limited laboratory resources; conventional design of experiments (DoE) failed to incorporate high-dimensional features in ML; Surrogate-based or Bayesian optimization (BO) shifted the goal to optimize material properties rather than guiding training data accumulation. The present research proposes leveraging active learning (AL) to strategically select critical data for experimentation. Two AL strategies, query-by-Committee (QBC) algorithm and Greedy method, are benchmarked against random query baseline on various materials datasets. AL is shown to efficiently reduce model prediction errors with minimal additional experiment data. Investigation of hyperparameters revealed benefits of applying AL at an early stage of experimental dataset construction. Moreover, AL is implemented and validated for an in-house materials development task - electrospray modelling. AL exploration as a paradigm is highlighted to guide experiment design for efficient data accumulation purposes, and its potential for further ML modelling. In doing so, the power of ML is expected to be fully unleashed to experimental researchers.},

These sheet-based fluidic diodes restrict reverse flow over a wide range of differential pressures—exhibiting a diodicity (the ratio of resistance to reverse vs forward flow) of approximately 100×—to address functional limitations exhibited by prior soft fluidic diodes. By harnessing the diode&#39;s highly unidirectional flow, soft devices capable of 1) facilitating the capture and storage of pressurized fluid, 2) performing Boolean operations using diode logic, 3) enabling binary encoding of circuits by preventing interactions between different pressurized input lines, and 4) converting oscillating input pressures to a direct current-like, positively phased output are realized.

The increasing size and complexity of graphs call for in-memory computing (IMC) accelerators for GCN to alleviate massive data transmission between off-chip memory and processing units.

Herein, a fully binarized GCN (BGCN) accelerator based on computational resistive random-access memory (RRAM) through software–hardware codesign is presented. The essential operations including aggregation and combination in GCN are implemented on the RRAM crossbar arrays with cooperation between multiply-and-accumulation and content-addressable memory operations. By leveraging the model quantization and IMC on the RRAM, the BGCN accelerator demonstrates less RRAM usage, high robustness to the device variations, high energy efficiency, and comparable classification accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art GCN accelerators on both graph classification task using the MUTAG and PTC datasets and node classification task using the Cora and CiteSeer datasets. These results provide a promising approach for edge intelligent systems to efficiently process graph-structured data.},

  abstract     = {Modular robots have unique advantages in handling faults and improving their robustness due to their self-reconfiguration capacity and homogeneous interchangeability. When locked joint failure occurs in modular robots, the distribution of the failed modules will affect the manipulation capacity of the robot. In this article, a novel self-reconfiguration method that utilizes only the remaining resources available to mitigate the damage caused by module joint failures is proposed. The key node configuration is searched by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and then the collision-free reconfiguration path is planned by the rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm. The proposed method not only handles single-module lockup failure but can also be expanded to multi-module lockup failures, fully improving the fault tolerance of the modular robot. The method is deployed on the hardware, and the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by self-reconfiguration experiments containing faulty modules.},

The adversarial attack technology makes both these models face severe challenges. Prior research is focused solely on attacking single object detection models, without considering the impact of the preprocessing models (multifocus image fusion) on adversarial perturbations within the object detection system. Multifocus image fusion models work in conjunction with the object detection models to enhance the quality of the images and improve the capability of object detection system. Herein, the problem of attacking object detection system that utilizes multifocus image fusion as its preprocessing models is addressed. To retain the attack capabilities of adversarial samples against as many perturbations as possible, new attack method called adaptive retention attack (ARA) is proposed. Additionally, adversarial perturbations concentration mechanism and image selection mechanism, which, respectively, enhance the transferability and attack capability of ARA-generated adversarial samples. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the ARA. The results confirm that the ARA method can successfully bypass multifocus image fusion models to attack the object detection model.},

To address this, intelligent surveillance systems leverage AI and computer vision to automatically detect anomalies. This study proposes an innovative method combining 3D convolutions and long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to capture spatiotemporal features in video data. Notably, a structured coarse-level feature fusion mechanism enhances generalization and mitigates the issue of vanishing gradients. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, the approach employs depth-wise feature stacking, reducing computational complexity and enhancing the architecture. Additionally, it integrates microautoencoder blocks for downsampling, eliminates the computational load of ConvLSTM2D layers, and employs frequent feature concatenation blocks during upsampling to preserve temporal information. Integrating a Conv-LSTM module at the down- and upsampling stages enhances the model&#39;s ability to capture short- and long-term temporal features, resulting in a 42-layer network while maintaining robust performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in false alarms and improved accuracy compared to contemporary methods, with enhancements of 2.7%, 0.6%, and 3.4% on the UCSDPed1, UCSDPed2, and Avenue datasets, respectively.},

This study presents an innovative weight-level pruning technique that mitigates the challenges of overparameterization, and subsequently minimizes the electricity usage of such large deep learning models. The method focuses on removing redundant parameters while upholding model accuracy. This methodology is applied to classify Eimeria species parasites from fowls and rabbits. By leveraging a set of 27 pretrained CNN models with a number of parameters between 3.0M and 118.5M, the framework has identified a 4.8M-parameter model with the highest accuracy for both animals. The model is then subjected to a systematic pruning process, resulting in an 8% reduction in parameters and a 421M reduction in floating point operations while maintaining the same classification accuracy for both fowls and rabbits. Furthermore, unlike the existing literature where two separate models are created for rabbits and fowls, this article presents a combined model with 17 classes. This approach has resulted in a CNN model with nearly 50% reduced parameter size while retaining the same accuracy of over 90%.},

Although related studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of deep learning models in diagnosing mpox, key aspects such as model inference speed and parameter size have always been overlooked. Herein, an ultrafast and ultralight network named Fast-MpoxNet is proposed. Fast-MpoxNet, with only 0.27 m parameters, can process input images at 68 frames per second (FPS) on the CPU. To detect subtle image differences and optimize model parameters better, Fast-MpoxNet incorporates an attention-based feature fusion module and a multiple auxiliary losses enhancement strategy. Experimental results indicate that Fast-MpoxNet, utilizing transfer learning and data augmentation, produces 98.40% classification accuracy for four classes on the mpox dataset. Furthermore, its Recall for early-stage mpox is 93.65%. Most importantly, an application system named Mpox-AISM V2 is developed, suitable for both personal computers and smartphones. Mpox-AISM V2 can rapidly and accurately diagnose mpox and can be easily deployed in various scenarios to offer the public real-time mpox diagnosis services. This work has the potential to mitigate future mpox outbreaks and pave the way for developing real-time diagnostic tools in the healthcare field.},

Herein, each of the fabricated magnetic millirobots is magnetized with a dissimilar magnetization profile. Further, these millirobots are independently controlled using the mentioned magnetization strategy in addition to the supply of controlled current to each electromagnetic coil. To explore the physics of this combined stepwise approach in controlling the millirobots, theoretical and numerical investigations are carried out that further ensure the practical significance for broad applications. For demonstration purposes, three different shear-induced flow manipulation experiments, including the particle manipulation task, fluid color transition task, and micromixing task, are conducted using more than one millirobot with distinct motions. A maximum of three millirobots controlled with different motions are employed in the micromixing task, and further, it is observed to achieve nearly 80% mixing efficiency within 45 s. The presented work with the introduced actuation system and motion control strategies can strengthen the existing methods of small-scale robots for various applications, particularly for tasks that demand multiple millirobots.},

In order to find a better solution, an improved algorithm based on GWO is proposed herein. Gaussian barebone, random selection and chaotic game mechanisms are introduced into the GWO algorithm to enhance the global search ability. The GWO enhanced by three mechanisms is called CBRGWO. To verify the performance of CBRGWO, using IEEE CEC 2017 as a test function, CBRGWO is compared to five GWO variants, five basic algorithms, six advanced algorithms, and four champion algorithms. CBRGWO is evaluated using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Then, the stability of CBRGWO is analyzed. To verify that CBRGWO is still effective in practical application, CBRGWO is applied to five engineering problems and a water quality prediction problem. The experimental findings indicate that CBRGWO maintains excellent optimization ability in practical engineering problems.},

Various cable-crawling robots (CCRs) have been developed to perform scheduled inspection or convey supplies. Most existing CCRs are often actuated by motors and used in large-scaled engineering structures. The heavy bodies of these CCRs can cause damage or even casualties once slippage or drop occurs. A small and lightweight CCR that can crawl on thin cables is highly demanded for safety inspection in narrow and confined inner spaces of engineering structures. Herein, a soft CCR (weight, 2.1 g; length, 43 mm) is developed by utilizing multilayered dielectric elastomer actuators. Compared with existing solutions, this CCR achieves crawling on thin cables (diameter: &lt;1 mm) while crawling fastest (horizontal: 0.72 body length per second). The CCR is also capable of transporting objects (horizontal: 3.69 times its own weight; vertical: 0.76 times its own weight), climbing upward on a vertical cable, and locomoting across the water–air interface. The CCR is also demonstrated to crawl on a slack cable and circular/spiral cables. Finally, the soft robot, equipped with an endoscope, demonstrates inspections on a tensegrity structure as well as in an airplane wing model with a preplaced cable.},

Herein, surface curvature is explored as a design modality and a deep learning framework is presented to produce topologies with as-desired curvature profiles. The inverse design framework can generalize to diverse topological features such as tubular, membranous, and particulate features. Moreover, successful generalization beyond both the design and data space is demonstrated by inverse designing topologies that mimic the curvature profile of trabecular bone, spinodoid topologies, and periodic nodal surfaces for application in bio-scaffolds and implants. Lastly, curvature and mechanics are bridged by showing how topological curvature can be designed to promote mechanically beneficial stretching-dominated deformation over bending-dominated deformation.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be thoroughly tested to ensure safety and reliability before marketing. Simulation-based testing has gained widespread recognition as the essential approach for AV testing by providing sufficient testing scenarios in the virtual environment. Vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) simulation has the ability to perform comprehensive tests and validations for the AVs’ overall behaviors while keeping significant testing accuracy and efficiency through the combination of the virtual scenarios and the physical AV. This article provides an overview of representative studies on testbench-based VIL simulation testing for AVs, mainly focusing on utilizing testbenches to simulate realistic road conditions, and using physical signal stimulation methods and related equipment to generate sensors’ physical signals. This article first summarizes current AV testing studies, identifying existing issues and flaws of the state-of-the-art methods and tools. Afterward, the testbench-based VIL is addressed around architecture, principles, advantages, and characteristics. Then, the road condition simulation and the sensor physical signal generation in VIL are discussed in depth from structure, principle, and corresponding advanced equipment. Finally, research gaps between cutting-edge technologies and AV testing applications in industrialization are identified to facilitate future research in this direction.},

In this work, it is found that the mathematical fitting methods which have been widely used to describe the decay trend of organic LEDs and quantum-dot LEDs, are unable to accurately predict the lifetime of perovskite LEDs. Then an ensemble machine learning model is developed, which utilizes data augmentation technique to predict T 50 of perovskite LEDs based on features before T 80 , achieving an accuracy of 0.995. Furthermore, the model can also accurately predict the T 90 lifetime of quantum-dot LEDs (QLEDs) using features before T 98 , suggesting it is a useful tool to efficiently evaluate LED lifetimes.},

Due to the intrinsic compliance of soft robotics for biomimicking purposes and the volume-regulation capability of the 3D origami patterns, the soft robots with origami patterns show promising potential in such research. However, the folding deformation of the origami facets cannot be straightforwardly implemented as the actuation or the body movement, and the predetermined movements of the pattern limit the appropriate functions for specific applications. In this work, an origami-patterned rigidification (OPR) method is proposed for applying rigid origami mechanisms (herein, the cuboctahedron origami ball) to the chamber-like structure of soft robots. The motion of the soft robot is programmed by purposefully rigidified the soft chamber following the pattern. The resultant OPR structures are granted with functions corresponding to the predetermined motion of the pattern, and the expanded movements through the bifurcation brought by the soft–rigid characteristics. The concept, design, and fabrication of the OPR robot are presented. By analyzing the deformation of the soft creases, the kinematic models of the predetermined and expanded degrees of freedom are presented and verified by experiments. The extended functions of two OPR robots are demonstrated.},

While exploration techniques address this requirement, conventional exploration methods have limitations: complexity of hardware implementation and significant hardware burden.

The electrical characteristics of fabricated FeFETs with low-power operation capability verify their suitability for neuromorphic systems. The proposed system achieves comparable performance to the conventional exploration method without additional circuits. The intrinsic 1/ f noise of the FeFETs facilitates efficient exploration and offers significant advantages: efficiency in hardware implementation and simplicity in adjusting the 1/ f noise level for optimal performance. This approach effectively addresses the challenges of conventional exploration methods. The operation mechanism of the exploration method utilizing the 1/ f noise is systematically analyzed. The proposed in-memory RL system demonstrates robustness and reliability to the device-to-device variation and the initial conductance distribution.

Gate-last processed FDSOI MOSFET with a high-k/metal gate stack features a memory window of 10 3 . Synaptic conductance is stably regulated by utilizing the FDSOI MOSFET, which offers the advantage of mitigating leakage current when compared to bulk Si MOSFET. Short- and long-term plasticity are investigated by applying engineered pulse, verifying the long-term synaptic properties of pattern recognition processes. With controllable synaptic conductance, the trade-off between conductance change and linearity regarding the recognition rate is evaluated, attaining a recognition rate of 0.83. To verify the pre- and post-synaptic weights within a real hardware-based neuromorphic system, 5 × 6 FDSOI field-effect transistor (FET) synapse array is interconnected to 10 × 10 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron array. The synaptic plasticity of FDSOI MOSFET in post-neurons following neuron firing in the neuron device is successfully demonstrated. These results indicate that FDSOI MOSFET devices could be applicable as synapse devices due to controllability and capability to realize signal transmissions and self-learning processes simultaneously and used to mimic a synapse neuron network system by configuring a hardware system interconnected with the LIF neuron.},

  abstract     = {Extensive efforts in providing upper limb amputees with sensory feedback have primarily focused on the restoration of tactile capabilities, while challenges in evoking proprioceptive sensations have been poorly addressed. Previously, an human–machine interface (HMI) was proposed based on permanent magnets implanted in residual muscles of an amputee, namely the myokinetic interface, to control robotic limb prostheses. Besides control, implanted magnets offer an unprecedent opportunity to trigger musculotendon proprioceptors via untethered selective vibrations. Herein, the challenge of tracking multiple moving magnets is addressed (e.g., following muscle contractions) while being vibrated by controlled magnetic fields produced by external coils. Results demonstrate the viability of a real-time (RT) system capable of simultaneously tracking and vibrating multiple moving magnets within a three-dimensional workspace. Highly selective torsional vibrations in the frequency span eliciting movement illusions (70, 80, and 90 Hz) are achieved on two moving magnets, with efficiencies above 0.82 (over 80% of spectral power at the desired frequency). Tracking accuracy and precision remain robust to the coil magnetic field, with position median errors below 1.2 mm and median displacement errors below 0.95 mm. This study represents a crucial step towards the development of a bench system to study proprioception in humans.},

This energy barrier allows for energy storage and release which can be used to improve systems characteristics. Bistability has been used to increase the frequency range over which a kinetic energy harvester is effective, and it has been proposed that bistability can increase the efficiency of biomimetic swimming robots. However, experiments involving bistable swimming robots have typically used bistability as a means of overcoming limitations inherent to soft actuators, rather than to increase overall performance. This article implements bistability into a swimming robotic and compares performance with and without bistable action. The static thrust generation and power consumption for bistable and nonbistable configurations for five different tail morphologies are compared. Bistability is generally found to increase the system efficiency, particularly at lower frequencies where increases are observed up to 250%. The untethered swimming speed of the robot in open water is also found to increase by approximately 30%. The results show that bistability can offer direct performance benefits for biomimetic swimming, but that the bistable transmission must be well tuned to the dynamics of the rest of the system.},

Based on the nonlinear response of STT–MTJ NSCS, the small-scale network with NSCS synapse is experimented on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset and compared with the traditional network of the same network size. In the simulation result, it is shown that better performance can be achieved with the STT–MTJ NSCS, including a 2–15 times improvement in convergence speed and a 2.5%–5.1% increase in accuracy.},

The corresponding scribing width and sheet resistance data are used as input databases for ML analysis. The classification and regression tree (CART)-based ML analysis revealed that median pulse energy &lt;5.7 μJ insufficient to separate the adjacent scribing regions. While pulse energy &gt;5.7 μJ, APL &gt; 35%, LSO &gt; 46%, and processing speed ≥1250 mm s −1 gives ≥16 μm of scribing width. Further, the decision tree (DT) analysis showed that pulse energy of ≥8.1 μJ, and LSO ≥ 37% are required for electrically isolated lines. The feature importance score suggests that laser fluence and pulse energy determined the scribing width, whereas electrical isolation strongly depends on LSO and processing speed.

Particularly, it is indicated that haptics can potentially improve early childhood learning outcomes and spatial reasoning skills as it can increase children&#39;s interest, participation, performance in educational activities, and analytical ability. The major drawbacks of the current studies, such as variance in participants’ learning challenges and small sample numbers are also highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Clusters, an aggregation of several to thousands of atoms, molecules, or ions, are the building blocks of novel functional materials by atomic manufacturing and exhibit excellent applications in catalysis, quantum information, and nanomedicine. The evolution of cluster structures has been studied for many years. Many effective structural search methods, such as genetic algorithm, basin-hopping, and so on, have been developed. However, the efficient execution of these methods relies on precise energy calculators, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Up to now, limited by computational methods and capabilities, the researches mainly focus on free-standing clusters, which are different from clusters in practical applications. Recently, the rapid development of big data-driven machine learning is expected to replace DFT for high-precision large-scale computing. In this review, the present cluster search methods and challenges currently faced have been summarized. It is proposed that the development of artificial intelligence has the potential to solve some practical problems including the structural and properties evolution of clusters in complex environment, causing revolutionary developments in the fields of catalysis, quantum information, and nanomedicine based on clusters.},

  abstract     = {Actuators based on soft elastomers offer significant advantages to the field of robotics, providing greater adaptability, improving collision resilience, and enabling shape-morphing. Thus, soft fluidic actuators have seen an expansion in their fields of application. Closed-cycle hydraulic systems are pressure agnostic, enabling their deployment in extremely high-pressure conditions, such as deep-sea environments. However, soft actuators have not been widely adopted on unmanned underwater vehicle control surfaces for deep-sea exploration due to their unpredictable hydrodynamic behavior when camber-morphing is applied. This study presents the design and characterization of a soft wing and investigates its feasibility for integration into an underwater glider. It is found that the morphing wing enables the glider to adjust the lift-to-drag ratio to adapt to different flow conditions. At the operational angle of attack of 12.5°, the lift-to-drag ratio ranges from −70% to +10% compared to a rigid version. Furthermore, it reduces the need for internal moving parts and increases maneuverability. The findings lay the groundwork for the real-world deployment of soft robotic principles capable of outperforming existing rigid systems. With the herein-described methods, soft morphing capabilities can be enabled on other vehicles.},

The improvement of traffic efficiency for mixed flow at near-saturated short-distance tandem signalized intersections (STSI) needs attention. Most of the existing studies design a generalized control rule for AVs, ignoring the heterogeneity among different AVs. Herein, a multivehicle trajectory planning framework based on a multiagent reinforcement learning (MRL) algorithm is designed to heuristically explore the optimal traffic efficiency of mixed flow at STSI. The core algorithm of this framework is improved from the classical MRL algorithm multi-agent proximal policy optimization based on the idea of the virtual group instead of designing control rules. The trajectories planned by the framework show outstanding performance in improving throughputs and reducing emissions at the global system level, comparing natural driving, classic adaptive cruise control model and cooperative adaptive cruise control model. The framework can be used to explore optimal traffic efficiency for mixed flow and better heterogeneous rules for high-level AVs.},

So far, the exploration of thick-panel origami has been relatively limited, but it is worth noting that the incorporation of rigid thick panels can introduce unique mechanical properties, showcasing great potential in addressing manipulation challenges. Our previous work has developed a gripper from thick-panel waterbomb origami, which can pick up a variety of daily objects. Based on the same prototype, this article extends the gripper&#39;s function from grasping to in-hand manipulation, which is attributed to the kinematic bifurcations and compliance of thick-panel origami. A kinematic study is carried out to investigate the gripper&#39;s bifurcated motion modes. The hinge compliance is also taken into account to enhance the gripper&#39;s motion dexterity. Theoretical analysis and experiments are conducted to demonstrate both features, thereby paving the foundation for achieving dexterous motions with a simplified control strategy. Aided by a differential mechanism, the gripper can effectively interact with objects with the actuation inputs from only two motors. Objects including balls, cuboids, and cones are explored for in-hand manipulation under different motion modes, showing varied trajectories. With the integration of tactile sensors at the fingertips, we have also revealed the gripper&#39;s potential for classification tasks.},

The concept that there are light-absorbing materials, electron-transporting materials, and hole-transporting materials in PSCs is successfully learned by the NLP-based machine learning model without a time-consuming human expert training process. The NLP model highlights a hole-transporting material that receives insufficient attention in the literature, which is then elaborated via density functional theory calculations to provide an atomistic view of the perovskite/hole-transporting layer heterostructures and their optoelectronic properties. Finally, the above results are confirmed by device experiments.

The proposed method uses a general design parameterization that works for multiple types of cylindrical origami patterns (Kresling, cylindrical Miura, Yoshimura, and Accordion). It is shown that a 3-DoF pneumatic actuator capable of bending and extension can be constructed by superimposing two cylindrical origami patterns to create a separation of chambers inside of the module. In addition, the design parameters are chosen to reduce the strain during deformation and maximize the output forces of the origami actuator. The actuator is manufactured, and its motion and force profiles are experimentally characterized.

This pertains particularly to its cameras as predominant sensors to perceive the environment and support actions. A fundamental camera problem addressed in this study is noise. Solutions often focus on denoising images a posteriori, that is, fighting symptoms rather than root causes. However, tackling root causes requires identifying the noise sources, considering the limitations of mobile platforms. In this work, a real-time, memory-efficient, and reliable noise source estimator that combines data-based and physically based models is investigated. To this end, a deep neural network that examines an image with camera metadata for major camera noise sources is built and trained. In addition, it quantifies unexpected factors that impact image noise or metadata. This study investigates seven different estimators on six datasets that include synthetic noise, real-world noise from two camera systems, and real-field campaigns. For these, only the model with most metadata is capable to accurately and robustly quantify all individual noise contributions. This method outperforms total image noise estimators and can be plug-and-play deployed. It also serves as a basis to include more advanced noise sources, or as part of an automatic countermeasure feedback loop to approach fully reliable machines.},

Consequently, the mole serves as an ideal model for designing highly efficient burrowing robots. This study introduces a mole-inspired robot burrowing with forelimbs, specifically designed for planetary soil exploration. By closely examining the distinctive body morphology of moles, a forelimb burrowing mechanism is devised through biomimetic mapping, and its kinematics is thoroughly analyzed. A robot prototype is developed and an experimental setup is constructed to evaluate its burrowing performance. A series of tests are conducted to assess the capabilities of the robot, including forelimb burrowing, robot crawling, and robot burrowing. The results demonstrate that the proposed mole-inspired burrowing robot is capable of crawling and burrowing to a certain depth using its forelimbs. Although it exhibits some upward displacement, this issue can be mitigated by modifying the head configuration and adjusting the forelimb posture to effectively overcome the vertical stress and lift force exerted by granular soils due to intensity gradient.},

This study hypothesizes that the gait and belly-dragging posture of tortoises can improve the energy efficiency of robots. To test this hypothesis, a quadruped robot mimicking these tortoise characteristics is developed, utilizing the cost of transport (CoT) as a measure of energy efficiency. Dynamic simulations and real-world experiments are conducted, varying parameters like robot size, mass, friction coefficient, and Froude number, to validate the generality of the findings. The results indicate that both belly dragging, a postural characteristic of tortoises, and their diagonal gait significantly lower the robot&#39;s CoT. This suggests that the energy-efficient locomotion of tortoises, specifically the diagonal gait with belly dragging, is transferable to robotic platforms to enhance energy efficiency. The tortoise-inspired robot design offers significant potential in applications such as search and rescue operations, space exploration, and payload transportation. Furthermore, the tortoise-inspired locomotion strategy can be effectively integrated with other research focusing on energy efficiency improvements through mechanical structures or control strategies.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces WingSegment, a MATLAB app-designed tool employing a hybrid approach of computer vision and graph theory for precise insect wing image segmentation. WingSegment detects cells, junctions, Pterostigma, and venation patterns, measuring geometric features and generating Voronoi patterns. The tool utilizes region-growing, thinning, and Dijkstra&#39;s algorithms for boundary detection, junction identification, and vein path extraction. It provides histograms and box plots of geometric features, facilitating comprehensive wing analysis. WingSegment&#39;s efficiency is validated through comparisons with established tools and manual measurements, demonstrating accurate results. The tool further enables exporting detected boundaries as FreeCAD macro files for 3D modeling and printing, supporting finite element analysis. Beyond advancing insect wing morphology understanding, WingSegment holds broader implications for diverse planar structures, including leaves and geocells. This tool not only enhances automated geometric analysis and 3D model generation in insect wing studies but also contributes to the broader advancement of analysis, 3D printing, and modeling technologies across various planar structures.},

Using sensor fusion techniques, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) of the KNN model are determined to be 0.01522 and 0.00132, respectively, in the range of 0–5.07 standard liters per minute. Compared with the average results obtained using only a single input, those obtained using a dual input indicate a significant decrease in the MAE and MSE by 85.69% and 96.68%, respectively. Furthermore, a transient analysis of the ML-based flow sensor is conducted to investigate the response time and transient characteristics of the MLR, KNN, and DNN models.

Simultaneous real-time visualization and manipulation of microcarriers at any depth in the human body is far to be achieved even though one of each task has been successfully proven. Herein, a novel targeting strategy is proposed that employs field-free region (FFR) scanning to guide microcarriers through multiple bifurcations within a predefined vessel network. The main challenge of this method lies on how, where, and when to activate FFR to steer a particle to a desired direction, regardless of its spatial feedback. To achieve it, first, a mathematical model of particle motion in a vessel network is developed to predict particle behaviors and positions. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is formulated to place FFR well-coordinated around each bifurcation at a designated moment. The established solution for targeting a magnetic microcarrier is preemptively evaluated through finite element simulations and then successfully implemented in in vitro multibranched vessels.},

Herein, “DeepStalk,” a soft robot designed for deep-sea exploration, is introduced, utilizing three shape memory alloys (SMAs) springs that mimic the three tentacle flexor muscles of deep-sea snails. Overall, DeepStalk incorporates sensory, actuation, and control modules for operation under high hydrostatic pressure. To achieve precise control of its orientation in 3D space, a simple and reliable vector-PID controller is developed. Remarkably, the robot successfully maintains its desired bending attitude even at 30 MPa hydrostatic pressure, achieved through the Joule heating of SMA springs. Furthermore, DeepStalk demonstrates the capability to track moving objects underwater, showcasing its potential application in challenging environments at depths of up to 20 MPa.

However, the clutter echoes originating from such environments have been difficult to analyze. To study the problem of sonar-based navigation in dense foliage in simulation, an artificial generation system for leaf impulse responses (IRs) based on variational auto-encoders is proposed. The system is to aid the construction of artificial foliage echo environments. A dataset of leaf echoes was collected in an anechoic chamber and convolved with the original signal to estimate the IR of each leaf. A modified version of the conditional variational autoencoder - generative adversarial network (cVAE-GAN) architecture was trained successfully on this dataset to produce a generative model that was conditional on leaf viewing angles, size, and species. The IRs generated by the model capture quantitative and qualitative similarity to the measured IRs. It surpasses the previous state of the art foliage echo model based on reflecting disks. The model&#39;s computational efficiency and its success suggest its potential use for simulating large environments of foliage to study bat biosonar and aid in engineering biomimetic sonar devices.},

Patients with positive cytology require neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of instant resection, and conversion to negative cytology results in improved survival. However, pathologists’ or artificial intelligence&#39;s accuracy of cytological diagnosis is disturbed by manually produced, unstandardized slides. In addition, the elaborate infrastructure makes cytology accessible to a limited number of medical institutes. This work develops CellGAN, a deep learning method that enables label-free virtual peritoneal lavage cytology by producing virtual hematoxylin–eosin-stained images with single-color stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. A structural similarity loss is introduced to overcome the challenge of unsupervised virtual pathology techniques that cannot accurately present cellular structures. This method achieves a structural similarity of 0.820 ± 0.041 and a nucleus area consistency of 0.698 ± 0.102, indicating the staining fidelity outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Diagnosis using virtually stained cells reaches 93.8% accuracy and substantial consistency with conventional staining. Single-cell detection and classification on virtual slides achieve a mean average precision of 0.924 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.906, respectively. Collectively, this method achieves standardized and accurate virtual peritoneal lavage cytology and holds great potential for clinical translation.},

To deal with this issue, a novel plug-and-play method known as Misclassification-Aware Contrastive Adversarial Training (MA-CAT) from the perspective of data distribution optimization is proposed. MA-CAT leverages supervised decoupled contrastive learning to cluster nature examples within the same class in the logit space, indirectly increasing the margins of examples. Moreover, by taking into account the varying difficulty levels of adversarial training for different examples, MA-CAT adaptively customizes the strength of adversarial training for each example using an instance-wise misclassification-aware adaptive temperature coefficient. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrate that MA-CAT can be easily integrated into existing models and significantly improves robustness with minimal computational cost.},

These mechanisms range from adapting their movements to move through the environment to the ability to chase prey, all thanks to senses such as sight, hearing, and touch. Neuromorphic engineering is inspired by brain problem-solving techniques with the goal of implementing models that take advantage of the characteristics of biological neural systems. While this is a well-defined and explored area in this field, there is no previous work that fuses analog and neuromorphic sensors to control and modify robotic behavior in real time. Herein, a system is presented based on spiking neural networks implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform that receives information from both analog (force-sensing resistor) and digital (neuromorphic retina) sensors and is able to adapt the speed and orientation of a hexapod robot depending on the stability of the terrain where it is located and the position of the target. These sensors are used to modify the behavior of different spiking central pattern generators, which in turn will adapt the speed and orientation of the robotic platform, all in real time. In particular, experiments show that the network is capable of correctly adapting to the stimuli received from the sensors, modifying the speed and heading of the robotic platform.},

  abstract     = {Morphological adaptation is crucial for animals and robots in navigating unstructured environments. In this article, a quadruped robot with a reconfigurable sprawl posture and posture transformation strategy is proposed, which can transform between different sprawl postures to cope with complex environments and adapt to a dorsal downward fall posture through reverse sprawling. First, the function and structure of the robot are described, including an analysis of the Hawken mechanism&#39;s endpoint trajectories and a regional examination of the robot leg&#39;s fundamental components, establishing a relationship between the trajectory characteristics and linkage length. Second, the robot posture transformation strategy is analysed, obtaining the geometric dimensional constraints and feasibility regions of the posture transformation. The posture transformation process is quantified, and the robot transformation gait and drive functions are designed. The robot gait and velocity regulation are implemented based on a neural control architecture. Finally, the robot&#39;s locomotion and posture transformation are tested using four high-speed cameras. The results show that the robot can crawl on an inclined surface and continue crawling in a dorsal downward posture post-fall. Additionally, the robot effectively navigates obstacles and narrow spaces after posture transformation.},

  abstract     = {The hygroscopic motion of plants has inspired the development of moisture-activated soft actuators. These actuators driven by ambient moisture sources are of great research interest in robotics and self-regulating textiles. However, these actuators often have slow motion and can only perform bending and twisting motions. Herein, a cellulose film-based fast-morphing and motion-programmable soft actuator is presented that can generate caterpillar-like movement. The cellophane films reported here bend almost instantaneously under changing humidity, with a large bending curvature, high repeatability, and negligible hysteresis. Different actuation modes are studied using both coated and uncoated cellophane films. The uncoated cellophane film can continuously move on a moist substrate through autonomous bending–rolling–flipping (or oscillating) cycles. A facile strategy is used here to control the rolling direction and facilitate the flipping motion by offsetting its center of gravity during deformation by adding appropriate weights on the end of the actuator. The coated cellophane film is used to fabricate motion-programmable actuators through heat-laminating. Several actuator structures are designed and fabricated and their diverse moisture-induced motions are demonstrated.},

In particular, the fabricated memristors exhibit both short- and long-term plasticity and traits akin to biological synapses. A fabricated memristor device is precisely programmed to 18 resistive states and each state exhibits stable data retention of more than 100 000 s. Furthermore, a matrix processing unit using a 4-by-4 memristor array is fabricated as the hardware core of an encoder–decoder artificial neural network to demonstrate high accuracy and reliable in-image font conversion. The resistive states of the 16 memristors are precisely programmed to the corresponding resistance values for specific synaptic weights of the artificial-neural-network-trained offline. In addition, experimental characterization and first-principles simulations attribute the continuous programmability and high reliability features of the memristors to the confinement mechanisms of the horizontal grain-boundary structure in polycrystalline perovskite NWs.},

The one-stage object detection network YOLOv5 is modified with a decoupled head, which solves the angle classification problem and rectangle parameter regression problem separately, such that the YOLOv5 network is applicable for robotic grasping and the detection accuracy is significantly improved. A circular smooth label angle classification method is proposed to tackle the boundary discontinuity problem in angle regression, and the periodicity of the angle prediction is guaranteed. A novel Jensen–Shannon intersection of union is designed to calculate the intersection over union of oriented rectangles, which aims to better measure the discrepancies between the prediction and the ground truth and to avoid the singularity problem when two rectangles are not overlapped. Extensive evaluation on the Cornell and visual manipulation relationship dataset datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the JSD–YOLO model in general robotic grasp operations, with 99.7% and 95.7% image-wise split accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Soft robots are being increasingly developed and deployed for underwater applications such as exploration, monitoring, and rescue owing to their innate compliance, mechanical and chemical stability, and waterproof properties. However, they are still predominantly manufactured using silicones and acrylic elastomers, which pose environmental risks due to their limited biodegradability. To tackle this issue, a method for manufacturing water-resistant, liquid-driven soft actuators made from a novel type of konjac glucomannan (KGM) is presented, which is plant-derived, insoluble, and edible. The material offers impressive stretchability, reaching up to 67.2% of its initial length, surpassing previous related work, and withstands over a 1000 cycles of tensile stress. Using this material, we develop soft actuators that can bend up to 47.1°, and the maximum blocking force of 0.1 N is achieved with a pressure input of 20 kPa. A gripper that is capable of grasping various objects underwater is also evaluated. In essence, this article introduces a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional soft robotic materials, paving the way for innovative and eco-conscious underwater applications. The utilization of edible, water-resistant materials like konjac provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and mitigate negative environmental impacts associated with traditional underwater soft robots.},

In this study, a general modeling of supernumerary robotic arms (SRAs) on an omnidirectional floating base is presented. Using position and orientation feedback from sensors at the base and tip, three control methods based on different sensor feedback are proposed to improve tracking accuracy. Experiments on point and trajectory tracking are conducted on the SRAs. In the results (point and circular trajectory-tracking errors with the manipulator as floating base: 1.18 ± 0.56 mm [mean ± standard deviation(SD) error] and 1.42 ± 0.43 mm, point trajectory-tracking errors with the human shoulder as floating base: 1.37 ± 0.58 mm, and the performance in perforation positioning operation experiment), it is demonstrated that the proposed controllers enable the SRAs to achieve high-precision tracking and good adaptability to different user movements and frequencies.

  abstract     = {Existing surgical guidewire endpoint localization methods in X-ray images face challenges owing to their small size, simple appearance, nonrigid nature of objects, low signal-to-noise ratio of X-ray images, and imbalance between the number of guidewire and background pixels, which lead to errors in surgical navigation. An eight-neighborhood-based method for increasing the localization accuracy of guidewire endpoint to improve the safety of interventional procedures is proposed herein. The proposed method includes two stages: 1) An improved U-Net network is employed for segmenting the data of the guidewire to extract regions of interest containing guidewire endpoints with higher precision and to reduce interference from other anatomical structures and imaging artifacts. 2) The proposed method detects guidewire endpoints using the adjacent relationship between pixels in the eight-neighborhood regions. This stage covers skeletonization extraction, removal of bifurcation points, and repair of fracture points. This study achieves mean pixel errors of 2.02 and 2.13 pixels in an in vivo rabbit and porcine X-ray fluoroscopy images, outperforming ten classic heatmap and regression methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection results. The proposed method can also be applied to detect other tiny surgical instruments such as stents and balloons, while preserving the flexibility of the guidewire bending angle.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic devices, which can mimic the human body&#39;s neural system, are rising as an essential technology for artificial intelligence. Here, two types of organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs), OSTR-A and OSTR-B, are fabricated on either glass or polymer film using water-processable charge-trapping gate-insulating layers that are prepared by reacting ethylenediamine (EDA) and poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA). OSTR-A is designed to function as a basic artificial synapse by gate pulse stimulation only, while OSTR-B has additional near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing conjugated polymer layers for further sensing of NIR light upon gate voltage stimulations. The PAMPSA:EDA films are found to contain permanent charge bridges (ion pairs of –SO 3 − + NH 3 -) that play a charge-trapping role in OSTRs. Both devices with the PAMPSA:EDA layers exhibit clear postsynaptic current (PSC) signals upon gate voltage pulses, leading to long-term potentiation/depression characteristics. The flexible OSTR-B devices can sense the NIR light (905 nm) upon gate pulse stimulation and their PSC signals are well maintained even after bending (&gt;5000 times). Artificial neural network simulations disclose that the flexible OSTR-B devices can stably perform synaptic operations under the NIR light with high accuracy (&gt;90%) even after repeated bending (5000 times), indicative of potential use in artificial neuromorphic skin applications.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind it is lacking due to the limited development of theoretical models and insufficient experimental data to validate them. This article proposes a new and systematic approach based on electrical impedance measurements to infer the electrostatic forces between two dielectric materials under EA. The proposed approach is applied to tactile displays, where skin and voltage-induced touchscreen impedances are measured and subtracted from the total impedance to obtain the remaining impedance to estimate the electrostatic forces between the finger and the touchscreen. This approach also marks the first instance of experimental estimation of the average air gap thickness between a human finger and a voltage-induced capacitive touchscreen. Moreover, the effect of electrode polarization impedance on EA is investigated. Precise measurements of electrical impedances confirm that electrode polarization impedance exists in parallel with the impedance of the air gap, particularly at low frequencies, giving rise to the commonly observed charge leakage phenomenon in EA.},

  abstract     = {Fast motion and high adaptability are crucial for the practical applications of miniature robots. However, combining these capabilities into a single robot skillfully is challenging, particularly in the domain of miniature structural design. Inspired by the amphibious motion of crocodiles in nature, a hollow piezoelectric miniature robot (HPMR) is proposed. The key benefit of the HPMR is to concurrently output the oscillating motion of the driving foot (oscillating mode) and the rotating motion of the internal rotor (rotating mode). That is, the mode of single-energy-input-multimotion output allows the robot to balance the requirements of speed and adaptability. In the oscillating mode, HPMR can run at speeds of up to 12.3 BL s −1 and realize a displacement resolution of 0.3 μm. Following the conical rotor assembly, the rotor can operate at a speed of 890 rpm, with a displacement resolution of 7.28 mrad. In the rotating mode, the robot demonstrates its multitasking ability in moving amphibiously, carrying loads, running on surfaces with varying roughness, crossing obstacles, and resisting shocks. The results show that the HPMR is capable of fast, high-resolution moving combined with high adaptability, opening up the possibility of using it for mobile detection tasks in real-world settings.},

Nevertheless, how to efficiently predict relaxed atomistic structures and the associated physical fields on each atom or bond under evolving mechanical deformations remains as an essential challenge. To address this issue, a deep neural network architecture is designed to embed the state of applied strains into the defect-engineered atomistic geometry, so that deformation-coupled physical fields of interests on atoms or bonds can be predicted or derived over continuous state of deformations. For demonstration, the combination of applied tensile strains and shear strain on monolayer graphene with random distribution of Stone–Wales defects and vacancy defects is considered. The unique advantage of this framework is the development of strain-embedding concept combined with generative adversarial network, which can be feasibly extended to other material and other conditions. The computational approach sheds light on boosting the efficiency of evaluating physical properties of 2D materials under complex strain and defect states.},

  abstract     = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental mechanism that regulates gene expressionin both physiological and pathological processes. This article introduces ASTK, a software package covering upstream and downstream analysis of AS. Initially, ASTK offers a module to perform enrichment analysis at both the gene- and exon-level to incorporate various impacts by different spliced events on a single gene. We further cluster AS genes and alternative exons into three groups based on spliced exon sizes (micro-, mid-, and macro-), which are preferentially associated with distinct biological pathways. A major challenge in the field has been decoding the regulatory codes of splicing. ASTK adeptly extracts both sequence features and epigenetic marks associated with AS events. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, we identified pivotal features influencing the inclusion levels of most AS types. Notably, the splice site strength is a primary determinant for the inclusion levels in alternative 3’/5’ splice sites (A3/A5). For the alternative first exon and skipping exon classes, a combination of sequence and epigenetic features collaboratively dictate exon inclusion/exclusion. Our findings underscore ASTK&#39;s capability to enhance the functional understanding of AS events and shed light on the intricacies of splicing regulation.},

In biomedical applications, this challenge is exacerbated by the dense surrounding environments with feature sizes and shapes comparable to microrobots. Herein, Motion Enhanced Multi-level Tracker (MEMTrack) is introduced for detecting and tracking microrobots in dense and low-contrast environments. Informed by the physics of microrobot motion, synthetic motion features for deep learning-based object detection and a modified Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT)algorithm with interpolation are used for tracking. MEMTrack is trained and tested using bacterial micromotors in collagen (tissue phantom), achieving precision and recall of 76% and 51%, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models, MEMTrack provides a minimum of 2.6-fold higher precision with a reasonably high recall. MEMTrack&#39;s generalizability to unseen (aqueous) media and its versatility in tracking microrobots of different shapes, sizes, and motion characteristics are shown. Finally, it is shown that MEMTrack localizes objects with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.84 μm and quantifies the average speed of all tested systems with no statistically significant difference from the laboriously produced manual tracking data. MEMTrack significantly advances microrobot localization and tracking in dense and low-contrast settings and can impact fundamental and translational microrobotic research.},

Previous approaches to nonreciprocity involve ferrite-based devices with bulky systems. Herein, the controlled synthesis of a space–time modulation (STM) metamaterial for enhanced nonreciprocity using machine learning (ML) is investigated. The design of STM metamaterial poses great challenges due to the nonlinear nature of time-periodic Floquet harmonics, which are inefficiently handled in traditional methods such as numerical optimization. To deal with the challenge, an ML approach is proposed that learns from the accumulated training data using the guided objective function and generates high-quality designs by leveraging the learned features. This approach first trains a residual neural network (ResNet) to learn the nonlinear relationships between the STM parameters and nonreciprocal responses. The trained ResNet achieves a high testing accuracy, with 96.7% of the 9000 instances having a mean square error less than 0.6 × 10 −4 . For the synthesis of STM metamaterial, a customized Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is proposed, which leverages the discovered nonlinearity and synthesizes large-scale datasets using small computational costs. The histogram obtained using 90 000 data samples shows that WGAN generates designs with an average normalized nonreciprocity of 0.83, four times higher than the measured data.},

Continuous monitoring of respiration with wearable sensors can provide abundant information related to the health status of the respiratory system. However, the vast majority of the developed respiration sensors are constructed on nontextile substrates, resulting in dissatisfactory convenience, comfortness, and aesthetics. Additionally, special micro-/nanomaterials are inevitably involved to construct the respiration sensors, which pose potential hazards to the human body due to the exfoliation and inhalation of these micro-/nanomaterials. Here, humidity- and temperature-sensitive electronic textiles (e-Textiles) are presented, which are fabricated based on easily accessible and biofriendly materials (e.g., sodium chloride, glycerin, aluminum fiber, carbon fiber, and polyvinyl alcohol). Moreover, the proposed e-Textiles use a potentiometric sensing mechanism, featuring self-powered signal outputs and ultralow power consumption. The humidity and temperature-sensing functionalities can also be in situ integrated into commercial masks for constructing full-textile and all-in-one e-Masks for comprehensive respiration monitoring. As demonstrations, both single-point respiration monitoring (e.g., intensity, frequency, etc.) and 2D respiratory analysis (i.e., airflow distribution) can be realized with the e-Masks.

  abstract     = {Integration of robotic solutions in manufacturing sector is growing. However, it is still concentrated in certain industries (i.e., electronics and automotive) where standardization of product physical form is high. Current state-of-the-art gripping solutions fall short when they need to accommodate items with high variability in physical form. This challenging scenario for automation can be found in a few industries (i.e., e-commerce). Automation of pick-and-place processes in this area requires a more versatile gripping solution. To resolve this challenge, this article proposes a novel way to improve grip-versatility by synergizing the mechanical and machine intelligence of a hybrid robotic gripper (HRG). Comparative analysis with commercial grippers shows that HRG can pick a more diverse range of items with success rate 94.78%. Visual perception-based picking strategy is developed to automate the reconfiguration of HRG into a stable grasp pose for different objects. Using the proposed reconfigurable picking strategy, the efficacy of HRG in pick-and-place tasks is evaluated using three parameters—mean pick per hour (MPPH), successful execution over total attempts (SETA), and average cycle time (AVGCT). HRG can effectively pick items in cluttered workspace with MPPH of 98.54 ± 15.49, SETA of 0.93 ± 0.11, and AVGCT of 34.76 ± 3.31 s.},

  abstract     = {Holonomic mobile micromanipulators driven by piezoelectric actuators offer precision and compact design. However, attaining both high speed and positioning repeatability with sufficient load capacity poses challenges, given that lightweight robots are susceptible to nonuniform driving surfaces and external forces. A holonomic beetle (HB) is proposed to realize a wide range, compact size, precise holonomic motion, automatic micromanipulation, and high-speed movement simultaneously. Inspired by the biological makeup of a Rhinoceros Beetle, a length, weight, and load capacity of 8 cm, 74 g, and of 2000 g, respectively, are used. The HB is a two-legged robot with a pseudoalternating tripod gait locomotion principle, with five piezoelectric actuators for XYθ displacement and switching of the contact leg. It achieves maximum walking velocities of 11.6 mm s −1 for translational motion and 19.3 deg s −1 for rotation, with a displacement resolution of 12 nm. Notably, under open-loop control, the HB demonstrates high repeatability with a coefficient of variation of 0.3%. It exhibits the capability to climb 30°-inclined surfaces, traverse flat surfaces with 0.1 mm bumps, and navigate 30 mm pits. Furthermore, the HB showcases practical automatic micromanipulation through visual servo control and machine learning, presenting potential applications in biomedical and microassembly fields.},

  abstract     = {Soft grippers are ideal for grasping delicate, deformable objects with complex geometries. Universal soft grippers have proven effective for grasping common objects, however complex objects or environments require bespoke gripper designs. Multi-material printing presents a vast design-space which, when coupled with an expressive computational design algorithm, can produce numerous, novel, high-performance soft grippers. Finding high-performing designs in challenging design spaces requires tools that combine rapid iteration, simulation accuracy, and fine-grained optimization across a range of gripper designs to maximize performance, no current tools meet all these criteria. Herein, a diversity-based soft gripper design framework combining generative design and topology optimization (TO) are presented. Compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) seed a diverse set of initial material distributions for the fine-grained TO. Focusing on vacuum-driven multi-material soft grippers, several grasping modes (e.g. pinching, scooping) emerging without explicit prompting are demonstrated. Extensive automated experimentation with printed multi-material grippers confirms optimized candidates exceed the grasp strength of comparable commercial designs. Grip strength, durability, and robustness is evaluated across 15,170 grasps. The combination of fine-grained generative design, diversity-based design processes, high-fidelity simulation, and automated experimental evaluation represents a new paradigm for bespoke soft gripper design which is generalizable across numerous design domains, tasks, and environments.},

First, a modularization concept and a hybrid actuation scheme to create a novel origami continuum manipulator with exceptional deformability are introduced. Second, an accurate model and framework for the forward and inverse kinematic analysis of origami manipulators are proposed. Specifically, each origami manipulator module can achieve axial extension and bending deformation by coordinated actuation of shape memory alloy (SMA) and pneumatic muscles, and the manipulator&#39;s end is equipped with a deformable gripper based on waterbomb origami and actuated by SMA. Through careful consideration of the self-weight and torque balance, an accurate kinematic model based on the Denavit–Hartenberg method is established, which enables one to effectively predict the reachable extreme positions and spatial poses of the manipulator and solve the inverse kinematics using a genetic algorithm. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the design&#39;s rationality and model&#39;s accuracy . In these tests, the rich spatial configurations are not only demonstrated that can be achieved by integrating hybrid actuators with origami modules but also the accuracy and reliability of the kinematic model are confirmed, opening up possibilities for the advancement and application of origami-inspired robotics in various fields.},

FeFETs with silicon oxynitride interfacial layer are fabricated and characterized at various temperatures, varying from room temperature to 120 °C. Although the memory window, numbers of programmable states, and endurance deteriorate at high temperatures, FeFETs show excellent robustness in data retention, write latency, and read stability at all temperatures, especially for binary operation. Finally, system-level simulations using a Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis software using experimental data are conducted to gauge the robustness of the data-search operation using the CAM array under different temperatures. Despite temperature-variation-induced changes in FeFET devices, it is observed that binary CAM cells perform robust and unerring search operations for storing and searching data at temperatures up to 120 °C.},

In this article, large-scale analog SNNs are investigated and optimized at the hardware-level by using SNNSim, the novel simulator for SNNs that employ analog synaptic devices and integrate-and-fire (I&amp;F) neuron circuits. SNNSim is a reconfigurable simulator that accurately and very quickly models the behavior of the user-defined device characteristics and returns key metrics such as area, accuracy, latency, and power consumption as output. Notably, SNNSim exhibits exceptional efficiency, as it can process the entire 10 000 Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) test dataset in a few seconds, whereas SPICE simulations require hours to simulate a single MNIST test data. Using SNNSim, the conversion of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs is simulated and the performance of the large-scale analog SNNs is optimized. The results enable the design of accurate, high-speed, and low-power operation of large-scale SNNs. SNNSim code is now available at https://github.com/SMDLGITHUB/SNNSim.},

Many researchers have attempted to solve this problem by introducing deep reinforcement learning, which trains agents through interaction with their environments. A method called BOAE-DDPG, which combines the novel bidirectional obstacle avoidance enhancement (BOAE) mechanism with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, is proposed to enhance the learning ability of obstacle avoidance. Inspired by the analysis of the reaction advantage in dynamic psychology, the BOAE mechanism focuses on obstacle-avoidance reactions from the state and action. The cross-attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance the attention to valuable obstacle-avoidance information. Meanwhile, the obstacle-avoidance behavioral advantage is separately estimated using the modified dueling network. Based on the learning goals of the mobile robot, new assistive reward factors are incorporated into the reward function to promote learning and convergence. The proposed method is validated through several experiments conducted using the simulation platform Gazebo. The results show that the proposed method is suitable for path planning tasks in unknown environments and has an excellent obstacle-avoidance learning capability.},

Specifically, some models are not parameterized, while others compromise accuracy and speed, which limits their usefulness in multi-device applications and reduces the quality of circuit simulations. To address these drawbacks, a neural compact modeling framework with a flexible selection of technology-based model parameters using a two-stage neural network (NN) architecture is proposed. The proposed neural compact model comprises two NN components: one utilizes model parameters to program the other, which can then describe the current–voltage ( I–V ) characteristics of the device. Unlike previous neural compact models, this two-stage network structure enables high accuracy and fast simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulation without any trade-off. The I–V characteristics of 1000 amorphous indium–gallium–zinc-oxide thin-film transistor devices with different properties obtained through fully calibrated technology computer-aided design simulations are utilized to train and test the model and a highly precise neural compact model with an average I DS error of 0.27% and R 2 DC characteristic values above 0.995 is acquired. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms the previous neural compact modeling methods in terms of SPICE simulation speed, training speed, and accuracy.},

This work proposes a novel markerless 3D tracking framework for continuum surgical tools using a proposed surgical tool partial pose estimation network (STPPE-Net) based on U-Net and ResNet. The STPPE-Net estimates the segmentation and a 5-DoF pose of the tool end-effector. This network is entirely trained by a synthetic data generator based on domain randomization (DR) and requires zero manual annotation. The 5-DoF pose estimation from the STPPE-Net is combined with the surgical tool axial rotation from the robot control system. Then, the entire pose is further refined via a region-based optimization that maximizes the overlap between the tool end-effector segmentation from the STPPE-Net and its projection onto the image plane of the endoscopic camera. The segmentation accuracy and 6-DoF pose estimation precision of the proposed framework are validated on the images captured from an endoscopic single-port system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracking framework for continuum surgical tools.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a flexible surgical robot featuring strong magnetic steering achieved by a hemispherical magnet array actuation, and high-accuracy ultrasonic position sensing achieved by a beacon total focusing method (b-TFM). The hemispherical magnet array with magnetic focusing is described and its array parameters are optimized through finite element analysis to increase the magnetic field for actuation. The magnetic field strength at 100 mm for the array with the same mass as the cylindrical magnet is about 1.8 times higher than that of the cylindrical magnet. Using the magnet array actuation, the flexible robot exhibits the capability of agile steering to navigate along a predefined trajectory. In addition, a 1 mm × 1 mm lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch is embedded into the tip of the flexible robot as a beacon for b-TFM ultrasonic imaging to detect the position of the robot. Therefore, the entire navigation process can be executed under the supervision of the ultrasonic position sensing system, and the maximum error is 0.8 mm when the steering radius is 100 mm.},

  abstract     = {[001]-oriented NaNbO 3 films are deposited on Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 /TiN/SiO 2 /Si substrates at 300 °C. The Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 nanosheets are used as a template to form crystalline NaNbO 3 films at low temperature. The NaNbO 3 films deposited on one Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayer exhibit a bipolar switching curve due to the construction and destruction of oxygen vacancy filaments. Because the Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayer does not act as an insulating layer, the film does not exhibit self-rectifying properties. Self-rectifying properties are observed in the NaNbO 3 memristor, which forms on two Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayers that act as tunnel barriers in the memristor. The memristor exhibits extensive rectification and on/off ratios of 48 and 15.7, respectively. Tunneling is the current conduction mechanism of the device in the low-resistance state, and Schottky emission and tunneling are responsible for the conduction mechanism in the high-resistance state at low and high voltages, respectively. The piezoelectric nanogenerator produced using the [001]-oriented NaNbO 3 film generates high voltage (1.8 V) and power (3.2 μW). Furthermore, endurance of the resistive random-access memory and nonlinear transmission characteristics of the biological synapse are accomplished in the NaNbO 3 memristor powered by the NaNbO 3 nanogenerator. Therefore, the [001]-oriented crystalline NaNbO 3 film formed at 300 °C may be utilized for self-rectifying and self-powered artificial synapses.},

  abstract     = {Capsule endoscopy is a valuable tool for diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, active-control capsule endoscopy, which can be controlled via external stimulation, has emerged as a prominent diagnosis tool, unlike traditional passive capsule endoscopy. However, owing to its rigid cover, the high rotating radii limit its observation range at anchor points, such as polyps. There are also persistent challenges with pass-through in narrow spaces in the intestines. This study proposes a soft-shell capsule endoscope (SSCE) to improve this limitation. Experiments ranging from virtual phantoms to ex vivo investigations in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine were conducted to ensure comprehensive coverage of the entire digestive system by the SSCE. Additionally, in the stomach and intestine experiments, we compared the performances of the SSCE and hard-shell capsule endoscope (HSCE) to highlight the advantages of the SSCE. The results demonstrate that the SSCE achieves a 37.3% increase in the observable angles through bending motions at the anchor point compared to the HSCE, in addition to increased efficiency of pass-through in the intestines. This revolutionary innovation is expected to significantly impact and promote high efficiency via pass-through and the observation area in the clinical application of capsule endoscopy.},

This article aims to bring robots closer to such abilities by providing a framework to detect and clear movable obstacles to continue navigation. The approach leverages a multimodal robot skin that provides both local proximity and tactile feedback regarding physical interactions with the surroundings. This multimodal contact feedback is employed to adapt the robot&#39;s behavior when interacting with object surfaces and regulating applied forces. This enables the robot to remove bulky obstacles from its path and solves otherwise infeasible navigation problems.

Therefore, a pressing demand exists for a proficient online defect-sensing system to monitor  defects evolution continuously within components during plastic deformation in real time. This article proposes an intelligent online sensing approach for detecting defects in metallic plastic forming based on acoustic emission (AE) and machine learning. A comparative analysis is conducted on AE amplitude signals, stress–strain curves, and defect evolution during the tensile process of TA15 titanium alloy specimens under different stress states. It is found that the defect formation process can be divided into four stages based on the AE amplitude signals. A convolutional neural network model for intelligent defect sensing is established. It leverages transfer learning and is grounded in the relationship between AE signals and the evolution of internal defects. The prediction accuracy using different pretrained models is investigated and compared. It is discerned that utilizing GoogleNet as the pretrained model offers the swiftest training pace with a prediction accuracy of 97.57%. This approach enables intelligent online sensing of internal defect evolution in metal plastic deformation processes.},

Current predictive models are limited in terms of resolution and accuracy, prompting the construction of a high-resolution prediction network (HRPN) that estimates the microdistribution of quantum dots, factoring in tumor vascular and nuclear features. The HRPN algorithm is trained using 27 780 patches and validated on 4920 patches derived from 4T1 breast cancer whole-slide images, demonstrating its reliability. The HRPN model exhibits minimal error (mean square error = 1.434, root mean square error = 1.198), satisfactory goodness of fit (R 2 = 0.891), and superior image quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio = 44.548) when compared to a generative-adversarial-network-structured model. Furthermore, the HRPN model offers improved prediction accuracy, broader prediction intervals, and reduced computational resource requirements. Consequently, the proposed model yields high-resolution predictions that more closely resemble actual tumor microdistributions, potentially serving as a powerful analytical tool for investigating the spatial relationship between the tumor microenvironment and nanoprobes.},

Stateful and non-stateful CIM concepts are recently attracting lots of interest, which are demonstrated as logical complete, energy efficient, and compatible with dense crossbar structures. However, sneak-path currents in passive resistive random access memory (RRAM) crossbars degrade the operation reliability and require the usage of active 1 Transistor–1 Resistance (1T-1R) bitcell designs. In this article, the arithmetic performance and reliability are investigated based on experimental measurements and variability-aware circuit simulations. Herein, it is aimed for the evaluation of logic operations specifically with fully integrated 1T–1R crossbar devices. Based on these operations, an N-bit full adder with optimized energy consumption and latency is demonstrated by combining stateful and non-stateful CIM logic styles with regard to the specific conditions in active 1T–1R RRAM crossbars.},

However, planning trajectories for hundreds of agents is a challenging and tedious task. When modifying crowd formation change schemes, adjustments are typically required based on the style of formation change. Existing methods often involve manual adjustments at each crucial step, leading to a substantial amount of physical labor. Motivated by these challenges, this study introduces a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating crowd formation transformations. The proposed GAN learns specific styles from a series of crowd formation transformation trajectories and can transform a new crowd with an arbitrary number of individuals into the same styles with minimal manual intervention. The model incorporates a space–time transformer module to aggregate spatiotemporal information for learning distinct styles of formation transformation. Furthermore, this article investigates the relationship between the distribution of training data and the length of trajectory sequences, providing insights into the preprocessing of training data.},

Key to analog neuromorphic computing hardware are memristors, providing non-volatile multistate conductance levels, high switching speed, and energy efficiency. Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) memristors are prime candidates for this purpose, but the impact of the particular characteristics for their performance upon integration into large crossbar arrays, the core compute element for both inference and training in deep neural networks, requires close investigation. In this work, a W/Hf x Zr 1− x O 2 /TiN FTJ with 60 programmable conductance states, a dynamic range (DR) up to 10, current density &gt;3 A m −2 at V read = 0.3 V and highly nonlinear current–voltage ( I–V ) characteristics (&gt;1100) is experimentally demonstrated. Using a circuit macro-model, the system level performance of a true crossbar array is evaluated and a 92% classification accuracy of the modified nation institute of science and technology (MNIST) dataset is achieved. Finally, the low on conductance in combination with the highly nonlinear I–V characteristics enable the realization of large selector-free crossbar arrays for neuromorphic hardware accelerators.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, demands innovative therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. Drug repurposing, identifying new uses for existing drugs, provides a cost-effective solution. To this end, this study constructs the first drug-target affinity dataset specifically for two novel therapeutic targets for CRC, P2X4 and mTOR, and designs a new deep learning-based multilevel feature aggregation enhanced (MFAE) model. The model implements hierarchical feature extraction and multilevel feature aggregation and enhancement to simulate complex drug-target interactions. Evaluations using fivefold cross-validation on the collected CRC dataset showcase MFAE&#39;s superior predictive accuracy. Fine-tuning of the model on external experimental data further enhances its performance, with a concordance index of 0.930, a determination coefficient of 0.782, and a mean squared error of 0.191. Ablation studies further highlight the key role of the group-wise feature enhancement mechanism and ensemble learning strategy in enhancing the model&#39;s performance. Virtual screening of the Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs identifies Ponatinib and Talazoparib as potential repurposing candidates. Despite limitations in experimental validation, this study establishes an innovative computational framework designed for CRC drug discovery. Overall, this research offers a valuable perspective on leveraging computational approaches for precision oncology.},

Accurately identifying the surface deformation of elastomers has been a key issue for understanding the contact state in a soft touch. However, effective monitoring of the deformed surface topography during soft-touch processes is difficult due to the complexity of interfacial deformation. Herein, the optical detection method based on an ideal diffuse reflection model is proposed to monitor the deformation of the elastomer, enabling the acquisition of a spatially continuous deformation of the surface in a soft touch. This optical system with the parallel incident light can distinguish the elastomers’ surface deformation field by constructing the correlation between the reflected light irradiance and the surface deformation angle. This method allows for the perception of the contact area. Through the deep learning method, the recognition rate can reach more than 84.24% when there are slight differences in the contact of objects with different geometric shapes. The design offers valuable insights for contact state detection tasks and facilitates soft-touch sensing functions through the high precision of optical signal acquisition.},

One emerging application is appending structures on existing ones that may have nonplanar surfaces in unconventional orientations. However, extrusion-based AM techniques are limited to printing on structured, planar environments with a fixed single-nozzle direction. Herein, the authors present a dexterous conformal material extrusion printing method using a six-axis robotic arm capable of constructing complex parts onto highly unstructured surfaces with rough topographies. The manufacturing method employs a custom algorithm that generates layers consisting of 3D spatial coordinates of print path as well as the extrusion nozzle oriented in the normal direction of the substrate, thereby enabling conformal motion of the extrusion nozzle to the unstructured surface. The capabilities of the surface-informed robotic conformal 3D printing method to fabricate structures on surfaces with a variety of topographies in unconventional orientations are demonstrated. Finally, via addition of deposited conductive paths, a high-strength, functional reinforcement capable of in situ deformation monitoring is appended. This work has the potential for reconstructing, repairing, and reinforcing existing structures in human-limited or inaccessible spaces. Integration of functional elements can also enable in situ sensing, monitoring, and self-diagnosis.},

Herein, a sensory modality that has been largely neglected is explored: the ability to perceive wetness. Providing moisture-related information to prosthesis users can increase their overall sensory palette toward a more natural sensory experience. A rapid decrease in skin temperature is found to trigger the illusion of contact with something wet. Two body parts were tested, the upper arm and the lateral abdomen, in a group of non amputated participants, and it was found that a wetness sensation can be elicited and maintained for at least 10 s in 86% and 93% of participants, respectively. It is then demonstrated how to mediate the wetness sensation in real-time using a thermal wearable device that mimics the thermal properties of the skin. Finally, two upper limb amputee individuals used their prosthetic arm, sensorized with the device, to discriminate between three levels of moisture; their detection accuracy was similar to one they had with their intact hands. The current study is a stepping stone for future prostheses aimed at restoring the richness of sensory experience in upper limb amputees.},

Nonetheless, subsequent analytical methods are essential to screen the numerous samples and identify promising material candidates. X-ray diffraction is a commonly used analysis method available in most laboratories which gives insight into the crystalline structure and reveals the presence of phases in a powder sample. Herein, a method for automating the analysis of XRD patterns, which uses a neural network model to classify samples into nondiffracting, single-phase, and multi-phase structures, is presented. To train neural networks for identifying materials with compositions not matching known crystallographic structures, a synthetic data generation approach is developed. The application of the neural networks on high-entropy oxides experimental data is demonstrated, where materials frequently deviate from anticipated structures. Our approach, not limited to these materials, seamlessly integrates into high-throughput data analysis pipelines, either filtering acquired patterns or serving as a standalone method for automated material exploration workflows.},

Ventricular assist devices have direct blood contact while passive ventricular constraint devices have only modest therapeutic efficacy. Current direct cardiac compression devices are either bulky, require noisy driving pneumatic sources, or are unable to mimic the natural heart motion. This study introduces a robotic cardiac compression device made of soft artificial muscle filaments that can simultaneously produce radial, axial, and torsional movements, potentially augmenting the pumping function of a failing heart. An empirical model is developed to describe the device motion and an artificial pericardium is employed to enable uniform force distribution to the heart and real-time pressure sensing. The proposed device could deliver a stroke volume of 70 mL at 15 beats per minute, or a cardiac output of 1.05 L min −1 , and achieve a peak instantaneous flow rate of 2.8 L min −1 and an output pressure of 50 mmHg.

To adapt to multiple scenarios, the hexagonal mechanism can be adjusted to different configurations including convex hexagonal configuration, pentagonal configuration, and concave hexagonal configuration. To achieve more optimized performance of different configurations, the optimization for identifying the optimal dimensions of each link was carried out. Subsequently, the detailed design methodology and specifics are presented. Finally, the load and wearing performance experiments were evaluated. The experiment results demonstrated that the tested maximum load in different configurations exceeded 90% of the simulated value and the entire equipment has a good wearing adaptability.

This manuscript distinctively combines multimodal HRI with cognitive science, deeply probing into the three dimensions, perception, cognition, and action, thereby demystifying algorithms intrinsic to multimodal HRI. Finally, it accentuates the empirical challenges and contours preemptive trajectories for multimodal HRI in human-centric smart manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Gait is a typical habitual human behavior and manifestation of personality. The unique properties of individual gaits may offer important clues in the assessment of personality. However, assessing personality accurately through quantitative gait analysis remains a daunting challenge. Herein, targeting young individuals, standardized gait data are obtained from 114 subjects with a wearable gait sensor, and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTl) personality scale is used to assess their corresponding personality types. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to systematically mine the relationship between gaits and 16 personality types. The work shows that gait parameters can indicate the personality of a subject from the four MBTI dimensions of E-l, S-N, T-F, and J-P with a concordance rate as high as 95%, 96%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. The overall measurement accuracy for the 16 personality types is 88.16%. Moreover, a personality tracking experiment on all the subjects after one year to assess the stability of their personality is also conducted. This research, which is based on a smart wearable Internet of Things gait sensor, not only establishes a new connection between behavioral analysis and personality assessment but also provides a set of accurate research tools for the quantitative assessment of personality.},

  abstract     = {Untethered magnetic millirobots with a characteristic length of a few millimeters can be wirelessly controlled. They exhibit promising potential in a wide variety of applications, particularly for tasks in clinic workspaces. However, magnetically controlling these robots is counter-intuitive and requires a steep learning curve, hindering their wide adoption. Herein, a computer-aided teleoperation platform is developed to operate a soft millirobot, with its feedback control being conducted behind-the-scenes, bridging the user&#39;s inputs directly with the millirobot&#39;s actions to offer an intuitive control. This system enables untrained users to conveniently control the position and actions of the millirobot inside a human stomach phantom by pointing-and-clicking on a real-time video monitor or using a keyboard. The platform automatically materializes the user&#39;s instructions by maneuvering a robotic arm with a tip-mounted magnet to exert a magnetic field to induce the desired response from the millirobot. Experiments show that the system allows the user to intuitively operate the millirobot and deliver its cargo without splitting their attention to monitor the workspace or to calculate the constantly changing control parameters. This platform can lower the barrier for healthcare practitioners without engineering expertise to adopt miniature robotic systems into their workflow and realize these systems’ promising potential.},

Soft robots employ soft materials to simplify the complex mechanical structures in rigid robots and adapt their morphology to the environment, making them suitable for performing some challenging tasks in place of manual labor. Due to superior flexible and deformable bodies, underwater soft robots have played significant roles in numerous applications in recent decades. Meanwhile, various technical challenges still need to be tackled to ensure the reliability and practical performance of underwater soft robots in complicated ocean environment. Nowadays, some researchers have developed underwater soft robotic systems based on biomimetics and other disciplines, aiming at comprehensive exploration of ocean and appropriate utilization of unexploited resources. This review presents the recent advances of underwater soft robots in the aspects of intelligent soft materials, fabrication, actuation, locomotion patterns, power storage, sensing, control, and modeling; additionally, the existing challenges and perspectives are analyzed as well.},

  abstract     = {The impressive capabilities of living organisms arise from the way autonomy is materialized by their bodies. Across scales, living beings couple computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics has advanced the design and fabrication of physically intelligent bodies, the integration of information-processing capabilities for computational intelligence remains a challenge. Consequently, perception and control limitations have constrained how soft robots are built today. Progress toward untethered autonomy will require deliberate convergence in how the field codevelops new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies for soft robots. Here, a new perspective is put forward: that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design. A conceptual framework is proposed for a task-first design paradigm that sidesteps limitations imposed by control strategies. This framework allows emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task-capable agents. Particular attention is paid to the scale dependence of solutions. Finally, an outlook is presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia.},

  abstract     = {Lung disease has become a leading cause of disease-related death, making it one of the most serious health problems in the world. Due to the advantages of fast postoperative recovery and small trauma, transbronchoscopic biopsy has become the main method for the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, limited by the large outer diameter of the bronchoscope, insufficient flexibility of the biopsy needle, and lack of force sensing, traditional biopsy operation is simple and rough, and it is difficult to enter the deep narrow areas of the lung for examination. In this article, a flexible biopsy robot with force-sensing ability is proposed. The robot is composed of a tendon-actuated catheter and an inner sliding flexible needle as well as their driving systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the robot has good positioning accuracy of 0.72 mm and high flexibility and repeatability. With the cooperation of the commercial bronchoscope, the robot can reach various narrow areas of the lung to perform biopsy operations. The proposed robot has the potential to improve the diagnosis rate of lung diseases and reduce related deaths.},

It is shown that the incorporation of externally responsive material enables biologically inspired microrobots to change their shapes and imitate the motion of living organisms under external stimuli, and it is interpreted how biohybrid microrobots are guided through the tactic behavior of microorganisms or cells. Finally, perspectives on key challenges that soft bio-microrobots must overcome to achieve in vivo biomedical applications are given.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial biofilms are widely found in nature, and they can be a major factor in many local chronic infections inside the human body. To date, effective elimination of biofilms is intractable for conventional antibiotic therapies due to the existence of bacteria-protecting extracellular polymeric substances. For biofilm eradication in tiny tubular structures, magnetic hydrogel micromachines (MHM) are designed that are capable of performing mechanical disruption of biofilms while releasing antibacterial agents in a controllable fashion. Two modes of motion controlled by external magnetic fields, namely planar rotation and wobbling modes, have been investigated to drive the micromachines to interact and destruct biofilms. In addition, the presented micromachines are composed of thermosensitive PNIPAm hydrogel that can load with the antibacterial agent (H 2 O 2 ) and release them upon heating. The Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel matrix act as catalysts for the Fenton reaction, generating bacteria-killing free radicals. The synergetic biofilm elimination effect has been experimentally demonstrated in well plates and small tubes. The presented MHMs may provide a new design to treat biofilm-related infections in narrow and confined spaces.},

Whereas, how to control the spreading process and accelerate the spreading speed is a major challenge. The rock-climbing fish is characterized by its alepidote feature that lives in stream habitats dominated by strong currents. The mucus on its body surface plays a vital role in its adherence and maintenance of antifouling and antibacterial properties. However, the rapid, uniform, and efficient spreading mechanism of mucus on the fish body surface remains largely unknown. Herein, it is revealed that the surface of the rock-climbing fish is overlaid fully by the microhexagonal texture structure. This hexagonal structure shows a superspreading effect on liquid diffusion, resulting from testing with bionic microfabrication inspired by the rock-climbing fish. It is demonstrated that the microhexagonal-textured surface can enhance liquid spreading quickly and evenly on the surface by regulating the moving contact line of the liquid. This kind of superspreading mechanism has great potential applications in the antifouling, electroencephalogram electrode interfaces, flexible skin sensors, and interfacial lubrication of underwater surfaces.},

The loss or change of light intensities inside a waveguide can be measured and converted into useful sensing feedback such as strain or shape sensing. Compared to other approaches such as those based on microelectromechanical system modules or flexible conductors, the entire sensor state can be characterized by fewer sensing nodes and less encumbering wiring, allowing greater scalability. Herein, simple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors (PDs) combined with an intelligent shape decoding framework are utilized to enable 3D shape sensing of a self-contained flexible substrate. Multiphysics finite element analysis is leveraged to optimize the PDs/LEDs layout and enrich ground-truth data from sparse to dense points for model training. The mapping from light intensities to overall sensor shape is achieved with an autoregression-based model that considers temporal continuity and spatial locality. The sensing framework is evaluated on an A5-sized flexible sensor prototype and a fish-shaped prototype, where sensing accuracy (RMSE = 0.27 mm) and repeatability (Δ light intensity &lt;0.31% over 1000 cycles) are tested underwater.},

  abstract     = {Compact, low-inertia, and soft compliant robotic joint mechanisms are in great demand for ensuring safe interactions in human–robot collaborative tasks. Tensegrity, of which the structural integrity is constrained by tension, does not involve static/sliding friction among the rigid components. However, this mechanical stability is very susceptible to actuation errors. It requires complex kinematics modeling and sophisticated control model with sensing feedback. Herein, a low-inertia tensegrity joint that is covered/protected by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-embedded silicone sheath is proposed, with the aim to reinforce the joint motion stability and enable self-contained sensing feedback. A learning-based closed-loop controller is also designed and trained with the proper joint configurations selected by a two-step sampling method. Both the kinematics and static equilibriums of such configurations can be well satisfied. The experiments demonstrate that the joint can follow paths accurately in 2D by compensating manipulation error shortly under the closed-loop control. The joint stiffness can also be varied against the external/impulsive disturbances. It can be foreseen that this primitive robot joint component with 2 degrees of freedom (DoFs) can provide safe, compliant interaction with human, for which a simple test of maneuvering a portable ultrasound probe (≈210 g) for abdominal imaging is demonstrated.},

Among them, electrical actuation method is an advanced choice to actuate and control soft actuators that are expected to be compatible and integrated with existing industrial robotic systems and wearable intelligent devices. Current robotic systems have higher requirements on the actuators’ function, which can be explored through material and structural designs. Based on a variety of deformable materials, the structural design enables the soft actuators to span from low dimension to high dimension with further improvement in function. Therefore, in this review, 2D and 3D electrical-based soft actuators from the perspective of dimension design are introduced, which involve functional materials, structure design, and fabrication technology. Some novel 3D fabrication methods, such as the 3D compressive buckling process, are summarized to build 3D soft robots.

  abstract     = {Soft magnetic manipulators offer the prospect of improved surgical outcomes through their potential for miniaturization and inherently safe tissue interaction. However, independent actuation of multiple manipulators within the same confined workspace is limited by undesired simultaneous actuation and manipulator–manipulator interactions. Herein, for the first time, approaches for the independent magnetic actuation of two magnetic continuum manipulators within the same confined workspace are proposed. A novel modular magnetic soft robot segment design is proposed with modified geometry to provide preferential bending planes and high angles of deflection. This design is integrated into two dual-segment magnetic manipulators which, when arranged in parallel, can deliver independent bending in two planes of motion. Two distinct independent control strategies are proposed, based on orthogonal manipulator magnetization profiles and local field gradient control, respectively. Each dual-manipulator configuration is characterized over a sequence of applied magnetic fields and gradients, induced via a dual robotically controlled external permanent magnet system. Manipulator independence, bending range of motion, and twisting behaviors are evaluated as a function of control strategy and manipulator separation distance. To demonstrate the system&#39;s potential in clinical scenarios, a dual-manipulator configuration is adapted to carry an endoscopic camera and optic fiber, respectively. The resultant bimanual system is deployed in the confined anatomy of a skull-base phantom to simulate minimally invasive ablation of a pituitary adenoma. Independent motion of the camera and tool within the confined workspace demonstrate the potential for an independent magnetic tool manipulation for surgical applications.},

Herein, a multilayer 3D printing method is reported for patterning magnetic nanoparticles in ultraviolet (UV)-curable polymer matrix. Various multilayer 3D structures within 10 mm in overall size are fabricated with controlled volumes at different parts, which outperform 2D folded shapes in terms of robustness and kinematic flexibility. By programming heterogeneous magnetization within discrete multilayer robot segments, magnetic torque-induced shape changes including gripping, rolling, swimming, and walking are induced by a global actuation field. Stacked design features with minimum dimension of 200 μm and encoded magnetization with resolution of 350 μm can be realized in the printing process. Meanwhile, enhanced deformation flexibility and formation of orientation-anchoring mechanisms are created by integrating multiple materials with distinct mechanical and magnetic properties, respectively, which enables the creation of versatile 3D multi-material actuators.},

Next, the commercial and synthesized dielectric and electrode materials of DEAs used in high-frequency applications are reviewed. Following materials, strategies for extending the lifetime of DEAs are introduced. Subsequently, the dynamic modeling approaches for DEAs are presented, considering damping, inertia, and the electrical loss. Building on the fundamental research, some important applications are summarized based on the high-frequency motions of DEAs including loudspeakers, active vibration suppression, pumps/valves, haptic devices, and high-speed mobile robots.

  abstract     = {Monitoring heart health typically requires a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) system with a sampling frequency of ≥400 Hz with high power requirements. This allows the detection of clinically relevant cardiovascular events using P, Q, R, S, and T signature peaks in ECG. These requirements limit the scope of ECG use, especially in proactive monitoring, cardiac event prevention, and wireless wearable devices. Herein, a skin-mountable 3-lead wireless sensor patch based on the Einthoven triangle is experimentally demonstrated. It allows us to gather vital cardiac information in place of a conventional 12-lead ECG system. The patch uses the industry&#39;s lowest-power Bluetooth low-energy system on chip which requires 50 Hz sampling frequency to detect all critical events. A firmware for the chip is developed to transmit data wirelessly at extremely low power (−19 dB), resulting in uninterrupted operation for ≈4 days using a simple CR1632 battery. An Android app records and plots ECG data on a smartphone for real-time visual monitoring and transmits the data to the cloud-connected interface for remote monitoring. The demonstration with low-power operation and integration to the cloud-connected interface is a significant step for nonassisted home-based caring to enable preventive health management without being widely constrained by battery and tethered operation.},

  abstract     = {Laparoscopic surgery (LS) has become an effective and widely accepted therapy for patients. However, performing LS requires advanced training and skills, as it demands high precision and dexterity due to visual feedback depending on the collaboration between the surgeon and endoscope assistant, restricted field of view, and limited dexterity inside the body. Thus, a flexible endoscope holder system with an automatic control scheme is proposed to assist LS performance, allowing the surgeon to perform solo LS. A DNA-inspired helix-based structure with wide-angle and constant curvature bending is presented and made of printable nylon with selective laser sintering. The proposed flexible mechanism reduces the cost of manufacturing and assembling. Also, it has a hollow design for embedded sensing and actuation. Then, an optimization method is proposed, which provides a reference for the endoscope installation, robot placement, and pose selection. In addition, aiming at the misorientation problem, a pose-constrained visual servoing control scheme for the endoscope system is developed. Both simulation and physical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed visual servoing scheme can maintain the optimized pose and reduce misorientation during automatic view steering.},

In this work, under the inspiration of mother nature, a novel strategy of simple combination of the bionic bristles structure and the photothermal-driven reversible shape change liquid crystal polymer (LCP) actuator is proposed to work out this difficulty. The combination structure is designed as unique three parts with two bionic bristle units at the two ends and one LCP unit in the center with a soft connection between them. After matching the driving force and the resistance, the prepared soft robot can realize the earthworm-like unidirectionally crawl on the paper surface upon near-infrared light irradiation through the contracting and stretching of LCP with a maximum average speed of 4.4 mm min −1 . What&#39;s more, the crawling speed of the soft robot can be regulated by varying the irradiation distance of near-infrared light or the length of the actuators. This strategy realizes the type of remote wireless control soft robot and has potential application ability in other soft robots with various demands.},

Herein, photoactivated far-infrared thermography is pushed from the millimeter to the micrometer scale by a 2D super-resolution imaging approach capable of tackling the resolution barriers imposed by both diffraction-limited signal collection and lateral spatiotemporal heat diffusion. The proposed imaging strategy relies on a full-wave forward model of far-infrared thermography and on an image-inversion approach, which reconstructs the surface distribution of the sample photothermal absorbers via gradient-descent optimization as the one yielding the best match between predicted and experimental images. With minute-long acquisitions on a commercial low-cost far-infrared camera, less-than-5 μm spatial resolution is demonstrated on both synthetic samples and human liver biopsies ex vivo, thereby exemplifying the applicability of super-resolution photothermal imaging to the fast nondestructive characterization of biological specimens well below the tissue spatial scale.},

This study examines the propulsion of planar V-shaped microswimmers in an aqueous solution powered by a conically rotating magnetic field and compares the experimental results with theory. Propulsion is investigated upon altering the cone angle of the driving field. It is shown that a V-shaped microswimmer magnetized along its symmetry axis exhibits unidirectional in-sync propulsion with a constant (frequency-independent) velocity in a limited band of actuation frequencies. It is also demonstrated that the motion of individual and multiple in-plane magnetized planar microswimmers in a conically rotating field can be efficiently controlled.},

The fabricated DG FET exhibits notable endurance characteristics, with the subthreshold swing remaining consistently within a 2.45% range of change and Δ V th per cycle maintaining stability at 4.5% over repetitive program and erase operations, up to 10 4 cycles. Furthermore, a multilevel characteristic is achieved through low-power program/erase operations based on Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling, which exhibit 0.09 and 0.99 fJ per spike, respectively. These characteristics provide the HNN stability, along with high performance and power efficiency. The NOR-type array in this work demonstrates selective update and bidirectional vector-by-matrix multiplication capabilities. This enables on-chip training based on a gradient descent algorithm, without the need for an additional array for backpropagation. Subsequently, a simulation of the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification is conducted to evaluate the accuracy and training power consumption of the proposed device in comparison to other two-terminal memristor devices. The results show that the DG FET array achieves superior accuracy while maintaining over 180.4 times higher energy efficiency, demonstrating the potential of the DG FET as a promising candidate for low-power HNN applications.},

The authors optimize the design of the piezoelectric cantilever, the weight of the magnetic mass, and the distance between the magnet and coil through theoretical simulation and experiments to maximize each contribution for the H-MME generator. The total root mean square output power of the H-MME generator is 28.35 mW with a power density of 0.042 mW cm −3 Oe 2 in a 5 Oe magnetic field of 60 Hz, which is sufficient for driving multiple functional Internet of Things sensors that detect temperature, humidity, light, UV radiation, air pressure, and sound. In addition, a self-powered smart proximity-detection system (including a microcontroller unit, an ultrasonic sensor module, a piezo speaker, and a Bluetooth module) is demonstrated by rectifying the output of the H-MME generator and controlling it using a power management circuit.

  abstract     = {Magnetic microrobots have gained significant attention in the biomedical field due to their wireless actuation, strong controllability, fast response, and minimal impact on the environment. As the task complexity keeps increasing in the clinical applications of magnetic microrobots, more geometric structures and magnetization profiles have been included in the designs of magnetic microrobots, posing significant challenges to the fabrication of magnetic microrobots. Microassembly is a fabrication method that can create convoluted structures with small-scale modules. It can accurately control the position and orientation of each magnetic module, resulting in a magnetic microrobot with arbitrary 3D geometries and magnetization profiles. This article reviews recent advanced assembly-based fabrication methods of magnetic microrobots, including microassembly driven by contact mechanical forces and noncontact field forces. The principles, fabrication processes, and the advantages and disadvantages of each assembly-based fabrication method are summarized. The existing challenges and future development of fabricating magnetic microrobots by assembly are discussed in detail. It is believed that this review will provide a methodological reference and inspire new ideas for manufacturing powerful magnetic microrobots in future biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Amphibious robots, which are expected to move agilely in both land and water environments with huge differences in medium density, have always been a hot spot in the field of robotics. However, limited by the simple structure and drive system, the existing mini-robots have a relatively single-movement mode, which limits their ability to move in complex environments. This article fuses two different biomimetic morphological features to create an amphibious mini-robot: mimicking the body shape and gait of a terrestrial inchworm, and mimicking the superhydrophobic leg shape and gait of an aquatic water strider. The light-driven approach also brings the advantage of remote wireless manipulation. The mass of the robot is only 8 mg, and it has fast land movement speed (≈0.05 times body length s −1 ), water surface movement speed (≈0.5 times body length s −1 ), and some obstacle-crossing ability (over obstacles of ≈64% of the robot&#39;s height). Moreover, the robot can quickly switch from land to water locomotion, which is expected to facilitate emerging applications in various industrial and biomedical settings.},

  abstract     = {Bubble-driven microsystems inspired by the therapeutic use of microbubbles under clinical ultrasound actuation offer innovative remote manipulation in biological settings. Ultrasound-powered microrobots, benefiting from a distribution of vibrating microbubbles (1–100 μm in diameters), exhibit localized fluid flow for self-propulsion. Microbubbles also contribute to the design of acoustic metamaterials, where distributed actuation of bubbles enables exotic material properties (e.g., negative refractive index). Herein, a metamaterial-inspired microrobot design, which exploits the streaming induced by the collective oscillation of microbubble arrays (&gt; 10), is reported. Such a large distribution of bubbles offers twofold advantages: a mesoscale microrobot allowing ease of handling and motion at a considerably low acoustic driving pressure of 50 kPa. In this work, the oscillatory amplitude of a single bubble that acts as a unit cell of the metamaterial-based microrobot is first characterized. Thereon, this amplitude is related to the flow generated by the collective vibration of all the bubbles close to the theoretically predicted resonant frequency of the bubbles. Finally, the hovering motion of the microrobot induced by the streaming and flow-assisted debris clearance is demonstrated. Such auxiliary functionalities of the microrobot can be useful for applications like contactless sample extraction in inaccessible biological environments.},

However, they still face significant challenges in learning, compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). Recently, several algorithms have been developed to narrow the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs, including features in spiking neurons that can reduce information loss in the membrane potential. Inspired by these advancements, the current study designs and measures a neuron circuit using 180 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology to address this information loss.

As a result, many individuals suffer from frustration, isolation, and depression. Natural verbal communication for SSD patients is now more feasible than ever thanks to advancements in wearable artificial skins and machine learning. This article presents an assistive magnetic skin system for speech reconstruction (AM2S-SR), which enables SSD-afflicted people to communicate with their mouths. Using magnetic field sensors integrated into Magnetphones, the system reads the movement of the mouth by tracking the movement of magnetic skin patches attached next to the bottom lip. The measured magnetic field signals data are then processed using a Fine K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning classifier. The classified data are then exported verbally on speakers, or visually on a display. AM2S-SR successfully identifies the full English alphabets with average success rate of 94.96%, thus enabling SSD people to talk using the mouth and have a more natural conversation with others.},

Each cell is rolled during flow, and its off-axis holograms from multiple viewpoints are acquired. Using the reconstructed quantitative phase profiles of the cell projections, highly discriminating features, enabling cell detection, classification, and differentiation, are extracted via a modified ResNet-18 deep convolutional neural network architecture. The model is first validated by classifying metastatic breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) and normal human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A). An increase in classification accuracy by 1% is achieved when processing five interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This model is further tested on four types of white blood cells and exhibits an accuracy increase of 5% when processing 12 interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This approach is shown to be superior to that of using conventional 2D-rotation augmentation, and can be used to decrease substantially the number of cell examples needed for training the classification model without impairing the results. This novel concept has great potential to be incorporated into label-free imaging flow cytometry and improve cell classification, and be used to detect various types of medical conditions and diseases.},

Template matching not only facilitates downstream processing of the NIE data but also provides a more accurate analysis of the NIE signal characteristics and variations that are difficult to discern with conventional data analysis techniques, such as the height threshold method. The developed algorithm enables fast automated processing of large experimental datasets recorded with different systems, requiring minimal human intervention and thereby eliminating human bias in data analysis.

However, current soft robotics, constructed from flexible materials, face limitations including insufficient proprioception and controllability. Herein, a vacuum-powered proprioceptive soft–rigid hybrid actuator (PSHA) module and a modular pressure redistribution cushion (MPRC) developed using this module are introduced. This PSHA module is capable of detecting both position and force. Each module within the MPRC is equipped with onboard control, proprioceptive sensation, and inter-module communication. The MPRC incorporates a closed-loop control system, enabling it to actively redistribute pressure, thereby preventing prolonged compression of local soft tissue during periods of inactivity. The proposed PSHA module, as evidenced in its application in pressure redistribution cushions, offers a promising approach for designs intent on reducing the risk of pressure ulcers. This study significantly contributes to the advancement of assistive technology, with the potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with immobility or limited mobility.},

However, it is both challenging and biologically implausible to implement such an HP algorithm in noisy and analog memristor-based hardware systems. Herein, it is demonstrated that the requirement for HP signals handling is not necessary and more efficient deep learning can be achieved when using a binary stochastic learning algorithm. The new algorithm proposed in this work modifies elementary neural network operations, which improves energy efficiency by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional memristor-based hardware and three orders of magnitude compared to complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor-based hardware.

Second, the relationship equation for each actuated wrench component in a reasonable actuated joint arrangement is derived, and the number and location of the actuated joints are determined. Third, by optimizing the design of the hip joint as a 2-DOF counter-centered five-link spherical mechanism with different rotation centers, passive knee and ankle joints are designed based on the bionic principle. This design is performed to make the PBM isotropic and minimize inertia. The proposed PBM can withstand heavy loads and impacts owing to its humanoid crossed four-link knee joint mechanism and compliant calf mechanism. Finally, the prototype is processed, and the rationality of the design and excellent performance of the PBM design are verified by dynamic and static simulations and gait experiments.},

This study investigates the transferability of grasping knowledge from on-land to underwater via a vision-based soft robotic finger that learns 6D forces and torques (FT) using a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE). A high-framerate camera captures the whole-body deformations while a soft robotic finger interacts with physical objects on-land and underwater. Results show that the trained SVAE model learns a series of latent representations of the soft mechanics transferable from land to water, presenting a superior adaptation to the changing environments against commercial FT sensors. Soft, delicate, and reactive grasping enabled by tactile intelligence enhances the gripper&#39;s underwater interaction with improved reliability and robustness at a much-reduced cost, paving the path for learning-based intelligent grasping to support fundamental scientific discoveries in environmental and ocean research.},

While many state-of-the-art works achieved optimal trajectory planning, their systems were stable or quasistable, and their approaches rarely optimized the system&#39;s initial conditions (ICs). Here, a new unstable dynamic system task called “internal sliding object stabilization control” is proposed, modeled, and solved by deep imitation learning. Given the system&#39;s ICs, the neural networks (NNs) can imitate the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR), generate optimal trajectories, and compute faster. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is used to track the unstable trajectories. Leveraging on the gradients of NNs, it can optimize the system&#39;s ICs, avoid obstacles stepwise, and ensure the worst bounds of NNs for safety. Subsequently, thorough simulations are conducted, including comparing the iLQR and PID controllers in the task, optimizing the system&#39;s different ICs by gradient descent, and finding the worst bound of the performance by gradient ascent. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves considerably improved performance. Finally, experiments are conducted with a real manipulator to compare the proposed structure with the original iLQR. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm resembles the iLQR well.

Herein, an omnidirectional augmented reality (AR)-assisted robotic telepresence for interventional medicine is developed. A monocular camera is used as an AR device with a manipulator, where virtual key anatomies and instruments are superimposed on video images using multiobject hand–eye calibration, iterative closest point, and images superposition algorithms. The view direction of the camera can be changed via the manipulator, which allows the key anatomies and instruments to be viewed from different directions. Structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo algorithms are used to reconstruct the scene on the patient&#39;s side, thus providing a virtual reality (VR) interactive interface for the manipulator&#39;s safe teleoperation. Two different phantom experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a porcine lumen is performed, in which the operator can view the interventional flexible robot.

Herein, a novel molecular detection platform is introduced by imaging a spatial gradient metasurface consisting of millions of different unique atoms and following with deep learning modeling to classify and quantify small molecules from mixed solutions accurately. The metasurface has a circular gradient geometry, which changes its transmittance intensity pattern based on the surrounding molecules under narrow-band illumination. A convolutional neural network trained on the monochromatic images of the metasurface is employed. The results demonstrate a recognition rate of 96.88% for classification and a mean absolute error of 16.23% for quantification. This novel platform enables label-free, sensitive, and rapid molecular classification and quantification, which opens a new avenue for small molecule classification and quantification and enables possibilities for real-time, on-site, and label-free applications, including environmental monitoring, drug screening, and early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Due to the nonlinearity and underactuation of bipedal robots, developing efficient jumping strategies remains challenging. To address this, a multiobjective collaborative deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor-critic framework is presented. Initially, two deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) networks are established for training the jumping motion, each focusing on different objectives and collaboratively learning the optimal jumping policy. Following this, a recovery experience replay mechanism, predicated on dynamic time warping, is integrated into the DDPG to enhance sample utilization efficiency. Concurrently, a timely adjustment unit is incorporated, which works in tandem with the training frequency to improve the convergence accuracy of the algorithm. Additionally, a Markov decision process is designed to manage the complexity and parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model of the bipedal robot. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a PyBullet platform. The results show that the method outperforms baseline methods by improving learning speed and enabling robust jumps with greater height and distance.},

  abstract     = {Currently, electromyography (EMG)-driven lower limb control can be divided into computational intrinsic control and interactive extrinsic control based on the participation of neural information in the controllers. However, the former method lacks detailed measurements of the expected motion, whereas the latter is prone to errors in diverse movement situations. Based on this problem, a multi-intent prediction scheme is proposed that analyzes both rhythmic locomotion and volitional movement intent for AI-based intrinsic and extrinsic hybrid control (AIEC). A 1D residual shrinkage convolutional network is designed to extract EMG features. The motion state is continuously predicted with an accuracy of 91.66% and the angle completion is also estimated with of 0.9540 and 0.9456 for left and right knee angles, respectively. Additionally, the comparison test further indicates that the motion state classification is significantly improved in the multitask analysis compared with the single-task approach. This work demonstrates and verifies a novel method in EMG studies that multi-intent recognition not only compensates for the lack of information in the analysis of single rhythmic or volitional movement, but also enhances the comprehensive performance and makes AIEC feasible, which optimizes the current EMG-driven control for ampler intent collection and more practical robotic control.},

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning system (IPS) technologies have widespread applications in logistics, intelligent manufacturing, healthcare monitoring, etc. The recently released Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) 5.1 specification enables in-phase and quadrature-phase ( I / Q ) data measurements. It allows angle of arrival estimation and becomes a natural choice for IPS implementation. Conventional BLE 5.1 IPSs use multiple anchors to provide massive redundancy to improve system robustness. It however demands effective approaches to leverage redundancy. Besides, interference due to various environmental factors can introduce severe errors to I / Q data and affect positioning accuracy. Facing these challenges, herein, a novel deep learning-based multianchor BLE 5.1 IPS is proposed. The system aggregates measurements from multiple anchors and makes them available at regular time steps. Then, a novel attentional filtering network tailored to infer high-quality I / Q sample data is developed and a spatial regularization loss incorporating spatial location relationships to strengthen the feature embedding discrimination is proposed. Two multianchor BLE 5.1 I / Q sample datasets are developed and released for public download. Numerical experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with previous BLE 5.1 IPS methods and methods utilizing other radio frequency data. Results indicate that the proposed method consistently achieves submeter accuracy and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Conventional sleep staging is a laborious and costly procedure requiring multimodal biological signals and an expert for the assessment. There has always been a demand for approaches which can exempt the need to going through diagnostic procedures under specialized facilities and enable automated sleep staging. Herein, a high-performance multitask learning model enabling high-accuracy sleep staging using heart rate data is reported. The proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance with reduced computational resource in comparison with the competing machine and deep learning algorithms when trained and evaluated using electrocardiography and photoplethysmogram (PPG) data. The reported model consumes ≈7.5 times less training parameters and ≈75% less amount of input data than the previously reported models and yields better or comparable performance (mean per night accuracy of 77.5% and Cohen&#39;s kappa of 0.643). To demonstrate its potential for wearable electronics, the reported algorithm is implemented in a fully integrated watch. The reported integrated watch is a stand-alone fully functional platform, which automatedly captures PPG data from the subject&#39;s wrist, predicts sleep stages, and displays the result on a screen as well as an associated smartphone application.},

  abstract     = {Flexible force sensors have been widely applied in robotics for object exploring, remote controlling, and human–machine interactions. The tri-axis force sensors for accurate measurement of normal and shear forces are generally in urgent demand. Most tri-axis force sensors rely on signal analyzation between multiple elements to achieve force components, which may need numerous leading wires and limit the force angular sensing performance. Herein, a novel flexible centralized force sensor is developed based on a novel tri-axis force refactoring method. Normal force is detected by the central parallel-plates capacitor, and both the angle and amplitude of shear force can be extracted through the resistance changes. The normal force performance is characterized with a sensitivity of 0.057 N −1 and a detection range of 0–12 N, and the effective detection range of shear force is about 0.5–0.67 N. The minimum distinguished shear angle difference is about 7.3°, which can be further improved by increasing the sensing material&#39;s resistivity. Then, robotic grasping tests are performed and show that the sensor can accurately measure the normal and shear forces and applied shear force angle, which indicates its promising applications in potential robotic manipulation and interactions.},
