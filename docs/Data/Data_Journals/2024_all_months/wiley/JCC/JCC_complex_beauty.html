  abstract     = {An impact of an electronic structure or force field method, gas-phase thermodynamic correction, and continuum solvation model on organic carbonate clusters (S) n conformational and binding energies is explored. None of the tested force field (GFN-FF, GAFF, MMFF94) and standard semiempirical methods (PM3, AM1, RM1, PM6, PM6-D3, PM6-D3H4, PM7) can reproduce reference RI-SCS-MP2 conformational energies. Tight-binding GFN n -xTB methods provide more realistic conformational energies which are accurate enough to discard the least stable conformers. The effect of thermodynamic correction is moderate and can be ignored if the gas phase conformational stability ranking is a goal. The influence of continuum solvation is stronger, especially if reinforced with the Gibbs free energy thermodynamic correction, and results in the reduced spread of conformational energies. The cluster formation binding energies strongly depend on a particular approach to vibrational thermochemistry with the difference between traditional harmonic and modified scaled rigid – harmonic oscillator approximations reaching 10 kcal mol −1 .},

  abstract     = {Quantum chemical methods have been intensively applied to study the pyrolytic conversion of glucose into hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural (FF). Herein, we collect the most relevant mechanistic proposals from the recent literature and organize them into a single reaction network. All the transition structures (TSs) and intermediates are characterized using highly accurate ab initio methods and the possible reaction pathways are assessed in terms of the Gibbs energies of the TSs and intermediates with respect to β-glucopyranose, selecting a 2D ideal-gas standard state at 773 K to represent the pyrolysis conditions. Several pathways can lead to the formation of both HMF and FF passing through rate-determining TSs that have ΔG ‡ values of ~49–50 kcal/mol. Both water-assisted mechanisms and nonspecific environmental effects have a minor impact on the Gibbs energy profiles. We find that the HMF → FF + CH 2 O fragmentation has a small Δ rxn G value and an accessible ΔG ‡ barrier. Our computational results, which are in consonance with the kinetic parameters derived from lumped models, the results of isotopic labeling experiments and the reported HMF/FF molecular ratios, could be useful for modeling studies including on nonequilibrium kinetic effects that may render more information about product yields and the relevance of the various pathways.},

  abstract     = {Sulfonyl fluorides hold significant importance as highly valued intermediates in chemical biology due to their optimal balance of biocompatibility with both aqueous stability and protein reactivity. The Cornella group introduced a one-pot strategy for synthesizing aryl sulfonyl fluorides via Bi(III) redox-neutral catalysis, which facilitates the transmetallation and direct insertion of SO 2 into the Bi  C(sp 2 ) bond giving the aryl sulfonyl fluorides. We report herein a comprehensive computational investigation of the redox-neutral Bi(III) catalytic mechanism, disclose the critical role of the Bi(III) catalyst and base (i.e., K 3 PO 4 ), and uncover the origin of SO 2 insertion into the Bi(III)  C(sp 2 ) bond. The entire catalysis can be characterized via three stages: (i) transmetallation generating the Bi(III)-phenyl intermediate IM3 facilitated by K 3 PO 4 . (ii) SO 2 insertion into IM3 leading to the formation of Bi(III)-OSOAr intermediate IM5 . (iii) IM5 undergoes S(IV)-oxidation yielding the aryl sulfonyl fluoride product 4 and liberating the Bi(III) catalyst for the next catalytic cycle. Each stage is kinetically and thermodynamically feasible. Moreover, we explored other some small molecules (NO 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O, N 2 O, etc.) insertion reactions mediated by the Bi(III)-complex, and found that NO 2 insertions could be easily achieved due to the low insertion barriers (i.e., 17.5 kcal/mol). Based on the detailed mechanistic study, we further rationally designed additional Bi(III) and Sb(III) catalysts, and found that some of which exhibit promising potential for experimental realization due to their low barriers (&lt;16.4 kcal/mol). In this regard, our study contributes significantly to enhancing current Bi(III)-catalytic systems and paving the way for novel Bi(III)-catalyzed aryl sulfonyl fluoride formation reactions.},

In this research, an efficient implementation of the equation-of-motion orbital-optimized coupled-cluster doubles method with the density-fitting (DF) approach, denoted by DF-EOM-OCCD, is presented. The computational cost of the DF-EOM-OCCD method for excitation energies is compared with that of the conventional EOM-OCCD method. Our results demonstrate that DF-EOM-OCCD excitation energies are dramatically accelerated compared to EOM-OCCD. There are almost 17-fold reductions for the C 5 ⁢ H 12 molecule in an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set with the RHF reference. This dramatic performance improvement comes from the reduced cost of integral transformation with the DF approach and the efficient evaluation of the particle-particle ladder (PPL) term, which is the most expensive term to evaluate. Further, our results show that the DF-EOM-OCCD approach is very helpful for the computation of excitation energies in open-shell molecular systems. Overall, we conclude that our new DF-EOM-OCCD implementation is very promising for the study of excited states in large-sized challenging chemical systems.},

Among the azaphilone pigments, mitorubrins are well recognized for their antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antidiabetic, and antiaging activities in addition to their well-known yellow-orange color. This makes these pigments interesting candidates for use in foods, as cosmetics, and as medicines. In particular, if it is desired to modify the properties of mitorubrin-based pigments, for example by derivatization, it is essential to have an understanding of the electronic spectra of the parent molecules. We have therefore undertaken a computational study of a series of mitorubrins, comparing our computed results with experimental UV/visible spectra. Both density-functional theory (DFT) and coupled-cluster (CC2) methods have been used, and in general, the results are in very good agreement with observation. In order to provide a simple and useful picture of the spectra we analyze the stronger transitions in terms of natural transition orbitals (NTOs).},

  abstract     = {Sampling reference data is crucial in machine learning potential (MLP) construction. Inadequate coverage of local configurations in reference data may lead to unphysical behaviors in MLP-based molecular dynamics (MLP-MD) simulations. To address this problem, this study proposes a new on-the-fly reference data sampling method called radial distribution function (RDF)-based data sampling for MLP construction. This method detects and extracts anomalous structures from the trajectories of MLP-MD simulations by focusing on the shapes of RDFs. The detected structures are added to the reference data to improve the accuracy of the MLP. This method allows us to realize a reasonable MLP construction for liquid water with minimal additional data. We prepare data from an H 2 O molecular cluster system and verify whether the constructed MLPs are practical for bulk water systems. MLP-MD simulations without RDF-based data sampling show unphysical behaviors, such as atomic collisions. In contrast, after applying this method, we obtain MLP-MD trajectories with features, such as RDF shapes and angle distributions, that are comparable to those of ab initio MD simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that the RDF-based data sampling approach is useful for constructing MLPs that are robust to extrapolations from molecular cluster systems to bulk systems without any specialized know-how.},

In this work, a time-independent coupled-channel implementation of the SQM approach is developed for atom-triatom systems in full dimensionality. As SQM treats the capture dynamics quantum mechanically, it is capable of handling quantum effects such as tunneling. A detailed study of the H/D + O 3 capture dynamics was performed by applying the newly developed SQM method on an accurate global potential energy surface. Agreement with previous ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) results on the same potential energy surface is excellent except for very low temperatures. The SQM results are also in reasonably good agreement with available experimental rate coefficients. The strong H/D kinetic isotope effect underscores the dominant role of quantum tunneling under an entrance channel barrier at low temperatures.},

With the accumulation of complex structures and binding affinity data, various machine-learning scoring functions, particularly those based on deep learning, have been developed for this task, exhibiting superiority over their traditional counterparts. A fusion model sequentially connecting a graph neural network (GNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict protein-ligand binding affinity is proposed in this work. In this model, the intermediate outputs of the GNN layers, as supplementary descriptors of atomic chemical environments at different levels, are concatenated with the input features of CNN. The model demonstrates a noticeable improvement in performance on CASF-2016 benchmark compared to its constituent CNN models. The generalization ability of the model is evaluated by setting a series of thresholds for ligand extended-connectivity fingerprint similarity or protein sequence similarity between the training and test sets. Masking experiment reveals that model can capture key interaction regions. Furthermore, the fusion model is applied to a virtual screening task for a novel target, PI5P4Kα. The fusion strategy significantly improves the ability of the constituent CNN model to identify active compounds.

We employed density functional theory, time-dependent DFT, DFT-MRCI and the ab initio wave function second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) methods to investigate theoretically these systems. The examined aromatic substituents have one, two, or three hetero- and non-hetero rings. We comprehensively investigated their optical, electronic, and charge transport properties to evaluate potential applications in organic electronic devices. We found that the donor substituents based on one, two, or three aromatic rings bonded to the DPP core can improve the efficiency of an organic solar cell by fine-tuning the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels to match acceptors in typical bulk heterojunctions acceptors. Several properties of interest for organic photovoltaic devices were computed. We show that the investigated molecules are promising for applications as donor materials when combined with typical acceptors in bulk heterojunctions because they have appreciable energy conversion efficiencies resulting from their low ionization potentials and high electron affinities. This scenario allows a more effective charge separation and reduces the recombination rates. A comprehensive charge transfer analysis shows that D–A (DDP)–D systems have significant intramolecular charge transfer, further confirming their promise as candidates for donor materials in solar cells. The significant photophysical properties of DPP derivatives, including the high fluorescence emission, also allow these materials to be used in organic light-emitting diodes.},

  abstract     = {Achieving chemical accuracy in describing reactions involving both main-group elements and transition metals poses a substantial challenge for density functional approximations (DFAs), primarily due to the significantly different behaviors for electrons moving in the s,p-orbitals or in the d,f-orbitals. MOR41, a representative dataset of transition metal chemistry, has highlighted the PWPB95-D3(BJ) functional, a B2PLYP-type doubly hybrid (bDH) approximation equipped with an empirical dispersion correction, as the leading functional thus far (Dohm et al., J Chem Theory Comput 2018;14: 2596–2608). However, this functional is not among the top bDH methods for main-group chemistry (Goerigk et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys. 2017;19: 32184). Conversely, bDH methods such as DSD-BLYP-D3, proficient in main-group chemistry, often falter for transition metal chemistry. Herein, taking advantage of the home-made Rust-based Electronic-Structure Toolkits, we examine a suite of XYG3-type doubly hybrid (xDH) methods. We confirm that the trade-off in descriptive accuracy between main-group and transition metal systems persists within the realm of perturbation theory (PT2)-based xDH methods. Notably, however, our study ushers in a pivotal advance with the recently proposed renormalized xDH method, R-xDH7-SCC15. This method not only distinguishes itself among the elite methods for main-group chemistry, but also achieves an unprecedented accuracy for the MOR41 dataset, outperforming all other reported DFAs. The efficacy of R-xDH7-SCC15 stems from the successful integration of a renormalized PT2 correlation model (rPT2) and a machine-learning strong-correlation correction (SCC15), marking a significant step forward in the realm of computational chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Closo -boron hydrides B n H n 2− ( n = 5–12) are a conceptually well understood class of compounds. For these and a few related prototype compounds, both the local and the global picture of 3-center bonding are extracted from position-space quantities based on the electron density and the pair density. For this purpose, three-center delocalization indices between quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) atoms in position space are used to develop a consistent set of local bond and triangle, and global cluster delocalization ratios (DRs), which are quantitatively compared with conceptual Γ values derived from the styx code for each cluster. Combination of the cluster DRs with associated effective numbers of skeletal electron sharing (SES) for selected cluster surface edges, triangles, or the whole cluster yields effective styx type values describing the trend and even the size of the conceptual styx codes for closo -boranes B n H n 2− and related systems with increasing cluster size n reasonably well. For nonuniform cluster topologies, the different vertex degrees are shown to cause systematic 3-center wise bond delocalization effects for the associated edges and triangles of different average vertex degrees. Extension of DR analysis beyond the styx type triangular cluster-surface bonding corresponds to a triangulation of multicentric bonding. The cluster-wise results keep indicating consistency with the mixed 2- and 3-center bonding approach. The successfully established chemical meaning of the local edge, triangle, and global cluster DR s and their associated SES values constitutes the basis for systematic investigations of mixed 2- and 3-center bonding scenarios in particular in intermetallic and related (endohedral) cluster compounds in the future.},

The method is based on the introduction of a fictitious ideal gas that exerts the required pressure on a molecular sample and is therefore called XP-GAS (eXtreme Pressure by Gas Atoms in a Sphere). The algorithm is most suitable for approximately spherical clusters of molecules described by quantum chemistry methods, Molecular Mechanics or mixed QM/MM approaches. We compare the results obtained by the algorithm here presented and by the XP-PCM approach, based on a continuum description of the environment. As a test case, we study the conformational dynamics of 1,3-butadiene either as an isolated molecule (“naked” butadiene) or embedded in a cluster of argon atoms, under pressures up to 15 GPa. Overall, our results show that the XP-GAS QM/MM simulation method is in good agreement with the XP-PCM QM/Continuum model (Cammi model) in describing the effect of the pressure on static properties as the equilibrium geometry of butadiene in the ground state. Furthermore, the comparison of XP-GAS simulations with naked butadiene and butadiene in argon shows the importance, for XP-GAS and related methods, of a realistic representation of the medium in modelling pressure effects.},

In previous modeling studies it has been suggested that the mechanism for nitrogen activation starts out by four pre-activation steps (A 0 –A 4 ) before catalysis. That suggestion led to excellent agreement with experimental Elecrtron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) observations in the step where N 2 becomes protonated (E 4 ). An important part of the pre-activation is that a sulfide is released. In the present paper, the details of the pre-activation are modeled, including the release of the sulfide. Several possible transition states for the release have been obtained. An A 4 (E 0 ) state is reached which is very similar to the E 4 state. For completeness, the steps going back from A 4 (E 0 ) to A 0 after catalysis are also modeled, including the insertion of a sulfide.},

  abstract     = {Schistosomiasis is a tropical disease that poses a significant risk to hundreds of millions of people, yet often goes unnoticed. While praziquantel, a widely used anti-schistosome drug, has a low cost and a high cure rate, it has several drawbacks. These include ineffectiveness against schistosome larvae, reduced efficacy in young children, and emerging drug resistance. Discovering new and active anti-schistosome small molecules is therefore critical, but this process presents the challenge of low accuracy in computer-aided methods. To address this issue, we proposed GNN-DDAS, a novel deep learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNN), designed for drug discovery to identify active anti-schistosome (DDAS) small molecules. Initially, a multi-layer perceptron was used to derive sequence features from various representations of small molecule SMILES. Next, GNN was employed to extract structural features from molecular graphs. Finally, the extracted sequence and structural features were then concatenated and fed into a fully connected network to predict active anti-schistosome small molecules. Experimental results showed that GNN-DDAS exhibited superior performance compared to the benchmark methods on both benchmark and real-world application datasets. Additionally, the use of GNNExplainer model allowed us to analyze the key substructure features of small molecules, providing insight into the effectiveness of GNN-DDAS. Overall, GNN-DDAS provided a promising solution for discovering new and active anti-schistosome small molecules.},

  abstract     = {We strongly advocate distinguishing cooperativity from cooperativity-induced effects. From the MOW e D-based approach, the origin of all-body cooperativity is synonymous with physics- and quantum-based processes of electron ( e ) delocalization throughout water clusters. To this effect, over 10 atom-pairs contribute to the total e -density at a BCP(H,O) between water molecules in a tetramer. Intermolecular all-body e -delocalization, that is, cooperativity, is an energy-minimizing process that fully explains non-additive increase in stability of a water molecule in clusters with an increase in their size. A non-linear change in cooperativity and cooperativity-induced effects, such as (i) structural (e.g., a change in d(O,O)) or topological intra- and intermolecular properties in water clusters (e.g., electron density or potential energy density at bond critical points) is theoretically reproduced by the proposed expression. It predicted the limiting value of delocalized electrons by a H 2 O molecule in homodromic cyclic clusters to be 1.58 e . O-atoms provide the vast majority of electrons that “travel throughout a cluster predominantly on a privileged exchange quantum density highway” (⋅⋅⋅O–H⋅⋅⋅O–H⋅⋅⋅O–H⋅⋅⋅) using Bader&#39;s classical bond paths as density bridges linking water molecules. There are, however, additional electron exchange channels that are not seen on molecular graphs as bond paths. A 3D visual representation of the “privileged” and “additional” exchange channels as well as detailed intra- and inter-molecular patterns of e -sharing and (de)localizing is presented. The energy stabilizing contribution made by three O-atoms of neighboring water molecules was found to be large (−597 kcal/mol in cyclic hexamer) and 5 times more significant than that of a classical O–H⋅⋅⋅O intermolecular H-bond.},

Although universal neural network potentials (UNNPs), representing pretrained machine learning interatomic potentials, are emerging, current UNNP models lack explicit treatment of Coulomb potentials, and methods for integrating additional charges on the electrode remain to be established. We propose a method to analyze liquid–electrode interfaces by integrating a UNNP, known as the preferred potential, with Coulomb potentials using the ONIOM method. This approach extends the applicability of UNNPs to electrode–liquid interface systems. Through molecular dynamics simulations of graphene–water and graphene oxide (GO)–water interfaces, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating long-range Coulomb potentials into the water potential to accurately describe water polarization at the interface. Furthermore, we observe that functional groups on the GO electrode influence both polarization and capacitance.},

Sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices guides the identification of the most influential parameters for a given reference dataset, allowing for a nuanced understanding of their impact on diverse molecular properties. In the case of the W4-11 dataset, substantial error reduction was achieved, demonstrating the potential of the optimization. Transferability of the optimized spin-polarization constants over different properties, however, is limited, as we demonstrate by applying the optimized parameters on a set of singlet-triplet gaps in carbenes. Further studies on ionization potentials and electron affinities highlight some inherent limitations of current extended tight-binding methods that can not be resolved by simple parameter optimization. We conclude that the significantly improved accuracy strongly encourages the present re-optimization of the spin-polarization constants, whereas the limited transferability motivates a property-specific optimization strategy.},

  abstract     = {Orphan nuclear estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target for cancer, inflammation and metabolic disorder. The ERRγ contains a regulatory AF2 helical tail linked C-terminally to its ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is a self-binding peptide (SBP) and serves as molecular switch to dynamically regulate the receptor alternation between active and inactive states by binding to and unbinding from the AF2-binding site on ERRγ LBD surface, respectively. Traditional ERRγ modulators are all small-molecule chemical ligands that can be classified into agonists and inverse agonists in terms of their action mechanism; the agonists stabilize the AF2 in ABS site with an agonist conformation, while the inverse agonists lock the AF2 out of the site to largely abolish ERRγ transcriptional activity. Here, a class of ERRγ peptidic antagonists was described to compete with native AF2 for the ABS site, thus blocking the active state of AF2 binding to ERRγ LBD domain. Self-inhibitory peptide was derived from the SBP-covering AF2 region and we expected it can rebind potently to the ABS site by reducing its intrinsic disorder and entropy cost upon the rebinding. Hydrocarbon stapling was employed to do so, which employed an all-hydrocarbon bridge across the [ i , i + 4]-anchor residue pair in the N-terminal, middle or C-terminal region of the self-inhibitory peptide. As might be expected, it is revealed that the stapled peptides are good binders of ERRγ LBD domain and can effectively compete with the native AF2 helical tail for ERRγ ABS site, which exhibit a basically similar binding mode with AF2 to the site and form diverse noncovalent interactions with the site, thus conferring stability and specificity to the domain–peptide complexes.},

Then, the PGA was applied to search for the global minimum structures of Mg n − ( n = 3–30) clusters, new structures have been found for sizes n = 6, 7, 12, 14, and medium-sized 21–30 were first determined. The high consistency between the simulated spectra and the experimental ones once again demonstrates the efficiency of the PGA program. Based on the ground-state structures of these ( n = 3–30) clusters, their structural evolution and electronic properties were subsequently explored. The performance on Au 20 , B 20 , and ( n = 3–30) clusters indicates the promising potential of the PGA program for exploring the global minima of other clusters.

  abstract     = {A system associated with several number of weak interactions supports numerous number of stable structures within a narrow range of energy. Often, a deterministic search method fails to locate the global minimum geometry as well as important local minimum isomers for such systems. Therefore, in this work, the stochastic search technique, namely parallel tempering, has been executed on the quantum chemical surface of the CNO (-) ⁢ (H 2 ⁢ O) n system for n = 1 –8 to generate global minimum as well as several number of local minimum isomers. IR spectrum can act as the fingerprint property for such system to be identified. Thus, IR spectroscopic features have also been included in this work. Vertical detachment energy has also been calculated to obtain clear information about number of water molecules in several spheres around the central anion. In addition, in a real experimental scenario, not only the global but also the local minimum isomers play an important role in determining the average value of a particular physically observable property. Therefore, the relative conformational populations have been determined for all the evaluated structures for the temperature range between 20K and 400K. Further to understand the phase change behavior, the configurational heat capacities have also been calculated for different sizes.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the effects of two TiO 2 polymorphs on the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (NH 4 ClO 4 ) were studied experimentally and theoretically. The interactions between AP and various surfaces of TiO 2 were modeled using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, the adsorption of AP on three rutile surfaces (1 1 0), (1 0 0), and (0 0 1), as well as two anatase surfaces (1 0 1), and (0 0 1) were modeled using cluster models, along with the decomposition of adsorbed AP into small molecules. The optimized complexes of the AP molecule on TiO 2 surfaces were very stable, indicating strong covalent and hydrogen bonding interactions, leading to highly energetic adsorption reactions. The calculated energy of adsorption (Δ E ads ) ranged from −120.23 to −301.98 kJ/mol, with highly exergonic calculated Gibbs free energy (Δ G ads ) of reaction, and highly exothermic enthalpy of reaction (Δ H ads ). The decomposition of adsorbed AP was also found to have very negative Δ E dec values between −199.08 and −380.73 kJ/mol. The values of Δ G dec and Δ H dec reveal exergonic and exothermic reactions. The adsorption of AP on TiO 2 surfaces anticipates the heat release of decomposition, in agreement with experimental results. The most common anatase surface, (1 0 1), was predicted to be more reactive for AP decomposition than the most stable rutile surface, (1 1 0), which was confirmed by experiments. DFT calculations show the mechanism for activation of the two TiO 2 polymorphs is entropy driven.},

In addition to the optically bright singlets (S 1 and S 2 ) and singly excited triplets (T 1 and T 2 ), the full spin manifold of multiexcitonic triplet-pair states ( 1 ME, 3 ME, 5 ME) has been considered. In the ortho - and para -regioisomers, the 1 ME and S 1 potentials intersect upon geometry relaxation of the S 1 excitation. In the meta -regioisomer, the crossing occurs upon delocalization of the optically bright excitation. The energetic accessibility of these conical intersections and the absence of low-lying charge-transfer states suggests a direct SF mechanism, assisted by charge-resonance effects in the ME state. While the ME state does not appear to play a role in the SF mechanism of the ortho - and para -regioisomers, its participation in the disentanglement of the triplet pair is conceivable in the meta -regioisomer.},

Gerasimova, S. Grimme, J. Phys. Chem. B 2020, 124 , 6664) is applied to ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (EmimBr), its C2-deuterated analog [Emim-d]Br and its aqueous solutions. It is shown that the solvation strongly modifies frequencies and IR intensities of the CH/CD stretching vibrations (νCH/νCD) of the imidazolium ring. The main vibrational spectroscopic features of the neat IL are reproduced by the simulations for a cluster (EmimBr) 9 , in which all three imidazolium CH moieties of the solvated cation form short contacts with three Br − anions, and another two Br − anions are located on top and bottom of imidazolium ring. Cluster models of aqueous solutions reproduce the experimental vibrational frequencies of actual solutions, provided that the Br − anion of solvated contact ion pair (CIP) is situated on top of imidazolium ring, and CH/CD moieties of the latter participate in short contacts with surrounding water molecules. Both structural and spectroscopic analysis allow to interpret the short contacts CH/CD⋯Br − and CH/CD⋯OH 2 as hydrogen bonds of approximately equal strength. Enthalpies of bonding of these liquid-state H-bonds, estimated with the use of empirical correlations, amount to ca. 1.4 kcal⋅mol −1 , while the analogous estimates obtained for the gas-phase charged species [Emim] 2 Br + increase to 5.6 kcal⋅mol −1 . It is shown that formation of solvent-shared ion pair (SIP) in aqueous solution, where the counterions of IL are separated by two water molecules H-bonded to a Br − anion, produces frequency shifts ΔνCH/CD, strongly different from the case of CIP formation. This difference can be used for IR/Raman spectroscopic differentiation of the type of solvated ion pairs of EmimBr or other related ILs.},

The dataset contains 1,400,000 snapshots, which are extracted from an enhanced sampling simulation and distribute widely in the conformational space. Various testing results present that our program is quite efficient. Particularly, with two NVIDIA RTX4090 GPUs and single precision data type, the clustering calculation on 1 million snapshots is completed in a few seconds (including the uploading time of data from memory to GPU and neglecting the reading time from hard disk).

  abstract     = {The development of novel methods in solid-state quantum chemistry necessitates reliable reference data sets for their assessment. The most fundamental solid-state property of interest is the crystal structure, quantified by the lattice parameters. In the last decade, several studies were conducted to assess theoretical approaches based on the agreement of calculated lattice parameters with respect to experiment as a measure. However, most of these studies used a limited number of reference systems with high symmetry. The present work offers a more comprehensive reference benchmark denoted as Sol337LC, which consists of 337 inorganic compounds with 553 symmetry-inequivalent lattice parameters, representing every element of the periodic table for atomic numbers between 1 and 86, except noble gases, the radioactive elements and lanthanoids. The reference values were taken from earlier benchmarks and from measurements at very low temperature or extrapolation to 0 K. The experimental low-temperature lattice parameters were then corrected for zero-point energy effects via the quasi-harmonic approximation for direct comparison with quantum-chemical optimized structures. A selection of standard density functional approximations was assessed for their deviations from the experimental reference data. The calculations were performed with the crystal orbital program CRYSTAL23, applying optimized atom-centered basis sets of triple-zeta plus polarization quality. The SCAN functional family and the global hybrid functional PW1PW, augmented with the D3 dispersion correction, were found to provide closest agreement with the Sol337LC reference data.},

However, MA 2 Z 4 family monolayer materials involve primarily transition metal substitutions for M atoms. In order to address the research gap on lanthanide and actinide MA 2 Z 4 materials, this work conducts electronic structure calculations on novel 2D MSi 2 N 4 (M = La, Eu) monolayer materials by employing first-principles methods and CASTEP. High carrier mobility is discovered in the indirect bandgap semiconductor 2D LaSi 2 N 4 monolayer (~5400 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and in the spin (spin-down channel) carrier mobility of the half-metallic ferromagnetic EuSi 2 N 4 monolayer (~2800 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). EuSi 2 N 4 monolayer supplements research on spin carrier mobility in half-metallic ferromagnetic monolayer materials at room temperature and possesses a magnetic moment of 5 μ B , which should not be underestimated. Furthermore, due to the unique electronic band structure of EuSi 2 N 4 monolayer (with the spin-up channel exhibiting metallic properties and the spin-down channel exhibiting semiconductor properties), it demonstrates a 100% spin polarization rate, presenting significant potential applications in fields such as magnetic storage, magnetic sensing, and spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Development of organic nonlinear optical materials has become progressively more important due to their emerging applications in new-generation photonic devices. A novel series of chromophores based on innovative thiophene and furan-fused cyclopentadienyl bridge with various powerful donor and acceptor moieties were designed and theoretically investigated for applications in nonlinear optics. To unravel the structure–property relationship between this new push-pull conjugated systems and their nonlinear optical property, multiple methods, including density of states analysis, coupled perturbed Kohn–Sham (CPKS) method, sum-over-states (SOS) model, the two-level model (TSM), hyperpolarizability density analysis, and the (hyper)polarizability contribution decomposition, were performed to comprehensively investigated the nonlinear optical and electronic properties of this new π-system. Due to excellent charge transfer ability of new bridge and distinctive structure of donor and acceptor, the designed chromophores exhibit deep HOMO levels, low excitation energy, high dipole moment difference and large hyperpolarizability, indicating the appealing air-stable property and remarkable electrooptic performance of them. Importantly, THQ-CS-A3 and PA-CS-A3 shows outstanding NLO response properties with β tot value of 6953.9 × 10 −30 and 5066.0 × 10 −30 esu in AN, respectively. The influence of the push-pull strength, the heterocycle and the π-conjugation of new bridge on the nonlinear optical properties of this novel powerful systems are clarified. This new series of chromophores exhibit remarkable electro-optical Pockels and optical rectification effect. More interestingly, PA-CS-A3 and THQ-CS-A2 also show appealing SHG effect. This study will help people understand the nature of nonlinear optical properties of innovative heteroarene-fused based cyclopentadienyl chromophores and offer guidance for the rational design of chromophores with outstanding electrooptic (EO) performance in the future.},

  abstract     = {Chlorine is an important chemical which has long been produced in chlor-alkali process using dimensionally stable anodes (DSA). However, some serious drawbacks of DSA inspire the development of alternative anodes for chlorine evolution reaction (CER). In this study, we focused on the graphene- and carbon nanotube-supported platinum tetra-phenyl porphyrins as electrocatalysts for CER, which have been theoretically investigated based on density functional theory. Our results reveal that the supported substrates possess potential CER electrocatalytic activity with very low thermodynamic overpotentials (0.012–0.028 V) via Cl* pathway instead of ClO*. The electronic structures analyses showed that electron transfer from the support to the adsorbed chlorine via the Pt center leads to strong Pt–Cl interactions. Furthermore, the supported electrocatalysts exhibited excellent selectivity toward CER because of high overpotentials and reaction barriers of oxygen evolution process. Therefore, our results may pave the way for designing CER electrocatalyst utilizing emerging carbon nanomaterials.},

Imaginary components of impurity Green&#39;s functions show that 5 f j =5/2 and 5 f j =7/2 manifolds are in conducting and insulating regimes, respectively. Quasi-particle weights and their ratio suggest that the intermediate coupling mechanism is applicable for Pu 5 f electrons, and PuB 6 might be in the orbital-selective localized state. The weighted summation of occupation probabilities yields the interconfiguration fluctuation and average occupation number of 5 f electrons n 5 f ~ 5.101. The interplay of 5 f –5 f correlation, spin-orbit coupling, Hund&#39;s exchange interaction, many-body transition of 5 f configurations, and final state effects might be responsible for the quasiparticle multiplets in electronic spectrum functions. Prominent characters in the density of state, such as the coexistence of atomic multiplet peaks in the vicinity of the Fermi level and broad Hubbard bands in the high-lying regime, suggest that PuB 6 could be identified as a Racah material. Finally, the quasiparticle band structure is also presented.},

The output of the current computations is compared to the results that are currently available, and a respectable agreement is noted. The studied compounds were cubic in nature and structurally stabe. The mechanical properties reflect the mechanical stability and ductility of the proposed materials. The Sn-based single perovskite compounds proposed in this study are mechanically stable and ductile.

These five quantities are Cartesian tensors and they are responsible for the chiral signal in the chiroptical version of the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) spectroscopy, namely the HRS optical activity (HRS-OA) spectroscopy. For the first time, for each hyperpolarizability, alongside with the three-dimensional representation of the whole (i.e., reducible) Cartesian tensors, the mUSRs are developed for each of the irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) that constitute them. This scheme has been applied to a series of three (chiral) hexahelicene molecules containing different degrees of electron-withdrawing (quinone) groups and characterized by the same (positive) handedness. For these molecules, the mUSR shows that, upon substitution, the most remarkable qualitative and semi-quantitative (enhancement of the molecular responses) effects are obtained for the pure electric-dipole and for the mixed electric-dipole/magnetic-dipole hyperpolarizabilities.},

In this work, we present an alternative minimized error matrix to the commutator in the CDIIS, namely the residual or the gradient of the energy-functional for a Slater determinant subject to the orthonormality constraints among orbitals, representing the search for a newly improved Fock matrix in the direction of the residual in the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (RDIIS). Implemented in the computational chemistry package GAMESS, the RDIIS is compared with the standard CDIIS and the second order SCF orbital optimization (SOSCF) for tested molecules started with a crude guess. As a result, the RDIIS stably and efficiently performs the SCF convergence acceleration. Furthermore, the RDIIS is considerably independent on the subspace size with the concentrated linear coefficients accounting proportionally for the Fock matrices close to the current iteration.},

For the former, the structural and spectroscopic characterization employed composite schemes based on coupled cluster (CC) calculations that account for the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and core correlation effects. A first important outcome is the definitive confirmation of the nonplanarity of carbamic acid, then followed by an accurate estimate of its rotational and vibrational spectroscopy parameters. As far as the carbamic acid dimer is concerned, the investigation started from the identification of its most stable forms. For them, structure and vibrational properties have been evaluated using density functional theory, while a composite scheme rooted in CC theory has been employed for the energetic characterization.

These range from cocrystals containing model compounds 4,4′-bipyridine and oxalic acid to those with the well benchmarked APIs of aspirin and paracetamol, all tested with a large set of alternative coformers. For simple cocrystals, there is a general consensus in lattice enthalpy calculated by the different DFT models. For the cocrystals with API coformers the cocrystals, enthalpy predictions depend strongly on the DFT model. The significantly lighter DFTB models predict unrealistic values of lattice enthalpy even for simple cocrystals.},

  abstract     = {Intermolecular interactions with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent an important area of physisorption studies. These investigations are often hampered by a size of interacting PAHs, which makes the calculation prohibitively expensive. Therefore, methods designed to deal with large molecules could be helpful to reduce the computational costs of such studies. Recently we have introduced a new systematic approach for the molecular fragmentation of PAHs, denoted as AROFRAG, which decomposes a large PAH molecule into a set of predefined small PAHs with a benzene ring being the smallest unbreakable unit, and which in conjunction with the Molecules-in-Molecules (MIM) approach provides an accurate description of total molecular energies. In this contribution we propose an extension of the AROFRAG, which provides a description of intermolecular interactions for complexes composed of PAH molecules. The examination of interaction energy partitioning for various test cases shows that the AROFRAG3 model connected with the MIM approach accurately reproduces all important components of the interaction energy. An additional important finding in our study is that the computationally expensive long-range electron-correlation part of the interaction energy, that is, the dispersion component, is well described at lower AROFRAG levels even without MIM, which makes the latter models interesting alternatives to existing methods for an accurate description of the electron-correlated part of the interaction energy.},

Nine conformers of emodepside and their complexes with K + ion were characterized as stationary points on the potential energy surface. The conformational isomers were examined for their 3D structures, bonding, energetics, and interactions with the cation. A cavitand-like structure ( CC ) is identified to be the energetically most stable arrangement. To arrive at a better understanding of the K + ion binding, calculations were initially performed on complexes formed by the K + and Na + ions with model ligands (methyl ester and N,N-dimethyl acetamide). Both the natural bond orbital (NBO) method and the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) energy decomposition approach was employed to assess the bonding and energetic contributions stabilizing the ion-bound model complexes. Finally, the solvent effect was evaluated through complete geometry optimizations and energy minimizations for the model ion-ligand complexes and the emodepside-K + bound complexes using an implicit solvent model mimicking water and DMSO.},

  abstract     = {This study delves into the nature of individual hydrogen bonds and the relationship between metal cations and hydrogen bonding in the Watson–Crick guanine–cytosine (GC) base pair and its alkali and alkaline earth cation-containing complexes (M n+ –GC). The findings reveal how metal cations affect the nature and strength of individual hydrogen bonds. The study employs interacting quantum atoms (IQA) analysis to comprehensively understand three individual hydrogen bonds within the GC base pair and its cationic derivatives. These analyses unveil the nature and strength of hydrogen bonds and serve as a valuable reference for exploring the impact of cations (and other factors) on each hydrogen bond. All the H D interactions (H is hydrogen and D is oxygen or nitrogen) in the GC base pair are primarily electrostatic in nature, with the charge transfer component playing a substantial role. Introducing a metal cation perturbs all H D interatomic interactions in the system, weakening the nearest hydrogen bond to the cation (indicated by a ) and reinforcing the other ( b and c ) interactions. Notably, the interaction a , the strongest H D interaction in the GC base pair, becomes the weakest in the M n + –GC complexes. A broader perspective on the stability of GC and M n + –GC complexes is provided through interacting quantum fragments (IQF) analysis. This approach considers all pairwise interactions between fragments and intra-fragment components, offering a complete view of the factors that stabilize and destabilize GC and M n + –GC complexes. The IQF analysis underscores the importance of electron sharing, with the dominant contribution arising from the inter-fragment exchange-correlation term, in shaping and sustaining GC and M n + –GC complexes. From this point of view, alkaline and alkaline earth cations have distinct effects, with alkaline cations generally weakening inter-fragment interactions and alkaline earth cations strengthening them. In addition, IQA and IQF calculations demonstrate that the hydration of cations led to small changes in the hydrogen bonding network. Finally, the IQA interatomic energies associated with the hydrogen bonds and also inter-fragment interaction energies provide robust indicators for characterizing hydrogen bonds and complex stability, showing a strong correlation with total interaction energies.},

However, their accurate prediction by theoretical computations, which is a complementary task and sometimes the only alternative to experimental measurement, may be often resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses this challenge through the application of machine learning techniques, with a particular focus on graph-based methods (such as graph edit distances, graph kernels, and graph neural networks) that are reviewed to enlighten their deep links with theoretical chemistry. To this aim, we establish the ORedOx159 database, a comprehensive, homogeneous (with reference values stemming from density functional theory calculations), and reliable resource containing 318 one-electron reduction and oxidation reactions and featuring 159 large organic compounds. Subsequently, we provide an instructive overview of the good practice in machine learning and of commonly utilized machine learning models. We then assess their predictive performances on the ORedOx159 dataset through extensive analyses. Our simulations using descriptors that are computed in an almost instantaneous way result in a notable improvement in prediction accuracy, with mean absolute error (MAE) values equal to 5.6 kcal mol for reduction and 7.2 kcal mol for oxidation potentials, which paves a way toward efficient in silico design of new electrochemical systems.},

The ab initio modeling is very helpful to assign the frequencies to vibrational modes but it is a challenge to process the huge quantity of data into descriptors useful for experimentalists. To this end, we developed a new tool called VIBMOL allowing to analyze vibrational modes of molecules from hessian matrices calculated with common quantum chemistry codes. VIBMOL program runs on Unix machines. Through a new graphical interface, the users can calculate the normal modes of molecules, visualize them, simulate infrared spectra, and explore the Potential Energy Distribution of normal modes among any set of vibration coordinates. It is combined with an interface program (gosdmu) formatting relevant data from the GAUSSIAN program. VIBMOL code is available upon request to the authors. A discussion is provided to help the readers to choose between a large choice of different software and it shows how VIBMOL can make the IR assignment easier in the context of collaborations with experimentalists.},

For a wavepacket propagating in an anharmonic potential and for a tunneling system, we show that the FNO approach can accurately and faithfully model wavepacket propagation via the density. Additionally, we demonstrate that FNOs can be a suitable replacement for traditional TDSE solvers in cases where the results of the quantum dynamical simulation are required repeatedly such as in the case of parameter optimization problems (e.g., control). The speed-up from the FNO method allows for its combination with the Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach in applications that involve solving inverse problems such as optimal and coherent laser control of the outcome of dynamical processes.},

  abstract     = {Acetonitrile, a polar molecule that cannot form hydrogen bonds on its own, interacts with solvent molecules mainly through the lone pair of its nitrogen atom and the π electrons of its CN triple bond [Correction added on 17 July 2024, after first online publication: Acetole has been changed to Acetonitrile in the preceeding sentence.]. Interestingly, acetonitrile exhibits an unexpected strengthening of the triple bond&#39;s force constant in an aqueous environment, leading to an upshift ( blueshift ) in the corresponding stretching vibration: this effect contrasts with the usual consequence of hydrogen bonding on the vibrational frequencies of the acceptor groups, that is, frequency redshift . This investigation elucidates this phenomenon using Raman spectroscopy to examine the behavior of acetonitrile in organic solvent, water, and silver ion aqueous solutions, where an even more pronounced upshift is observed. Raman spectroscopy is particularly well suited for analyzing aqueous solutions due to the minimal scattering effect of water molecules across most of the vibrational spectrum. Computational approaches, both static and dynamical, based on Density Functional Theory and hybrid functionals, are employed here to interpret these findings, and accurately reproduce the vibrational frequencies of acetonitrile in different environments. Our calculations also allow an explanation for this unique behavior in terms of electric charge displacements. On the other hand, the study of the interaction of acetonitrile with water molecules and metal ions is relevant for the use of this molecule as a solvent in both chemical and pharmaceutical applications.},

Yet, there is water ice in the ISM, either as grain or as mantle around grains. Therefore, the addition of atomic hydrogen on double-bonded carbon in a series of seven molecules have been studied and it was found that water catalyzes this reaction. The origin of the catalysis is a weak charge transfer between the π MO of the unsaturated molecule and H atom, allowing a stabilizing interaction with H 2 O. This mechanism is rationalized using the non-covalent interaction and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules approaches.},

In this work, we reported the structures, electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnGe n with sizes n = 3–20. Transition metals (TMs) of Cr and Mn tend to stay together and be surrounded by Ge atoms. Small sized clusters with n ≤ 8 prefer to adopt bipyramid-based structures as the motifs with the excess Ge atoms absorbed on the surface. Starting from n = 9, the structure with one TM atom interior appears and persists until n = 16, and for larger sizes n = 17–20, the two TM atoms are full-encapsulated by Ge atoms to form endohedral structures. The Hirshfeld population analyses show that Cr atom always acts as the electron donor, while Mn atom is always the acceptor except for sizes 3 and 6. The average binding energies of these clusters increase with cluster size n , sharing a very similar trend as that of CrMnSi n ( n = 4–20) clusters, which indicates that it is favorable to form large-sized clusters. CrMnGe n ( n = 6, 13, 16, 19, and 20) clusters prefer to exhibit ferromagnetic Cr–Mn coupling, while the remaining clusters are ferrimagnetic.},

  abstract     = {Here, TS-tools is presented, a Python package facilitating the automated localization of transition states (TS) based on a textual reaction SMILES input. TS searches can either be performed at xTB or DFT level of theory, with the former yielding guesses at marginal computational cost, and the latter directly yielding accurate structures at greater expense. On a benchmarking dataset of mono- and bimolecular reactions, TS-tools reaches an excellent success rate of 95% already at xTB level of theory. For tri- and multimolecular reaction pathways - which are typically not benchmarked when developing new automated TS search approaches, yet are relevant for various types of reactivity, cf. solvent- and autocatalysis and enzymatic reactivity - TS-tools retains its ability to identify TS geometries, though a DFT treatment becomes essential in many cases. Throughout the presented applications, a particular emphasis is placed on solvation-induced mechanistic changes, another issue that received limited attention in the automated TS search literature so far.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we present a density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT-D) calculations that focus on the intercalation of ionic liquids (ILs) electrolytes into the two-dimensional (2D) Ti 3 C 2 T x MXenes. These ILs include the cation 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (Emim + ), accompanied by three distinct anions: bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSA − ), (fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSA − ) and fluorosulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (FTFSA − ). By altering the surface termination elements, we explore the intricate geometries of IL intercalation in neutral, negative, and positive pore systems. Accurate estimation of charge transfer is achieved through five population analysis models, such as Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I, DDEC6 (density derived electrostatic and chemical), Bader, and VDD (voronoi deformation density) charges. In this work, we recommend the DDEC6 and Hirshfeld-I charge models, as they offer moderate values and exhibit reasonable trends. The investigation, aimed at visualizing non-covalent interactions, elucidates the role of cation-MXene and anion-MXene interactions in governing the intercalation phenomenon of ionic liquids within MXenes. The magnitude of this role depends on two factors: the specific arrangement of the cation, and the nature of the anionic species involved in the process.},

The selection of an appropriate functional among the plethora of developed ones is the first challenge on the way to reliable energy barrier calculations. To provide guidelines for the choice of an initial and reliable computational level, the performances of commonly used non-empirical (PBE, PBE0, PBE0-DH) and empirical density functionals (BLYP, B3LYP, B2PLYP) were evaluated relative to experimental activation enthalpies. Most reactivity databases to assess density functional performances are primarily based on high level calculations, here a set of experimental activation enthalpies of organic and organometallic reactions performed in solution were selected from the literature. As a general trend, the non-empirical functionals outperform the empirical ones. The most accurate energy barriers are obtained with hybrid PBE0 and double-hybrid PBE0-DH density functionals, both providing similar performance. Regardless of the functional under consideration, the addition of the GD3-BJ empirical dispersion correction does not enhance the accuracy of computed energy barriers.},

The results show that these partial σ C  C bonds have Wiberg bond orders of 0.38 to 0.48 and bond lengths ranging from 2.62 Å to 5.93 Å. Cage size influences the characteristics of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), with electrons favoring more antibonding orbitals in smaller cages where electrons reside more on the exterior of the cage and favoring bonding orbitals in larger ones where electrons are more in the interior. Fluorination enhances electron density on bonding orbitals. The analysis further clarified that the differentiation between antibonding and bonding features of HOMOs and LUMOs extends beyond merely electron transfer from s - to p -atomic orbitals, also noting possible interactions of the same symmetry repel. The study also introduces hyperconjugation from α-position C  H bonds as a factor in stabilizing partial σ-bond formation. The results also caution against the use of broken symmetry methodology in unrestricted SCF wavefunctions for biradicals, such as those in this study as it may cause large spin contamination and thus errors in the calculated electronic properties results.},

The methodology uses results from quantum mechanics based methods to automatically set up the chemical reaction network, and to build speciation models. As a result, it becomes possible to predict speciation and phase diagrams, as well as to derive new insights into the formation mechanisms of large molecular clusters. In this work we present the main features of the first open-source version of the software. Since the first report [Chem. Sci. 2020, 11, 8448-8456], POMSimulator has undergone several improvements to keep up with the growing challenges that were tackled.

In this work, we computationally investigate the impact of near-environment models consisting of aggregated water as well as betaine molecules on the vibrational profile of fluorescence spectra of different oxazine derivatives. For aggregated betaine and a water molecule located above the plane of the dyes, we observe a distinct modification of the vibrational profile, which is more pronounced than the effect of a continuum description of a solvent environment. Our analysis shows that this effect cannot be explained by a pure change in the electronic structure, but that also vibrational degrees of freedom of the environment can be decisive for the vibrational profile and should, hence, not generally be neglected.},

A molecular level rationalization of the Hofmeister series is still missing, and therefore the denaturant activity of thiocyanate also awaits a robust explanation. In the last years, different types of experimental studies have shown that thiocyanate is capable to directly interact with both polar and nonpolar groups of polypeptide chains. This finding has been scrutinized via a careful computational procedure based on density functional theory approaches. The results indicate that thiocyanate is able to make H-bonds via both the nitrogen and sulfur atom, and to make strong van der Waals interactions with almost all the groups of polypeptide chains, regardless of their polarity.},

At the opposite, the more stable CeO 2 (111) and (110) terminations weakly bind the platinum atom and can promote the growth of metallic clusters thanks to fast diffusion kinetics. The adsorption of carbon monoxide on the single platinum atom supported on the various ceria terminations is also sensitive to the surface structure. Carbon monoxide weakly binds to the single platinum atom supported on reduced CeO 2 (111) and (211) terminations. The desorption of the CO 2 formed during the WGS reaction is thus facilitated on the latter terminations.

Formulas of response theory can be well expressed in terms of the symbolic classes in the library Tinned. Their high-order perturbation-strength derivatives can be straightforwardly computed and extracted afterwards for numerical evaluation. The library Tinned will greatly facilitate the development work of response theory and may lead to a unified framework for response theory at different levels of electronic structure theory.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical modeling of the solid-state photocatalysis is one of the important issues as various useful photocatalysts have been developed to date. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of the alcohol photooxidation on niobium oxide (Nb 2 O 5 ) which was experimentally developed, using the density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent (TD)DFT calculations based on the cluster model. The alcohol adsorption and the first hydrogen transfer from hydroxy group to surface occur in the ground state, while the second hydrogen transfer from CH proceeds in the excited states during the photoirradiation of UV or visible light. The spin crossing was identified and the low-lying triplet states were solved for the reaction pathway. The photoabsorption in the visible light region was characterized as the charge transfer transition from O 2p of alcohol to Nb 4d of the Nb 2 O 5 surface. The spin density and the natural population analysis indicated the generation of spin density in the moiety of carbonyl compound and its dissipation to the interface of the surface, which partly explains the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement. It was confirmed that the rate determining step is the desorption of carbonyl compound and water molecule in agreement with the experimental rate equation analysis. The present findings with the theoretical modeling will provide useful information for the further studies of the solid-state photocatalysis.},

Modulating the bandgap thus is critical in developing novel materials particularly semiconductors with improved features. This study examines the bandgap, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level trends in a metal organic framework, metal–organic framework 5 (MOF-5), as a function of Hammett substituent effect (with the constant σ m in the meta-position of the benzene ring) and solvent dielectric effect (with the constant ε ). Specifically, experimental design and response surface methodologies helped to assess the significance of trends and correlations between these molecular properties with σ m and ε . While the HOMO and LUMO decrease with increasing σ m , the LUMO exhibits greater sensitivity to the substituent&#39;s electron withdrawing capability. The relative difference in these trends helps to explain why the bandgap tends to decrease with increasing σ m .},

To this end, here we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to the conformations obtained by semiempirical quantum mechanical molecular dynamics calculations to reveal the reaction mechanism and the role of CD in controlling regioselectivity. The results show that metal salt increases the yield but do not affect the regioselectivity, which we further confirmed by an experiment. In contrast, multiple CD-substrate complex conformations and reaction pathways were obtained, and CD was shown to contribute to improving the regioselectivity by stabilizing the intermediate state via encapsulation. The present study indicates that CDs can increase the regioselectivity by stabilizing the intermediate and product states while only marginally affecting the transition state.},

The present computational investigations primarily focus on understanding the role of copper (I) and N 1 ,N 1 ,N 2 ,N 2 -tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine (TMEDA) in this reaction, TMEDA often being considered a proton scavenger by experimentalists. Considering TMEDA as a ligand significantly alters the energy barrier. In fact, it is only 8.3 kcal/mol higher compared to the ligand-free (LF) route for the removal of a chlorine atom to form the radical · CCl 3 but the following steps are almost barrierless. This intermediate then participates in attacking the electrophilic carbon in the hydrazone. Crucially, the study reveals that the overall potential energy surface is thermodynamically favorable, and the theoretical turnover frequency (TOF) value is higher in the case of Cu(I)-TMEDA complex catalyzed pathway.},

A key aspect of our investigation is the examination of the one-particle potential, kept constant in our previous work, and the effects of its optimization on the adiabatic connection. Our methodology involves the use of a parameter-dependent potential dependent on a single parameter to facilitate practical computations. We analyze the energy errors and densities in a two-electron system (harmonium) under various conditions, employing different confinement potentials and interaction parameters. The study reveals that while the mean-field potential improves the expectation value of the physical Hamiltonian, it does not necessarily improve the energy of the system within the bounds of chemical accuracy. We also delve into the impact of density variations in adiabatic connections, challenging the common assumption that a mean field improves results. Our findings indicate that as long as energy errors remain within chemical accuracy, the mean field does not significantly outperform a bare potential. This observation is attributed to the effectiveness of corrections based on the short-range behavior of the wave function, a universal characteristic that diminishes the distinction between using a mean field or not.},

  abstract     = {We show herein that 1,10-dicyano substitution restricts the paragon fluxionality of bullvalene to just 14 isomers which isomerize along a single cycle. The restricted fluxionality of 1,10-dicyanobullvalene (DCB) is investigated by means of: (i) Bonding analyses of the isomer structures using the adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP). (ii) Quantum dynamical simulations of the isomerizations along the cyclic intrinsic reaction coordinate of the potential energy surface (PES). The PES possesses 14 equivalent potential wells supporting 14 isomers which are separated by 14 equivalent potential barriers supporting 14 transition states. Accordingly, at low temperatures, DCB appears as a hindered molecular rotor, without any delocalization of the wavefunction in the 14 potential wells, without any nuclear spin isomers, and with completely negligible tunneling. These results are compared and found to differ from those for molecular boron rotors. (iii) Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations of thermally activated isomerizations. (iv) Calculations of the rate constants in the frame of transition state theory (TST) with reasonable agreement achieved with the BOMD results. (v) Simulations of the equilibration dynamics using rate equations for the isomerizations with TST rate coefficients. Accordingly, in the long-time limit, isomerizations of the 14 isomers, each with C s symmetry, approach the “14 C s → C 7 v ” thermally averaged structure. This is a superposition of the 14 equally populated isomer structures with an overall C 7 v symmetry. By extrapolation, the results for DCB yield working hypotheses for so far un-explored properties e.g. for the equilibration dynamics of C 10 H 10 .},

The absorption spectra, together with the non-radiative rate constants for the S1 – Tn intersystem crossing transitions, have been computed for this purpose. Calculations evidence that the structural modification on the chromophore destabilizes the HOMO of the complexes thus reducing the H-L gap and, consequently, red shifting the maximum absorption wavelength within the therapeutic window, up to 620 nm. Moreover, the favored ISC process from the bright state involves the triplet state closest in energy, which is also characterized by the highest SOC value and by the involvement of the whole bpy ligand bearing the chromophore in delocalising the unpaired electrons.

For instance, different ligands can bind to different metastable states of a protein, and if these protein conformational changes are not sampled in relative binding free energy calculations, the contribution of these states to binding is not accounted for and thus calculated binding free energies are inaccurate. In this work, we investigate the impact of different beta-sectretase 1 (BACE1) protein conformations obtained from x-ray crystallography on the binding of BACE1 inhibitors. We highlight how these conformational changes are not adequately sampled in typical molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we show that insufficient sampling of relevant conformations induces substantial error in relative binding free energy calculations, as judged by a variation in calculated relative binding free energies up to 2 kcal/mol depending on the starting protein conformation. These results emphasize the importance of protein conformational sampling and pose this BACE1 system as a challenge case for further method development in the area of enhanced protein conformational sampling, either in combination with binding calculations or as an endpoint correction.},

Consequently, machine learning has undergone significant evolution to address the challenges of cancer drug discovery related to EGFR family proteins. However, the application of deep learning in this area is hindered by inherent difficulties associated with small-scale data, particularly the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the design of a model architecture that facilitates learning through multi-task and transfer learning, coupled with appropriate molecular representation, poses substantial challenges. In this study, we introduce GraphEGFR, a deep learning regression model designed to enhance molecular representation and model architecture for predicting the bioactivity of inhibitors against both wild-type and mutant EGFR family proteins. GraphEGFR integrates a graph attention mechanism for molecular graphs with deep and convolutional neural networks for molecular fingerprints. We observed that GraphEGFR models employing multi-task and transfer learning strategies generally achieve predictive performance comparable to existing competitive methods. The integration of molecular graphs and fingerprints adeptly captures relationships between atoms and enables both global and local pattern recognition. We further validated potential multi-targeted inhibitors for wild-type and mutant HER1 kinases, exploring key amino acid residues through molecular dynamics simulations to understand molecular interactions. This predictive model offers a robust strategy that could significantly contribute to overcoming the challenges of developing deep learning models for drug discovery with limited data and exploring new frontiers in multi-targeted kinase drug discovery for EGFR family proteins.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers are expected to outperform classical computers for specific problems in quantum chemistry. Such calculations remain expensive, but costs can be lowered through the partition of the molecular system. In the present study, partition was achieved with range-separated density functional theory (RS-DFT). The use of RS-DFT reduces both the basis set size and the active space size dependence of the ground state energy in comparison with the use of wave function theory (WFT) alone. The utilization of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) in place of canonical molecular orbitals (MOs) results in more compact qubit Hamiltonians. To test this strategy, a basis-set independent framework, known as multiresolution analysis (MRA), was employed to generate PNOs. Tests were conducted with the variational quantum eigensolver for a number of molecules. The results show that the proposed approach reduces the number of qubits needed to reach a target energy accuracy.},

Within this approach the many-electron states of the system, computed at the SOS-ADC(2) level, are followed along the individual normal modes of the encapsulated molecules. The inspection of the changes in the partial charge distribution of the many-electron states allows the quantification of the electron transport and the estimation of transmission probabilities. This analysis improves the understanding of the relationship between internal motions and electron transport. Two SMJ model systems are studied for validation purposes, constructed from a conductor (BDA, benzene-1,4-diamine) and an insulator molecule (DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). The trends of the resulting transmission probabilities are in agreement with the experimental observations, demonstrating the capability of the approach to distinguish between conductor and insulator type systems, thereby offering a straightforward and cost-effective tool for such classifications via quantum chemical calculations.},

This formalism made it possible to revisit the concept of density-functional derivative discontinuity, in the particular case of single excitations from the highest occupied Kohn–Sham (KS) molecular orbital, without invoking the usual “asymptotic behavior of the density” argument. In this work, we address a broader class of excitations, with a particular focus on double excitations. An exact implementation of the theory is presented for the two-electron Hubbard dimer model. A thorough comparison of the true physical ground- and excited-state electronic structures with that of the fictitious ensemble density-functional KS system is also presented. Depending on the choice of the density-functional ensemble as well as the asymmetry of the dimer and the correlation strength, an inversion of states can be observed. In some other cases, the strong mixture of KS states within the true physical system makes the assignment “single excitation” or “double excitation” irrelevant.},

In turn, chalcogen bonding has found to modulate the conformation of some N -thiophen-2-ylfomamides. Since halogens participate in a kin interaction (halogen bonding) and are abundant in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials, we have quantum-chemically explored the interaction between organic halogen and thiophene as a conformational modulator in some model compounds. Although such interaction indeed appears, as demonstrated by atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital analysis, it is inefficient to control the conformational equilibrium. An energy decomposition analysis scheme demonstrated that halomethane and thiophene tend to move away from one another due to a core component (Pauli repulsion and exchange), which is mainly due to a deformation term. Therefore, chalcogen bonds with halogens appear weaker than with other chalcogens.},

  abstract     = {The impact of targeted replacement of individual terms in empirical force fields is quantitatively assessed for pure water, dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ), and solvated K + and Cl − ions. For the electrostatic interactions, point charges (PCs) and machine learning (ML)-based minimally distributed charges (MDCM) fitted to the molecular electrostatic potential are evaluated together with electrostatics based on the Coulomb integral. The impact of explicitly including second-order terms is investigated by adding a fragment molecular orbital (FMO)-derived polarization energy to an existing force field, in this case CHARMM. It is demonstrated that anisotropic electrostatics reduce the RMSE for water (by 1.4 kcal/mol), CH Cl (by 0.8 kcal/mol) and for solvated Cl clusters (by 0.4 kcal/mol). An additional polarization term can be neglected for CH Cl but further improves the models for pure water (by 1.0 kcal/mol) and hydrated Cl (by 0.4 kcal/mol), and is key for solvated K , reducing the RMSE by 2.3 kcal/mol. A 12-6 Lennard-Jones functional form performs satisfactorily with PC and MDCM electrostatics, but is not appropriate for descriptions that account for the electrostatic penetration energy. The importance of many-body contributions is assessed by comparing a strictly 2-body approach with self-consistent reference data. Two-body interactions suffice for CH Cl whereas water and solvated K and Cl ions require explicit many-body corrections. Finally, a many-body-corrected dimer potential energy surface exceeds the accuracy attained using a conventional empirical force field, potentially reaching that of an FMO calculation. The present work systematically quantifies which terms improve the performance of an existing force field and what reference data to use for parametrizing these terms in a tractable fashion for ML fitting of pure and heterogeneous systems.},

While density functional theory (DFT) has become the standard method when targeting medium-size or larger systems, the problem of its reliability and accuracy are well-known and have been abundantly documented. To establish a reliable computational protocol, especially when accuracy is critical, a tailored benchmark is usually required. This is generally done over a short list of known candidates, with the basis set often fixed a priori. In this work, we present a systematic study of the performance of DFT-based hybrid and double-hybrid functionals in the prediction of vibrational energies and infrared intensities at the harmonic level and beyond, considering anharmonic effects through vibrational perturbation theory at the second order. The study is performed for the six-lowest energy glycine conformers, utilizing available “state-of-the-art” accurate theoretical and experimental data as reference. Focusing on the most intense fundamental vibrations in the mid-infrared range of glycine conformers, the role of the basis sets is also investigated considering the balance between computational cost and accuracy. Targeting larger systems, a broad range of hybrid schemes with different computational costs is also tested.},

Classical molecular dynamics simulations have been applied extensively to simulate the response of fluids to inhomogeneities directly, but are limited by the accuracy of the underlying interatomic potentials. Here, we use neural network potentials (NNPs) trained to ab initio simulations to accurately predict the inhomogeneous responses of two distinct fluids: liquid water and molten NaCl. Although NNPs can be readily trained to model complex bulk systems across a range of state points, we show that to appropriately model a fluid&#39;s response at an interface, relevant inhomogeneous configurations must be included in the training data. In order to sufficiently sample appropriate configurations of such inhomogeneous fluids, we develop protocols based on molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of external potentials. We demonstrate that NNPs trained on inhomogeneous fluid configurations can more accurately predict several key properties of fluids—including the density response, surface tension and size-dependent cavitation free energies—for liquid water and molten NaCl, compared to both empirical interatomic potentials and NNPs that are not trained on such inhomogeneous configurations. This work therefore provides a first demonstration and framework to extract the response of inhomogeneous fluids from first principles for classical density-functional treatment of fluids free from empirical potentials.},

  abstract     = {Physics-based scoring function AutoDock4 is one of the most successfully applied tools in the area of structure-based drug design. However, current scoring functions are still far from being perfect. In a recent work highlighting the strengths and deficiencies of current scoring functions, we discovered that the residual error of Δ G bind predictions made by AutoDock4 is highly correlated to the presence of formally charged fragments in a ligand. In this work, we study how the use of the high-quality atomic charges, applied for contemporary force fields calculation, affects the quality of the experimental ΔG bind prediction by means of AutoDock4. We initially expected that the previously found discrepancy could be attributed to the Gasteiger charges used within AutoDock4. We show that AutoDock4 is, surprisingly, not sensitive to the charges used, and the use of QC-derived atomic charges does not lead to any statistical improvements. We also briefly discuss the role of the explicit empirical hydrogen bond term along with the electrostatic term.},

  abstract     = {In an effort to expand the existing QUEST database of accurate vertical transition energies [Véril et al. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2021 , 11 , e1517], we have modeled more than 100 electronic excited states of different natures (local, charge-transfer, Rydberg, singlet, and triplet) in a dozen of mono- and di-substituted benzenes, including aniline, benzonitrile, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, nitrobenzene, among others. To establish theoretical best estimates for these vertical excitation energies, we have employed advanced coupled-cluster methods including iterative triples (CC3 and CCSDT) and, when technically possible, iterative quadruples (CC4). These high-level computational approaches provide a robust foundation for benchmarking a series of popular wave function methods. The evaluated methods all include contributions from double excitations (ADC(2), CC2, CCSD, CIS(D), EOM-MP2, STEOM-CCSD), along with schemes that also incorporate perturbative or iterative triples (ADC(3), CCSDR(3), CCSD(T)(a) , and CCSDT-3). This systematic exploration not only broadens the scope of the QUEST database but also facilitates a rigorous assessment of different theoretical approaches in the framework of a homologous chemical series, offering valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of these methods in such cases. We found that both ADC(2.5) and CCSDT-3 can provide very consistent estimates, whereas among less expensive methods SCS-CC2 is likely the most effective approach. Importantly, we show that some lower order methods may offer reasonable trends in the homologous series while providing quite large average errors, and vice versa . Consequently, benchmarking the accuracy of a model based solely on absolute transition energies may not be meaningful for applications involving a series of similar compounds.},

Leveraging a graph neural network trained on the OE62 dataset of molecular geometries, nGDE predicts interatomic distances based on molecular graphs. These distances are then used in multidimensional scaling to produce 3D geometries, subsequently refined with standard bioorganic forcefields. The machine learning-based graph distance introduced herein is found to be an improvement over the conventional shortest path distances used in graph drawing. Comparative analysis with a state-of-the-art distance geometry method demonstrates nGDE&#39;s competitive performance, particularly showcasing robustness in handling polycyclic molecules—a challenge for existing methods.},

Significant challenges are associated with this approach, including the flexibility of the protein–ligand system, solvent-mediated interactions, and associated entropy changes. In addition, scoring functions are only weakly accurate due to the short time required for calculating enthalpic and entropic binding interactions. The workflow described here attempts to address these limitations by combining supervised molecular dynamics with dynamical averaging quantum mechanics fragment molecular orbital. This combination significantly increased the ability to predict the experimental binding structure of protein–ligand complexes independent from the starting position of the ligands or the binding site conformation. We found that the predictive power could be enhanced by combining the residence time and interaction energies as descriptors in a novel scoring function named the P-score . This is illustrated using six different protein–ligand targets as case studies.},

The interaction energies between the bimetallic clusters and the defective graphene systems are significantly higher than those reported in the literature for the Pd-based clusters deposited on pristine graphene. It is observed that the composites studied present a HOMO-LUMO gap less than 1 eV, which suggests that they may present a good chemical reactivity.

Moreover, both semi-fluorinated and fully fluorinated monolayer violet phosphorus exhibit advantageous semiconducting characteristics, with a tunable bandgap of 0.50 ~ 1.04 eV under biaxial strain ranging from −6% to 6%. Notably, the fully fluorinated monolayer violet phosphorus demonstrates a higher coefficient of light absorption within the visible range.

In an effort to investigate these changes when the Be and Mg derivatives form clusters of increasing size, we have examined the behavior of the (MX 2 ) n (M = Be, Mg; X = H, F; n = 1, 2, 3) clusters when they interact with ammonia, methanimine, hydrogen cyanide and pyridine, and with their corresponding deprotonated forms. The complexes obtained at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level were analyzed using the MBIE energy decomposition formalism, in parallel with QTAIM, ELF, NCIPLOT and AdNDP analyses of their electron density. For n = 1 the interaction enthalpy for the different families of monomers, Be (Mg) hydrides and Be (Mg) fluorides, follows the same trend as the intrinsic basicity of the base that interacts with them. This interaction is greatly reinforced after the deprotonation of the base, resulting in a significant enhancement of the intrinsic acidity of the corresponding MX 2 –Base complex. For (MX 2 ) 2 clusters a further reinforcement of the interaction with the base is observed, this reinforcement being again larger for the deprotonated complexes. However, the concomitant increase of their intrinsic acidity is one order of magnitude larger for hydrides than for fluorides. Unexpectedly, the cyclic conformers (MX 2 ) 3 , which are more unstable than the linear ones, become the global minima after association with the base and the same is true for the deprotonated complex. Accordingly, a further increase of the intrinsic acidity of the (MX 2 ) 3 –Base complexes with respect to the (MX 2 ) 2 –Base ones is observed. This effect is maximum for (MgF 2 ) 3 clusters, to the point that the (MgF 2 ) 3 –Base complexes become more acidic than nitric acid, the extreme case being the cluster (MgF 2 ) 3 –NCH, whose acidity is higher than that of perchloric acid.},

A comparative analysis of DFT approaches for surface modeling is conducted, utilizing either a finite graphene flake or a periodic carbon surface. Results reveal that the finite model effectively preserves all crucial properties. By examining predicted structures arising from CO 2 insertion within the mono-reduced NiFe species, whether isolated or adsorbed on the graphene flake, a potential species for subsequent electro-reduction steps is proposed.

By fitting the Gaussian functions to the DOS, multiple descriptors, such as the Gaussian peak positions, heights, and widths were extracted. Several regression methods, such as the least absolute shrinkage of selection operator (LASSO), random-forest, gradient-boosting, and extra-tree were used to find the relationship between these descriptors and the E ad . The results show that the energy position of the peaks in the d-projected DOS is the most important descriptor, in agreement with the previously known d-band center theory.

  abstract     = {Time-dependent double hybrids with spin-component or spin-opposite scaling to their second-order perturbative correlation correction have demonstrated competitive robustness in the computation of electronic excitation energies. Some of the most robust are those recently published by our group (M. Casanova-Páez, L. Goerigk, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021 , 20 , 5165). So far, the implementation of these functionals has not allowed correctly calculating their ground-state total energies. Herein, we define their correct spin-scaled ground-state energy expressions which enables us to test our methods on the noncovalent excited-state interaction energies of four aromatic excimers. A range of 22 double hybrids with and without spin scaling are compared to the reasonably accurate wavefunction reference from our previous work (A. C. Hancock, L. Goerigk, RSC Adv. 2023 , 13 , 35964). The impact of spin scaling is highly dependent on the underlying functional expression, however, the smallest overall errors belong to spin-scaled functionals with range separation: SCS- and SOS- PBEPP86, and SCS-RSX-QIDH. We additionally determine parameters for DFT-D3(BJ)/D4 ground-state dispersion corrections of these functionals, which reduce errors in most cases. We highlight the necessity of dispersion corrections for even the most robust TD-DFT methods but also point out that ground-state based corrections are insufficient to completely capture dispersion effects for excited-state interaction energies.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations are conducted on a series of chiral gold/silver alloy nanowires to explore whether silver doping can produce an enhancement of circular dichroism at the plasmon resonance in these systems, and to identify the quantum-mechanical origin of the observed effects. We find a strong plasmonic dichroism when one or two helixes of gold atoms are substituted by silver in a linear chiral nanotube, whose pure gold counterpart does not display any plasmonic dichroism, and we rationalize this finding in terms of “decoupling” the destructive interference of excitations in the pure gold nanotube via alloying. However, further attempts to increase the plasmonic dichroism by considering multi-shell gold nanowires in which one entire shell is doped with silver did not produce the desired effect, but rather a decrease in circular dichroism. We show that this latter result is due to a more severe destructive interference in the dipole excitation contributions, and suggest that further amplification should be possible in principle by properly tuning simultaneously the nanowire structure and chemical ordering.},

Therefore, elucidating how different properties of the Ni-Ceria NPs relate to the activity and selectivity of the catalytic reaction, is of crucial importance for the development of novel catalysts. In this work the active learning (AL) method based on machine learning regression and its uncertainty is used for the global optimization of Ce (4-x) Ni x O (8-x) (x = 1, 2, 3) nanoparticles, employing density functional theory calculations. Additionally, further investigation of the NPs by mass-scaled parallel-tempering Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics resulted in the same putative global minimum structures found by AL, demonstrating the robustness of our AL search to learn from small datasets and assist in the global optimization of complex electronic structure systems.},

  abstract     = {The synergistic regulation of the multi-functional sites on one receptor molecule with different cationic effectors for anion recognition is scarce to be well understood from the experiment and theory. In this work, a new anion receptor with three functional zones including ether hole, biurea and double bipyridine groups ( EUPR ) is designed expecting to enhance the chloride anion recognition together with a rational synthesis path being proposed based on four simple and mature organic reaction steps. The conformational structures of the designed receptor EUPR and the binding behaviors for three kinds of ions (Cl − , Na + , and Ag + ) are deeply investigated by using density functional theoretical calculations. It is found that Cl − binding via the hydrogen bond interaction can be significantly enhanced and synergistically regulated by the two kinds of cations and the corresponding conformational changes of receptor EUPR . Especially, the conformational pre-organization of receptor caused by the encapsulation of sodium ion into ether hole is benefit to the binding for Cl − in both thermodynamics and kinetics. Na + binding, in turn, can ever be enhanced by chloride anion, whereas it seems that Ag + binding cannot always be enhanced by chloride anion, reflecting an electrical complementary matching and mutual enhancement effect for different counter ions. Moreover, solvent effect calculations indicate that EUPR may be an ideal candidate structure for Cl − recognition by strategy of counter ion enhancement in water. Additionally, a visual study of intermolecular noncovalent interaction (NCI) and molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) are used for the analysis on the nature of interactions between receptor and bound ions.},

Theoretical calculations show that XBTD-NPh is a long-time phosphorescent material at 77 K and TADF is attributed to the RISC of T 1 to S 1 state. For DSBNA-BTD, excitons arrived at T 1 state comes to a large rate of nonradiatively path to the ground state, meaning it is may not be an efficient TADF molecule.

  abstract     = {A comprehensive study of the different classes of cycloaddition reactions ([3+2], [2+2], and [2+1]) of SO 2 to acetylene and ethylene has been performed using density functional theory (DFT) and composite wavefunction methods. The [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, that was previously explored in the context of the cycloaddition of thioformaldehyde S-methylide (TSM) to ethylene and acetylene, proceeds in a concerted way to the formation of stable heterocycles. In this paper, we extend our study to the [2+2] and [2+1] cycloadditions of SO 2 to acetylene, which would produce 1,1-oxathiete-2-oxide and thiirene-1,1-dioxide, respectively. One of the main conclusions is that cyclic 1,1-oxathiete-2-oxide can open through a relatively easy breaking of the S  O single bond and rearrange toward sulfinyl acetaldehyde (SA). The SA molecule can easily undergo several internal rearrangements, which eventually lead to sulfenic acid and sulfoxide derivatives of ethenone, 1,2,3-dioxathiole, and CO plus sulfinylmethane. The most probable path, however, produces 2-thioxoacetic acid, whose derivatives (or those of the corresponding acetate) are usually obtained by Willgerodt–Kindler-type sulfuration of acetates. This product can in turn decompose, leading to the final products CO 2 and H 2 CS. Comparison of this decomposition path with that of 2-amino-2-thioxoacetic acid shows that the process occurs through different H-transfer processes.},

Polarizable continuum model (PCM), molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations are used to disclose the effects of solute/solvent interactions and, more generally, the role of the embedding in NMR simulations. The results show the beneficial effect of carrying out QM/MM optimizations on top of geometries directly extracted from classical MD simulations, used to ensure representative conformational sampling. The nuclear shielding convergence has been tested against a different number of snapshots and with the inclusion of solvent shells into the QM region. An automated MD//QM/MM//GIAO protocol, implemented in the COBRAMM package, is here proposed and tested on trimethyl phosphite showing that our approach boosts the convergence of nuclear shielding satisfactorily.

Our study explored harnessing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to unveil the molecular traits inherent in CA I and CA II inhibitors. The PubChem molecular fingerprints of these inhibitors, sourced from the ChEMBL database, were subjected to detailed XAI analysis. The study encompassed training 10 regression models using IC 50 values, and their efficacy was gauged using metrics including R 2 , RMSE, and time taken. The Decision Tree Regressor algorithm emerged as the optimal performer ( R 2 : 0.93, RMSE: 0.43, time-taken: 0.07). Furthermore, the PFI method unveiled key molecular features for CA I inhibitors, notably PubChemFP432 (C(O)N) and PubChemFP6978 (C(O)O). The SHAP analysis highlighted the significance of attributes like PubChemFP539 (C(O)NCC), PubChemFP601 (C(O)OCC), and PubChemFP432 (C(O)N) in CA I inhibitiotable n. Likewise, features for CA II inhibitors encompassed PubChemFP528(C(O)OCCN), PubChemFP791 (C(O)OCCC), PubChemFP696 (C(O)OCCCC), PubChemFP335 (C(O)NCCN), PubChemFP580 (C(O)NCCCN), and PubChemFP180 (C(O)NCCC), identified through SHAP analysis. The sulfonamide group (S), aromatic ring (A), and hydrogen bonding group (H) exert a substantial impact on CA I and CA II enzyme activities and IC 50 values through the XAI approach. These insights into the CA I and CA II inhibitors are poised to guide future drug discovery efforts, serving as a beacon for innovative therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {This study employs grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to investigate the impact of functional group modifications (  CH 3 ,  OH,  NH 2 , and  O  Li) on the adsorption performance of CH 4 /N 2 on Ni-MOF-74. The results revealed that functional group modifications significantly increased the adsorption capacity of Ni-MOF-74 for both CH 4 and N 2 . The packed methyl groups in CH 3 -Ni-MOF-74 create an environment conducive to CH 4 , leading to the highest CH 4 adsorption capacity. The electrostatic potential distribution indicates that the strong electron-donating effect introduced by the alkali metal Li results in the highest electrostatic potential gradient in Li-O-Ni-MOF-74, leading to the strongest adsorption of N 2 , this is unfavorable for CH 4 /N 2 separation. At 1500 kPa the selectivity order of adsorbents for mixed gases was as follows: CH 3 -Ni-MOF-74 &gt; NH 2 -Ni-MOF-74 &gt; OH-Ni-MOF-74 &gt; Ni-MOF-74 &gt; Li-O-Ni-MOF-74. This study highlights that CH 3 -Ni-MOF-74 possesses optimal CH 4 selectivity and adsorption performance. Given the current lack of research on functionalized MOF-74 for the separation of CH 4 and N 2 , the findings of this study will serve as a theoretical guide and provide references for the applications of CH 4 adsorption and CH 4 /N 2 separation.},

Here, we introduce the Python 3-Body Recombination program, which is dedicated to the computation of atomic three-body recombination rate coefficients. The software is based on a classical trajectory approach in hyperspherical coordinates after mapping the three-body problem as a single particle in a higher-dimensional space. This theoretical approach is fully general and applicable to any ion-atom-atom or atom-atom-atom three-body process. The predictive power of the methodology has been tested in several different experimental scenarios, reaching a good description of every system. The code structure is presented alongside examples and tests to ensure the software&#39;s capacity. In addition, the performance of the software after parallelization is shown.},

  abstract     = {Avena sativa phototropin 1 light-oxygen-voltage 2 domain ( As LOV2) is a model protein of Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily, characterized by conformational changes in response to external environmental stimuli. This conformational change begins with the unfolding of the N-terminal A&#39; α helix in the dark state followed by the unfolding of the C-terminal J α helix. The light state is characterized by the unfolded termini and the subsequent modifications in hydrogen bond patterns. In this photoreceptor, β -sheets are identified as crucial components for mediating allosteric signal transmission between the two termini. Through combined experimental and computational investigations, the H β and I β strands are recognized as the most critical and influential β -sheets in As LOV2&#39;s allosteric mechanism. To elucidate the role of these β -sheets, we introduced 13 distinct mutations (F490L, N492A, L493A, F494L, H495L, L496F, Q497A, R500A, F509L, Q513A, L514A, D515V, and T517V) and conducted comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations. In-depth hydrogen bond analyses emphasized the role of two hydrogen bonds, Asn482-Leu453 and Gln479-Val520, in the observed distinct behaviors of L493A, L496F, Q497A, and D515V mutants. This illustrates the role of β -sheets in the transmission of the allosteric signal upon the photoactivation of the light state.},

Unfortunately, the dimensions of even the smallest realistic models are too large to permit the use of state-of-the-art composite wave function methods. Under these circumstances, density functional theory still offers the best compromise between cost and accuracy. However, comprehensive benchmarks of different functionals are not yet available for this important research field. The main aim of the present paper is to fill this gap by performing an unbiased comparison of several density functionals and continuum solvent models for the stereo-control in the propylene polymerization on prototypical catalysts inducing different reaction mechanisms. While it was not possible to define a unique computational protocol providing the best results in all the situations, the B3PW91 functional in conjunction with D3 empirical dispersions and the solvent model density solvent model performs remarkably well for three out of the four investigated catalysts. Under such circumstances, it is recommended to compare the results delivered by different models when approaching additional classes of catalysts.},

Limited research on the B 6 ⁢ O 7 ⁢ ( OH ) 6 2 − hydrolysis mechanism under neutral solution conditions exists. Calculations based on density functional theory show that B 6 ⁢ O 7 ⁢ ( OH ) 6 2 − undergoes five steps of hydrolysis to form H 3 BO 3 and B ⁢ ( OH ) 4 − . At the same time, there are a small number of borate ions with different degrees of polymerization during the hydrolysis process, such as triborate, tetraborate, and pentaborate anions. The structure of the borate anion and the coordination environment of the bridging oxygen atoms control the hydrolysis process. Finally, this work explains that in existing experimental studies, the reason for the low content in solution environments with low total boron concentrations is that it depolymerizes into other types of borate ions and clarifies the borate species. The conversion relationship provides a basis for identifying the possibility of various borate ions existing in the solution. This work also provides a certain degree of theoretical support for the cause of the “dilution to salt” phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {In a protein, nearby titratable sites can be coupled: the (de)protonation of one may affect the other. The degree of this interaction depends on several factors and can influence the measured p K a . Here, we derive a formalism based on double free energy differences ( Δ ⁢ Δ G ) for quantifying the individual site p K a values of coupled residues. As Δ ⁢ Δ G values can be obtained by means of alchemical free energy calculations, the presented approach allows for a convenient estimation of coupled residue p K a s in practice. We demonstrate that our approach and a previously proposed microscopic p K a formalism, can be combined with alchemical free energy calculations to resolve pH-dependent protein p K a values. Toy models and both, regular and constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations, alongside experimental data, are used to validate this approach. Our results highlight the insights gleaned when coupling and microstate probabilities are analyzed and suggest extensions to more complex enzymatic contexts. Furthermore, we find that naïvely computed values that ignore coupling, can be significantly improved when coupling is accounted for, in some cases reducing the error by half. In short, alchemical free energy methods can resolve the values of both uncoupled and coupled residues.},

Moreover, the relative preference of trapping among these molecules within the sight of Ag metal ion in the complex is explored. The nature of interaction of these small molecules with the [Ag(C 6 H 12 O 6 )] + ion is studied. Exergonic nature of binding is noted with the metal center for all the chosen small molecules except O 2 . Thermochemical data reveals the binding preference of C 2 H 4 &gt; C 2 H 2 &gt; CO &gt; NO &gt; N 2 &gt; H 2 . Natural bond orbital analysis, contour plot of the Laplacian of electron density, electron density descriptors, and gradient isosurface help in understanding the nature of interactions. Maximum bond formation is noted between the Ag-complex and CO molecule. Assessed energy decomposition analysis discloses the nature of interaction as mainly orbital between the bound small gas molecules and the Ag-complex. Frontier molecular orbital pictures further help in understanding the type of interaction as orbital. To disclose the kinetic stability of the gas molecule bound Ag complexes an ab initio molecular dynamics study is done at different temperatures up to 2 ps. These studies help in understanding the type of adsorption. Calculated conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) based reactivity descriptors corroborate well with results. β-D-glucopyranose—silver ion (1:1) complex may be used as small gas molecule scavenger.},

This study is performed for a set of 11 molecules which includes diatomics, linear triatomics, and a few non-linear molecules. The ab initio calculations were performed using three tiers of composite chemical recipes. The current results show that as the overall rigor of calculation is increased, the semi-experimental and the ab initio numbers agree to within 0.0003 Å for all molecules in the test set. The composite approach based on correcting the potential energy surface (energy scheme) and the one based on correcting the geometry directly (geometry scheme) show excellent agreement with each other.

In this work, we aim at simulation of the spectral properties of terthiophene with oligo(ethylene oxide) substituents by the methods of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics (MD).

MD simulations in water than revealed the most frequented molecular conformations in both these states. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were determined for all these conformations, including the surrounding water molecules, using TD-DFT and averaged over the conformation space to obtain the final absorption and fluorescence spectrum. The calculated spectra were compared with their experimental counterparts and the differences were discussed in context of the supramolecular structure revealed by confocal microscopy. In spite of its simplicity, this approach provides a satisfactory approximation of absorption and fluorescent spectra of these molecules obtained by computational methods.},

  abstract     = {For a detailed understanding of chemical processes in nature and industry, we need accurate models of chemical reactions in complex environments. While Eyring transition state theory is commonly used for modeling chemical reactions, it is most accurate for small molecules in the gas phase. A wide range of alternative rate theories exist that can better capture reactions involving complex molecules and environmental effects. However, they require that the chemical reaction is sampled by molecular dynamics simulations. This is a formidable challenge since the accessible simulation timescales are many orders of magnitude smaller than typical timescales of chemical reactions. To overcome these limitations, rare event methods involving enhanced molecular dynamics sampling are employed. In this work, thermal isomerization of retinal is studied using tight-binding density functional theory. Results from transition state theory are compared to those obtained from enhanced sampling. Rates obtained from dynamical reweighting using infrequent metadynamics simulations were in close agreement with those from transition state theory. Meanwhile, rates obtained from application of Kramers&#39; rate equation to a sampled free energy profile along a torsional dihedral reaction coordinate were found to be up to three orders of magnitude higher. This discrepancy raises concerns about applying rate methods to one-dimensional reaction coordinates in chemical reactions.},

Here, we present a bottom-up coarse-graining approach for modeling titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanomaterials in contact with phospholipids that uses the inverse Monte Carlo method to optimize the effective interactions from the structural data obtained in small-scale all-atom simulations of TiO 2 surfaces with lipids in aqueous solution. The resulting coarse-grained models are able to accurately reproduce the structural details of lipid adsorption on different titania surfaces without the use of an explicit solvent, enabling significant computational resource savings and favorable scaling. Our coarse-grained simulations show that small spherical TiO 2 nanoparticles ( r = 2 nm) can only be partially wrapped by a lipid bilayer with phosphoethanolamine headgroups, however, the lipid adsorption increases with the radius of the nanoparticle. The current approach can be used to study the effect of the size and shape of TiO 2 nanoparticles on their interactions with cell membrane lipids, which can be a determining factor in membrane wrapping as well as the recently discovered phenomenon of nanoquarantining, which involves the formation of layered nanomaterial–lipid structures.},

  abstract     = {Vibrational spectroscopy enables critical insight into the structural and dynamic properties of molecules. Presently, the majority of theoretical approaches to spectroscopy employ wavefunction-based ab initio or density functional methods that rely on the harmonic approximation. This approximation breaks down for large molecules with strongly anharmonic bonds or for molecules with large internuclear separations. An alternative to these methods involves generating molecular anharmonic potential energy surfaces (potentials) and using them to extrapolate the vibrational frequencies. This study examines the efficacy of density functional theory (DFT) and the correlation consistent Composite Approach (ccCA) in generating anharmonic frequencies from potentials of small main group molecules. Vibrational self-consistent field Theory (VSCF) and post-VSCF methods were used to calculate the fundamental frequencies of these molecules from their potentials. Functional choice, basis set selection, and mode-coupling are also examined as factors in influencing accuracy. The absolute deviations for the calculated frequencies using potentials at the ccCA level of theory were lower than the potentials at the DFT level. With DFT resulting in bending modes that are better described than those of ccCA, a multilevel DFT:ccCA approach where DFT potentials are used for single vibrational mode potentials and ccCA is used for vibrational mode-mode couplings can be utilized for larger polyatomic systems. The frequencies obtained with this multilevel approach using VCIPSI-PT2 were closer to experimental frequencies than the scaled harmonic frequencies, indicating the success of utilizing post-VSCF methods to generate more accurate representations of computed infrared spectra.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the enantioselectivity of β-cyclodextrin and its derivatives towards propranolol enantiomers are investigated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) have previously been shown to be able to recognize propranolol (PRP) enantiomers. To improve upon the enantioselectivity of β-cyclodextrin, we propose the use of an ionic-liquid-modified-β-cyclodextrin (β-CD-IL). β-CD-IL was found to be able to complex R and S propranolol enantiomers with differing binding energies. The molecular docking study reveals that the ionic liquid chain attached to the β-CD molecule has significant interaction with propranolol. The formation of the most stable complex occurred between (S)-β-CD-IL and (S)-propranolol with an energy of −5.80 kcal/mol. This is attributed to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the oxygen of the propranolol and the hydrogen on the primary rim of the (S)-β-CD-IL cavity. This interaction is not detected in other complexes. The root mean-squared fluctuation (RMSF) value indicates that the NH group is the most flexible molecular fragment, followed by the aromatic group. Also of note, the formation of a complex between pristine β-CD and (S)-propranolol is the least favorable.},

In this work, we present a RL method, based on Q-learning, for the structural determination of adsorbate@substrate models in silico, where the minimization of the energy landscape resulting from adsorbate interactions with a substrate is made by actions on states (translations and rotations) chosen from an agent&#39;s policy. The proposed RL method is implemented in an early version of the reinforcement learning software for materials design and discovery (RLMaterial), developed in Python3.x. RLMaterial interfaces with deMon2k, DFTB+, ORCA, and Quantum Espresso codes to compute the adsorbate@substrate energies. The RL method was applied for the structural determination of (i) the amino acid glycine and (ii) 2-amino-acetaldehyde, both interacting with a boron nitride (BN) monolayer, (iii) host-guest interactions between phenylboronic acid and β -cyclodextrin and (iv) ammonia on naphthalene. Density functional tight binding calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with a reasonably low computational cost for systems (i)–(iii) and DFT for system (iv). Artificial neural network and gradient boosting regression techniques were employed to approximate the Q-matrix or Q-table for better decision making (policy) on next actions. Finally, we have developed a transfer-learning protocol within the RL framework that allows learning from one chemical system and transferring the experience to another, as well as from different DFT or DFTB levels.},

  abstract     = {Through this paper, the authors propose using the quantum cluster equilibrium (QCE) theory to reinvestigate ammonia clusters in the liquid phase. The ammonia clusters from size monomer to hexadecamer were considered to simulate the liquid ammonia in this approach. The clusterset used to model the liquid ammonia is an ensemble of different structures of ammonia clusters. After studious research of the representative configurations of ammonia clusters through the cluster research program ABCluster, the configurations have been optimized at the MN15/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. These optimizations lead to geometries and frequencies as inputs for the Peacemaker code. The QCE study of this molecular system permits us to get the liquid phase populations in a temperature range of 190–260 K, covering the temperatures from the melting point to the boiling point. The results show that the population of liquid ammonia comprises mainly the ammonia hexadecamer followed by pentadecamer, tetradecamer, and tridecamer. We noted that the small-sized ammonia clusters do not contribute to the population of liquid ammonia. In addition, the thermodynamic properties, such as heat of vaporization, heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy, and free energies, obtained by the QCE theory have been compared to the experiment given some relatively good agreements in the gas phase and show considerable discrepancies in liquid phase except the density. Finally, based on the predicted population, we calculated the infrared spectrum of liquid ammonia at 215 K temperature. It comes out that the calculated infrared spectrum qualitatively agrees with the experiment.},

In all of these contexts, the chief advantage of Crystal over other methods is its ability to globally map the PES, thereby determining the most relevant regions of configuration space quickly and reliably—even when the dimensionality is rather large. Here, Crystal is used to generate a uniformly spaced grid of density functional theory (DFT) or ab initio points, truncated over the relevant regions, which can then be used to either: (a) hone in precisely on PES features such as minima and transition states, or; (b) create a new PES function automatically, via interpolation. Proof of concept is demonstrated via application to three molecular systems: water (H 2 O), (reduced-dimensional) methane (CH 4 ), and methylene imine (CH 2 NH).},

Different basis-set correction density-functional approximations are explored and the complementary-auxiliary-basis-set single-excitation correction is added. The method is tested on a benchmark set of reaction energies at the second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) level and a comparison with the explicitly correlated MP2-F12 method is provided.

Additionally, the models are tested in 298 K MD simulations with FFLUX to benchmark for robustness. The resulting energy and force predictions throughout the simulation are in excellent agreement with ab initio data for ammonia and methanol but decrease in quality for malondialdehyde due to the increased system complexity.

In this article, the transition-metal hydrides ScH and YH are investigated, assuming a similar unquenching effect involving low-lying unoccupied π and δ orbitals formed from the metal d orbitals rather than the p orbitals. We are comparing results obtained with various quantum-chemical methods (HF, CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT) and basis sets. The obtained positive values for the magnetizabilities clearly indicate paramagnetic behavior. Vibrational effects on the magnetizability tensor are also considered, but these effects are small and do not change the overall conclusion that both ScH and YH are further examples for closed-shell paramagnetism.},

  abstract     = {This paper (i) explores the internal structure of two quantum mechanics datasets (QM7b, QM9), composed of several thousands of organic molecules and described in terms of electronic properties, and (ii) further explores an inverse design approach to molecular design consisting of using machine learning methods to approximate the atomic composition of molecules, using QM9 data. Understanding the structure and characteristics of this kind of data is important when predicting the atomic composition from physical-chemical properties in inverse molecular designs. Intrinsic dimension analysis, clustering, and outlier detection methods were used in the study. They revealed that for both datasets the intrinsic dimensionality is several times smaller than the descriptive dimensions. The QM7b data is composed of well-defined clusters related to atomic composition. The QM9 data consists of an outer region predominantly composed of outliers, and an inner, core region that concentrates clustered inliner objects. A significant relationship exists between the number of atoms in the molecule and its outlier/inliner nature. The spatial structure exhibits a relationship with molecular weight. Despite the structural differences between the two datasets, the predictability of variables of interest for inverse molecular design is high. This is exemplified by models estimating the number of atoms of the molecule from both the original properties and from lower dimensional embedding spaces. In the generative approach the input is given by a set of desired properties of the molecule and the output is an approximation of the atomic composition in terms of its constituent chemical elements. This could serve as the starting region for further search in the huge space determined by the set of possible chemical compounds. The quantum mechanic&#39;s dataset QM9 is used in the study, composed of 133,885 small organic molecules and 19 electronic properties. Different multi-target regression approaches were considered for predicting the atomic composition from the properties, including feature engineering techniques in an auto-machine learning framework. High-quality models were found that predict the atomic composition of the molecules from their electronic properties, as well as from a subset of only 52.6% size. Feature selection worked better than feature generation. The results validate the generative approach to inverse molecular design.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we have investigated factors affecting the accuracy of computational chemistry calculation of redox potentials, namely the gas-phase ionization energy (IE) and electron affinity (EA), and the continuum solvation effect. In general, double-hybrid density functional theory methods yield IEs and EAs that are on average within ~0.1 eV of our high-level W3X-L benchmark, with the best performing method being DSD-BLYP/ma-def2-QZVPP. For lower-cost methods, the average errors are ~0.2–0.3 eV, with ω B97X-3c being the most accurate (~0.15 eV). For the solvation component, essentially all methods have an average error of ~0.3 eV, which shows the limitation of the continuum solvation model. Curiously, the directly calculated redox potentials show errors of ~0.3 eV for all methods. These errors are notably smaller than what can be expected from error propagation with the two components (IE and EA, and solvation effect). Such a discrepancy can be attributed to the cancellation of errors, with the lowest-cost GFN2-xTB method benefiting the most, and the most accurate ω B97X-3c method benefiting the least. For organometallic species, the redox potentials show large deviations exceeding ~0.5 eV even for DSD-BLYP. The large errors are attributed to those for the gas-phase IEs and EAs, which represents a major barrier to the accurate calculation of redox potentials for such systems.},

  abstract     = {Molecular properties and reactions form the foundation of chemical space. Over the years, innumerable molecules have been synthesized, a smaller fraction of them found immediate applications, while a larger proportion served as a testimony to creative and empirical nature of the domain of chemical science. With increasing emphasis on sustainable practices, it is desirable that a target set of molecules are synthesized preferably through a fewer empirical attempts instead of a larger library, to realize an active candidate. In this front, predictive endeavors using machine learning (ML) models built on available data acquire high timely significance. Prediction of molecular property and reaction outcome remain one of the burgeoning applications of ML in chemical science. Among several methods of encoding molecular samples for ML models, the ones that employ language like representations are gaining steady popularity. Such representations would additionally help adopt well-developed natural language processing (NLP) models for chemical applications. Given this advantageous background, herein we describe several successful chemical applications of NLP focusing on molecular property and reaction outcome predictions. From relatively simpler recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to complex models like transformers, different network architecture have been leveraged for tasks such as de novo drug design, catalyst generation, forward and retro-synthesis predictions. The chemical language model (CLM) provides promising avenues toward a broad range of applications in a time and cost-effective manner. While we showcase an optimistic outlook of CLMs, attention is also placed on the persisting challenges in reaction domain, which would optimistically be addressed by advanced algorithms tailored to chemical language and with increased availability of high-quality datasets.},

Using the appropriate radical GPRI equation for electrophilic attack or nucleophilic radical attack, seven different population schemes were used to assign the most reactive atoms in each of the 22 molecules. The results show that the condensed radical GPRI is sensitive to the population scheme chosen, but less sensitive than the radical Fukui function. Therefore, the reliability of these methods depends on the population scheme. Our investigation indicates that the condensed radical GPRI is most accurate in predicting the dominant products of the methyl radical addition reactions on a variety of unsaturated molecules when the Hirshfeld, Merz–Singh–Kollman, or Voronoi deformation density population schemes are used. Furthermore, for all populations schemes in the majority of instances where the radical Fukui function failed the radical GPRI was able to identify the most reactive atom under certain reactivity conditions.},

Machine learning (ML)-based potential energy functions offer the prospect of simulating complex molecular systems efficiently at quantum chemical accuracy. In previous work, we have introduced the ML-based PairF-Net approach to neural network potentials, that adopts a pairwise interatomic scheme to predicting forces within a molecular system. Here, we further develop the PairF-Net model to intrinsically incorporate energy conservation and couple the model to a molecular mechanical (MM) environment within the OpenMM package. The updated PairF-Net model yields energy and force predictions and dynamical distributions in good agreement with the rMD17 dataset of ten small organic molecules in the gas-phase. We further show that these in vacuo ML models of small molecules can be applied to force predictions in aqueous solution via hybrid ML/MM simulations. We present a new benchmark dataset for these ten molecules in solution, obtained from QM/MM simulations, which we denote as rMD17-aq ( https://zenodo.org/records/10048644 ); and assess the ability of PairF-Net to reproduce the molecular energy, atomic forces and dynamical distributions of these solution conformations via ML/MM simulations.},

Notably, a novel interface with the Crystal package was established, enabling a seamless transition from molecules to periodic systems using a unified methodology. Two distinct sets of uranium-based systems were investigated: (i) the evolution of the Uranyl ion (UO 2 2 + ) traced from its molecular configurations to the solid state, exemplified by Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 and (ii) Uranium tetrachloride (UCl 4 ) in both its molecular and crystalline forms. The primary focus was on exploring the impact of crystal packing on key properties, including IR and Raman spectra, structural parameters, and an in-depth assessment of bond strength utilizing local mode perspectives. This work not only demonstrates the adaptability and versatility of LModeA for periodic systems but also highlights its potential for gaining insights into complex materials and aiding in the design of new materials through fine-tuning.},

Experimental investigations and highly correlated wave function-based calculations are performed to determine benchmark redox potentials. Based on these, the accuracies of different methods (semi-empirical, density functional theory, wave function-based), solvent models, dispersion corrections, and basis sets are evaluated. The developed screening procedure consists of three steps: First, a conformer search is performed with CREST. The molecules are selected based on the redox potentials calculated using GFN2-xTB. Second, HOMO energies calculated with reparametrized B3LYP-D3(BJ) and the def2-SVP basis set are used as selection criteria. The final molecules are selected based on the redox potentials calculated from Gibbs energies using BP86-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP.

Our findings reveal that the centrally doped pentagonal ring structure demonstrates enhanced stability and heightened aromaticity due to its uniform bonding characteristics and a larger charge transfer region. Through natural population analysis and spin density diagrams, we observed a monotonic decrease in the magnetic moment from Gd to Yb. This is attributed to the decreasing number of unpaired electrons in the 4f orbitals of the heavy rare earth atoms. Interestingly, the system doped with Er atoms showed lower stability and anti-aromaticity, likely due to the involvement of the 4f orbitals in bonding. Conversely, the systems doped with Gd and Tb atoms stood out for their high magnetism and stability, making them potential building blocks for rare earth-doped semiconductor materials.},

Quantitative descriptors are determined to assess the extent of charge transfer between the bithiophene moieties and the capping domains, represented by either phenyl or triazine groups. The investigation substantiates intrinsic differences in the photophysical behavior of these two structural variants and reveals the presence of lower-energy excited states characterized by noteworthy charge transfer contributions in the triazine cage system. The manifestation of this charge transfer character is discernible even at the Franck–Condon geometry, persisting throughout the relaxation of the excited state. By examining isolated monomer building blocks, we confirm the existence of analogous charge transfer contributions in their excitations.

In this work a systematic study of the mutual influence of various paired combinations of non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds and π-interactions) involving the imidazole moiety was performed by means of quantum chemistry (PW6B95-GD3/def2-QZVPD) for a series of model systems constructed based on analysis of available x-ray data. It is shown that for considered complexes formation of additional non-covalent interactions can only enhance the proton-donating ability of imidazole. At the same time, its proton-accepting ability can be both enhanced and weakened, depending on what additional interactions are added to a given system. The mutual influence of non-covalent interactions involving imidazole can be classified as weak geometric and strong energetic cooperativity—a small change in the length of non-covalent interaction formed by imidazole can strongly influence its strength. The latter can be used to develop methods for controlling the rate and selectivity of chemical reactions involving the imidazole fragment in larger systems. It is shown that the strong mutual influence of non-covalent interactions involving imidazole is due to the unique ability of the imidazole ring to effectively redistribute electron density in non-covalently bound systems with its participation.},

  abstract     = {The photophysical properties of a series of recently synthesized single benzene fluorophores were investigated using ensemble density functional theory calculations. The energetic stability of the ground and excited state species were counterposed against the aromaticity index derived from local vibrational modes. It was found that the large Stokes shift of the fluorophores (up to ca. 5800 cm − 1 ) originates from the effect of electron donating and electron withdrawing substituents rather than π -delocalization and related (anti-)aromaticity. On the basis of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, the absence of fluorescence from one of the regioisomers was explained by the occurrence of easily accessible S 1 /S 0 conical intersections below the vertical excitation energy level. It is demonstrated in the manuscript that the analysis of local mode force constants and the related aromaticity index represent a useful tool for the characterization of π -delocalization effects in π -conjugated compounds.},

  abstract     = {Partial charges are a central concept in general chemistry and chemical biology, yet dozens of different computational definitions exist. In prior work [Cho et al., ChemPhysChem 21 , 688-696 (2020)], we showed that these can be reduced to at most three ‘principal components of ionicity’. The present study addressed the dependence of computed partial charges q on 1-particle basis set and (for WFT methods) n -particle correlation treatment or (for DFT methods) exchange-correlation functional, for several representative partial charge definitions such as QTAIM, Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I, HLY (electrostatic), NPA, and GAPT. Our findings show that semi-empirical double hybrids can closely approach the CCSD(T) ‘gold standard’ for this property. In fact, owing to an error compensation in MP2, CCSD partial charges are further away from CCSD(T) than is MP2. The nonlocal correlation is important, especially when there is a substantial amount of nonlocal exchange. Employing range separation proves to be “mostly&quot; not advantageous, while global hybrids perform optimally for 20%–30% Hartree-Fock exchange across all charge types. Basis set convergence analysis shows that an augmented triple-zeta heavy-aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set or a partially augmented jun-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set is sufficient for Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I, HLY, and GAPT charges. In contrast, QTAIM and NPA display slower basis set convergence. It is noteworthy that for both NPA and QTAIM, HF exhibits markedly slower basis set convergence than the correlation components of MP2 and CCSD. Triples corrections in CCSD(T), denoted as CCSD(T)-CCSD, exhibit even faster basis set convergence.},

The transport properties are estimated considering Boltzmann transport theory. The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and power factor are all assessed using the Boltzmann transport theory. The optimized thermoelectric response of the examined TlTaO 3 is produced by the improved carrier mobility, which also improves the thermoelectric efficiency of the TlTaO 3 .

Additionally, we examined potential electronic transitions within these systems and assessed the feasibility of quantum entanglement generation and manipulation. Our findings revealed that the interaction energies within the analyzed systems exhibited behavior akin to that described by the Lennard-Jones potential, which characterizes systems with favorable energy for their formation. The results further yielded estimates for the constants ϵ and σ , with values of − 66 . 59 kcal/mol and 1.63 Å , respectively.

Harmonic vibrational frequencies were computed at the same level of theory while anharmonic vibrational frequencies were computed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pwCVTZ-PP level of theory. Final energetics were obtained with the CCSDT(Q) method. Basis sets up to augmented quintuple-zeta cardinality (aug-cc-pwCV5Z-PP) were employed to obtain energetics in order to extrapolate to the complete basis set limits using the focal point approach. Zero-point vibrational energy corrections were appended to the extrapolated energies in order to determine relative energies at 0 K. It was found that the planar dibridged isomer lies lowest in energy while the linear structure lies highest in energy. The results were compared to other group 13 M H (M = B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl) theoretical studies and some interesting variations are found. With respect to experiment, incompatibilities exist.},

This is followed by a weighted least-squares refinement yielding the energy levels of the states involved in the measured transitions. Altogether 6318 empirical rovibrational energies have been determined for C O . Finally, estimates have been given for the uncertainties of the empirical energies, based on the experimental uncertainties of the transitions. The detailed analysis of the lines and the spectroscopic network built from them, as well as the uncertainty estimates, all serve to pinpoint possible errors in the experimental data, such as typos, misassignment of quantum numbers, and misidentifications.

This study employs ensemble learning models to identify crucial substructures as significant features for drug development. Using molecular docking techniques, a collection of 160 darunavir (DRV) analogs was designed based on these key substructures and subsequently screened using molecular docking techniques. Chemical structures with high fitness scores were selected, combined, and one-dimensional (1D) screening based on beyond Lipinski&#39;s rule of five (bRo5) and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) prediction implemented in the Combined Analog generator Tool (CAT) program. A total of 473 screened analogs were subjected to docking analysis through convolutional neural networks scoring function against both the wild-type (WT) and 12 major mutated PRs. DRV analogs with negative changes in binding free energy ( ΔΔ G bind ) compared to DRV could be categorized into four attractive groups based on their interactions with the majority of vital PRs. The analysis of interaction profiles revealed that potent designed analogs, targeting both WT and mutant PRs, exhibited interactions with common key amino acid residues. This observation further confirms that the ML model-guided approach effectively identified the substructures that play a crucial role in potent analogs. It is expected to function as a powerful computational tool, offering valuable guidance in the identification of chemical substructures for synthesis and subsequent experimental testing.},

The amount of experimental data about various properties of molecules constantly grows, promoting data-driven approaches. However, the applicability of typical predictive machine learning techniques can be substantially limited by a lack of experimental data about a particular target. For example, there are many known Thrombin inhibitors (acting as anticoagulants), but a very limited number of known Protein C inhibitors (coagulants). In this study, we present our approach to suggest new inhibitor candidates by building an effective representation of chemical space. For this aim, we developed a deep learning model—autoencoder, trained on a large set of molecules in the SMILES format to map the chemical space. Further, we applied different sampling strategies to generate novel coagulant candidates. Symmetrically, we tested our approach on anticoagulant candidates, where we were able to predict their inhibition towards Thrombin. We also compare our approach with MegaMolBART—another deep learning generative model, but exploiting similar principles of navigation in a chemical space.},

The effect of the substitution of EWG and EDG on the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbitals, ionization energy, electron affinity, reorganization energy, crystal packing, and charge carrier mobility are studied. The crystal structure simulation method is used to optimize the possible crystal packing arrangements for the studied molecules. The energy and distribution of electron density on the frontier molecular orbitals are strongly influenced by the substitution of EWG and EDG, thereby changes in the absorption spectrum and charge transport properties. The unsubstituted NDT molecule possesses a maximum hole mobility of 2.8 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is due to the strong intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the NDT molecule can be used as a p-type semiconducting material.

One is a separation of the dispersion-type stabilization from the electron correlation energy, traditionally referred to as the “dispersion interaction” (DI). Another is an alternative evaluation of the electrostatic (ES) interaction using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges.

Although the two spectra probe the same set of electronic states, the intensity patterns are different, leading to an apparent red-shift of the 2PA spectrum relative to the 1PA spectrum. The presented analysis explains the intensity patterns and attributes the differences between the 1PA and 2PA spectra to the native symmetry of isolated SCN − , which influences the spectra in the low-symmetry solvated environment. The native symmetry also manifests itself in variations of the polarization ratio (e.g., parallel vs. perpendicular cross sections) across the spectrum.

While the charge factor has a minimal impact on π -electron delocalization, the presence of a p z orbital capable of interacting with the π -electron delocalization is the primary factor leading to a deviation from the typical aromaticity characteristics observed in benzene.},

However, its application is often hindered by the complexity of the calculation choices and the requirement of expertise in the field. Improper lambda scheme of RFEP may result in deviations from an accurate description of the perturbation process and is prone to erroneous affinity predictions. To address such challenges, an automated adaptive lambda method is proposed where the adaptive lambda schemes are obtained through a split-and-merge algorithm based on the pilot runs. The newly established workflow along with a series of improvements to the perturbation settings increases the consistency of the RFEP calculation results. Comparing the pilot and adaptive lambda schemes, the latter demonstrated improvements in convergence and reproducibility and lowered the mean unsigned error and the root-mean-square error. Overall, the adaptive lambda method is a reliable and robust choice to predict small molecule relative binding free energy and can be capitalized to benefit routine RFEP calculations for drug discovery projects.},

The research findings demonstrate remarkable consistency with the experimental outcomes reported in the existing literature pertaining to the studied compounds. However, this study unveils novel insights into the mechanical and optical characteristics of the doped structures, which have not been previously reported. The structural stability is rigorously examined through multiple stability criteria, encompassing structural optimization, tests of elastic stability, and enthalpy of formation calculations. Furthermore, the electronic and optical properties of the compounds exhibit exceptional improvements in conductivity and reflectivity as a result of the doping process. The band structure analysis reveals the presence of a Moss-Burstein shift. Investigation of the magnetic properties indicates an increase in the magnetic moment value due to the Fe-Mn degeneracy resulting from increased Mn content. Mechanical analysis of the elastic moduli B, G, and Y demonstrates an enhanced strength and metal-like conductivity, attributed to the induced anharmonicity. Moreover, the internal strain factor suggests a higher degree of bond flexibility, implying potential applications of these compounds in flexible electronics.},

The objective is to assess the TD-DFT for the simulation of pleochroism (change of color depending on the crystallographic direction of the observation) and the change of color as a function of the light source. For these simulations, we compared an embedding where dangling bonds are saturated by hydrogen atoms and an electrostatic embedding. The electrostatic embedding provided numerically more stable results and allowed a good reproduction of the pleochroism of cordierite, based on a Fe 2+ -Fe 3+ intervalence charge transfer transition. However, the pleochroism of alexandrite is not as well reproduced, suggesting that TD-DFT has some difficulties to reproduce the anisotropy of the transition dipole moment, an aspect that is not deeply documented in the literature.},

The choice and position of metal atoms in endohedrally doped C 80 derivatives largely affects the orientation of SAMO energies and wavefunction distributions. Among various derivatives, the Co-substituted C 80 constitutes the lowest SAMO energy. The charge transfer study infers the influence of metal atoms inside the cage on SAMO energies. At higher energies, p z -, 2 s -, and p xy - SAMO bands have been overlapped with higher dispersion bands which depict the increased intermolecular interaction in delocalized bands causing a larger dispersion.

  abstract     = {The inability of p-block elements to participate in π-backbonding restricts them from activating small molecules like CO, H 2 , and so forth. However, the development of the main group metallomimetics became a new pathway, where the main-group elements like boron can bind and activate small molecules like CO and H 2 . The concept of the frustrated Lewis pair, Boron–Boron multiple bonds, and borylene are previously illustrated. Some of these reported classes of boron species can mimic the jobs of the metal complexes. Hence, we have theoretically studied the binding of CO/N 2 molecules at B-center of elusive species like sila/germa boryne stabilized by donor base ligands (cAAC)B  E(Me)(L), where E  Si, L  cAAC Me , NHC Me , PMe 3 , E  Ge, L  cAAC Me and (NHC Me )B  E(Me)(cAAC Me )).

The computed bond dissociation energy and inner stability analyses by the EDA-NOCV method showed that the CO molecule can bind at the B-center of the above-mentioned species due to stronger σ-donor ability while binding of N 2 has been theoretically predicted to be weak. The energy barrier for the CO binding is estimated to be 13–14 kcal/mol by transition state calculation. The change of partial triple bond character to single bond nature of the B  Si bond and the bending of C  B  Si bond angle of sila-boryne species are the reason for the activation energy. Our study reveals the ability of such species to bind and activate the CO molecule to mimic the transition metal-containing complexes. We have additionally shown that binding of Fe(CO) 4 and Ni(CO) 3 is feasible at Si-center after binding of CO at the B-center.},

  abstract     = {The Poisson–Boltzmann equation is widely used to model electrostatics in molecular systems. Available software packages solve it using finite difference, finite element, and boundary element methods, where the latter is attractive due to the accurate representation of the molecular surface and partial charges, and exact enforcement of the boundary conditions at infinity. However, the boundary element method is limited to linear equations and piecewise constant variations of the material properties. In this work, we present a scheme that couples finite and boundary elements for the linearised Poisson–Boltzmann equation, where the finite element method is applied in a confined solute region and the boundary element method in the external solvent region. As a proof-of-concept exercise, we use the simplest methods available: Johnson–Nédélec coupling with mass matrix and diagonal preconditioning, implemented using the Bempp-cl and FEniCSx libraries via their Python interfaces. We showcase our implementation by computing the polar component of the solvation free energy of a set of molecules using a constant and a Gaussian-varying permittivity. As validation, we compare against well-established finite difference solvers for an extensive binding energy data set, and with the finite difference code APBS (to 0.5%) for Gaussian permittivities. We also show scaling results from protein G B1 (955 atoms) up to immunoglobulin G (20,148 atoms). For small problems, the coupled method was efficient, outperforming a purely boundary integral approach. For Gaussian-varying permittivities, which are beyond the applicability of boundary elements alone, we were able to run medium to large-sized problems on a single workstation. The development of better preconditioning techniques and the use of distributed memory parallelism for larger systems remains an area for future work. We hope this work will serve as inspiration for future developments that consider space-varying field parameters, and mixed linear-nonlinear schemes for molecular electrostatics with implicit solvent models.},

Prompted by these results, the CH 2 SO family of isomers has been investigated from an energetic point of view using a double-hybrid density functional in combination with a partially augmented triple-zeta basis set. This preliminary study showed that the most stable species of the family are the cis and trans forms of HC(O)SH and HC(S)OH. For their structural and spectroscopic characterization, a composite scheme based on coupled cluster (CC) calculations that incorporates up to the quadruple excitations and accounts for the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and core correlation effects has been employed. This approach opens to the prediction of rotational constants with an accuracy of 0.1%. A hybrid scheme, based on harmonic frequencies computed using the CC singles, doubles and a perturbative treatment of triples method (CCSD(T)) in conjunction with a quadruple-zeta basis set, allowed us to obtain fundamental vibrational frequencies with a mean absolute error of about 1%.},

If extracted from experiment, these structures often suffer from severe uncertainties, of which the lack of information on hydrogen atoms is a prominent example. Hence, experimental structures require careful review and curation, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Here, we present a fast and robust protocol for the automated structure analysis and pH-consistent protonation, in short, ASAP. For biomolecules as a target, the ASAP protocol integrates sequence analysis and error assessment of a given input structure. ASAP allows for p K a prediction from reference data through Gaussian process regression including uncertainty estimation and connects to system-focused atomistic modeling described in Brunken and Reiher ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 2020, 1646). Although focused on biomolecules, ASAP can be extended to other nanoscopic objects, because most of its design elements rely on a general graph-based foundation guaranteeing transferability. The modular character of the underlying pipeline supports different degrees of automation, which allows for (i) efficient feedback loops for human-machine interaction with a low entrance barrier and for (ii) integration into autonomous procedures such as automated force field parametrizations. This facilitates fast switching of the pH-state through on-the-fly system-focused reparametrization during a molecular simulation at virtually no extra computational cost.},

In our four-dimensional imaging technique, the protein conformational change was obtained using the two-dimensional protein images (the three-dimensional electron density maps used in previously proposed techniques were not used). The protein conformation for each two-dimensional protein image was obtained using our original protocol with molecular dynamics simulations. Using a manifold-learning technique and two-dimensional protein images, the protein conformations were arranged according to the conformational change of the protein. By arranging the protein conformations according to the arrangement of the protein images, four-dimensional imaging is constructed.

  abstract     = {Solvation effects profoundly influence the characteristics and behavior of chemical systems in liquid solutions. The interaction between solute and solvent molecules intricately impacts solubility, reactivity, stability, and various chemical processes. Continuum solvation models gained prominence in quantum chemistry by implicitly capturing these interactions and enabling efficient investigations of diverse chemical systems in solution. In comparison, continuum solvation models in condensed matter simulation are very recent. Among these, the self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) and the soft-sphere continuum solvation models (SSCS) have been among the first to be successfully parameterized and extended to model periodic systems in aqueous solutions and electrolytes. As most continuum approaches, these models depend on a number of parameters that are linked to experimental or theoretical properties of the solvent, or that can be tuned based on reference data. Here, we present a systematic parameterization of the SSCS model for over 100 nonaqueous solvents. We validate the model&#39;s efficacy across diverse solvent environments by leveraging experimental solvation-free energies and partition coefficients from comprehensive databases. The average root means square error over all the solvents was calculated as 0.85 kcal/mol which is below the chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). Similarly to what has been reported by Hille et al. ( J. Chem. Phys. 2019 , 150 , 041710.) for the SCCS model, a single-parameter model accurately reproduces experimental solvation energies, showcasing the transferability and predictive power of these continuum approaches. Our findings underscore the potential for a unified approach to predict solvation properties, paving the way for enhanced computational studies across various chemical environments.},

  abstract     = {Nanodiamonds (NDs) are unique carbonaceous materials with exceptionally high stability, hardness, and notable electronic properties. Their applications in photocatalysis, biomedicine, and energy materials are usually carried out in aqueous environments, where they interact with aqueous adsorbates. Especially, electron density may rearrange from the diamond material toward oxidative adsorbates such as oxygen, which is known as charge transfer doping. In this article, we quantify the charge transfer doping for NDs with inhomogeneous surface coverings (hydroxyl, fluorine, and amorphous carbon), as well as NDs doped with heteroatoms (B, Si, N) using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The transfer doping magnitude is largely determined by the NDs&#39; highest occupied molecular orbital energies, which can in turn be modified by the surface covering and doping. However, local modifications of the ND structures do not have any local effects on the magnitude of the charge transfer. We furthermore analyze the impact of aqueous adsorbates on the excited states of an aqueous ND in the context of photocatalysis via time-dependent DFT. Here, we find that the excited electrons are biased to move in the direction of the respective oxidative adsorbate. Surprisingly, we find that also unreactive species such as nitrous oxide may attract the excited electrons, which is probably due to the positive partial charge that is induced by the local N O solvation geometry.},

We have also performed similar calculations on simple polyacene analogs consisting only of hydrogen atoms and exhibiting electron delocalization in the framework. We find that the energetic cost of localizing the electrons in the polyacenes is roughly 60, 5 or 0.1 kJ/mol per ring atom for the two-, six- and ten-atom HILOs, respectively, and the use of these localized models overestimates the predicted hydrogenation energies of the acenes by roughly 50%, 4% and 0.1%, respectively. We conclude that the chemistry of polyacenes can be modeled well using highly localized descriptions of the electrons.},

When the exact exchange percentage varies from 0 to 100, the system is insulating when it exceeds 20. By reducing progressively the symmetry from cubic down to orthorhombic, the relative importance of the Jahn-Teller deformation and of the rotation of the octahedra is explored.},

The primary metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, equilibrates with the ring-open aldophosphamide that undergoes β -elimination to yield the therapeutically active DNA cross-linking phosphoramide mustard and the byproduct acrolein. The present paper presents a DFT investigation of the different metabolic phases and an insight into the mechanism by which CP exerts its cytotoxic action. A detailed computational analysis of the energy profiles describing all the involved transformations and the mechanism of DNA alkylation is given with the aim to contribute to an increase of knowledge that, after more than 60 years of unsuccessful attempts, can lead to the design and development of a new generation of oxazaphosphorines.},

However, the inert NN triple bond caused by its large HOMO-LUMO gap (10.8 eV) and high bond dissociation energy (945 kJ mol −1 ) renders its activation under mild conditions particularly challenging. Recent progress shows that a few main group species can mimic transition metal complexes to activate dinitrogen. Here, we demonstrate that a series of seven-electron (7e) boron-centered radical can be used to activate N 2 via density functional theory calculations. It is found that boron-centered radicals containing amine ligand perform best on the thermodynamics of dinitrogen activation. In addition, when electron-donating groups are introduced at the boron atom, these radicals can be used to activate N 2 with low reaction barriers. Further analysis suggests that the electron transfer from the boron atom to the π* orbitals of dinitrogen is essential for its activation. Our findings suggest great potential of 7e boron radicals in the field of dinitrogen activation.},

Our tutorial begins with the introduction of simple feedforward neural network (FNN) and kernel-based (using Gaussian process regression, GPR) models by fitting the two-dimensional Müller-Brown potential. Subsequently, two simple descriptors are presented for extracting features of molecular systems: symmetry functions (including the ANI variant) and embedding neural networks (such as DeepPot-SE). Lastly, these features will be fed into FNN and GPR models to reproduce the energies and forces for the molecular configurations in a Claisen rearrangement reaction.},

  abstract     = {Pyrazinamide, an antituberculosis but documented toxic drug, is subjected to computational investigation along with the metal complexes via a DFT approach to predict the structure–activity and structure-toxicity relationship. 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used for Zn, Ni, Mn, Fe, and Co, while the SDD basis set was applied to Cu, Cr, Cd, and Hg. Several reactivity parameters and charge distribution were calculated and the reactivity profile was estimated. The complexes were found to be soft and polarizable which could be responsible for their binding with bacterial targets to inhibit their growth. In contrast, pyrazinamide which is found to be hard among all is susceptible to being toxic. Moreover, the electronegative nature of the complexes can endow them with a better antibacterial effect. Since metal complexes have been found to be less toxic and more biologically interactive by computational methods, they can be employed as potent drugs for the cure of tuberculosis.},

  abstract     = {The development of the catalytic regio- and enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of 1,3-dienes remains a challenge and requires deep insight into the reaction mechanisms. We herein thoroughly studied the reaction mechanism of the Ni-catalyzed hydroalkylation of 1,3-dienes with ketones by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It reveals that the reaction is initiated by stepwise oxidative addition of EtO-H followed by 1,3-diene migratory insertion to generate the alkylnickel(II) intermediate, rather than the experimentally proposed ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) mechanism. In addition, we rationalized the role of t BuOK in the subsequent addition of enolate of ketone and transmetalation process. Based on the whole catalysis, the C  C reductive elimination step, turns out to be the rate- and enantioselectivity-determining step. Furthermore, we disclosed the origins of the regio- and enantioselectivity of the product, and found that the 1,2-selectivity lies in the combination effects of the ligand-substrate electrostatic interactions, orbital interactions and Pauli repulsions, while the enantioselectivity mainly arises from substrate-ligand steric repulsions. Based on mechanistic study, new biaryl bisphosphine ligands affording higher enantioselectivity were designed, which will help to improve current catalytic systems and develop new transition-metal-catalyzed hydroalkylations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the reactions of quadricyclane with dimethyl azodicarboxylate (DMAD) and of quadricyclane with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) in gas phase and in water environments were studied by a first-principles investigation within the framework of auxiliary density functional theory (ADFT). For these type of organic reactions is known that water is required to accelerate them. Since the reason of why this occur is still unknown, this work aims to gain insight into this reaction mechanism. For this investigation, the generalized gradient approximation as well as a hybrid functional were employed. The obtained optimized structures for the reactants, of the products and of the transition states are reported, together with the corresponding frequency analysis results and the reaction profiles. Along the proposed concerted reaction mechanism, a critical points search of the electron density and a charge analysis were performed. The calculated potential energy barriers of these reactions in gas phase and in water environments are compared. In agreement with experiment, the obtained results indicate that both reactions occur faster in water than in gas phase. This study shows that there is a change in the polarity of the two most important carbon atoms of the formed compounds along the reactions and that the decrease of the activation energy barrier which occurs in liquid phase in these reactions is because the structures of the main transition states are stabilized by the water environment. Therefore, the here obtained results demonstrate the important role played by the water-molecule framework into the activation energy barrier and structures of the molecules that participate in the DMAD and DEAD cycloaddition reactions.},

As a qualified measure of bond strength, we used local vibrational force constants k (FeN) based on local mode theory developed in our group. All calculations were performed with a hybrid QM/MM ansatz. Starting geometries were taken from available x-ray structures. k (FeN) values were correlated with FeN bond lengths and covalent bond character. We also investigated the stiffness of the axial NFeN bond angle. Our results highlight that protein effects are sensitively reflected in k (FeN), allowing one to compare trends in diverse protein groups. Moreover, k (NFeN) is a perfect tool to monitor changes in the axial heme framework caused by different protein environments as well as different Fe oxidation states.},

Computations show that, in gas phase, this ring-opening conversions to oxazolidinones initiates by coordinating a CO 2 molecule to the nitrogen atom of the aziridine. Then, a nucleophilic interaction between one oxygen atom of the coordinated CO 2 and the carbon atom of the aziridine occurs. For methyl substituted aziridine, two pathways are proposed leading either to 4-oxazolidinone or to 5-oxazolidinone. Besides, we show that the activation energy of this reaction reduces in aqueous solution, in the presence of a water molecule explicitly or NaBr catalyst. In addition, the corresponding reaction mechanisms and regioselectivity associated with this ring-opening conversions to oxazolidinones, in the presence of carbon dioxide are found to be influenced by solvent and catalyst. The present findings should allow better designing regioisomer oxazolidinones relevant for organic chemistry, medicinal and pharmacological applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, surface-hopping ab initio molecular dynamics (SH-AIMD) simulations have come to be used to discuss the mechanisms and dynamics of excited-state chemical reactions, including internal conversion and intersystem crossing. In dynamics simulations involving intersystem crossing, there are two potential energy surfaces (PESs) governing the motion of nuclei: PES in a spin-pure state and PES in a spin-mixed state. The former gives wrong results for molecular systems with large spin-orbit coupling (SOC), while the latter requires a potential gradient that includes a change in SOC at each point, making the computational cost very high. In this study, we systematically investigate the extent to which the magnitude of SOC affects the results of the spin-pure state-based dynamics simulations for the hydride MH 2 (M = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) by performing SH-AIMD simulations based on spin-pure and spin-mixed states. It is clearly shown that spin-mixed state PESs are indispensable for the dynamics simulation of intersystem crossing in systems containing elements Sn and Pb from the fifth period onward. Furthermore, in addition to the widely used Tully&#39;s fewest switches (TFS) algorithm, the Zhu-Nakamura (ZN) global switching algorithm, which is computationally less expensive, is applied to SH for comparison. The results from TFS- and ZN-SH-AIMD methods are in qualitative agreement, suggesting that the less expensive ZN-SH-AIMD can be successfully utilized to investigate the dynamics of photochemical reactions based on quantum chemical calculations.},

These studies have been facilitated by implementations which determine steady-state coverages and rates of mean-field micro-kinetic models. As implemented in the open-source kinetic modeling program, CatMAP, the conventional solution strategy is to use a root-finding algorithm to determine the coverage of all intermediates through the steady-state expressions, constraining all coverages to be non-negative and to properly sum to unity. Though intuitive, this root-finding strategy causes issues with convergence to solution due to these imposed constraints. In this work, we avoid explicitly imposing these constraints, solving the mean-field steady-state micro-kinetic model in the space of number of sites instead of solving it in the space of coverages . We transform the constrained root-finding problem to an unconstrained least-squares minimization problem, leading to significantly improved convergence in solving micro-kinetic models and thus enabling the efficient study of more complex catalytic reactions.},

The GFW transformation covers a wide range of transformations beyond the simple unitary transformation of the Dirac Hamiltonian, allowing for the systematic classification of all existing two-component methods. New two-component methods were also systematically derived based on the GFW transformation. These various two-component methods were applied to hydrogen-like and helium-like ions. Numerical errors in energy were evaluated and classified into four types: the one-electron Hamiltonian approximation, the two-electron operator approximation, the newly defined “picture difference error (PDE),” and the error in determining the transformation, and errors in multi-electron systems were discussed based on this classification.},

This study investigates peptide-induced spontaneous curvature δc 0 p in asymmetric bilayers consisting of a single lipid type and a peptide confined to one leaflet; δc 0 p is calculated from the Helfrich equation using the first moment of the lateral pressure tensor and an alternative expression using the differential stress. It is shown that differential stress introduced during initial system generation is effectively relaxed by equilibrating using P2 1 periodic boundary conditions, which allows lipids to switch leaflets across cell boundaries and equalize their chemical potentials across leaflets. This procedure leads to robust estimates of for the systems simulated, and is recommended when equality of chemical potentials between the leaflets is a primary consideration.},

SPANA applies the spatial decomposition of a large biological system to distribute structural and dynamical analyses into individual CPU cores, which reduces the computational time and the memory size, significantly.

Inspired by the fact that the dynamics of complex systems are always driven by rare but significant transition events, we herein propose a TS search method in accordance with the Q-learning algorithm. Appropriate reward functions are set for a given PES to optimize the reaction pathway through continuous trial and error, and then the TS can be obtained from the optimized reaction pathway. The validity of this Q-learning method with reasonable settings of Q -value table including actions, states, learning rate, greedy rate, discount rate, and so on, is exemplified in 2 two-dimensional potential functions. In the applications of the Q-learning method to two chemical reactions, it is demonstrated that the Q-learning method can predict consistent TS and reaction pathway with those by ab initio calculations. Notably, the PES must be well prepared before using the Q-learning method, and a coarse-to-fine PES scanning scheme is thus introduced to save the computational time while maintaining the accuracy of the Q-learning prediction. This work offers a simple and reliable Q-learning method to search for all possible TS and reaction pathway of a chemical reaction, which may be a new option for effectively exploring the PES in an extensive search manner.},

Potential energy curves suggest formation of an electrostatically bound complex that relaxes to a hydrogen-bonded contact ion-pair (HBCIP) which can decay yielding CH 2 F + Cl or to the ground state minimum of CH 2 FCl. The HBCIP has a dipole moment of 9.57 D, a CI wavefunction described as 0.65ionic + 0.20biradical and it is strongly bonded by 4.72 eV. Its H bond has characteristics of moderate and strong H bonds. The simulated absorption spectrum confirms the nσ* assignment for the first and suggests the n3s + n3p σ assignment for the second band.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical investigation on the cooperativity of a series of binary, ternary, and quaternary complexes interconnected by pnicogen bonds has been conducted using calculations at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level of density functional theory. By measuring changes in the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) at the nucleus of interacting atoms in all of the complexes, it is possible to quantify the substantial reorganization of the electron density triggered by the formation of pnicogen bonds. The positive change in MESP, indicating a loss of electron density from the donor molecule in a dimer, facilitates the acceptance of electron density from a third molecule, resulting in the formation of a ternary complex with a stronger pnicogen bond compared to the one present in the binary complex. Similarly, the acceptor molecule in a dimer with a negative change in MESP showed an enhanced tendency to donate electron density to an electron-deficient third molecule. The MESP analysis provided valuable insights into the donor/acceptor characteristics of pnicogen bonds within the quaternary complexes. The proposed MESP hypotheses are consistent with the positive cooperativity observed in the pnicogen-bonded clusters. To quantify the changes in MESP, both at the donor atom (Δ V donor ) and the acceptor atom (Δ V acceptor ), for all pnicogen bonds in the cluster, the total change in MESP (ΔΔ V n ) was measured as ΔΔ V n = ∑(Δ V donor )−∑(Δ V acceptor ). Remarkably, ΔΔ V n exhibited a strong linear relationship with the sum of the bond energies of the pnicogen bonds in the cluster. This establishes the MESP analysis as a robust approach for understanding the strength and cooperative behavior of pnicogen-bonded clusters. Additionally, the MESP features provided clear evidence of pnicogen bond formation, further supporting the reliability of this approach.},

The original benzene rings in the helicene backbone were replaced by heterocycles such as furan, thiophene, pyrrole, or phosphole to create [n]helicenes with n ranging from 4 to 7. The impact of the type, position, and number of heterocycles on the enantiomerization barrier was systematically evaluated. Notably, the enantiomerization barrier was found to be significantly dependent on the rotatory angle and the position of the heterocycles, particularly for [4, 5]helicenes. With less rotatory angle of heterocycle, the enantiomerization barrier of helicenes was revealed to be lower, while when the heterocycle was close to the central part of the helicene chain, the barrier was also lower. Furthermore, the number of thiophene rings also had a marked effect on enantiomerization, showing a decrease of the barrier with more thiophene rings placed on the helicenes backbone. We expect this work would deliver new perspective on the relative studies for the helicene conformational conversion.},

Small-sized CrMnSi n ( n = 4–9) clusters tend to adopt bipyramid-based geometries, while clusters with sizes n = 10 and 11 prefer to opening cage-like structures. For sizes n = 12 to 14, the half-encapsulated structures gradually transform into closed-cage Cr@Si n structures, with the Mn atom exposed outside. Starting from size 15, both the Cr and Mn atoms are completely encapsulated by silicon atoms. Meanwhile, the Cr and Mn atoms in smaller-sized CrMnSi n ( n = 4–7) clusters tend to be separated, while they prefer to stay together for larger sizes. Cr atom always acts as electron donor, but not for Mn atom. From the average binding energies, one can conclude that it is easier to form larger size clusters. Smaller and larger sized CrMnSi n ( n = 4–9 and 19–20) clusters prefer to exhibit ferromagnetic Cr–Mn coupling, while sizes n = 10–18 always exhibit ferrimagnetic state.

  abstract     = {Solubility is one of the most important properties of protein. Protein solubility can be greatly changed by single amino acid mutations and the reduced protein solubility could lead to diseases. Since experimental methods to determine solubility are time-consuming and expensive, in-silico methods have been developed to predict the protein solubility changes caused by mutations mostly through protein evolution information. However, these methods are slow since it takes long time to obtain evolution information through multiple sequence alignment. In addition, these methods are of low performance because they do not fully utilize protein 3D structures due to a lack of experimental structures for most proteins. Here, we proposed a sequence-based method DeepMutSol to predict solubility change from residual mutations based on the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), where the protein graph was initiated according to predicted protein structure from Alphafold2, and the nodes (residues) were represented by protein language embeddings. To circumvent the small data of solubility changes, we further pretrained the model over absolute protein solubility. DeepMutSol was shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in benchmark tests. In addition, we applied the method to clinically relevant genes from the ClinVar database and the predicted solubility changes were shown able to separate pathogenic mutations. All of the data sets and the source code are available at https://github.com/biomed-AI/DeepMutSol .},

  abstract     = {A prerequisite for the computational prediction of molecular properties like conformational energies of biomolecules is a reliable, robust, and computationally affordable method usually selected according to its performance for relevant benchmark sets. However, most of these sets comprise molecules in the gas phase and do not cover interactions with a solvent, even though biomolecules typically occur in aqueous solution. To address this issue, we introduce a with explicit water molecules solvated version of a gas-phase benchmark set containing 196 conformers of 13 peptides and other relevant macrocycles, namely MPCONF196 [J. Řezáč et al., JCTC 2018 , 14 , 1254–1266], and provide very accurate PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12b/AVQZ&#39; reference values. The novel solvMPCONF196 benchmark set features two additional challenges beyond the description of conformers in the gas phase: conformer–water and water–water interactions. The overall best performing method for this set is the double hybrid revDSDPBEP86-D4/def2-QZVPP yielding conformational energies of almost coupled cluster quality. Furthermore, some (meta-)GGAs and hybrid functionals like B97M-V and B97M-D with a large basis set reproduce the coupled cluster reference with an MAD below 1 kcal mol . If more efficient methods are required, the composite DFT-method r SCAN-3c (MAD of 1.2 kcal mol ) is a good alternative, and when conformational energies of polypeptides or macrocycles with more than 500–1000 atoms are in the focus, the semi-empirical GFN2-xTB or the MMFF94 force field (for very large systems) are recommended.},

Valence CASSCF (2s,2p) calculations incorporate nondynamical electron correlation in the calculations, while the corresponding multireference configuration interaction and coupled cluster calculations incorporate dynamical electron correlation. Treatment of nondynamical correlation is critical for properly describing the Li 2,3 +,0,− molecules as well as the Li − anion with dynamical correlation, in general, only fine-tuning the predictions. All lithium molecules and ions are bound, with the Li 3 + and Li 2 + ions being the most strongly bound, followed by Li 3 − , Li 2 , Li 2 − and Li 3 . The minimum energy structures of Li 3 +,0,− are, respectively, an equilateral triangle, an isosceles triangle, and a linear structure. The results of SCGVB calculations are analyzed to obtain insights into the nature of the bonding in these molecules. An important finding of this work is that interstitial orbitals, a concept first put forward by McAdon and Goddard in 1985, play an essential role in the bonding of all lithium molecules considered here except for Li 2 . The interstitial orbitals found in the Li 3 +,0 molecules likely give rise to the non-nuclear attractors/maxima observed in these molecules.},

A single mixed-valence (MV) molecule acts as an elementary QCA device known as a cell. Cells coupled locally via the electrostatic field form logic circuits. However, previously-synthesized ionic MV molecular cells are affected by randomly-located, nearby neutralizing counterions that can bias device states or change device characteristics, causing incorrect computational results. This ab initio study explores how non-biasing counterions affect individual molecular cells. Additionally, we model two novel neutral, zwitterionic MV QCA molecules designed to avoid biasing and other undesirable counterionic effects. The location of the neutralizing counterion is controlled by integrating one counterion into each cell at a well-defined, non-biasing location. Each zwitterionic QCA candidate molecule presented here has a fixed, integrated counterion, which neutralizes the mobile charges used to encode the device state.},

To achieve this goal, a data set was created, representing four bonding groups and various combinations of functionals and dispersion correction schemes. The calculations showed significant variation among the different functionals for the EDA terms, with the dispersion correction terms exhibiting the highest variability. More information was extracted by using machine learning in combination with dimensionality reduction on the data set. Results indicate that, despite the differences in the EDA terms obtained from different functionals, the functional has the least significant impact, suggesting minimal influence on the bonding interpretation.},

In this work, the activation mechanisms of CO 2 , i PrNCO, and i PrNCN i Pr by ( μ -Hydrido) diborane anion ( [1H] − ) have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Two different activation sites, B  B versus B  H bond of [1H] − , are investigated and compared. The results show that these inert molecules can be activated by [1H] − through cycloadditions under mild conditions. The reactions with i PrNCO and i PrNCN i Pr are dynamic and thermodynamic controlling, the obtained products are related not only to the energy barrier but also to the stability of the products. Moreover, the competition for B  B/B  H bond site activation is directly related to the steric effect of small molecules.

  abstract     = {Cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes are popular phosphorescent emitters with color-tunable emissions. To render their practical applications as organic light-emitting diodes emitters, it is required to develop Pt(II) complexes with high radiative decay rate constant and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield. Here, a general protocol is developed for accurate predictions of emission wavelength, radiative decay rate constant, and PL quantum yield based on the combination of first-principles quantum mechanical method, machine learning, and experimental calibration. A new dataset concerning phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters is constructed, with more than 200 samples collected from the literature. Features containing pertinent electronic properties of the complexes are chosen and ensemble learning models combined with stacking-based approaches exhibit the best performance, where the values of squared correlation coefficients are 0.96, 0.81, and 0.67 for the predictions of emission wavelength, PL quantum yield and radiative decay rate constant, respectively. The accuracy of the protocol is further confirmed using 24 recently reported Pt(II) complexes, which demonstrates its reliability for a broad palette of Pt(II) emitters.},

Molecular surface generators, which produce the discretized dielectric interfaces between solutes and solvents, are critical factors in determining the accuracy and efficiency of the PB solvers. In this work, we investigate the utility of the Eulerian Solvent Excluded Surface (ESES) software for rendering conjugated Eulerian and Lagrangian surface representations, which enables us to numerically validate and compare the quality of Eulerian PB solvers, such as the MIBPB solver, and the Lagrangian PB solvers, such as the TABI-PB solver. Furthermore, with the ESES software and its associated PB solvers, we are able to numerically validate an interesting and useful but often neglected source-target symmetric property associated with the linearized PB model.},

We use the Molecular Electron Density Theory at the MPWB1K/6-311G(d) level. We focus on the reaction mechanism, selectivity, solvent, and temperature effects. In addition, we perform topological analyses at the minimal and transition states to identify the intermolecular interactions. Electron Localization Function approach classifies the N-benzyl fluoro nitrone as zwitterionic (zw-) three-atom components (TACs), associated with a high energy barrier. The low polar character of the reaction is evaluated using the Conceptual Density Functional Theory analysis of the reactants, confirmed by the low global electron density transfer computed at the transition states. Computations show that these 32CA reactions follow a one-step mechanism under kinetic control, with highly asynchronous bond formation and no new covalent bond is formed at the TS. Besides, the potential energy surfaces along the reaction pathways in gas phase and in solvent are mapped. The corresponding Gibbs free energy profiles reveal that the exo -cycloadducts are kinetically and thermodynamically more favored than endo -cycloadducts, in agreement with the exo -selectivity observed experimentally. In particular, we found that solvent and temperature did not affect this selectivity and mainly influence the activation energies and the exothermic character of these 32CA reactions.},

In this article, we report an in-house developed software for automated hydrogen bond energy estimation (H-BEE) in large molecular clusters. This user-friendly software is essentially written in Python and executed on a Linux platform with the Gaussian package at the backend. Two approximations to the MTA-based procedure, viz. the first spherical shell (SS1) and the Fragments-in-Fragments (Frags-in-Frags), enabling cost-effective, automated evaluation of HB energies and cooperativity contributions, are also implemented in this software.

Analogously, one-electron energy densities higher than 800 Whkg −1 have been predicted for 626 molecules. Explicit calculations performed for certain materials show that at least 69 candidates with a two-electron energy density higher than 1300 Whkg −1 .

  abstract     = {At the beginning of the last century, multiple pandemics caused by influenza (flu) viruses severely impacted public health. Despite the development of vaccinations and antiviral medications to prevent and control impending flu outbreaks, unforeseen novel strains and continuously evolving old strains continue to represent a serious threat to human life. Therefore, the recently identified H10N7, for which not much data is available for rational structure-based drug design, needs to be further explored. Here, we investigated the structural dynamics of neuraminidase N7 upon binding of inhibitors, and the drug resistance mechanisms against the oseltamivir (OTV) and laninamivir (LNV) antivirals due to the crucial R292K mutation on the N7 using the computational microscope, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this study, each system underwent long 2 × 1 μs MD simulations to answer the conformational changes and drug resistance mechanisms. These long time-scale dynamics simulations and free energy landscapes demonstrated that the mutant systems showed a high degree of conformational variation compared to their wildtype (WT) counterparts, and the LNV-bound mutant exhibited an extended 150-loop conformation. Further, the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation and MM/GBSA free energy decomposition were used to characterize the binding of OTV and LNV with WT, and R292K mutated N7, revealing the R292K mutation as drug-resistant, facilitated by a decline in binding interaction and a reduction in the dehydration penalty. Due to the broader binding pocket cavity of the smaller K292 mutant residue relative to the wildtype, the drug carboxylate to K292 hydrogen bonding was lost, and the area surrounding the K292 residue was more accessible to water molecules. This implies that drug resistance could be reduced by strengthening the hydrogen bond contacts between N7 inhibitors and altered N7, creating inhibitors that can form a hydrogen bond to the mutant K292, or preserving the closed cavity conformations.},

In the present work, methane dissociation on the oxygen-preadsorbed transition metals including Au, Cu, Ni, Pt, and Pd is systemically studied by reactive force field (ReaxFF). The ReaxFF simulation results indicate that CH 4 molecules mainly undergo the direct dissociation on Ni, Pt, and Pd surfaces, while undergo the oxygen-assisted dissociation on Au and Cu surfaces. Additionally, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with the umbrella sampling are employed to study the free-energy changes of CH 4 dissociation, and the results further support the CH 4 dissociation pathway during the ReaxFF simulations. The present results based on ReaxFF and AIMD will provide a deeper dynamic understanding of the effects of pre-adsorbed oxygen species on the C  H bond activation compared to that of static DFT.},

Asymmetrically substituted indenotetracene molecules, given their potential application as n-type semiconductors in organic photovoltaic materials, are here investigated. Effects of substituents with different electron-donating characters are analyzed in terms of the overall electronic energy spacing and resulting ultrafast CT dynamics through linear response (LR-)TD-DFT and RT-TD-DFT based approaches. The combination of the computational techniques here employed provided direct access to the electronic density reorganization in time and to its spatial and rational representation in terms of molecular orbital occupation time evolution.

However, there is no observed correlation between the stability of the complex and the solvent donor number. Analysis of the charge transfer and Wiberg bond indices indicates a dative-bond character in all the complexes. The solvent effect assessed through solvation energy is determined by the change in the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and the change in the charge distribution that occurs during complex formation. It has been observed that the SASA and charge transfer are different in the different coordination numbers, resulting in a variation in the solvent effect on complex stability in different solvents. This ultimately leads to a change between the relative stability of complexes with different coordination numbers while increasing the solvent polarity for a few complexes. Moreover, the findings indicate a direct relationship between ΔΔ G (∆ G solvent -∆ G gas ) and Δ E solv , which enables the computation of ΔG for the compounds in a particular solvent using only Δ G gas and Δ E solv .

While ΔSCF and STS vary significantly depending on the functional used, the variation of shifted STS (2) is small, and all shifted STS (2) values are close to the observed ones. The deviations of the shifted STS (2) from the experiment are 0.24 eV (BH&amp;HLYP), 0.19 eV (B3LYP), and 0.23 eV (LC-BOP). These results further support the use of shifted STS methods for predicting the core ionization energies.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of catalytic reaction efficiency is one of the most intriguing and challenging applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms in chemistry. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy for utilizing ML protocols applied to Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) parameters to predict the ability of the A17 L47K catalytic antibody to covalently capture organophosphate pesticides. We found that the novel “composite” DFT functional B97-3c could be effectively employed for fast and accurate initial geometry optimization, aligning well with the input dataset creation. QTAIM descriptors proved to be well-established in describing the examined dataset using density-based and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The obtained clusters exhibited correlations with the chemical classes of the input compounds. The precise physical interpretation of the QTAIM properties simplifies the explanation of feature impact for both supervised and unsupervised ML protocols. It also enables acceleration in the search for entries with desired properties within large databases. Furthermore, our findings indicated that Ridge Regression with Laplacian kernel and CatBoost Regressor algorithms demonstrated suitable performance in handling small datasets with non-trivial dependencies. They were able to predict the actual reaction barrier values with a high level of accuracy. Additionally, the CatBoost Classifier proved reliable in discriminating between “active” and “inactive” compounds.},

  abstract     = {A pair of simulated left and right circularly polarized ultra-fast laser pulses of duration 20 femtoseconds that induce a mixture of excited states are applied to ethane. The response of the electron dynamics is investigated within the next generation quantum theory of atoms in molecules (NG-QTAIM) using third-generation eigenvector-trajectories which are introduced in this work. This enables an analysis of the mechanical and chiral properties of the electron dynamics of ethane without needing to subject the C-C bond to external torsions as was the case for second-generation eigenvector-trajectories. The mechanical properties, in particular, the bond-flexing and bond-torsion were found to increase depending on the plane of the applied laser pulses. The bond-flexing and bond-torsion, depending on the plane of polarization, increases or decreases after the laser pulses are switched off. This is explainable in terms of directionally-dependent effects of the long-lasting superpositions of excited states. The chiral properties correspond to the ethane molecule being classified as formally achiral consistent with previous NG-QTAIM investigations. Future planned investigations using ultra-fast circularly polarized lasers are briefly discussed.},

The electron density of all the neutral and charged systems investigated was analyzed using the QTAIM, ELF, and NBO approaches. The vertical ionization potential (IP) of the five stable tautomers of 1,2-ethenediol and the two stable tautomers of 1,1-ethenediol go from 11.81 to 12.27 eV, whereas the adiabatic ones go from 11.00 to 11.72 eV. The adiabatic ionization leads to a significant charge delocalization along the O-C-C-O skeleton. The most stable protonated form of ( Z )-1,2-ethenediol can be reached by the protonation of both the anti-anti and the syn-anti conformers, whereas the most stable deprotonated form arises only from the syn-anti one. Both charged species are extra-stabilized by the formation of an O-H···O intramolecular hydrogen bond (IHB) which is not found in the neutral system. ( Z )-1,2-ethenediol is predicted to be less stable, less basic, and more acidic than its cis -glycolaldehyde isomer. The most stable protonated species of ( E )-1,2-ethenediol comes from its syn-syn conformer, although the anti-anti conformer is the most basic one. Contrarily, the three conformers yield a common deprotonated species, so their acidity follows exactly their relative stability. Again, the ( E )-1,2-ethenediol is predicted to be less stable, less basic, and more acidic than its trans -glycolaldehyde isomer. Neither the neutral nor the protonated or the deprotonated forms of 1,1-ethenediol show the formation of any O-H···O IHB. The most stable protonated species is formed by the protonation of any of the two tautomers, but the most stable deprotonated form arises exclusively from the syn-anti neutral conformer. The conformers of 1,1-ethenediol are much less stable and significantly less basic than their isomer, acetic acid, and only slightly more acidic.},

In principle, its application is fairly straightforward, but can be tedious and involve a trial-and-error approach to identify and judge the best set of parameters. With the availability of quantum chemical methods to predict d-d transitions in transition metal complexes, a rich source of computational spectroscopic data with unambiguous assignments to electronic states is available. Herein, we present AOMadillo, a software package that is designed to interface the output of ab initio LFT calculations from the ORCA suite of programs and performs a least-squares fit for a chosen AOM parameterization. Many steps of the AOM parameterization are automated, so that scans of geometric parameters and evaluations of sets of similar complexes are convenient. The fitting routine is highly configurable, allowing the efficient evaluation of different parameter sets.},

We contrast these results with available experiments and reference fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results.

Triplet methylene exhibits a large-amplitude bending vibration and can reach a quasilinear configuration due to its low barrier (~2000 cm −1 ). To construct the ab initio PES, the Dunning&#39;s augmented correlation-consistent core-valence orbital basis sets were employed up to the sextuple-ζ quality [aug-cc-pCVXZ, X = T , Q, 5, and 6] combined with the single- and double-excitation unrestricted coupled cluster approach with a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [RHF-UCCSD(T)]. We have shown that the accuracy of the ab initio energies is further improved by including the corrections due to the scalar relativistic effects, DBOC and high-order electronic correlations. For the first time, all the available experimental rovibrational transitions were reproduced with errors less than 0.12 cm −1 , without any empirical corrections. Unlike more “traditional” nonlinear triatomic molecules, we have shown that even the energies of the ground vibrational state (000) with rather small rotational quantum numbers are strongly affected by the very pronounced rovibrational resonance interactions. Accordingly, the polyad structure of the vibrational levels of CH 2 and CD 2 was analyzed and discussed. The comparison between the energy levels obtained from the effective Watson A -reduced Hamiltonian, from the generating-function approach and from a variational calculation was given.},

The analysis involves studying the electronic structures of various ligands, such as phosphate, phosphonate, phosphinate, and phosphine oxide, as well as variations in their alkyl chain length, and their corresponding uranium complexes. The studies revealed a significant amount of destabilizing strain and steric repulsion for ligands having longer alkyl chains upon complexation. A considerable amount of stabilizing orbital and dispersion interactions compensate for these repulsions, forming stable complexes. Dispersion interactions become more significant upon chain elongation and are mainly responsible for the preference for U(VI) metal ions by ligands with lengthy alkyl chain units. The preference of phosphine oxide ligands for U(VI) is analyzed within the context of enhanced orbital interactions resulting from the energetically close donor (ligand) and acceptor (metal nitrate) orbitals. Additionally, dispersion-based interactions also become significant, especially with larger chain lengths. The electronegative environment around the phosphorus atom, along with the existence of low-dipole moment structures, is also examined in relation to their possible role in solvent extraction and their influence on the selectivity of ligands for uranyl species.},

  abstract     = {We studied the structural, electronic, phonon spectrum and thermoelectric properties of ternary LuMSb (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) half Heusler compounds by using first principles method. The electronic properties are calculated via energy band structure and density of states by using GGA + U approximation. The calculations reveal that the replacement of Ni with Pd and Pt, energy gap decreases and LuNiSb, LuPdSb are found to have narrow indirect band gaps and exhibit semiconducting nature, while LuPtSb is found to be a gapless semiconductor. Phonon band structure calculations give only positive values of phonon frequency indicating the dynamically stability of these compounds. The thermoelectric properties have been computed using semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We found high Seebeck coefficient (S) and high power factor (PF) for LuNiSb and LuPdSb compounds in the whole temperature range. The ZT values of LuNiSb and LuPdSb are high in general and reach a maximum of 0.67 and 0.69 at 450 K, respectively, whereas 0.39 is the maximum ZT value for LuPtSb at the same temperature. These findings propose LuNiSb and LuPdSb compounds as promising materials for thermoelectric applications at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {Multidrug resistance pathogens causing infections and illness remain largely untreated clinically. Efflux pumps are one of the primary processes through which bacteria develop resistance by transferring antibiotics from the interior of their cells to the outside environment. Inhibiting these pumps by developing efficient derivatives appears to be a promising strategy for restoring antibiotic potency. This investigation explores literature-reported inhibitors of E. coli efflux pump fusion proteins AcrB-AcrA and identify potential chemical derivatives of these inhibitors to overcome the limitations. Using computational and structure-guided approaches, a study was conducted with the selected inhibitors (AcrA:25-AcrB:59) obtained by data mining and their derivatives (AcrA:857-AcrB:3891) to identify their inhibitory effect on efflux pump using virtual screening, molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The finding indicates that Compound 2 (ZINC000072136376) has shown better binding and a significant inhibitory effect on AcrA, while Compound 3 (ZINC000072266819) has shown stronger binding and substantial inhibition effect on both non-mutant and mutated AcrB subunits. The identified derivatives could exhibit a better inhibitor and provide a potential approach for restoring the actions of resistant antibiotics.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we have revisited the aromaticity of benzyne isomers at the unrestricted density functional theory level (UDFT) using the energetic, magnetic, and delocalization criteria. In addition, this last criterion has also been analyzed employing complete active space (CASSCF) calculations. The results show conservation of aromaticity in these monocycles. Additionally it is observed that this trend is maintained in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives such as biradical didehydrophenanthrenes. Do these results imply a violation of Baird&#39;s rule? The answer is No, because this conservation in aromaticity is due to the loss of hydrogen atoms affects only the electronic σ skeleton and exerts a minor influence on the π cloud. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative stability of benzyne isomers and their relationship with experimental Δ E S-T values. According to the literature, the stability of the benzynes in the singlet state is due to an effective interaction between the electrons of the biradical centers; however, this effect is completely reversed in the triplet state, which explains why the para isomer has the lowest Δ E S-T gap.},
