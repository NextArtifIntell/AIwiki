  abstract     = {Abstract In recent years, the internet and smart devices have developed rapidly. Many people no longer rely on newspapers, magazines, or television to receive news. They can see the latest news using computers or mobile phones. According to a study by the Taiwan Internet Information Center, nearly 90% of Taiwanese people have used the internet. Many online streaming services have emerged, and people can easily watch movies and TV programs through computers or mobile phones. Hence, some websites use digital copyright management mechanisms to protect videos from being directly downloaded. However, 30% of websites use AES-128 encryption to protect their content. If the key access mechanism is not well protected, the encryption methodology may be useless. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-platform digital copyright management mechanism for adaptive streaming. With this mechanism, users do not need to download additional applications, as the mechanism implements Web-Assembly language through the browser.},

This paper presents a refined reputation-based lightweight consensus mechanism (LRBCM) tailored for IIoT&#39;s distributed network structures. Leveraging node reputation values, LRBCM streamlines ledger consensus, minimizing communication overhead and complexity. Comparative experiments show LRBCM outperforms competing mechanisms. It maintains higher throughput as the number of participating nodes increases and achieves a throughput approximately 10.78% higher than ReCon. Moreover, runtime analysis demonstrates LRBCM&#39;s scalability, surpassing ReCon by approximately 12.79% with equivalent nodes and transactions. In addition, as a combination of LRBCM, the proposed distributed lightweight authentication mechanism (ELAM) is rigorously evaluated against the security of various attacks, and its resilience is confirmed. Experiments show that ELAM has good efficiency while maintaining high security.},

However, in many scenarios, the entities may not be fully annotated, leading to serious performance degradation. To address this issue, the authors propose a robust NER approach that combines a novel PU-learning algorithm and negative sampling. Unlike many existing studies, the proposed method adopts a two-step procedure for handling unlabeled entities, thereby enhancing its capability to mitigate the impact of such entities. Moreover, this algorithm demonstrates high versatility and can be integrated into any token-level NER model with ease. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on several classic NER models and datasets, demonstrating its strong ability to handle unlabeled entities.

  abstract     = {Abstract Under the premise of ensuring data privacy, traditional network intrusion detection (NID) methods cannot achieve high accuracy for different types of intrusions. A NID method combining transformer and federated learning (FedL) is proposed for this purpose. First, a multi-party collaborative learning framework was built based on FedL, which achieved data exchange and sharing. Then, by introducing the self-attention mechanism (AttM) to improve the traditional transformer, it could quickly converge. Finally, an NID model integrating transformer and FedL was constructed by combining DNN, GRU, and an encoder module composed of improved transformer, achieving accurate detection of network intrusion. The proposed NID method was compared with the other three methods. The results show that the proposed method has the highest NID accuracy and F1 score on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 dataset, with the highest accuracy reaching 99.65% and 89.25%, while the F1 score has the highest accuracy, reaching 99.45% and 88.13%, outperforming the other three comparative algorithms in terms of performance.},

The research through random sampling survey analyzes survey data from 572 farmers and herders in the Kubuqi Desert region of Inner Mongolia using structural equation modeling and mediation analysis, based on the TPB. The aim is to understand the paradoxical willingness and behavior of farmers and herders to participate in desert management. The study found that farmers and herders&#39; willingness to participate is a crucial factor that influences their behavior.

Therefore, an MSA method based on hierarchical adaptive feature fusion network is proposed. Firstly, RoBERTa, ResViT, and LibROSA are used to extract different modal features and construct a layered adaptive multi-modal fusion network. Then, the multi-modal feature extraction module and cross-modal feature interaction module are combined to realize the interactive fusion of information between modes. Finally, an adaptive gating mechanism is introduced to design a global multi-modal feature interaction module to learn the unique features of different modes. The experimental results on three public data sets show that the proposed method can make full use of multi-modal information, outperform other advanced comparison methods, improve the accuracy and robustness of sentiment analysis, and is expected to achieve better results in the field of sentiment analysis.},

Many existing KGC methods utilize the multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHA) in transformers, which yields favorable results in low-dimensional space. Nevertheless, employing MHA introduces the risk of overfitting due to a large number of additional parameters, and the choice of model loss function is not comprehensive enough to capture the semantic discriminatory nature between entities and relationships and the treatment of RDF indicates that the dataset contains only positive (training) examples, and the error facts are not encoded, which tends to cause overgeneralization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Table tennis is a popular sport around the world. A key technology in table tennis education and analysis system is reconstructing the trajectory of the fast-moving ball from videos. Typically the table tennis ball is too small and barely visible in the video, making it difficult to be recognized directly by detection models like YOLO. However, table tennis balls usually has obvious motion features, which are usually not found in similar false targets. It inspired the authors to first find all candidate targets and then use the motion features of table tennis ball to select them out. In this article, the authors propose a tree-based algorithm named T-FORT to track the ball and reconstruct its trajectory. Specifically, they consider all the possible objects in a tree-framework, and identify the real target by integrating visual features and moving patterns. The authors conduct a set of experiments on three datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more precise than existing algorithms, and is robust in various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Aspect-based sentiment analysis is the key to natural language processing, and it focuses on the polarity of emotions associated with specific text aspects. Traditional models that combine text and visual data tend to ignore the deeper interconnections between patterns. To solve this problem, the authors propose a multimodal sentiment-oriented analysis (BiCCM-ABSA) model based on bidirectional complementary correlation. The model utilizes text-image synergy through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism to align text with image features. With the transformer architecture, it is not only a simple fusion, but also ensures the complex alignment of multi-modal features and gating mechanisms. Experiments were conducted on the Twitter-15 and Twitter-17 datasets, achieving 69.28 accuracy and 67.54% F1 score, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of BiCCM-ABSA, the bidirectional approach of the model and the effective cross-modal correlation set a new benchmark in the field of multimodal emotion recognition, providing insights beyond traditional single-modal analysis.},

The method&#39;s effectiveness and performance are evaluated on our video datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods on precision performance metrics. The error screening algorithm improves precision score to nearly 1.

To improve multi-scale feature aggregation, the model integrates a channel information compression and linear mapping (CLM) module into its feature pyramid architecture. Moreover, the optimization of training and inference performance is achieved by employing RepVGG blocks between the main computational modules of the model. Experimental data reveal that the enhanced YOLOv7-tiny model achieves a 31.7% faster inference speed and marginal gains of 0.7% in mAP@0.5 and 0.5% in mAP@0.5:0.95 over the original.

In detail, the proposed model incorporates the emotional attributes into the soft prompt by using the NRC emotion intensity lexicon and updates the additional parameters while freezing the language model. Then, it steers the generation toward a given emotion by calculating the cosine distance between the affective soft prompt and the candidate tokens generated by the language model.

By analyzing and utilizing the abundant sentimental interaction information, one can not only more precisely identify the communities, but also discover the interesting interactions and conflicts between these communities. Based on this concept, the authors propose a new Community Sentiment Diffusion Detection Model (CSDD), which utilizes sentimental information embedded in forward posts. Furthermore, the authors present an efficient variational algorithm for model inference. The community detection results have been verified on two large Twitter datasets.

To address the above issues, a secure trusted authentication scheme based on semantic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and blockchain is proposed for IoT applications. The attribute-based access control model is optimized, combining blockchain technology with access control models, effectively improving the robustness and credibility of access control systems. Semantic LSTM is used to predict environmental attributes that can further restrict user access and dynamically meet the minimum permission granting requirements. Experiments show that when the number of certificates is 60, the computational overhead of the proposed method is only 203s, which is lower than other state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, the performance of the proposed schema in information security protection in IoT environments shows promise as a scalable authentication solution for IoT applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Fast and accurate segmentation is important for robot judgement, e.g. robot detection, segmentation, and control. Most researchers have focused on deploying lightweight semantic segmentation models into robot services. The problem is that the critical interaction between semantic segmentation and boundaries is ignored. In this chapter, the authors propose a lightweight parallel execution model (EPSSNet) based on semantic flow branch (SFB), edge flow branch (EFB) and self-adapting weighting fusion (SAWF) for mobile robot service projects. The semantic flow branching module is used to obtain accurate object shape features. The boundary constraint module uses multiple convolution and upsampling to distinguish boundary features from semantic features. In order to adaptively fuse boundary features with semantic segmentation features, the SAWF is proposed. It adaptively fuses semantic and boundary features by learning boundary and semantic feature fusion weights. Detailed experimental results on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20k datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.},

To address these issues, we employ slicing techniques to reduce the interference of extraneous code on the detection process, apply normalisation techniques to eliminate the differences between different compiler versions and use particle swarm optimisation algorithms to determine the similarity between contracts, thus improving the accuracy and efficiency of detection. In addition, we combine a variety of features such as static analysis, dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to gain a more comprehensive understanding of contract characteristics and behaviours for more accurate vulnerability identification.

By introducing controllable absorption distance and neighborhood learning mechanism, MOEA/D-BH can deal with high-dimension parameters well in a multi-objective optimization problem. Thus, in a limited design space, a satisfied antenna can be optimized by proposed scheme efficiently. This can be a feasible candidate scheme for MIMO antenna design. A single-band and dual-band MIMO antenna, which are applied for semantic-based mobile system, are optimized by proposed scheme sharing the same model. Both the data of simulation and measurement show good electrical and MIMO performances in the working frequency band. Thus not only the performance of the semantic communication definitely improved, but also it provides useful exploration for the development of intelligent semantic mobile systems.},

But generating music that resonates emotionally is a challenge. Therefore, we introduce a new framework called the Sequence-to-Music Transformer Framework for Music Generation. This framework employs a simple encoder-decoder Transformer to model music by transforming its fundamental notes into a sequence of discrete tokens. The model learns to generate this sequence token by token. The encoder extracts melodic features of the music, while the decoder uses these extracted features to generate the music sequence. Generation is performed in an auto-regressive manner, meaning the model generates tokens based on previously observed tokens. Music melodic features are integrated into the decoder through cross-attention layers, and the generation process concludes when “end” is generated. The experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of datasets.},

For the update and maintenance of boundary regions, we can also continuously extract richer information from the boundary, make more elaborate plans, and develop an incremental method to detect locally updated maps within the boundary. The fire point can be independently and quickly identified through deep learning to extinguish the fire accurately. Assuming that the system incorrectly identifies 2 out of 80 non-fire sources as fire sources, so the results indicate a precision of about 88%, a recall of 90%.

The network includes a coarse-grained anomaly detection module, a multi-scale channel attention module, and a fine-grained detection module. The coarse-grained module identifies abnormal regions, serving as the initial filter. The multi-scale channel attention module focuses on anomalous features, enhancing sensitivity to fine-grained characteristics. This step overcomes limitations in discerning subtle yet critical anomalies. The fine-grained detection module refines feature maps, enhancing generalization.

This method merges feature maps of the same size from different stages to introduce richer feature information. Specifically, we introduce a pixel-level Triplet Global Attention (TGA) module to enhance feature representation and perceptual range. Additionally, we introduce a Differential Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which optimizes features between similar nodes for filtering. This series of operations helps the model focus more on discriminative features, ultimately improving pedestrian detection performance.

  abstract     = {Abstract In this work, a simple yet robust neighboring-aware hierarchical-based clustering approach (NHC) is developed. NHC employs its dynamic technique to take into account the surroundings of each point when clustering, making it extremely competitive. NHC offers a straightforward design and reliable clustering. It comprises two key techniques, namely, neighboring- aware and filtering and merging. While the proposed neighboring-aware technique helps find the most coherent clusters, filtering and merging help reach the desired number of clusters during the clustering process. The NHC&#39;s performance, which includes all evaluation metrics and run time, has been thoroughly tested against nine clustering rivals using four similarity measures on several real-world numerical and textual datasets. The evaluation is done in two phases. First, we compare NHC to three common clustering methods and show its efficacy through empirical analysis. Second, a comparison with six relevant, contemporary competitors highlights NHC&#39;s extremely competitive performance.},

Although the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), based on web semantics, excels at capturing global features and efficiently performs in stock trend prediction, it does not consider the issue of declining prediction performance caused by the changing distribution of stock data over time (concept drift phenomenon). Accordingly, this work introduces the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into the prediction model to leverage its ability to effectively capture local features. Additionally, local features are combined with global features to obtain a comprehensive set of feature information. Lastly, the model processes new data in real-time, continuously learns new knowledge, updates model parameters, and effectively addresses the decline in model performance caused by concept drift. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other models indicating its ability to efficiently perform well in stock trend prediction.},

The efficiency and the working statistics of such DMV could also be sufficiently monitored through semantic techniques.

This study presents a novel approach for extracting abandoned cropland using NDVI time series from Sentinel-2 satellite images, exploiting the difference in vegetation phenology between abandoned and cultivated croplands. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm was used to determine the similarity between NDVI time-series curves of different cropland types. The similarity metrics were used to find the optimal NDVI threshold for abandoned cropland through F1-score evaluation. The method&#39;s overall accuracy is 92.4%, higher than comparison methods at 84.60% and 75.6%. The approach captures year-round vegetation changes, expands time dimension data, and improves accuracy. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed decreased patch size, increased shape complexity, and more dispersed distribution of abandoned cropland over time. Major factors were proximity to settlements, roads, water bodies.},

Additionally, it analyzes decision-makers (DMs) as a social network to alleviate individual biases. IT2FSs are chosen to handle uncertainties in assessing industrial energy consumption. Addressing biases in DMs&#39; opinions, a group consensus model aids the consensus reaching process (CRP). Industrial energy consumption is assessed using the MULTIMOORA method, yielding three results. These are fused via D-S evidence theory (DSET) to obtain the final assessment. Finally, the model&#39;s effectiveness is verified with a case study on energy consumption in the steel industry. In conclusion, this paper not only deepens the understanding of uncertainties in the energy consumption assessment process, but also provides a robust tool for various industries to optimize energy use and economic outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Facial expression recognition (FER) is of great value in affective computing. Currently, many FER models have difficulty distinguishing between primary and secondary features. To this end, we propose a FER model based on the semantic bottleneck attention module (BAM). The improvement is that the input image is processed through two branches. BAM uses spatial attention to construct feature maps that can highlight important feature areas and suppress secondary features. The moving flipped bottleneck convolution (MBConv) module introduces random depth, reducing training time and improving model performance. Random depth enables the model to reduce the risk of overfitting during training by randomly skipping some layers. Global average pooling replaces the fully connected layer and compresses the entire feature map (FM) into numerical values to obtain high-purity image features. Through experiments on Extended Cohn-Kanade, Static Facial Expressions in the Wild, and Real-world Affective Faces Database CK+, SFEW, and RAFDB databases, the accuracy of our model reaches 98.33%, 61.14%, and 89.43% respectively, which is better than the other three advanced comparison methods.},

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for intelligently identifying chronic atrophic gastritis directly from high-resolution endoscopic images. Specifically, we design a two-stage network that emulates the diagnostic workflow of clinical experts, which first localizes the lesion area to downscale the high-resolution image and then applies a patch-based magnification technique to detect finer pathological features. On a real clinical cases dataset, our method achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 94.08%, with specificity and precision of 96.86% and 96.28%, respectively.

The impact of investor sentiment on short trading volume is multifaceted and varies depending on the scenario. Further analysis suggests that investor sentiment and stock market volatility can reinforce each other in bull markets.

The experimental results indicate that the model fusion strategy significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis. Notably, the stacking fusion strategy outperforms the others in recognizing complex fault patterns.

  abstract     = {Abstract In the context of globalization and intense market competition, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) have become a common strategy for enterprises to expand and transform. However, goodwill issues in M&amp;A are increasingly concerning. Traditional goodwill impairment prediction models face drawbacks like reliance on precise predictions, large datasets, complexity, poor interpretability, high computational costs, and data acquisition difficulties. This paper proposes a prediction model based on an improved Mamba algorithm. By processing financial data from listed companies in the CSMAR database, the model constructs lagged and rolling statistical features to reflect performance trends. The Mamba algorithm dynamically adjusts input parameters through a Selective State-Space Model (SSM), capturing dependencies in long-sequence data and improving prediction accuracy and timeliness. Experimental results show the Mamba algorithm excels in handling long-sequence data, offering valuable guidance for financial management and risk control.},

Safety in NPPs is more dependent on team performance than individual, and reducing team errors requires identifying key causative factors and chains. Current studies primarily use qualitative analysis whereas lacking quantitative methods. This study addressed this by constructing a complex network model of team error based on semantic features and coding of the Semantic Web and determining criteria for selecting key causative factors by three node failure strategies. The top 5 team error key PSFs and top 5 high-risk causative chains were identified in the results. Finally, a set of control strategies was proposed further. This research can guide identifying key causative factors which could be a good starting point to scrutinize the team performance and establish control strategies for team error in NPPs.},

The attention mechanism solves the limitations, but the detection effect for small target detection and occluded object detection is not good. In order to solve the above problems, a target detection method based on attention pyramid information fusion (APIFNet) is proposed. It consists of Dynamic Pyramid Attention Fusion Module (DPAF) and Attention Semantic Contextual Information Module (ACM). First, the DPAF module fuses information at different scales and simultaneously guides the learning of low-level features by high-level features to enhance semantic information and spatial details. Then, in order to detect small targets and occluded objects, the ACM module effectively enhances the detection ability of small targets by emphasizing the importance of foreground contextual semantic information and suppressing unimportant semantic information. Ultimately, APIFNet outperforms other methods in terms of evaluation performance on the COCO and PASCAL VOC data sets.},

An efficient AI-driven Semantic Web method for phishing detection enhancement is presented in this work. The approach uses the Chi-square feature selection approach along with the Adaptive Differential Evolution with Optional External Archive (JADE) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Having grown up on a large collection of more than 11,000 webpages, the model attained 93% accuracy. Although alternative models sometimes exceeded it in accuracy, the suggested method always showed the lowest loss values throughout all epochs, therefore stressing its stability and efficiency. Comparative study using conventional models confirms its resilience against phishing attacks for protecting e-commerce systems.},

However, a significant challenge remains in detecting obscene information in obscure scenarios, like indecent behavior occurring while wearing normal clothing, causing significant negative impacts, such as harmful influence on children. To address this issue, an innovative multi frame obscene video detection base on ViT is proposed by this manuscript per the authors, aiming to automatically detect and filter obscene content in videos. Extensive experiments conducted on the public NPDI dataset demonstrate that this method achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving 96.2%. Additionally, it achieves satisfactory classification accuracy on a dataset of obscure obscene videos.This provides a powerful tool for future video censorship and protects minors and the general public.},

Previous works frequently face challenges in integrating heterogeneous data without fully leveraging the rich semantic content of text, resulting in poor information association. We propose an MSA model based on Text-Driven Crossmodal Fusion and Mutual Information Estimation, called TeD-MI, which comprises a Stacked Text-Driven Crossmodal Fusion (STDC) module, which efficiently fusions the three modalities driven by the text modality to optimize fusion feature representation and enhance semantic understanding. Furthermore, TeD-MI designed a mutual information estimation module to achieve the best balance between preserving task-related information and filtering out irrelevant noise information as much as possible. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate our proposed model achieves varying degrees of improvement across most evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems has drawn significant attention. Most work focuses on white-box methods, but the assumption of full transparency of model architecture and parameters is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. Although several targeted black-box attack methods have been proposed in recent years, due to the complexity of ASR systems, they primarily rely on query-based approaches with limited search capabilities, leading to low success rates and noticeable noise. To address this, we propose DE-gradient, a new black-box approach using differential evolution (DE), a population-based search algorithm. Inspired by Semantic Web ideas, we introduce modulation noise to preserve semantic coherence while enhancing imperceptibility. In experiments on two public datasets, DE-gradient improved attack success rates by 19% and increased the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of silent parts from 27 dB to 54 dB, establishing a strong baseline for evaluating black-box adversarial attacks in ASR systems.},
