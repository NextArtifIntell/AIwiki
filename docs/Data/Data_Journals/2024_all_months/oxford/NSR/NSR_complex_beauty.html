To bridge the data gap and assess ecosystem responses, we compiled and compared a mercury accumulation database from peat, lake, ice and marine deposits worldwide with atmospheric mercury deposition modelled by GEOS-Chem, focusing on trends, magnitudes, spatial–temporal distributions and impact factors. The mercury fluxes in all four deposits showed a 5- to 9-fold increase over 1700–2012, with lake and peat mercury fluxes that generally mirrored atmospheric deposition trends. Significant decreases in lake and peat mercury fluxes post-1950 in Europe evidenced effective environmental policies, whereas rises in East Asia, Africa and Oceania highlighted coal-use impacts, inter alia . Conversely, mercury fluxes in marine and high-altitude ecosystems did not align well with atmospheric deposition, emphasizing natural influences over anthropogenic impacts. Our study underscores the importance of these key regions and ecosystems for future mercury management.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the multimodal large language model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful large language models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of the MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and optical character recognition–free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even outperform GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First, we present the basic formulation of the MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including multimodal in-context learning, multimodal chain of thought and LLM-aided visual reasoning. To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions.},

  abstract     = {Lipid droplets (LDs) are the major sites of lipid and energy homeostasis. However, few LD biogenesis proteins have been identified. Using model microalga Chlamydomonas , we show that ABHD1, an α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein, is localized to the LD surface and stimulates LD formation through two actions: one enzymatic and one structural. The knockout mutants contained similar amounts of triacylglycerols (TAG) but their LDs showed a higher content of lyso-derivatives of betaine lipid diacylglyceryl- N,N,N -trimethylhomoserine (DGTS). Over-expression of ABHD1 increased LD abundance and boosted TAG content. Purified recombinant ABHD1 hydrolyzed lyso-DGTS, producing a free fatty acid and a glyceryltrimethylhomoserine. In vitro droplet-embedded vesicles showed that ABHD1 promoted LD emergence. Taken together, these results identify ABHD1 as a new player in LD formation by its lipase activity on lyso-DGTS and by its distinct biophysical property. This study further suggests that lipases targeted to LDs and able to act on their polar lipid coat may be interesting tools to promote LD assembly in eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract     = {Although adeno-to-squamous transition (AST) has been observed in association with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in clinic, its causality, molecular mechanism and overcoming strategies remain largely unclear. We here demonstrate that squamous transition occurs concomitantly with TKI resistance in PC9-derived xenograft tumors. Perturbation of squamous transition via DNp63 overexpression or knockdown leads to significant changes in TKI responses, indicative of a direct causal link between squamous transition and TKI resistance. Integrative RNA-seq, ATAC-seq analyses and functional studies reveal that FOXA1 plays an important role in maintaining adenomatous lineage and contributes to TKI sensitivity. FOXM1 overexpression together with FOXA1 knockout fully recapitulates squamous transition and TKI resistance in both PC9 xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of RAPGEF3 combined with EGFR TKI efficiently overcomes TKI resistance, especially in RAPGEF3 high PDXs. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into squamous transition and therapeutic strategy to overcome EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer.},

Herein we report an in-situ grazing incidence wide-angle/small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS/GISAXS) screening that reveals the fact that naphthalene derived solid additives can suppress the aggregation of the polymer acceptor (PY-IT) at the beginning stage of spin coating, which provides sufficient time and space for the polymer donor (PM6) to form the fibril structure. Moreover, guided by this knowledge, a ternary all-polymer system is proposed, which achieves cutting-edge level PCEs for both small-area (0.04 cm 2 ) (also decent operational stability) and large-area (1 cm 2 ) devices.},

  abstract     = {In 2023, the CO 2 growth rate was 3.37 ± 0.11 ppm at Mauna Loa, which was 86% above that of the previous year and hit a record high since observations began in 1958, while global fossil fuel CO 2 emissions only increased by 0.6% ± 0.5%. This implies an unprecedented weakening of land and ocean sinks, and raises the question of where and why this reduction happened. Here, we show a global net land CO 2 sink of 0.44 ± 0.21 GtC yr −1 , which is the weakest since 2003. We used dynamic global vegetation models, satellite fire emissions, an atmospheric inversion based on OCO-2 measurements and emulators of ocean biogeochemical and data-driven models to deliver a fast-track carbon budget in 2023. Those models ensured consistency with previous carbon budgets. Regional flux anomalies from 2015 to 2022 are consistent between top-down and bottom-up approaches, with the largest abnormal carbon loss in the Amazon during the drought in the second half of 2023 (0.31 ± 0.19 GtC yr −1 ), extreme fire emissions of 0.58 ± 0.10 GtC yr −1 in Canada and a loss in Southeast Asia (0.13 ± 0.12 GtC yr −1 ). Since 2015, land CO 2 uptake north of 20°N had declined by half to 1.13 ± 0.24 GtC yr −1 in 2023. Meanwhile, the tropics recovered from the 2015–2016 El Niño carbon loss, gained carbon during the La Niña years (2020–2023), then switched to a carbon loss during the 2023 El Niño (0.56 ± 0.23 GtC yr −1 ). The ocean sink was stronger than normal in the equatorial eastern Pacific due to reduced upwelling from La Niña&#39;s retreat in early 2023 and the development of El Niño later. Land regions exposed to extreme heat in 2023 contributed a gross carbon loss of 1.73 GtC yr −1 , indicating that record warming in 2023 had a strong negative impact on the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate climate change.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric CO 2 growth rate (CGR), reflecting the carbon balance between anthropogenic emissions and net uptake from land and ocean, largely determines the magnitude and speed of global warming. The CGR at Mauna Loa Baseline Observatory reached a record high in 2023. We quantified major components of the global carbon balance for 2023, by developing a framework that integrated fossil fuel CO 2 emissions data and an atmospheric inversion from the Global ObservatioN-based system for monitoring Greenhouse GAses (GONGGA) with two artificial intelligence (AI) models derived from dynamic global vegetation models. We attributed the record high CGR increase in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily to the large decline in land carbon sink (1803 ± 197 TgC year −1 ), with minor contributions from a small reduction in ocean carbon sink (184 TgC year −1 ) and a slight increase in fossil fuel emissions (24 TgC year −1 ). At least 78% of the global decline in land carbon sink was contributed by the decline in tropical sink, with GONGGA inversion (1354 TgC year −1 ) and AI simulations (1578 ± 666 TgC year −1 ) showing similar declines in the tropics. We further linked this tropical decline to the detrimental impact of El Niño-induced anomalous warming and drying on vegetation productivity in water-limited Sahel and southern Africa. Our successful attribution of CGR increase within a framework combining atmospheric inversion and AI simulations enabled near-real-time tracking of the global carbon budget, which had a one-year reporting lag.},

  abstract     = {Cu-based materials can produce hydrocarbons in CO 2 electroreduction (CO 2 RR), but their stability still needs to be enhanced particularly in acidic media. Metallic Pt is highly stable in both acidic and alkaline media, yet rarely utilized in CO 2 RR, due to the competitive activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this research, abundant thionine (Th) molecules are stably confined within Pt nanocrystals via a molecular doping strategy. The Pt surface is successfully modulated by these Th molecules, and thereby the dominant HER activity is converted to CO 2 RR activity. CO 2 could be electroreduced to CH 4 using organic molecule-modified Pt-based catalysts for the first time. Specifically, this composite catalyst maintains more than 100-hour stability in strong acid conditions (pH 1), even comparable to those state-of-the-art CO 2 RR catalysts. In-situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the molecular modification can decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, and guarantee the sufficient local *H near Pt surface. Additionally, the *H derived from H 2 O dissociation is favorable for the *CO hydrogenation pathway towards *CHO, eventually leading to the formation of CH 4 . This strategy might be easily applied to microenvironment and interface regulation in other electrocatalytic reactions.},

  abstract     = {Paleogeographic reconstructions are of key importance for understanding the history of continental breakups and amalgamations during Earth’s history. A special case is the history of the Asian continent, which, compared to other continents, consists of several large cratons and numerous smaller continental blocks. The history of the assembly of South China remains controversial in terms of the timing, Late Neoproterozoic or Early Paleozoic, and the participating continental blocks, e.g. Yangtze, Cathaysia, India and Australia. Detrital rutile U-Pb dating has significant potential with regard to deciphering tectonic settings as rutile frequently crystallizes during orogenic events associated with the processes of collision and subduction. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating is a perfect instrument for identifying the provenance characteristics and age characteristics of sedimentary sources. An integration of these two methods of dating offers better opportunities for reconstructing tectonic settings. This paper presents a first attempt to reconstruct the Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic tectonic history and paleogeography of the whole South China based on U-Pb geochronology of rutile and zircon and Hf-in-zircon isotopes from Lower Jurassic Baitianba Formation sedimentary rocks of the western margin of the Yangtze Block, a major part of South China. Our obtained integrated U-Pb rutile and zircon age data show three main age populations of 960–940 Ma, 630–610 Ma and 530–520 Ma. The new U-Pb detrital rutile and zircon ages, compared with former data from Gondwana and Australia, suggest that Yangtze amalgamated with Cathaysia to form South China during the Sibao orogeny at 960–940 Ma. The detrital rutile and zircons of the new 630–610 Ma age group could have been delivered from western Australia during the Late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Paterson-Petermann orogeny. The abundant 530–520 Ma detrital rutile and zircon ages fit well with the coeval zircon age populations recorded in Gondwana-derived terranes, like India and Indochina.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models, a powerful and universal generative artificial intelligence technology, have achieved tremendous success and opened up new possibilities in diverse applications. In these applications, diffusion models provide flexible high-dimensional data modeling, and act as a sampler for generating new samples under active control towards task-desired properties. Despite the significant empirical success, theoretical underpinnings of diffusion models are very limited, potentially slowing down principled methodological innovations for further harnessing and improving diffusion models. In this paper, we review emerging applications of diffusion models to highlight their sample generation capabilities under various control goals. At the same time, we dive into the unique working flow of diffusion models through the lens of stochastic processes. We identify theoretical challenges in analyzing diffusion models, owing to their complicated training procedure and interaction with the underlying data distribution. To address these challenges, we overview several promising advances, demonstrating diffusion models as an efficient distribution learner and a sampler. Furthermore, we introduce a new avenue in high-dimensional structured optimization through diffusion models, where searching for solutions is reformulated as a conditional sampling problem and solved by diffusion models. Lastly, we discuss future directions about diffusion models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a well-rounded exposure for stimulating forward-looking theories and methods of diffusion models.},

  abstract     = {Due to almost identical boiling points of benzene and cyclohexane, the extraction of trace benzene from cyclohexane is currently performed via the energy-intensive extractive distillation method. Their adsorptive separation by porous materials is hampered by their similar dimensions. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile pore environments are capable of molecular discrimination, but the separation of trace substrates in liquid-phase remains extremely challenging. Herein, we report a robust MOF (NKU-300) with triangular channels decorated with crown ether that can discriminate trace benzene from cyclohexane, exhibiting an unprecedented selectivity of 8615(10) for the mixture of benzene/cyclohexane (v/v = 1/1000). Remarkably, NKU-300 demonstrates exceptional selectivities for the extraction of benzene from cyclohexane over a wide range of concentrations of 0.1%–50% with ultrafast sorption kinetics and excellent stability. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and computational modelling reveal that multiple supramolecular interactions cooperatively immobilise benzene molecules in the triangular channel, enabling superior separation performance. This study will promote the application of advanced sorbents with tailored binding sites for challenging industrial separations.},

Microenvironment regulation at the catalytic interface has been demonstrated to be capable of effectively enhancing the reaction rates and improving the selectivities for specific products. In this review we summarize the latest advances in microenvironment regulation in typical electrocatalytic processes (including water electrolysis, hydrogen–oxygen fuel cells, and carbon dioxide reduction) and the related in situ / operando characterization techniques and theoretical simulation methods.

Although numerous sensors have been developed, there is a continuous demand for sensors with increased sensitivity, to detect signals that were previously undetectable. Recently, non-Hermitian degeneracies, also known as exceptional points (EPs), have attracted attention as a way of improving the responsiveness of sensors. In contrast to previous investigations, here we present a new approach to achieving ultra-sensitivity by reconstructing exceptional systems. In the reconstruction process, some eigenstates near the previous EPs are utilized, and non-reciprocal long-range couplings are introduced. The sensitivities of our reconstructed systems have improved by several orders of magnitude compared to those based on EPs. Furthermore, we design and fabricate corresponding integrated circuit sensors to demonstrate the scheme. Our work paves the way for the development of highly sensitive sensors, which have a wide range of applications in various fields.},

In situ electrochemical spectroscopy revealed that the *CO (a key intermediate of the CO 2 reduction reaction) binding affinity and consequent *CO coverage positively correlate with the Cu surface oxidation state, leading to favorable C–C coupling on F-GDY/Cu NW over Me-GDY/Cu NW. Electrochemical measurements corroborate the favorable C 2 H 4 production with an optimum C 2+ selectivity of 73.15% ± 2.5% observed for F-GDY/Cu NW, while the predominant CH 4 production is favored by Me-GDY/Cu NW. Furthermore, by leveraging the *Cu–hydroxyl (OH)/*CO ratio as a descriptor, mechanistic investigation reveals that the protonation of distinct adsorbed *CO facilitated by *Cu–OH is crucial for the selective generation of C 2 H 4 and CH 4 on F-GDY/Cu NW and Me-GDY/Cu NW, respectively.},

The artificial nacre has a chemical composition and microstructure highly similar to that of natural nacre, and therefore is both strong and tough. Over the past two decades, Yu&#39;s team has been focusing on the field of biomimetic materials. In addition to shells and pearls, their mimetic targets also include wood, animal bone, fish scale, bamboo joint, lotus root silk and others. Their biomimetic materials have excellent mechanical properties and good application prospects in many fields. In this interview with NSR , Yu introduced many of his interesting works. His research was initially driven by interest and curiosity, but in recent years, he also hopes to shoulder more social responsibility as a scientist and benefit society with his research outputs.},

  abstract     = {The quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) is a phenomenon driven by quenched disorders that break conventional scaling invariance and result in a divergent dynamic critical exponent during quantum phase transitions (QPT). While this phenomenon has been well-documented in low-dimensional conventional superconductors and in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic metal systems, its presence in 3D superconducting systems and in unconventional high-temperature superconductors (high- T c SCs) remains unclear. In this study, we report the observation of robust QGS in the superconductor-metal transition (SMT) of both quasi-2D and 3D anisotropic unconventional high- T c superconductor CaFe 1- x Ni x AsF ( x &lt;5%) bulk single crystals, where the QGS states persist to up to 5.3 K. A comprehensive quantum phase diagram is established that delineates the 3D anisotropic QGS of SMT induced by perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields. Our findings reveal the universality of QGS in 3D superconducting systems and unconventional high- T c SCs, thereby substantially expanding the range of applicability of QGS.},

  abstract     = {Crystalline solids exhibiting inherently low lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ) are of great importance in applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. However, κ L cannot be arbitrarily low and is limited by the minimum thermal conductivity related to phonon dispersions. In this work, we report the liquid-like thermal transport in a well-ordered crystalline CsAg 5 Te 3 , which exhibits an extremely low κ L value of ∼0.18 Wm −1 K −1 . On the basis of first-principles calculations and inelastic neutron scattering measurements, we find that there are lots of low-lying optical phonon modes at ∼3.1 meV hosting the avoided-crossing behavior with acoustic phonons. These strongly localized modes are accompanied by weakly bound rattling Ag atoms with thermally induced large amplitudes of vibrations. Using the two-channel model, we demonstrate that coupling of the particle-like phonon modes and the heat-carrying wave-like phonons is essential for understanding the low κ L , which is heavily deviated from the 1/ T temperature dependence of the standard Peierls theory. In addition, our analysis indicates that the soft structural framework with liquid-like motions of the fluctuating Ag atoms is the underlying cause that leads to the suppression of the heat conduction in CsAg 5 Te 3 . These factors synergistically account for the ultralow κ L value. Our results demonstrate that the liquid-like heat transfer could indeed exist in a well-ordered crystal.},

  abstract     = {Unravelling the influence of strain and geometric effects on the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) on Cu-based (or Pd-based) alloys remains challenging due to complex local microenvironment variables. Herein, we employ two PdCu alloys (nanoparticles and nanodendrites) to demonstrate how CO 2 RR selectivity can shift from CO to HCOO − . Despite sharing consistent phases, exposed crystal facets, and overall oxidative states, these alloys exhibit different local strain profiles due to their distinct geometries. By integrating experimental data, in-situ spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we revealed that CO 2 prefers adsorption on tensile-strained areas with carbon-side geometry, following a *COOH-to-CO pathway. Conversely, on some compressive-strained regions induced by the dendrite-like morphology, CO 2 adopts an oxygen-side geometry, favoring an *OCHO-to-HCOO pathway due to the downshift of the d -band center. Notably, our findings elucidate a dominant *OCHO-to-HCOO − pathway in catalysts when featuring both adsorption geometries. This research provides a comprehensive model for local environment of bimetallic alloys, and establishes a clear relationship between the CO 2 RR pathway shift and variation in local strain environments of PdCu alloys.},

Current research has concentrated on the new hydride superconductors with the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature ( T c ). The multiple extreme conditions (high pressure/temperature and magnetic field) will introduce new insights into hydride superconductors. The study of transport properties under very high magnetic fields facilitates the understanding of superconductivity in conventional hydride superconductors. In the present work, we report experimental evidence of an unusual metal state in a newly synthesized cubic A15-type La 4 H 23 that exhibits superconductivity with a T c reaching 105 K at 118 GPa. A large negative magnetoresistance is observed in strong pulsed magnetic fields in the non-superconducting state of this compound below 40 K. Moreover, we construct the full magnetic phase diagram of La 4 H 23 up to 68 T at high pressure. The present work reveals anomalous electronic structural properties of A15-La 4 H 23 under high magnetic fields, and therefore has great importance with regard to advancing the understanding of quantum transport behaviors in hydride superconductors.},

  abstract     = {The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit sets the lower bound of the carrier mean free path for coherent quasiparticle transport. Metallicity beyond this limit is of great interest because it is often closely related to quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity. Progress along this direction mainly focuses on the strange-metal behaviors originating from the evolution of the quasiparticle scattering rate, such as linear-in-temperature resistivity, while the quasiparticle coherence phenomena in this regime are much less explored due to the short mean free path at the diffusive bound. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations from Landau quantization near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs 3 . Despite the insulator-like temperature dependence of resistivity, CaAs 3 presents giant magnetoresistance and prominent Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations from Fermi surfaces, indicating highly coherent band transport. In contrast, quantum oscillation is absent in the magnetic torque. The quasiparticle effective mass increases systematically with magnetic fields, manifesting a much larger value than what is expected based on magneto-infrared spectroscopy. This suggests a strong many-body renormalization effect near the Fermi surface. We find that these unconventional behaviors may be explained by the interplay between the mobility edge and the van Hove singularity, which results in the formation of coherent cyclotron orbits emerging at the diffusive bound. Our results call for further study on the electron correlation effect of the van Hove singularity.},

Here, we propose a natural approach to generalize energy band theory to incommensurate systems without reliance on the commensurate approximation, thus providing a comprehensive energy spectrum theory of incommensurate systems. Except for a truncation-dependent weighting factor, the formulae of this theory are formally almost identical to that of Bloch electrons, making it particularly suitable for complex incommensurate structures. To illustrate the application of this theory, we give three typical examples: one-dimensional bichromatic and trichromatic incommensurate potential models, as well as a moiré quasicrystal. Our theory establishes a fundamental framework for understanding incommensurate systems.},

Furthermore, the ability to recognize facial emotions of LSF content genetically correlated with the function of the amygdala. Crucially, single-unit recording of the amygdala in macaques further revealed the dissociation between LSF and HSF processing in facial emotion perception, indicating the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. This cross-species study enhances insights into the neurobiological dual-route model (subcortical vs. cortical) of emotion perception and illuminates the origin and the functional development of the emotional brain in primates.},

Chemoautotrophic enrichments from hot spring sediments and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed enrichment of six CSP1-3 genera, and both transcribed genes and DNA-stable isotope probing were consistent with proposed chemoautotrophic metabolisms. Ancestral state reconstructions showed that the ancestors of phylum CSP1-3 may have been acetogens that were autotrophic via the RGP, whereas the WLP and CBB were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Our results reveal that CSP1-3 is a widely distributed phylum with the potential to contribute to the cycling of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen. The name Sysuimicrobiota phy. nov. is proposed.},

  abstract     = {Ozone pollution is a major environmental threat to human health. Timely assessment of ozone trends is crucial for informing environmental policy. Here we show that for the most recent decade (2013–2022) in the northern hemisphere, warm-season (April–September) mean daily 8-h average maximum ozone increases much faster in urban regions with top ozone levels (mainly in the North China Plain, 1.2 ± 1.3 ppbv year −1 ) than in other, low-ozone regions (0.2 ± 0.9 ppbv year −1 ). These trends widen the ozone differences across urban regions, and increase extreme pollution levels and health threats from a global perspective. Comparison of historical trends in different urban regions reveals that ozone increases in China during 2013–2022 differ in magnitude and mechanisms to historical periods in other regions since 1980. This reflects a unique chemical environment characterized by exceptionally high nitrogen oxides and aerosol concentrations, where reducing ozone precursor emissions leads to substantial ozone increase. Ozone increase in China has slowed down in 2018–2022 compared to 2013–2017, driven by ongoing emission reductions, but with ozone-favorable weather conditions. Historical ozone evolution in Japan and South Korea indicates that ozone increases should be suppressed with continuous emission reduction. Increasing temperature and associated wildfires have also reversed ozone decreases in the USA and Europe, with anthropogenic ozone control slowing down in recent decades.},

The emerging oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) streamlines direct O–O radical coupling, circumventing the formation of oxygen vacancy defects featured in the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and bypassing additional reaction intermediates (*OOH) inherent to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). With only *O and *OH as intermediates, OPM-driven electrocatalysts stand out for their ability to disrupt traditional scaling relationships while ensuring stability. This review compiles the latest significant advances in OPM-based electrocatalysis, detailing design principles, synthetic methods, and sophisticated techniques to identify active sites and pathways. We conclude with prospective challenges and opportunities for OPM-driven electrocatalysts, aiming to advance the field into a new era by overcoming traditional constraints.},

The integration of smart stimuli–response transitions in biomass aerogels holds promise as a solution, yet remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a pioneering strategy that employs reversible-gel-assisted ambient-pressure drying without organic solvents to craft multifunctional bio-based aerogels. By exploiting the thermally reversible gelling propensity of select biomasses, we anchor emulsified bubbles within cross-linked hydrogels, circumventing surface tension issues during mild drying. The resultant aerogels feature a robust porous matrix that is imbued with stable bubbles, yielding low thermal conductivity, high flame retardancy and robust resistance to diverse rigors. This innovative approach facilitates a paradigm shift in intelligent fire protection in which aerogels transition from robust to flexible in response to water stimuli, effectively shielding against thermal hazards and external forces. This work opens up a facile, eco-friendly and mild way to fabricate advanced biomass aerogels with stimuli-responsive transformation.},

The cosolvent electrolyte breaks the dissolution limitation of the salt through ion–dipole interactions, significantly enlarging the anion-rich solvation clusters, as verified by the insitu synchrotron-based wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments. Furthermore, the large anion-rich solvation clusters also facilitate the formation of an effective electrode–electrolyte interphase, thereby enhancing compatibility with high-voltage electrodes. The cosolvent electrolyte enables K||Prussian blue cells (2–4.5 V) to operate for &gt;700 cycles with a capacity retention of 91.9%.

  abstract     = {Epitaxy is the cornerstone of semiconductor technology, enabling the fabrication of single-crystal film. Recent advancements in van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy have opened new avenues for producing wafer-scale single-crystal 2D atomic crystals. However, when it comes to molecular crystals, the overall weak vdW force means that it is a significant challenge for small molecules to form a well-ordered structure during epitaxy. Here we demonstrate that the vdW epitaxy of Sb 2 O 3 molecular crystal, where the whole growth process is governed by vdW interactions, can be precisely controlled. The nucleation is deterministically modulated by epilayer–substrate interactions and unidirectional nuclei are realized through designing the lattice and symmetry matching between epilayer and substrate. Moreover, the growth and coalescence of nuclei as well as the layer-by-layer growth mode are kinetically realized via tackling the Schwoebel-Ehrlich barrier. Such precise control of vdW epitaxy enables the growth of single-crystal Sb 2 O 3 molecular film with desirable thickness. Using the ultrathin highly oriented Sb 2 O 3 film as a gate dielectric, we fabricated MoS 2 -based field-effect transistors that exhibit superior device performance. The results substantiate the viability of precisely managing molecule alignment in vdW epitaxy, paving the way for large-scale synthesis of single-crystal 2D molecular crystals.},

However, the prerequisites for implanted sensors pose greater challenges than those for wearables or for robots: aside from biocompatibility and tissue-like softness, they must also exhibit humidity insensitivity and high-pressure resolution across a broad pressure spectrum. Iontronic sensors can provide superior sensing properties, but they undergo property degradation in wet environments due to the hygroscopic nature of their active component: ionogels. Herein, we introduce a humidity-insensitive iontronic sensor array based on a hydrophobic and tough ionogel polymerized in a hydrophobicity transition yielding two hydrophobic phases: a soft liquid-rich phase that enhances ionic conductivity and ductility, and a stiff polymer-rich phase that contributes to superior toughness. We demonstrate the in vivo implantation of these sensor arrays to monitor real-time intra-articular pressure distribution in a sheep model, while assessing knee flexion with an angular resolution of 0.1° and a pressure resolution of 0.1%. We anticipate that this sensor array will find applications in various orthopedic surgeries and implantable medical devices.},

Here, we develop a rapid and large-scale glycopeptide enrichment strategy via bioorthogonal ligation and trypsin cleavage. The enrichment process is performed in one tube to minimize sample loss and time costs. This method combines convenience and practicality, identifying over 900 O-GlcNAc sites from a 500 μg sample. Surprisingly, it allows simultaneous identification of N-glycosites, O-GlcNAc sites, O-GalNAc sites and N-glycans via a two-step enzymatic release strategy. Combined with quantitative analysis, it reveals the distinct O-GlcNAcylation patterns in different compartments during oxidative stress. In summary, our study offers a convenient and robust tool for glycoproteome and glycome profiling, facilitating in-depth analysis to elucidate the biological functions of glycosylation.},

  abstract     = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon and is indispensable for mitigating climate change and sustaining soil fertility. As a major component of stable SOC, microbial-derived carbon (MDC) accounts for approximately half of the total SOC and has repercussions on climate feedback. However, our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of MDC stocks is limited, hindering assessments of the long-term impacts of global warming on persistent SOC sequestration in the soil‒atmosphere carbon cycle. Here, we compiled an extensive global dataset and employed ensemble machine learning techniques to forecast the spatial-temporal dynamics of MDC stocks across 93.4% of the total global land area from 1981 to 2018. Our findings revealed that for every 1°C increase in temperature, there was a global decrease of 6.7 Pg in the soil MDC stock within the predictable areas, equivalent to 1.4% of the total MDC stock or 0.9% of the atmospheric C pool. Tropical regions experienced the most substantial declines in MDC stocks. We further projected future MDC stocks for the next century based on shared socioeconomic pathways, showing a global decline in MDC stocks with a potential 6–37 Pg reduction by 2100 depending on future pathways. We recommend integrating the response of MDC stocks to warming into socioeconomic models to enhance confidence in selecting sustainable pathways.},

  abstract     = {The Chang&#39;E-6 (CE-6) mission successfully achieved return of the first samples from the far side of the Moon. The sampling site of CE-6 is located in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin—the largest, deepest and oldest impact basin on the Moon. The 1935.3 g of CE-6 lunar samples exhibit distinct characteristics compared with previous lunar samples. This study analyses the physical, mineralogical, petrographic and geochemical properties of CE-6 lunar scooped samples. The CE-6 soil has a significantly lower bulk density (0.983 g/cm 3 ) and true density (3.035 g/cm 3 ) than the Chang&#39;E-5 (CE-5) samples. The grain size of the CE-6 soil exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a mixture of different compositions. Mineralogically, the CE-6 soil consists of 32.6% plagioclase (anorthite and bytownite), 19.7% augite, 10% pigeonite and 3.6% orthopyroxene, and with low content of olivine (0.5%) but high content of amorphous glass (29.4%). Geochemically, the bulk composition of CE-6 soil is rich in Al 2 O 3 (14%) and CaO (12%) but low in FeO (17%), and trace elements of CE-6 soil such as K (∼630 ppm), U (0.26 ppm), Th (0.92 ppm) and rare-earth elements are significantly lower than those of the lunar soils within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. The local basalts are characterized by low-Ti (TiO 2 , 5.08%), low-Al (Al 2 O 3 9.85%) and low-K (∼830 ppm), features suggesting that the CE-6 soil is a mixture of local basalts and non-basaltic ejecta. The returned CE-6 sample contains diverse lithic fragments, including local mare basalt, breccia, agglutinate, glasses and leucocrate. These local mare basalts document the volcanic history of the lunar far side, while the non-basaltic fragments may offer critical insights into the lunar highland crust, SPA impact melts and potentially the deep lunar mantle, making these samples highly significant for scientific research.},

Here we report the design of an endo-lysosome-targeted fluorescent reporter, Znluor ly , for imaging endogenous zinc ions. Znluor ly is constructed from an amphiphilic DNA framework (DNF) with programmable size and shape, which can encapsulate zinc-responsive fluorophores within its hydrophobic nanocavity. We find that the tetrahedral DNFs of 20 bp in the edge length are effectively located within endo-lysosomes, which can detect zinc ions with a detection limit of ∼31.9 nM (a sensitivity that is ∼2.5 times that of the free fluorophore). Given the organelle-targeting ability and high zinc sensitivity of Znluor ly , we employ it to detect endogenous endo-lysosomal zinc ions in neuron cells. We monitor the dynamics of zinc levels in AD model cells and zebrafish, corroborating the positive correlation between zinc levels and AD hallmarks including Aβ aggregates and learning/memory impairments. Our study provides a generalizable strategy for organelle-specific theranostic applications.},

However, this aerobic epoxidation reaction suffers from the apparent trade-off between propylene conversion and PO selectivity, and remains a key challenge in catalysis. We report that Ti-Beta zeolites containing isolated framework Ti species can efficiently catalyze the aerobic epoxidation of propylene. Stable propylene conversion of 25% and PO selectivity of up to 90% are achieved at the same time, matching the levels of industrial ethylene aerobic epoxidation processes. H-terminated pentacoordinated Ti species in Beta zeolite frameworks are identified as the preferred active sites for propylene aerobic epoxidation and the reaction is initiated by the participation of lattice oxygen in Ti-OH. These results are expected to spark new technology for the industrial production of PO toward more sustainable chemistry and chemical engineering.},

  abstract     = {The development of alternative methods to the Haber–Bosch process for ammonia (NH 3 ) synthesis is a pressing and formidable challenge. Nuclear energy represents a low-carbon, efficient and stable source of power. The harnessing of nuclear energy to drive nitrogen (N 2 ) reduction not only allows ‘green’ NH 3 synthesis, but also offers the potential for the storage of nuclear energy as a readily transportable zero-carbon fuel. Herein, we explore radiocatalytic N 2 fixation to NH 3 induced by γ-ray radiation. Hydrated electrons (e − aq ) that are generated from water radiolysis enable N 2 reduction to produce NH 3 . Ru-based catalysts synthesized by using γ-ray radiation with excellent radiation stability substantially improve NH 3 production in which the B 5 sites of Ru particles may play an important role in the activation of N 2 . By benefitting from the remarkable penetrating power of γ-ray radiation, radiocatalytic NH 3 synthesis can proceed in an autoclave under appropriate pressure conditions, resulting in an NH 3 concentration of ≤5.1 mM. The energy conversion efficiency of the reaction is as high as 563.7 mg NH3 ·MJ −1 . This radiocatalytic chemistry broadens the research scope of catalytic N 2 fixation while offering promising opportunities for converting nuclear energy into chemical energy.},

The all-optical method has aroused growing interest owing to its ultra-fast speed, low energy consumption and parallel computation. However, current optical edge detection methods are generally limited to static devices and fixed functionality. Herein, we propose a fast-switchable scheme based on a ferroelectric liquid crystal topological structure. The self-assembled chiral lamellar superstructure, directed by the azimuthally variant photo-alignment agent, can be dynamically controlled by the polarity of the external electric field and respectively generates the vector beams with nearly orthogonal polarization distribution. Even after thousands of cycles, the horizontal and vertical edges of the object are selectively enhanced with an ultra-fast switching time of ∼57 μs. Broadband edge-enhanced imaging is efficiently demonstrated. This work extends the ingenious building of topological heliconical superstructures and offers an important glimpse into their potential in the emerging frontiers of optical computing for artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {The established paradigm assumes that drainage may decrease the vast soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoir in global wetlands. Yet drainage can also promote SOC stabilization by fostering the accrual of metal-bound organic carbon (bound OC) upon oxygen exposure. Here, this emergent mechanism is tested for the first time at a regional scale, using literature data and a nationwide, pairwise survey of drained wetlands across China. We show that long-term (15–55 years) drainage largely increased metallic protection of SOC (bound OC%) in non- Sphagnum wetlands, but consistently decreased bound OC% in Sphagnum wetlands following replacement of the ‘rust engineer’ Sphagnum by herbaceous plants. Improved SOC stock estimates based on 66 soil profiles reveal that bound OC increases can compensate for the loss of unbound SOC components in non- Sphagnum wetlands with substantial accrual of reactive metals. Metallic stabilization of wetland SOC is hence a widespread but overlooked mechanism that is heavily influenced by vegetational shifts. Incorporating this novel mechanism into models will improve prediction of wetland SOC dynamics under shifting hydrological regimes.},

Iron-based superconductors offer an economically attractive solution to push forward important yet costly scientific programs, such as nuclear fusion reactors and next-generation particle accelerators. In this review, we start with the fabrication of iron-based superconducting wires and tapes and continue to discuss several key factors governing the current transport properties. State-of-the-art wires and tapes are introduced with emphasis on grain boundary characteristics, flux pinning, and anisotropy. The architecture of flexible conductors enables low cost, high mechanical strength, and high thermal stability. Recent progress in practical applications, including superconducting joints and insert coils, is also reviewed. Finally, we propose several key questions faced by iron-based superconductors in future practical applications.},

Along a separate line of research, a quadrupole topological insulator was the first higher-order topological phase supporting localized corner states, but has been so far limited to T -invariant systems, as T is a key ingredient in early models. Here we report the realization of a quadrupole topological insulator phase in a gyromagnetic PhC, as a consequence of topological phase transition from the previously demonstrated Chern insulator phase. The phase transition has been demonstrated with microwave measurements, which characterize the evolution from propagating chiral edge states to localized corner states. We also demonstrate the migration of topological boundary states into the continuum, when the gyromagnetic PhC is magnetically tuned. These results extend the quadrupole topological insulator phase into T -broken systems, and integrate topologically protected propagating and localized modes in a magnetically tunable photonic crystal platform.},

The FLASH effect was defined as the ability of FLASH-RT to suppress tumor growth while sparing normal tissues. Although the FLASH effect has been proven to be valid in various models by different modalities of irradiation and clinical trials of FLASH-RT have achieved promising initial success, the exact underlying mechanism is still unclear. This article summarizes mainstream hypotheses of the FLASH effect at physicochemical and biological levels, including oxygen depletion and free radical reactions, nuclear and mitochondria damage, as well as immune response. These hypotheses contribute reasonable explanations to the FLASH effect and are interconnected according to the chronological order of the organism&#39;s response to ionizing radiation. By collating the existing consensus, evidence and hypotheses, this article provides a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms of the FLASH effect and practical guidance for future investigation in the field of FLASH-RT.},

However, issues with the structural stability and electrochemical kinetics during discharge/charge limit the development of AZIBs. In this study, vanadium oxide electrodes with organic molecular intercalation were designed based on intercalating 11 kinds of charged organic carboxylic acid ligands between 2D layers to regulate the interlayer spacing. The negatively charged carboxylic acid group can neutralize Zn 2+ , reduce electrostatic repulsion and enhance electrochemical kinetics. The intercalated organic molecules increased the interlayer spacing. Among them, the 0.028EDTA · 0.28NH 4 + · V 2 O 5 · 0.069H 2 O was employed as the cathode with a high specific capacity (464.6 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and excellent rate performance (324.4 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ). Even at a current density of 20 A g −1 , the specific capacity after 2000 charge/discharge cycles was 215.2 mAh g −1 (capacity retention of 78%). The results of this study demonstrate that modulation of the electrostatic repulsion and interlayer spacing through the intercalation of organic ligands can enhance the properties of vanadium-based materials.},

  abstract     = {Population allele frequency is crucially important for accurate interpretation of known and novel variants in medical genetics. Recently, several large allele frequency databases, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have been created to serve as a global reference for such studies. However, frequencies of many rare alleles vary dramatically between populations, and population-specific allele frequency is often more informative than the global one. Many countries and regions, including Russia, remain poorly studied from the genetic perspective. Here, we report the first successful attempt to integrate genetic information between major medical genetic laboratories in Russia. We construct RUSeq, an open, large-scale reference set of genetic variants by analyzing 7452 exome samples collected in two major Russian cities—Moscow and St. Petersburg. An ∼10-fold increase in sample size compared to previous studies allowed us to characterize extensive genetic diversity within the admixed Russian population with contributions from several major ancestral groups. We highlight 51 known pathogenic variants that are overrepresented in Russia compared to other European countries. We also identify several dozen high-impact variants that are present in healthy donors despite being annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar and falling within genes associated with autosomal dominant disorders. The constructed database of genetic variant frequencies in Russia has been made available to the medical genetics community through a variant browser available at http://ruseq.ru .},

Although the Chinese government is promoting a policy shift to large-scale farming, the benefits of this, when integrated with nitrogen management, remain unclear. Here we fill this gap using an integrated assessment, by combining geostatistical analysis, high-resolution emission inventories, farm surveys and air quality modeling. Smallholder-dominated farming allows only 13%–31% NH 3 reduction, leading to limited PM 2.5 decreases nationally due to non-linear PM 2.5 chemistry. Conversely, large-scale farming would double nitrogen management adoption rates, increasing NH 3 reduction potential to 48%–58% and decreasing PM 2.5 by 9.4–14.0 μg·m −3 in polluted regions. The estimated PM 2.5 reduction is conservative due to localized NH 3 -rich conditions under large-scale livestock farming. This strategy could prevent over 300 000 premature deaths and achieve a net benefit of US $68.4–86.8 billion annually, unlocking immense benefits for air quality and agricultural sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The coexistence and coupling of capacitive and memristive effects have been an important subject of scientific interest. While the capacitive effect in memristors has been extensively studied, the reciprocal scenario of the memristive effect in capacitors remains unexplored. In this study, we introduce a supercapacitor-memristor (CAPistor) concept, which is constructed by leveraging non-linear ion transport within the pores of a metal-organic framework zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-7). Within the nanochannels of the ZIF-7 electrode in an aqueous pseudocapacitor, the anionic species (OH − ) of the electrolyte can be enriched and dissipated in different voltage regimes. This difference leads to a hysteresis effect in ion conductivity, constituting a memristive behavior in the pseudocapacitor. Thus, the pseudocapacitor-converted CAPistor seamlessly integrates the programmable resistance and memory functions of an ionic memristor into a supercapacitor, demonstrating enormous potential to extend the traditional energy storage applications of supercapacitors into emerging fields, including biomimetic nanofluidic ionics and neuromorphic computing.},

Despite their demonstrated efficacy, these hydrogels as soft implants are still limited by improper symmetric surface functions, leading to postoperative complications and disorders. Janus hydrogel bioadhesives with unique asymmetric surface designs have thus been proposed as a reliable and biocompatible hydrogel interface, mimicking the structural characteristics of natural biological barriers. In this comprehensive review, we provide guidelines for the rational design of Janus hydrogel bioadhesives, covering methods for hydrogel surface chemistry and microstructure engineering. The engineering of Janus hydrogels is highlighted, specifically in tuning the basal surface to facilitate instant and robust hydrogel-tissue integration and modulating the apical surface as the anti-adhesion, anti-fouling, and anti-wear barrier. These asymmetric designs hold great potential in clinical translation, supporting applications including hemostasis/tissue sealing, chronic wound management, and regenerative medicine. By shedding light on the potential of Janus hydrogels as bioactive interfaces, this review paper aims to inspire further research and overcome current obstacles for advancing soft matter in next-generation healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The significant volume of existing buildings and ongoing annual construction of infrastructure underscore the vast potential for integrating large-scale energy-storage solutions into these structures. Herein, we propose an innovative approach for developing structural and scalable energy-storage systems by integrating safe and cost-effective zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors into cement mortar, which is the predominant material used for structural purposes. By performing air entrainment and leveraging the adverse reaction of the ZnSO 4 electrolyte, we can engineer an aerated cement mortar with a multiscale pore structure that exhibits dual functionality: effective ion conductivity in the form of a cell separator and a robust load-bearing capacity that contributes to structural integrity. Consequently, a hybrid supercapacitor building block consisting of a tailored cement mortar, zinc metal anode and active carbon cathode demonstrates exceptional specific energy density (71.4 Wh kg −1 at 68.7 W kg −1 ), high areal energy density (2.0 Wh m −2 at 1.9 W m −2 ), favorable cycling stability (∼92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and exceptional safety (endurance in a 1-hour combustion test). By demonstrating the scalability of the structural energy-storage system coupled with solar energy generation, this new device exhibits great potential to revolutionize energy-storage systems.},

Here, we report the rapid synthesis of four types of xylomannans, including the proposed antifreeze xylomannan up to a 64-mer (Type I), the regioisomeric [→3)- β -D-Man p -(1→4)- β -D-Xyl p -(1→] n 16-mer (Type II), the diastereomeric [→4)- β -L-Man p -(1→4)- β -D-Xyl p -(1→] n 16-mer (Type III) and the block-wise [→4)- β -D-Man p -(1→] m [→4)- β -D-Xyl p -(1→] n 32-mer (Type IV), by employing a strategic iterative exponential glycan growth (IEGG) process. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data of the alleged natural xylomannan are in accordance only to those of the block-wise Type IV glycan and none of these synthetic xylomannans has been found to be capable of inducing thermal hysteresis. These results disprove the previous reports about the natural occurrence of antifreeze xylomannans.},

BC emissions have rapidly declined over the past three decades and it is important to uncover the major factors behind this decline. Herein, the temporal trends in BC emissions were compiled from 146 detailed sources from 1960 to 2019. Results revealed that the major emission sources were residential solid fuel usage, coke production and brick production. Furthermore, 96.9% of the emission reduction from 3.03 Tg in 1995 to 1.02 Tg in 2019 was attributed to these three sources. It was determined that the transition in residential energy/stove usage, phasing-out of beehive coke ovens and brick kiln upgrading were the most important drivers leading to this reduction and will continue to play a key role in future emission mitigation. In addition, this study identified the need to address emissions from coal used in vegetable greenhouses and the commercial sector, and diesel consumption in on/off-road vehicles.},

Both remote sensing observations and eddy covariance measurements reveal that hot–dry events prolong the recovery time compared with dry events, with greater prolongation of recovery time in drylands than in humid regions. Random forest regression modeling demonstrates that the difference in vapor pressure deficit between hot–dry and dry events, with an importance score of 35%, is the major factor contributing to ΔRT. The severity of stomatal restriction exceeds that of non-stomatal limitation, which restricts the vegetation productivity that is necessary for the recovery process. These results emphasize the negative effect of vapor pressure deficit on vegetation recovery during hot–dry events and project an extension of drought recovery time considering elevated vapor pressure deficit in a warming world.},

  abstract     = {Using the electrochemical polyol oxidation reaction (POR) to produce formic acid over nickel-based oxides/hydroxides (NiO x H y ) is an attractive strategy for the electrochemical upgrading of biomass-derived polyols. The key step in the POR, i.e. the cleavage of the C–C bond, depends on an oxygen-vacancy-induced mechanism. However, a high-energy oxygen vacancy is usually ineffective for Schottky-type oxygen-vacancy-rich β-Ni(OH) 2 (V SO -β-Ni(OH) 2 ). As a result, both β-Ni(OH) 2 and V SO -β-Ni(OH) 2 cannot continuously catalyze oxygen-vacancy-induced C–C bond cleavage during PORs. Here, we report a strategy of oxygen-vacancy-filling with sulfur to synthesize a β-Ni(OH) 2 (S-V O -β-Ni(OH) 2 ) catalyst, whose oxygen vacancies are protected by filling with sulfur atoms. During PORs over S-V O -β-Ni(OH) 2 , the pre-electrooxidation-induced loss of sulfur and structural self-reconstruction cause the in-situ generation of stable Frenkel-type oxygen vacancies for activating vacancy-induced C–C bond cleavage, thus leading to excellent POR performances. This work provides an intelligent approach for guaranteeing the sustaining action of the oxygen-vacancy-induced catalytic mechanism in electrooxidation reactions.},

The facile process involves partially removing lignin and hemicellulose functioning as glue in grass, which leads to the separation of vessels, parenchymal cells, and cellulosic fibers, where cellulosic fibers are manufactured at kilogram scale. The resulting fibers show dense and unidirectional fibril structure at both micro- and nano-scales, which demonstrate high tensile strength of ∼0.9 GPa and Young&#39;s modulus of 72 GPa, being 13- and 14-times higher than original grass. Inspired by stretchable plant tendrils, we developed a humidity-responsive actuator by engineering cellulosic fibers into the spring-like structures, presenting superior response rate and lifting capability.

However, severe interfacial issues, such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides on the cathode side, lead to capacity decay and poor lifespan of the batteries. Herein, we report a fiber-shaped composite cathode with collaborative interface interactions to maintain electrode integrity and boost electrochemical performance. In this architecture, nanosulfur-polyvinylpyrrolidone (nanoS-PVP) particles are uniformly implanted into the few-layer Ti 3 C 2 T x with outstanding electrical conductivity and then coated on aluminum (Al) fiber current collectors. Impressively, nanoS and soluble polysulfides are restricted to the cathode side via synergy physical confinement and chemical adsorption of Ti 3 C 2 T x . The PVP chains on the surface of the nanoS prevent the sulfur from agglomeration and bridge the Ti 3 C 2 T x by abundant hydrogen bonds. The enhanced interface endows the cathode with excellent mechanical flexibility, good adsorption of polysulfides and fast reaction kinetics. Consequently, the prepared Ti 3 C 2 T x /nanoS-PVP@Al cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance (capacity retention of 92.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C), high-rate capacity (556.2 mAh g −1 at 2.0 C) and high linear capacity (22.9 mAh m −1 ).

  abstract     = {Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) is a rapidly emerging separation technique that merges the high separation efficiency of capillary electrophoresis with the exceptional selectivity of liquid chromatography. However, it remains a synthetic challenge to design functional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) with high chemical stability against acid and base in CEC enantioseparation. Here we demonstrate that incorporating chiral crown ethers into stable covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables efficient and stable separations of racemates by CEC. This facilitates the crafting of two three-dimensional (3D) chiral COFs by polycondensation of a chiral 1,1&#39;-binaphyl-20-crown-6-derived dialdehyde and tetraamines with diisopropyl substituents. Both feature an 11-fold interpenetrated diamond framework, characterized by tubular open channels decorated with chiral crown ethers serving as enantioselective recognition and binding sites. These frameworks demonstrate excellent stability in water, acid and base, thanks to the presence of bulky isopropyl groups that shield the dynamic imine linkages. Moreover, the precisely defined COF channels enhanced the accessibility of the enclosed crown ethers to the analytes while providing strong protection against harsh environments, rendering them suitable for CSPs in CEC separations. They can effectively separate some important enantiomers, including ketones, epoxides and alkaline substances, when utilized as coatings on chiral columns, particularly facilitating the chiral separation of drugs. This study advances the application of COFs in electrochromatographic separations, expanding the scope of porous materials design and engineering to create COFs with targeted enantioselective properties.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) non-layered materials in many aspects differ from their layered counterparts, and the exploration of their physical properties has produced many intriguing findings. However, due to challenges in applying existing experimental techniques to such nanoscale samples, their thermal properties have remained largely uncharacterized, hindering further exploration and device application using this promising material system. Here, we demonstrate an experimental study of thermal conduction in β -In 2 S 3 , a typical non-layered 2D material, using a resonant nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) platform. We devise a new two-degrees-of-freedom technique, more responsive and sensitive than Raman spectroscopy, to simultaneously determine both the thermal conductivity to be 3.7 W m −1 K −1 and its interfacial thermal conductance with SiO 2 as 6.4 MW m −2 K −1 . Leveraging such unique thermal properties, we further demonstrate a record-high power-to-frequency responsivity of −447 ppm/μW in β -In 2 S 3 NEMS sensors, the best among drumhead NEMS-based bolometers. Our findings offer an effective approach for studying thermal properties and exploring potential thermal applications of 2D non-layered materials.},

  abstract     = {What if one of your organs, say, the kidney, the heart or the liver, deteriorates completely, and you are not lucky enough to have a human organ for transplantation? Do you want to receive an organ from a pig? That is not a joke, but a subject some physicians and researchers are working on—a field of research known as ‘xenotransplantation’.In 2022, David Bennett, a 57-year-old patient with terminal heart disease, received a pig heart and survived for 2 months after the surgery. Another recipient, Lawrence Faucette, survived for 40 days after similar surgery in 2023. Then, in 2024, Rick Slayman, the world&#39;s first recipient of a pig kidney, passed away 2 months after the surgery. Rick was able to get out of the hospital during these 2 months and the transplant team said there is no indication that his sudden passing was the result of failure of the pig kidney graft. Rather, it was related to his heart disease. In China, a liver xenotransplantation from pig to a brain-dead patient was reported in 2024 and the transplanted liver survived in the human body for as long as 10 days.On April 2024, National Science Review organized a panel discussion on xenotransplantation, which was chaired by Prof. Liangxue Lai and involved six other experts in the field. The panelists had in-depth discussions on xenotransplantation, covering its history and the (i) gene editing of the donor pigs, (ii) immunosuppressive regimens required by the recipients, (iii) challenges in preclinical and clinical research, (iv) relevant ethical issues and (v) prospects for the future of xenotransplantation.

  abstract     = {Owing to the intrinsic excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanotube fibers (CNTFs) have been expected to become promising candidates for the next-generation of high-performance fibers. They have received considerable interest for cutting-edge applications, such as ultra-light electric wire, aerospace craft, military equipment, and space elevators. Wet-spinning is a broadly utilized commercial technique for high-performance fiber manufacturing. Thus, compared with array spinning from drawable CNTs vertical array and direct dry spinning from floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), the wet-spinning technique is considered to be a promising strategy to realize the production of CNTFs on a large scale. In this tutorial review, we begin with a summative description of CNTFs wet-spinning process. Then, we discuss the high-concentration CNTs wet-spinning dope preparation strategies and corresponding non-covalent adsorption/charge transfer mechanisms. The filament solidification during the coagulation process is another critical procedure for determining the configurations and properties for derived CNTFs. Next, we discuss post-treatment, including continuous drafting and thermal annealing, to further optimize the CNTs orientation and compact configuration. Finally, we summarize the physical property-structure relationship to give insights for further performance promotion in order to satisfy the prerequisite for detailed application. Insights into propelling high-performance CNTFs production from lab-scale to industry-scale are proposed, in anticipation of this novel fiber having an impact on our lives in the near future.},

  abstract     = {Proton activity at the electrified interface is central to the kinetics of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we construct an efficient Fe 3 C water activation site in Fe-N co-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe 3 C-Fe 1 /CNT) using an electrospinning-pyrolysis-etching strategy to improve interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions with oxygen intermediates during ORR. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory studies identified delocalized electrons as key to water activation kinetics. Specifically, the strong electronic perturbation of the Fe–N 4 sites by Fe 3 C disrupts the symmetric electron density distribution, allowing more free electrons to activate the dissociation of interfacial water, thereby promoting hydrogen bond formation. This process ultimately controls the PCET kinetics for enhanced ORR. The Fe 3 C-Fe 1 /CNT catalyst demonstrates a half-wave potential of 0.83 V in acidic media and 0.91 V in alkaline media, along with strong performance in H 2 -O 2 fuel cells and Al-air batteries.},

Here, we report a class of adhesive fibrils that achieve unprecedented adhesion strength (∼2 MPa), switchability (∼2000), and scalability (up to millimeter-scale at the single fibril level), by leveraging the rubber-to-glass (R2G) transition in shape memory polymers (SMPs). Moreover, R2G SMP fibrillar adhesive arrays exhibit a switchability of &gt;1000 (with the aid of controlled buckling) and an adhesion efficiency of 57.8%, with apparent contact area scalable to 1000 mm 2 , outperforming existing fibrillar adhesives. We further demonstrate that the SMP fibrillar adhesives can be used as soft grippers and reusable superglue devices that are capable of holding and releasing heavy objects &gt;2000 times of their own weight. These findings represent significant advances in smart fibrillar adhesives for numerous applications, especially those involving high-payload scenarios.},

Inspired by advances in topological matter, it was recently suggested that the Berry curvature and Chern numbers of band structures can dictate strict lower bounds on metrological properties, hence establishing a strong connection between topology and quantum metrology. In this work, we provide a first experimental verification of such topological bounds, by performing optimal quantum multi-parameter estimation and achieving the best possible measurement precision. By emulating the band structure of a Chern insulator, we experimentally determine the metrological potential across a topological phase transition, and demonstrate strong enhancement in the topologically non-trivial regime. Our work opens the door to metrological applications empowered by topology, with potential implications for quantum many-body systems.},

Accordingly, we create a novel 3D integration architecture and CMOS-compatible fabrication methodology, including optimizing individual devices, electron/ionic isolation, interconnection, and encapsulation. As a demonstration, we integrate electrochemical micro supercapacitors with a P-N junction diode rectifier bridge circuit and successfully obtain the first monolithic rectifier-filter chip, which shows a revolutionary volume reduction of 98% compared to non-integrateable commercial products. The chip can provide a stable output with a tiny ripple factor of 0.23% in typical conditions, surpassing the requirements of most applications by more than one order of magnitude. More importantly, all the processes are suitable for mass production in standard foundries, allowing ubiquitous applications of electrochemistry in integrated electronics.},

It underlies fertile spin transport phenomena and is of crucial importance for spintronics. Here, we observe the spin texture in k -space of nominally centrosymmetric SrIrO 3 grown on NdGaO 3 (110) substrates, using non-linear magnetotransport measurements. We demonstrate that the spin texture is not only induced by the interface, which inherently breaks the inversion symmetry in strong spin–orbit coupled SrIrO 3 films, but also originates from the film bulk. Structural analysis reveals that thicker SrIrO 3 films exhibit a strain gradient, which could be considered as a continuous change in the lattice constant across different layers and breaks the inversion symmetry throughout the entire SrIrO 3 films, giving rise to the spin texture in k -space. First-principles calculations reveal that the strain gradient creates large spin-splitting bands, inducing the spin texture with anisotropy, which is consistent with our experimental observations. Our results offer an efficient method for inducing the spin textures in k -space.},

  abstract     = {The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect offers promising prospects for spintronics, yet designing chiral materials that enable efficient spin-polarized electron transport remains challenging. Here, we report the utility of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in manipulating electron spin for spin-dependent catalysis via CISS. This enables us to design and synthesize three three-dimensional chiral COFs (CCOFs) with tunable electroactivity and spin-electron conductivity through imine condensations of enantiopure 1,1′-binaphthol-derived tetraaldehyde and tetraamines derived from 1,4-benzenediamine, pyrene, or tetrathiafulvalene skeletons. The CISS effect of CCOFs is verified by magnetic conductive atomic force microscopy. Compared with their achiral analogs, these CCOFs serve as efficient spin filters, reducing the overpotential of oxygen evolution and improving the Tafel slope. Particularly, the diarylamine-based CCOF showed a low overpotential of 430 mV (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm −2 with long-term stability comparable to the commercial RuO 2 . This enhanced spin-dependent OER activity stems from its excellent redox-activity, good electron conductivity and effective suppression effect on the formation of H 2 O 2 byproducts.},

The effects of urban geomorphology and complex geological contexts during conflicts, characterized by different levels of structural damage, are not yet fully understood globally. Here we report how integrating deep learning with data from the independently developed LuoJia3-01 satellite enables near real-time detection of explosions and assessment of different building damage levels in the Israel–Palestine conflict. We found that the damage continually increased from 17 October 2023 to 2 March 2024. We found 3747 missile craters with precision positions and sizes, and timing on vital infrastructure across five governorates in the Gaza Strip on 2 March 2024, providing accurate estimates of potential unexploded ordnance locations and assisting in demining and chemical decontamination. Our findings reveal a significant increase in damage to residential and educational structures, accounting for 58.4% of the total—15.4% destroyed, 18.7% severely damaged, 11.8% moderately damaged and 12.5% slightly damaged—which exacerbates the housing crisis and potential population displacement. Additionally, there is a 34.1% decline in the cultivated area of agricultural land, posing a risk to food security. The LuoJia3-01 satellite data are crucial for impartial conflict monitoring, and our innovative methodology offers a cost-effective, scalable approach to assess future conflicts in various global contexts. These first-time findings highlight the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire to prevent further damage and support the release of hostages and subsequent reconstruction efforts.},

  abstract     = {Resolving complex three-dimensional (3D) subcellular dynamics noninvasively in live tissues demands imaging tools that balance spatiotemporal resolution, field-of-view and phototoxicity. Image scanning microscopy (ISM), as an advancement of confocal laser scanning microscopy, provides a 2-fold 3D resolution enhancement. Nevertheless, the relatively low imaging speed has been the major obstacle for ISM to be further employed in in vivo imaging of biological tissues. Our proposed solution, multi-confocal image scanning microscopy (MC-ISM), aims to overcome the limitations of existing techniques in terms of spatiotemporal resolution balancing by optimizing pinhole diameter and pitch, eliminating out-of-focus signals, and introducing a frame reduction reconstruction algorithm. The imaging speed is increased by 16 times compared with multifocal structured illumination microscopy. We further propose a single-galvo scan, akin to the Archimedes spiral in spinning disk confocal systems, to ensure a high-speed and high-accuracy scan without the galvanometer&#39;s inertial motion. Benefitting from its high photon efficiency, MC-ISM allows continuous imaging of mitochondria dynamics in live cells for 1000 frames without apparent phototoxicity, reaching an imaging depth of 175 μm. Noteworthy, MC-ISM enables the observation of the inner membrane structure of living mitochondria in Arabidopsis hypocotyl for the first time, demonstrating its outstanding performance.},

As fuel stock, the role of vegetation and its phenology changes in wildfire dynamics, however is not fully appreciated. Using long-term satellite-based burned areas and photosynthesis observations, we reveal that an earlier peak photosynthesis timing (PPT) potentially acts to escalate subsequent wildfires, with an increase in the global average burned fraction of 0.021% (∼2.20 Mha) for every additional day of PPT advancement. Satellite observations and Earth System modeling consistently show that this fire escalation is likely due to intensified drought conditions and increased fuel availability associated with the climate feedback arising from earlier PPT. Current fire-enabled dynamic global vegetation models can reproduce the observed negative correlation between PPT and burned area but underestimate the strength of the relationship notably. Given the continued PPT advancement owing to climate change, the bioclimatic effects of vegetation phenology change suggest a potentially pervasive upward pressure on future wildfires.},

  abstract     = {Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of trace gases and particles in the atmosphere, influencing air quality, radiative balance, and climate. Previous studies have mainly focused on the BB emissions of carbon and nitrogen species with less attention on chlorine. Reactive chlorine chemistry has significant effects on atmospheric chemistry and air quality. However, quantitative information on chlorine emissions from BB, particularly the long-term trend and associated atmospheric impacts, is limited both on regional and global scales. Here, we report a long-term (2001–2018) high-resolution BB emission inventory for the major chlorine-containing compounds (HCl, chloride, and CH 3 Cl) in Asia based on satellite observations. We estimate an average of 730 Gg yr −1 chlorine emitted from BB activity in Asia, with China contributing the largest share at 24.2% (177 Gg yr −1 ), followed by Myanmar at 18.7% and India at 18.3%. Distinct seasonal patterns and significant spatial and interannual variability are observed, mainly driven by human-mediated changes in agricultural activity. By incorporating the newly developed chlorine emission inventory into a global chemistry-climate model (CAM-Chem), we find that the BB-chlorine emissions lead to elevated levels of HCl and CH 3 Cl (monthly average up to 2062 and 1421 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), respectively), subsequently resulting in noticeable changes in oxidants (up to 3.1% in O 3 and 17% in OH radicals). The results demonstrate that BB is not only a significant source of air pollutants but also of oxidants, suggesting a larger role of BB emissions in the atmospheric chemistry and oxidation process than previously appreciated. In light of the projected increase in BB activity toward the end of the century and the extensive control of anthropogenic emissions worldwide, the contribution of BB emissions may become fundamental to air quality composition in the future.},

  abstract     = {It remains debatable how many genes and how various the mechanisms are behind human adaptation to extreme environments, such as high altitudes. Despite extensive studies on Tibetans, Andeans and Ethiopians, new insights are expected to be provided with careful analysis of underrepresented highlanders living in a different geographical region, such as the Tajiks, who reside on the Pamir Plateau at an average altitude exceeding 4000 meters. Moreover, genetic admixture, as we observed in the current whole-genome deep-sequencing study of Xinjiang Tajiks (XJT), offers a unique opportunity to explore how admixture may facilitate adaptation to high-altitude environments. Compared with other extensively studied highlanders, XJT showed pronounced admixture patterns: most of their ancestry are derived from West Eurasians (34.5%–48.3%) and South Asians (21.4%–40.0%), and some minor ancestry from East Asians and Siberians (3.62%–17.5%). The greater genetic diversity in XJT than in their ancestral source populations provides a genetic basis for their adaptation to high-altitude environments. The admixture gain of functional adaptive components from ancestral populations could facilitate adaptation to high-altitude environments. Specifically, admixture-facilitated adaptation was strongly associated with skin-related candidate genes that respond to UV radiation (e.g. HERC2 and BNC2 ) and cardiovascular-system-related genes (e.g. MPI and BEST1 ). Notably, no adaptive variants of genes showing outstanding natural selection signatures in the Tibetan or Andean highlanders were identified in XJT, including EPAS1 and EGLN1 , indicating that a different set of genes contributed to XJT&#39;s survival on the Pamir Plateau, although some genes underlying natural selection in XJT have been previously reported in other highlanders. Our results highlight the unique genetic adaptations in XJT and propose that admixture may play a vital role in facilitating high-altitude adaptation. By introducing and elevating diversity, admixture likely induces novel genetic factors that contribute to the survival of populations in extreme environments like the highlands.},

  abstract     = {Physical science has undergone an evolutional transition in research focus from solid bulks to surfaces, culminating in numerous prominent achievements. Currently, it is experiencing a new exploratory phase—interfacial science. Many a technology with a tremendous impact is closely associated with a functional interface which delineates the boundary between disparate materials or phases, evokes complexities that surpass its pristine comprising surfaces, and thereby unveils a plethora of distinctive properties. Such an interface may generate completely new or significantly enhanced properties. These specific properties are closely related to the interfacial states formed at the interfaces. Therefore, establishing a quantitative relationship between the interfacial states and their functionalities has become a key scientific issue in interfacial science. However, interfacial science also faces several challenges such as invisibility in characterization, inaccuracy in calculation, and difficulty in precise construction. To tackle these challenges, people must develop new strategies for precise detection, accurate computation, and meticulous construction of functional interfaces. Such strategies are anticipated to provide a comprehensive toolbox tailored for future interfacial science explorations and thereby lay a solid scientific foundation for several key future technologies.},

Based on the electrostatic interaction between periodically arranged atoms, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd derivatives of interatomic potential, respectively, enable a prediction of ten kinds in total of mechanical, acoustical and thermal properties. Over a thousand measurements are collected from ∼500 literatures, this results in the symmetric mean percentage error (SMPE) within ±25% and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) ranging from 22%∼74% across all properties predicted, which further enables a revelation of bond characteristics as the most important but implicit origin for functionalities.},

For atmospheric mercury, which is a globally transported neurotoxin, much less is known about the long-term changes in its concentrations and anthropogenic emissions in China. In this study, over a decade of continuous observations at four Chinese sites show that gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentrations continuously increased until the early 2010s, followed by significant declines at rates of 1.8%–6.1% yr −1 until 2022. The GEM decline from 2013 to 2022 (by 38.6% ± 12.7%) coincided with the decreasing concentrations of criteria air pollutants in China and were larger than those observed elsewhere in the northern hemisphere (5.7%–14.2%). The co-benefits of emission control measures contributed to the reduced anthropogenic Hg emissions and led to the GEM decline in China. We estimated that anthropogenic GEM emissions in China were reduced by 38%–50% (116–151 tons) from 2013 to 2022 using the machine-learning and relationship models.},

When employed in organic solar cells (OSCs) with PBDB-T as the donor material, P-2BTh-F -based devices demonstrate an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11%, exceeding the 8.7% achieved by P-2BTh -based devices. Furthermore, all-polymer solar cells utilizing PBDB-T: P-2BTh-F exhibit superior storage stability. Additionally, P-2BTh-F was explored as a functional additive in a high-performance binary system, enhancing stability while maintaining comparable PCE (19.45%).

Until recently the Hoh-Xil Basin remained uncovered by seismic networks due to inaccessibility. Here, based on linear seismic arrays across the Hoh-Xil Basin, we present a three-dimensional S-wave velocity (V S ) model of the crust and uppermost mantle structure beneath the Tibetan Plateau from ambient noise tomography. This model exhibits a widespread partially molten crust in the northern Tibetan Plateau but only isolated pockets in the south manifested as low-V S anomalies in the middle crust. The spatial correlation of the widespread low-V S anomalies with strong uppermost mantle low-V S anomalies and young exposed magmatic rocks in the Hoh-Xil Basin suggests that the plateau grew through lithospheric mantle removal and its driven magmatism.},

Controlling JT distortions and their corresponding electronic structures is highly desirable to tailor the functionalities of materials. Here, we propose a local coordinate strategy to regulate the JTE through quantifying occupancy in the d z 2 and d x 2 − y 2 orbitals of Mn and scrutinizing the symmetries of the ligand oxygen atoms in MnO 6 octahedra in LiMn 2 O 4 and Li 0.5 Mn 2 O 4 . The effectiveness of such a strategy has been demonstrated by constructing P2-type NaLi x Mn 1 – x O 2 oxides with different Li/Mn ordering schemes. In addition, this strategy is also tenable for most 3d transition-metal compounds in spinel and perovskite frameworks, indicating the universality of local coordinate strategy and the tunability of the lattice–orbital coupling in transition-metal oxides. This work demonstrates a useful strategy to regulate JT distortion and provides useful guidelines for future design of functional materials with specific physical properties.},

  abstract     = {Ni-rich LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 (NCM xyz, x + y + z = 1, x ≥ 0.8) layered oxide materials are considered the main cathode materials for high-energy-density Li-ion batteries. However, the endless cracking of polycrystalline NCM materials caused by stress accelerates the loss of active materials and electrolyte decomposition, limiting the cycle life. Hence, understanding the chemo-mechanical evolution during (de)lithiation of NCM materials is crucial to performance improvement. In this work, an optical fiber with με resolution is designed to in operando detect the stress evolution of a polycrystalline LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (P-NCM811) cathode during cycling. By integrating the sensor inside the cathode, the stress variation of P-NCM811 is completely transferred to the optical fiber. We find that the anisotropy of primary particles leads to the appearance of structural stress, inducing the formation of microcracks in polycrystalline particles, which is the main reason for capacity decay. The isotropy of primary particles reduces the structural stress of polycrystalline particles, eliminating the generation of microcracks. Accordingly, the P-NCM811 with an ordered arrangement structure delivered high electrochemical performance with capacity retention of 82% over 500 cycles. This work provides a brand-new perspective with regard to understanding the operando chemo-mechanical evolution of NCM materials during battery operation, and guides the design of electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.},

Here we report a theoretical study on an SCC of Ru 3 @Mo 2 CO 2 MXene for N 2 -to-NH 3 thermal conversion. Our results show that Ru 3 @Mo 2 CO 2 can effectively activate N 2 and promotes its conversion to NH 3 through an association mechanism, in which the rate-determining step of NH 2 * + H* → NH 3 * has a low energy barrier of 1.29 eV. Notably, with the assistance of Mo 2 CO 2 support, the positively charged Ru 3 cluster active site can effectively adsorb and activate N 2 , leading to 0.74 |e| charge transfer from Ru 3 @Mo 2 CO 2 to the adsorbed N 2 . The supported Ru 3 also acts as an electron reservoir to regulate the charge transfer for various intermediate steps of ammonia synthesis. Microkinetic analysis shows that the turnover frequency of the N 2 -to-NH 3 conversion on Ru 3 @Mo 2 CO 2 is as high as 1.45 × 10 −2 s −1 site −1 at a selected thermodynamic condition of 48 bar and 700 K, the performance of which even surpasses that of the Ru B5 site and Fe 3 /θ-Al 2 O 3 (010) reported before.

Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), among various hyperpolarization methods, has gained prominence for its efficacy in real-time monitoring of metabolism and physiology. By administering a hyperpolarized substrate through dissolution DNP (dDNP), the biodistribution and metabolic changes of the DNP agent can be visualized spatiotemporally. This approach proves to be a distinctive and invaluable tool for non-invasively studying cellular metabolism in vivo , particularly in animal models. Biomarkers play a pivotal role in influencing the growth and metastasis of tumor cells by closely interacting with them, and accordingly detecting pathological alterations of these biomarkers is crucial for disease diagnosis and therapy. In recent years, a range of hyperpolarized DNP molecular bioresponsive agents utilizing various nuclei, such as 13 C, 15 N, 31 P, 89 Y, etc., have been developed. In this context, we explore how these magnetic resonance signals of nuclear spins enhanced by DNP respond to biomarkers, including pH, metal ions, enzymes, or redox processes. This review aims to offer insights into the design principles of responsive DNP agents, target selection, and the mechanisms of action for imaging. Such discussions aim to propel the future development and application of DNP-based biomedical imaging agents.},

A common consensus has been reached that surgical procedures are to become less traumatic and with the implementation of more intelligence and higher autonomy, which is a serious challenge faced by the environmental sensing capabilities of robotic systems. One of the main sources of environmental information for robots are images, which are the basis of robot vision. In this review article, we divide clinical image into direct and indirect based on the object of information acquisition, and into continuous, intermittent continuous, and discontinuous according to the target-tracking frequency. The characteristics and applications of the existing surgical robots in each category are introduced based on these two dimensions. Our purpose in conducting this review was to analyze, summarize, and discuss the current evidence on the general rules on the application of image technologies for medical purposes. Our analysis gives insight and provides guidance conducive to the development of more advanced surgical robotics systems in the future.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of waves within a waveguide can enable directional transmission of signals, which has found wide applications in communication, imaging, and signal isolation. Extending this concept to static systems, where material deformation is piled up along a spatial trajectory, remains elusive due to the sensitivity of localized deformation to structural defects and impurities. Here, we propose a general framework to characterize localized static deformation responses in two-dimensional generic static mechanical metamaterials, by exploiting the duality between space in static systems and time in one-dimensional non-reciprocal wave systems. An internal time-reverse symmetry is developed by the space-time duality. Upon breaking this symmetry, quasi-static load-induced deformation can be guided to travel along a designated path, thereby realizing a stress guide. A combination of time-reverse and inversion symmetries discloses the parity-time symmetry inherent in static systems, which can be leveraged to achieve directional deformation shielding. The tailorable stress guides can find applications in various scenarios, ranging from stress shielding and energy harvesting in structural tasks to information processing in mechanical computing devices.},

  abstract     = {The stability of complex systems is profoundly affected by underlying structures, which are often modeled as networks where nodes indicate system components and edges indicate pairwise interactions between nodes. However, such networks cannot encode the overall complexity of networked systems with higher-order interactions among more than two nodes. Set structures provide a natural description of pairwise and higher-order interactions where nodes are grouped into multiple sets based on their shared traits. Here we derive the stability criteria for networked systems with higher-order interactions by employing set structures. In particular, we provide a simple rule showing that the higher-order interactions play a double-sided role in community stability—networked systems with set structures are stabilized if the expected number of common sets for any two nodes is less than one. Moreover, although previous knowledge suggests that more interactions (i.e. complexity) destabilize networked systems, we report that, with higher-order interactions, networked systems can be stabilized by forming more local sets. Our findings are robust with respect to degree heterogeneous structures, diverse equilibrium states and interaction types.},

  abstract     = {Although magnetism undoubtedly influences life on Earth, the science behind biological magnetic sensing is largely a mystery, and it has proved challenging, especially in the life sciences, to harness the interactions of magnetic fields (MFs) with matter to achieve specific ends. Using the well-established radical pair (RP) mechanism, we here demonstrate a bottom-up strategy for the exploitation of MF effects in living cells by translating knowledge from studies of RP reactions performed in vitro . We found an unprecedented MF dependence of the reactivity of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) towards electron-rich substrates ( S ) such as anthracene, lipids and iodide, in which [ S ˙+ O 2 ˙− ] RPs are formed as a basis for MFs influencing molecular redox events in biological systems. The close similarity of the observed MF effects on the biologically relevant process of lipid peroxidation in solution, in membrane mimics and in living cells, shows that MFs can reliably be used to manipulate 1 O 2 -induced cytotoxicity and cell-apoptosis-related protein expression. These findings led to a ‘proof-of-concept’ study on MF-assisted photodynamic therapy in vivo , highlighting the potential of MFs as a non-invasive tool for controlling cellular events.},

  abstract     = {The current-carrying friction characteristics are crucial for the performance of a sliding electrical contact, which plays critical roles in numerous electrical machines and devices. However, these characteristics are influenced by multiple factors such as material surface quality, chemical reactions, and atmospheric environment, leading to a challenge for researchers to comprehensively consider these impacts. Structural superlubricity (SSL), a state of nearly zero friction and no wear between contact solid surfaces, provides an ideal experimental system for these studies. Here, with microscale graphite flakes on atomic-flattened Au surface under applied voltages, we observed two opposite friction phenomena, depending only on whether the edge of graphite flake was in contact with the Au substrate. When in contact the friction force would increase with an increasing voltage, otherwise, the friction force would decrease. Notably, when the voltage was turned off, the friction force quickly recovered to its original level, indicating the absence of wear. Through atmosphere control and molecular dynamics simulations, we revealed the mechanism to be the different roles played by the water molecules confined at the interface or adsorbed near the edges. Our experimental results demonstrate the remarkable tunable and robust frictional properties of SSL under an electrical field, providing an ideal system for the fundamental research of not only sliding electrical contacts, but also novel devices which demand tunable frictions.},

NAS has demonstrated its capability of dramatic performance improvement across a large number of real-world tasks. The core components in NAS methodologies normally include (i) defining the appropriate search space, (ii) designing the right search strategy and (iii) developing the effective evaluation mechanism. Although early NAS endeavors are characterized via groundbreaking architecture designs, the imposed exorbitant computational demands prompt a shift towards more efficient paradigms such as weight sharing and evaluation estimation, etc. Concurrently, the introduction of specialized benchmarks has paved the way for standardized comparisons of NAS techniques. Notably, the adaptability of NAS is evidenced by its capability of extending to diverse datasets, including graphs, tabular data and videos, etc., each of which requires a tailored configuration.

  abstract     = {Plastics, fibers and rubber are three mainstream synthetic materials that are essential to our daily lives and contribute significantly to the quality of our lives. The production of the monomers of these synthetic polymers usually involves oxidation or ammoximation reactions of olefins and analogues. However, the utilization of C, O and N atoms in current industrial processes is &lt;80%, which represents the most environmentally polluting processes for the production of basic chemicals. Through innovation and integration of catalytic materials, new reaction pathways, and reaction engineering, the Research Institute of Petroleum Processing, Sinopec Co., Ltd. (RIPP) and its collaborators have developed unique H 2 O 2 -centered oxidation/ammoximation technologies for olefins and analogues, which has resulted in a ¥500 billion emerging industry and driven trillions of ¥s&#39; worth of downstream industries. The chemical and engineering bases of the production technologies mainly involve the integration of slurry-bed reactors and microsphere catalysts to enhance H 2 O 2 production, H 2 O 2 propylene/chloropropylene epoxidation for the production of propylene oxide/epichlorohydrin, and integration of H 2 O 2 cyclohexanone ammoximation and membrane separation to innovate the caprolactam production process. This review briefly summarizes the whole process from the acquisition of scientific knowledge to the formation of an industrial production technology by RIPP. Moreover, the scientific frontiers of H 2 O 2 production and related oxidation/ammoximation processes of olefins and analogues are reviewed, and new technological growth points are envisaged, with the aim of maintaining China&#39;s standing as a leader in the development of the science and technologies of H 2 O 2 production and utilization.},

Herein, inspired by the selectivity filter structure of the KcsA potassium channel, we propose a design of biomimetic potassium nanochannels by functionalizing the wall of carbon nanotubes with an array of arranged carbonyl oxygen atoms. Our extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that the biomimetic nanochannel exhibits a high K + permeation rate along with a high K + /Na + selectivity ratio. The free energy calculations suggest that the low Na + permeability is the result of the higher energy barrier for Na + than K + at the channel entrance and ion binding sites. In addition, reducing the number of ion binding sites leads to an increase in the permeation rate but a decrease in selectivity. These findings not only hold promise for the design of high-performance membranes but also help understand the mechanism of selective ion transport in biological ion channels.},

To help clarify this unusual plume–rift relationship and to better establish the region affected by the Keweenaw mantle plume, we present the first electrical resistivity model of the MCR derived from 3D inversion of EarthScope USArray and Lithoprobe magnetotelluric (MT) data, extending northwards into the Archean Superior Province. Our model shows a prominent highly conductive anomaly trending NW-SE at the base of Western Superior&#39;s cratonic lithospheric mantle, cross-cutting and extending for over 300 km on both sides of the western rift branch. We propose that this anomaly reflects the ancient signature of a plume trail, resulting from metasomatism and/or partial melting of the sulfide-rich basal lithospheric mantle during impingement of the Keweenaw mantle plume.},

Nevertheless, the sluggish diffusion kinetics of highly polarized Mg 2+ in host lattices severely hinders the development of RMBs. Herein, we report an electron injection strategy for modulating the Mo 4d-orbital splitting manner and first fabricate a dual-phase MoO 2.8 F 0.2 /MoO 2.4 F 0.6 heterostructure to accelerate Mg 2+ diffusion. The electron injection strategy triggers weak Jahn–Teller distortion in MoO 6 octahedra and reorganization of the Mo 4d-orbital, leading to a partial phase transition from orthorhombic phase MoO 2.8 F 0.2 to cubic phase MoO 2.4 F 0.6 . As a result, the designed heterostructure generates a built-in electric field, simultaneously improving its electronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity by at least one order of magnitude compared to MoO 2.8 F 0.2 and MoO 2.4 F 0.6 . Importantly, the assembled MoO 2.8 F 0.2 /MoO 2.4 F 0.6 //Mg full cell exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity of 172.5 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , pushing forward the orbital-scale manipulation for high-performance RMBs.},

  abstract     = {An increase in atmospheric p O 2 has been proposed as a trigger for the Cambrian Explosion at ∼539–514 Ma but the mechanistic linkage remains unclear. To gain insights into marine habitability for the Cambrian Explosion, we analysed excess Ba contents (Ba excess ) and isotope compositions (δ 138 Ba excess ) of ∼521-Myr-old metalliferous black shales in South China. The δ 138 Ba excess values vary within a large range and show a negative logarithmic correlation with Ba excess , suggesting a major (&gt;99%) drawdown of oceanic Ba inventory via barite precipitation. Spatial variations in Ba excess and δ 138 Ba excess indicate that Ba removal was driven by sulfate availability that was ultimately derived from the upwelling of deep seawaters. Global oceanic oxygenation across the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition may have increased the sulfate reservoir via oxidation of sulfide and concurrently decreased the Ba reservoir by barite precipitation. The removal of both H 2 S and Ba that are deleterious to animals could have improved marine habitability for early animals.},

Herein, we design a series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes containing bioactive β-carboline derivatives as ligands for anticancer evaluation, among which Ru5 shows suitable lipophilicity, high aqueous solubility, relatively high anticancer activity and cancer cell selectivity. The subsequent utilization of a photo-clickable probe, Ru5a , serves to validate the significance of ATP synthase as a crucial target for Ru5 through photoaffinity-based protein profiling. Ru5 accumulates in mitochondria, impairs mitochondrial functions and induces mitophagy and ferroptosis. Combined analysis of mitochondrial proteomics and RNA-sequencing shows that Ru5 significantly downregulates the expression of the chloride channel protein, and influences genes related to ferroptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally, we prove that Ru5 exhibits higher anticancer efficacy than cisplatin in vivo . We firstly identify the molecular targets of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes using a photo-click proteomic method coupled with a multiomics approach, which provides an innovative strategy to elucidate the anticancer mechanisms of metallo-anticancer candidates.},

  abstract     = {Platinum-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) play a vital role as electrocatalysts in a range of energy and environmental technologies, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the synthesis of IMCs necessitates recombination of ordered Pt-M metallic bonds with high temperature driving, which is generally accompanied by side effects for catalysts’ structure and performance. In this work, we highlight that semimetal atoms can trigger covalent interactions to break the synthesis-temperature limitation of platinum-based intermetallic compounds and benefit fuel-cell electrocatalysis. Attributed to partial fillings of p-block in semimetal elements, the strong covalent interaction of d-p π backbonding can benefit the recombination of ordered Pt-M metallic bonds (PtGe, PtSb and PtTe) in the synthesis process. Moreover, this covalent interaction in metallic states can further promote both electron transport and orbital fillings of active sites in fuel cells. The semimetal-Pt IMCs were obtained with a temperature 300 K lower than that needed for the synthesis of metal-Pt intermetallic compounds and reached the highest CO-tolerant oxygen reduction activity (0.794 A mg −1 at 0.9 V and 5.1% decay under CO poisoning) among reported electrocatalysts. We anticipate that semimetal-Pt IMCs will offer new insights for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for fuel cells.},

However, the continuous dead MnO 2 and unstable Mn 2+ /MnO 2 electrolysis pose challenges to the practical output energy and lifespan. Herein, we demonstrate bifunctional cationic redox mediation and catalysis kinetics metrics to rescue dead MnO 2 and construct a stable and fast electrolytic Zn–Mn redox-flow battery (eZMRFB). Spectroscopic characterizations and electrochemical evaluation reveal the superior mediation kinetics of a cationic Fe 2+ redox mediator compared with the anionic ones (e.g. I – and Br – ), thus eliminating dead MnO 2 effectively. With intensified oxygen vacancies, density functional theory simulations of the reaction pathways further verify the concomitant Fe-catalysed Mn 2+ /MnO 2 electrolysis kinetics via charge delocalization and activated O 2p electron states, boosting its rate capability. As a result, the elaborated eZMRFB achieves a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, ultra-high areal capacity of 80 mAh cm –2 , rate capability of 20 C and a long lifespan of 2500 cycles.

  abstract     = {Swarming, as a special form of mating aggregation, is most noteworthy in insects of the orders Ephemeroptera, Diptera, and Trichoptera. Swarming in extant trichopterans is well understood in terms of sex composition, specific mating behaviors, and functional morphological specializations of adults, but an exploration of the evolution of such aggregative behaviors is hampered by the dearth of available examples from the fossil record as well as the ability to reliably distinguish the few gatherings as the result of swarming relative to other taphonomic or behavioral factors. Herein we describe five new fossil species of caddisflies preserved in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, all preserved as large aggregations. Monospecific aggregations of these five new species can be positively identified as swarms based on morphological traits of wing shape, as well as the presence of particular forms of sexual dimorphism. Results of a phylogenetic reconstruction of both molecular and morphological data as well as ancestral-trait reconstructions and tip-dating analyses indicate that swarming was likely present in the Triassic as a feature of the trichopteran groundplan. Since most Mesozoic insectivorous predators were diurnal based on morphological evidence, largely nocturnal caddisflies would have been freed from such pressures. The phylogeny also shows a correlation between the rise of nocturnal bat predators from the Paleocene or early Eocene and the repeated loss of swarming from various clades of caddisflies, revealing the potential impact of bat predation on reshaping the behavioral landscape of Trichoptera during the Cenozoic.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis involves hyperactivated stromal cells that recruit immune cells, exacerbating inflammation. This study presents an ATP-responsive metal–organic framework (Mg/Zn-MOF) designed for periodontitis treatment, utilizing ion interference to modulate immune responses and prevent tissue destruction. Addressing the challenges of synergistic ion effects and targeted delivery faced by traditional immunomodulatory nanomaterials, the Mg/Zn-MOF system is activated by extracellular ATP—a pivotal molecule in periodontitis pathology—ensuring targeted ion release. Magnesium and zinc ions released from the framework synergistically inhibit membrane pore formation by attenuating Gasdermin D (GSDMD) expression and activation. This action curtails pyroptosis, lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β release, thwarting the onset of inflammatory cascades. Mechanistically, Mg/Zn-MOF intervenes in both the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD and Caspase-11/GSDMD pathways to mitigate pyroptosis. In vivo assessments confirm its effectiveness in diminishing inflammatory cell infiltration and preserving collagen integrity, thereby safeguarding against periodontal tissue damage and bone loss. This investigation highlights the promise of ion-interference strategies in periodontitis immunotherapy, representing a significant stride in developing targeted therapeutic approaches.},

  abstract     = {The unprecedented surge in global methane levels has raised global concerns in recent years, casting a spotlight on China as a pivotal emitter. China has taken several actions to curb the methane emissions, but their effects remain unclear. Here, we developed the Global ObservatioN-based system for monitoring Greenhouse GAses for methane (GONGGA-CH 4 ) and assimilate GOSAT XCH 4 observations to assess changes in China&#39;s methane emissions. We find the average rate of increase in China&#39;s methane emissions (0.1 ± 0.3 Tg CH 4 yr −2 ) during 2016–2021 slowed down compared to the preceding years (2011–2015) (0.9 ± 0.5 Tg CH 4 yr −2 ), in contrast to the concurrent acceleration of global methane emissions. As a result, the contribution of China to global methane emissions dropped significantly. Notably, the slowdown of China&#39;s methane emission is mainly attributable to a reduction in biogenic emissions from wetlands and agriculture, associated with the drying trend in South China and the transition from double-season to single-season rice cropping, while fossil fuel emissions are still increasing. Our results suggest that GONGGA-CH 4 provides the opportunity for independent assessment of China&#39;s methane emissions from an atmospheric perspective, providing insights into the implementation of methane-related policies that align with its ambitious climate objectives.},

  abstract     = {The multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population is characterized with great potentials in power and resolution of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, but single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GWAS does not fully reach its potential. In this study, a MAGIC population of 1021 lines was developed from four Xian and four Geng varieties from five subgroups of rice. A total of 44 000 genes showed functional polymorphisms among eight parents, including frameshift variations or premature stop codon variations, which provides the potential to map almost all genes of the MAGIC population. Principal component analysis results showed that the MAGIC population had a weak population structure. A high-density bin map of 24 414 bins was constructed. Segregation distortion occurred in the regions possessing the genes underlying genetic incompatibility and gamete development. SNP-based association analysis and bin-based linkage analysis identified 25 significant loci and 47 QTLs for heading date, including 14 known heading date genes. The mapping resolution of genes is dependent on genetic effects with offset distances of &lt;55 kb for major effect genes and &lt;123 kb for moderate effect genes. Four causal variants and noncoding structure variants were identified to be associated with heading date. Three to four types of alleles with strong, intermediate, weak, and no genetic effects were identified from eight parents, providing flexibility for the improvement of rice heading date. In most cases, japonica rice carries weak alleles, and indica rice carries strong alleles and nonfunctional alleles. These results confirm that the MAGIC population provides the exceptional opportunity to detect QTLs, and its use is encouraged for mapping genes and mining favorable alleles for breeding.},

  abstract     = {The coupling of high-capacity cathodes and lithium metal anodes promises to be the next generation of high-energy-density batteries. However, the fast-structural degradations of the cathode and anode challenge their practical application. Herein, we synthesize an electrolyte additive, tris(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl) borane (TPFPB), for ultra-stable lithium (Li) metal||Ni-rich layered oxide batteries. It can be preferentially adsorbed on the cathode surface to form a stable (B and F)-rich cathode electrolyte interface film, which greatly suppresses the electrolyte-cathode side reactions and improves the stability of the cathode. In addition, the electrophilicity of B atoms in TPFPB enhances the solubility of LiNO 3 by 30 times in ester electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of the Li metal anode. Thus, the Li||Ni-rich layered oxide full batteries using TPFPB show high stability and an ultralong cycle life (up to 1500 cycles), which also present excellent performance even under high voltage (4.8 V), high areal mass loading (30 mg cm −2 ) and wide temperature range (−30∼60°C). The Li||LiNi 0.9 Co 0.05 Mn 0.05 O 2 (NCM90) pouch cell using TPFPB with a capacity of 3.1 Ah reaches a high energy density of 420 Wh kg −1 at 0.1 C and presents outstanding cycling performance.},

  abstract     = {Both the catalyst and electrolyte strongly impact the performance of CO 2 electrolysis. Despite substantial progress in catalysts, it remains highly challenging to tailor electrolyte compositions and understand their functions at the catalyst interface. Here, we report that the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and its analogs, featuring strong Lewis acid-base interaction with metal cations, are selected as electrolyte additives to reshape the catalyst-electrolyte interface for promoting CO 2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that EDTA molecules are dynamically assembled toward interface regions in response to bias potential due to strong Lewis acid-base interaction of EDTA 4– -K + . As a result, the original hydrogen-bond network among interfacial H 2 O is disrupted, and a hydrogen-bond gap layer at the electrified interface is established. The EDTA-reshaped K + solvation structure promotes the protonation of *CO 2 to *COOH and suppressing *H 2 O dissociation to *H, thereby boosting the co-electrolysis of CO 2 and H 2 O toward carbon-based products. In particular, when 5 mM of EDTA is added into the electrolytes, the Faradaic efficiency of CO on the commercial Ag nanoparticle catalyst is increased from 57.0% to 90.0% at an industry-relevant current density of 500 mA cm −2 . More importantly, the Lewis-base ligand-reshaped interface allows a range of catalysts (Ag, Zn, Pd, Bi, Sn, and Cu) to deliver substantially increased selectivity of carbon-based products in both H-type and flow-type electrolysis cells.},

  abstract     = {In adult gonads, disruption of somatic sexual identity leads to defective gametogenesis and infertility. However, the underlying mechanisms by which somatic signals regulate germline cells to achieve proper gametogenesis remain unclear. In our previous study, we introduced the chinmo Sex Transformation ( chinmo ST ) mutant Drosophila testis phenotype as a valuable model for investigating the mechanisms underlying sex maintenance. In chinmo ST testes, depletion of the Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription downstream effector Chinmo from somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) feminizes somatic cyst cells and arrests germline differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover chinmo ST -specific cell populations and their transcriptomic changes during sex transformation. Comparative analysis of intercellular communication networks between wild-type and chinmo ST testes revealed disruptions in several soma-germline signaling pathways in chinmo ST testes. Notably, the insulin signaling pathway exhibited significant enhancement in germline stem cells (GSCs). Chinmo cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) assay revealed that Chinmo directly regulates two male sex determination factors, doublesex ( dsx ) and fruitless ( fru ), as well as Ecdysone-inducible gene L2 ( ImpL2 ), a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway. Further genetic manipulations confirmed that the impaired gametogenesis observed in chinmo ST testes was partly contributed by dysregulation of the insulin signaling pathway. In summary, our study demonstrates that somatic sex maintenance promotes normal spermatogenesis through Chinmo-mediated conserved sex determination and the insulin signaling pathway. Our work offers new insights into the complex mechanisms of somatic stem cell sex maintenance and soma-germline communication at the single-cell level. Additionally, our discoveries highlight the potential significance of stem cell sex instability as a novel mechanism contributing to testicular tumorigenesis.},

  abstract     = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for higher-level cognitive functions. How epigenetic dynamics participates in PFC development and aging is largely unknown. Here, we profiled epigenomic landscapes of rhesus monkey PFCs from prenatal to aging stages. The dynamics of chromatin states, including higher-order chromatin structure, chromatin interaction and histone modifications are coordinated to regulate stage-specific gene transcription, participating in distinct processes of neurodevelopment. Dramatic changes of epigenetic signals occur around the birth stage. Notably, genes involved in neuronal cell differentiation and layer specification are pre -configured by bivalent promoters. We identified a cis -regulatory module and the transcription factors (TFs) associated with basal radial glia development, which was associated with large brain size in primates. These TFs include GLI3, CREB5 and SOX9. Interestingly, the genes associated with the basal radial glia (bRG)-associated cis -element module, such as SRY and SOX9, are enriched in sex differentiation. Schizophrenia-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are more enriched in super enhancers (SEs) than typical enhancers, suggesting that SEs play an important role in neural network wiring. A cis -regulatory element of DBN1 is identified, which is critical for neuronal cell proliferation and synaptic neuron differentiation. Notably, the loss of distal chromatin interaction and H3K27me3 signal are hallmarks of PFC aging, which are associated with abnormal expression of aging-related genes and transposon activation, respectively. Collectively, our findings shed light on epigenetic mechanisms underlying primate brain development and aging.},

  abstract     = {Thickening of electrodes is crucial for maximizing the proportion of active components and thus improving the energy density of practical energy storage cells. Nevertheless, trade-offs between electrode thickness and electrochemical performance persist because of the considerably increased ion transport resistance of thick electrodes. Herein, we propose accelerating ion transport through thick and dense electrodes by establishing an immobile polyanionic backbone within the electrode pores; and as a proof of concept, gel polyacrylic electrolytes as such a backbone are in situ synthesized for supercapacitors. During charge and discharge, protons rapidly hop among RCOO − sites for oriented transport, fundamentally reducing the effects of electrode tortuosity and polarization resulting from concentration gradients. Consequently, nearly constant ion transport resistance per unit thickness is achieved, even in the case of a 900-μm-thick dense electrode, leading to unprecedented areal capacitances of 14.85 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 and 4.26 F cm −2 at 100 mA cm −2 . This study provides an efficient method for accelerating ion transport through thick and dense electrodes, indicating a significant solution for achieving high energy density in energy storage devices, including but not limited to supercapacitors.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting infinite-layer (IL) nickelates offer a new platform for investigating the long-standing problem of high-temperature superconductivity. Many models were proposed to understand the superconducting mechanism of nickelates based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past five years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here we fill this gap by directly resolving the electronic structures of the parent compound LaNiO 2 and superconducting La 0.8 Ca 0.2 NiO 2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that their Fermi surfaces consist of a quasi-2D hole pocket and a 3D electron pocket at the Brillouin zone corner, whose volumes change upon Ca doping. The Fermi surface topology and band dispersion of the hole pocket closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates. However, the cuprate-like band exhibits significantly higher hole doping in superconducting La 0.8 Ca 0.2 NiO 2 compared to superconducting cuprates, highlighting the disparities in the electronic states of the superconducting phase. Our observations highlight the novel aspects of the IL nickelates, and pave the way toward the microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {A major impediment to the development of the efficient use of artificial photosynthesis is the lack of highly selective and efficient photocatalysts toward the conversion of CO 2 by sunlight energy at room temperature and ambient pressure. After many years of hard work, we finally completed the synthesis of graphdiyne-based palladium quantum dot catalysts containing high-density metal atom steps for selective artificial photosynthesis. The well-designed interface structure of the catalyst is composed of electron-donor and acceptor groups, resulting in the obvious incomplete charge-transfer phenomenon between graphdiyne and plasmonic metal nanostructures on the interface. These intrinsic characteristics are the origin of the high performance of the catalyst. Studies on its mechanism reveal that the synergism between ‘hot electron’ from local surface plasmon resonance and rapid photogenerated carrier separation at the ohmic contact interface accelerates the multi-electron reaction kinetics. The catalyst can selectively synthesize CH 4 directly from CO 2 and H 2 O with selectivity of near 100% at room temperature and pressure, and exhibits transformative performance, with an average CH 4 yield of 26.2 μmol g −1 h −1 and remarkable long-term stability.},

The synthetic and individual TPs operated in the coupled and decoupled states enable controllable on-chip modular TP transitions and subchannel switching. Two time-frequency interleaved subchannels support 10- and 12-Gbit/s QAM-16 high-speed data streams along corresponding paths over carriers of 120 and 130 GHz with 2.5- and 3-GHz bandwidths, respectively.

Here we report the observation of an induced large magnetic moment at high-quality nitride S/F interfaces. Using polarized neutron reflectometry and DC SQUID measurements, we quantitatively determined the magnetization profile of the S/F bilayer and confirmed that the induced magnetic moment in the adjacent superconductor only exists below T C . Interestingly, the direction of the induced moment in the superconductors was unexpectedly parallel to that in the ferromagnet, which contrasts with earlier findings in S/F heterostructures based on metals or oxides. First-principles calculations verified that the unusual interfacial spin texture observed in our study was caused by the Heisenberg direct exchange coupling with constant J∼4.28 meV through d -orbital overlapping and severe charge transfer across the interfaces. Our work establishes an incisive experimental probe for understanding the magnetic proximity behavior at S/F interfaces and provides a prototype epitaxial ‘building block’ for superconducting spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects ∼50 million people globally. The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, a predominant pathological feature of AD, plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis. In this respect, Aβ has been regarded as a highly promising therapeutic target for AD treatment. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a novel class of metallodrugs being developed as modulators of Aβ aggregation, owing to their negative charge, polarity, and three-dimensional structure. Unlike traditional discrete inorganic complexes, POMs contain tens to hundreds of metal atoms, showcasing remarkable tunability and diversity in nuclearities, sizes, and shapes. The easily adjustable and structurally variable nature of POMs allows for their favorable interactions with Aβ. This mini-review presents a balanced overview of recent progress in using POMs to mitigate amyloidosis. Clear correlations between anti-amyloid activities and structural features of POMs are also elaborated in detail. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects of POMs in combating AD.},

Based on the reversible interaction and polyvalent cerium ions, the Ce–Aln gel, which was mainly composed of ionic coordination and hydrogen bonds, displayed good injectability and autocatalytic amplification of the antioxidant effect. In vitro studies showed that the Ce–Aln gel effectively maintained the biological function of osteoblasts by regulating redox homeostasis and improved the inflammatory microenvironment to enhance the inhibitory effect on osteoclasts. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing further revealed significant downregulation of various metabolic pathways, including apoptosis signaling, hypoxia metabolism and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) signaling via the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway after treatment with the Ce–Aln gel. In vivo experiments showed that the clinical drug-based Ce–Aln gel effectively promoted the tissue repair of osteoporotic bone defects by improving inflammation and inhibiting osteoclast formation at the defect. Notably, in vivo systemic osteoporosis was significantly ameliorated, highlighting the strong potential of clinical translation for precise therapy of bone defects.},

Recently evolved variants differ from ancestors in additional glycosylation within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Details of how the acquisition of glycosylation impacts viral fitness and human adaptation are not clearly understood. Here, we dissected the role of N354-linked glycosylation, acquired by BA.2.86 sub-lineages, as a RBD conformational control element in attenuating viral infectivity. The reduced infectivity is recovered in the presence of heparin sulfate, which targets the ‘N354 pocket’ to ease restrictions of conformational transition resulting in a ‘RBD-up’ state, thereby conferring an adjustable infectivity. Furthermore, N354 glycosylation improved spike cleavage and cell–cell fusion, and in particular escaped one subset of ADCC antibodies. Together with reduced immunogenicity in hybrid immunity background, these indicate a single spike amino acid glycosylation event provides selective advantage in humans through multiple mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Irreversible interfacial reactions at the anodes pose a significant challenge to the long-term stability and lifespan of zinc (Zn) metal batteries, impeding their practical application as energy storage devices. The plating and stripping behavior of Zn ions on polycrystalline surfaces is inherently influenced by the microscopic structure of Zn anodes, a comprehensive understanding of which is crucial but often overlooked. Herein, commercial Zn foils were remodeled through the incorporation of cerium (Ce) elements via the ‘pinning effect’ during the electrodeposition process. By leveraging the electron-donating effect of Ce atoms segregated at grain boundaries (GBs), the electronic configuration of Zn is restructured to increase active sites for Zn nucleation. This facilitates continuous nucleation throughout the growth stage, leading to a high-rate instantaneous-progressive composite nucleation model that achieves a spatially uniform distribution of Zn nuclei and induces spontaneous grain refinement. Moreover, the incorporation of Ce elements elevates the site energy of GBs, mitigating detrimental parasitic reactions by enhancing the GB stability. Consequently, the remodeled ZnCe electrode exhibits highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with an accumulated capacity of up to 4.0 Ah cm −2 in a Zn symmetric cell over 4000 h without short-circuit behavior. Notably, a ∼0.4 Ah Zn||NH 4 V 4 O 10 pouch cell runs over 110 cycles with 83% capacity retention with the high-areal-loading cathode (≈20 mg cm −2 ). This refining-grains strategy offers new insights into designing dendrite-free metal anodes in rechargeable batteries.},

  abstract     = {Immune evasion is a pivotal force shaping the evolution of viruses. Nonetheless, the extent to which virus evolution varies among populations with diverse immune backgrounds remains an unsolved mystery. Prior to the widespread SARS-CoV-2 infections in December 2022 and January 2023, the Chinese population possessed a markedly distinct (less potent) immune background due to its low infection rate, compared to countries experiencing multiple infection waves, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how the virus has evolved under different immune contexts. We compared the mutation spectrum and functional potential of the newly derived mutations that occurred in BA.5.2.48, BF.7.14 and BA.5.2.49—variants prevalent in China—with their counterparts in other countries. We found that the emerging mutations in the receptor-binding-domain region in these lineages were more widely dispersed and evenly distributed across different epitopes. These mutations led to a higher angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding affinity and reduced potential for immune evasion compared to their counterparts in other countries. These findings suggest a milder immune pressure and less evident immune imprinting within the Chinese population. Despite the emergence of numerous immune-evading variants in China, none of them outcompeted the original strain until the arrival of the XBB variant, which had stronger immune evasion and subsequently outcompeted all circulating variants. Our findings demonstrated that the continuously changing immune background led to varying evolutionary pressures on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in addition to viral genome surveillance, immune background surveillance is also imperative for predicting forthcoming mutations and understanding how these variants spread in the population.},

  abstract     = {Endogenous opioid antinociception is a self-regulatory mechanism that reduces chronic pain, but its underlying circuit mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that endogenous opioid antinociception required the activation of mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in GABAergic neurons of the central amygdala nucleus (CEA) in a persistent-hyperalgesia mouse model. Pharmacogenetic suppression of these CEA MOR neurons, which mimics the effect of MOR activation, alleviated the persistent hyperalgesia. Furthermore, single-neuron projection analysis revealed multiple projectome-based subtypes of CEA MOR neurons, each innervating distinct target brain regions. We found that the suppression of axon branches projecting to the parabrachial nucleus (PB) of one subtype of CEA MOR neurons alleviated persistent hyperalgesia, indicating a subtype- and axonal-branch-specific mechanism of action. Further electrophysiological analysis revealed that suppression of a distinct CEA-PB disinhibitory circuit controlled endogenous opioid antinociception. Thus, this study identified the central neural circuit that underlies endogenous opioid antinociception, providing new insight into the endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Despite the discovery of a series of fullerenes and a handful of noncarbon clusters with the typical topology of I h -C 60 , the smallest fullerene with a large degree of curvature, C 20 , and its other-element counterparts are difficult to isolate experimentally. In coinage metal nanoclusters (NCs), the first all-gold fullerene, Au 32 , was discovered after a long-lasting pursuit, but the isolation of similar silvery fullerene structures is still challenging. Herein, we report a flying saucer-shaped 102-nuclei silver NC ( Ag102 ) with a silvery fullerene kernel of Ag 32 , which is embraced by a robust cyclic anionic passivation layer of (KPO 4 ) 10 . This Ag 32 kernel can be viewed as a non-centered icosahedron Ag 12 encaged into a dodecahedron Ag 20 , forming the silvery fullerene of Ag 12 @Ag 20 . The anionic layer (KPO 4 ) 10 is located at the interlayer between the Ag 32 kernel and Ag 70 shell, passivating the Ag 32 silvery fullerene and templating the Ag 70 shell. The t BuPhS − and CF 3 COO − ligands on the silver shell show a regioselective arrangement with the 60 t BuPhS − ligands as expanders covering the upper and lower of the flying saucer and 10 CF 3 COO − as terminators neatly encircling the edges of the structure. In addition, Ag102 shows excellent photothermal conversion efficiency ( η ) from the visible to near-infrared region ( η = 67.1% ± 0.9% at 450 nm, 60.9% ± 0.9% at 660 nm and 50.2% ± 0.5% at 808 nm), rendering it a promising material for photothermal converters and potential application in remote laser ignition. This work not only captures silver kernels with the topology of the smallest fullerene C 20 , but also provides a pathway for incorporating alkali metal (M) into coinage metal NCs via M-oxoanions.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous catalysis promises to accelerate sulfur-involved conversion reactions in lithium-sulfur batteries. Solid-state Li 2 S dissociation remains as the rate-limiting step because of the weakly matched solid-solid electrocatalysis interfaces. We propose an electrochemically molecular-imprinting strategy to have a metal sulfide (MS) catalyst with imprinted defects in positions from which the pre-implanted Li 2 S has been electrochemically removed. Such tailor-made defects enable the catalyst to bind exclusively to Li atoms in Li 2 S reactant and elongate the Li–S bond, thus decreasing the reaction energy barrier during charging. The imprinted Ni 3 S 2 catalyst shows the best activity due to the highest defect concentration among the MS catalysts examined. The Li 2 S oxidation potential is substantially reduced to 2.34 V from 2.96 V for the counterpart free of imprinted vacancies, and an Ah-level pouch cell is realized with excellent cycling performance. With a lean electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 1.80 μL mg S –1 , the cell achieves a benchmarkedly high energy density beyond 500 Wh kg –1 .},

  abstract     = {Ultrasensitive protein identification is of paramount importance in basic research and clinical diagnostics but remains extremely challenging. A key bottleneck in preventing single-molecule protein sequencing is that, unlike the revolutionary nucleic acid sequencing methods that rely on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA and RNA molecules, protein molecules cannot be directly amplified. Decoding the proteins via amplification of certain fingerprints rather than the intact protein sequence thus represents an appealing alternative choice to address this formidable challenge. Herein, we report a proof-of-concept method that relies on residue-resolved DNA barcoding and composition code counting for amplifiable protein fingerprinting (AmproCode). In AmproCode, selective types of residues on peptides or proteins are chemically labeled with a DNA barcode, which can be amplified and quantified via quantitative PCR. The operation generates a relative ratio as the residue-resolved ‘composition code’ for each target protein that can be utilized as the fingerprint to determine its identity from the proteome database. We developed a database searching algorithm and applied it to assess the coverage of the whole proteome and secretome via computational simulations, proving the theoretical feasibility of AmproCode. We then designed the residue-specific DNA barcoding and amplification workflow, and identified different synthetic model peptides found in the secretome at as low as the fmol/L level for demonstration. These results build the foundation for an unprecedented amplifiable protein fingerprinting method. We believe that, in the future, AmproCode could ultimately realize single-molecule amplifiable identification of trace complex samples without further purification, and it may open a new avenue in the development of next-generation protein sequencing techniques.},

  abstract     = {High-voltage aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) with a high-safety near-neutral electrolyte is of great significance for practical sustainable application; however, they suffer from anode and electrode/electrolyte interfacial incompatibility. Herein, a conversion-type anode chemistry with a low anodic potential, which is guided by the Gibbs free energy change of conversion reaction, was designed for high-voltage near-neutral AZIBs. A reversible conversion reaction between ZnC 2 O 4 ·2H 2 O particles and three-dimensional Zn metal networks well-matched in CH 3 COOLi-based electrolyte was revealed. This mechanism can be universally validated in the battery systems with sodium or iodine ions. More importantly, a cathodic crowded micellar electrolyte with a water confinement effect was proposed in which lies the core for the stability and reversibility of the cathode under an operating platform voltage beyond 2.0 V, obtaining a capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles. Remarkably, the scientific and technological challenges from the coin cell to Ah-scale battery, sluggish kinetics of the solid-solid electrode reaction, capacity excitation under high loading of active material, and preparation complexities associated with large-area quasi-solid electrolytes, were explored, successfully achieving an 88% capacity retention under high loading of more than 20 mg cm −2 and particularly a practical 1.1 Ah-level pouch cell.

However, achieving long-lived charge separation in COFs proves challenging due to the rapid charge recombination. Here, we develop a novel strategy by combining [6 + 4] nodes to construct zyg -type 3D COFs, first reported in COF chemistry. This structure type exhibits a fused Olympic-rings-like shape, which provides a platform for stabilizing the photoinduced D-A radical pairs. The zyg -type COFs containing catalytically active moieties such as triphenylamine and phenothiazine (PTZ) show superior photocatalytic production rates of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Significantly, the photochromic radical states of these COFs show up to 400% enhancement in photocatalytic activity compared to the parent states, achieving a remarkable H 2 O 2 synthesis rate of 3324 μmol g −1 h −1 , which makes the PTZ-COF one of the best crystalline porous photocatalysts in H 2 O 2 production.

Here, we successfully fabricate NiS ultrafine nanorods with separated symmetry along two directions. The atomic structure of the nanorod exhibits rotational symmetry in the radial direction, while its axial direction is characterized by divergent translational symmetry, surpassing the conventional crystalline structures known to date. It does not fit the traditional description of the space group and the point group in three dimensions, so we define it as a new structure in which translational symmetry and rotational symmetry are separated. Further corroborating the atomic symmetric separation in the electronic structure, we observed the combination of stripe and vortex magnetic domains in a single nanorod with different directions, in accordance with the atomic structure. The manipulation of nanostructure at the atomic level introduces a novel approach to regulate new properties finely, leading to the proposal of new nanotechnology mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Prokaryotes are ubiquitous in the biosphere, important for human health and drive diverse biological and environmental processes. Systematics of prokaryotes, whose origins can be traced to the discovery of microorganisms in the 17th century, has transitioned from a phenotype-based classification to a more comprehensive polyphasic taxonomy and eventually to the current genome-based taxonomic approach. This transition aligns with a foundational shift from studies focused on phenotypic traits that have limited comparative value to those using genome sequences. In this context, Bergey&#39;s Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria (BMSAB) and Bergey&#39;s International Society for Microbial Systematics (BISMiS) play a pivotal role in guiding prokaryotic systematics. This review focuses on the historical development of prokaryotic systematics with a focus on the roles of BMSAB and BISMiS. We also explore significant contributions and achievements by microbiologists, highlight the latest progress in the field and anticipate challenges and opportunities within prokaryotic systematics. Additionally, we outline five focal points of BISMiS that are aimed at addressing these challenges. In conclusion, our collaborative effort seeks to enhance ongoing advancements in prokaryotic systematics, ensuring its continued relevance and innovative characters in the contemporary landscape of genomics and bioinformatics.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment, but its clinical utility is limited by radioresistance and its inability to target metastases. Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise as high-Z nanoradiosensitizers to enhance radiotherapy and induce immunostimulatory regulation of the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that MOFs could deliver small-molecule therapeutics to synergize with radiotherapy for enhanced antitumor efficacy. Herein, we develop a robust nanoradiosensitizer, GA-MOF, by conjugating a STING agonist, 2′,3′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (GA), on MOFs for synergistic radiosensitization and STING activation. GA-MOF demonstrated strong anticancer efficacy by forming immune-cell-rich nodules (artificial leukocytoid structures) and transforming them into immunostimulatory hotspots with radiotherapy. Further combination with an immune checkpoint blockade suppressed distant tumors through systemic immune activation. Our work not only demonstrates the potent radiosensitization of GA-MOF, but also provides detailed mechanisms regarding MOF distribution, immune regulatory pathways and long-term immune effects.},

In recent decades, frequent rainstorms and droughts have seemingly diminished the misty features of traditional Meiyu–Baiu rainfall. However, there is still no consensus on whether their traditional nature is suspended. In this study, we quantitatively demonstrate that the Meiyu–Baiu almost completely lost their traditional features during 1961–2023, ∼80% of which can be attributed to anthropogenic warming. Furthermore, in a warmer future, the traditional Meiyu–Baiu will be more unlikely to appear. This study underscores the urgency in adapting to climate shift because destructive extremes are measurably taking the place of mild and maternal rains.},

To this end, most existing studies from diverse research domains focus on the disproportionate role played by highly connected ‘hub’ individuals. However, we demonstrate here that information superspreaders in online social media are best understood and predicted by simultaneously considering two individual-level behavioral traits: influence and susceptibility. Specifically, we derive a nonlinear network-based algorithm to quantify individuals’ influence and susceptibility from multiple spreading event data. By applying the algorithm to large-scale data from Twitter and Weibo, we demonstrate that individuals’ estimated influence and susceptibility scores enable predictions of future superspreaders above and beyond network centrality, and reveal new insights into the network positions of the superspreaders.},

  abstract     = {We present EPR-Net, a novel and effective deep learning approach that tackles a crucial challenge in biophysics: constructing potential landscapes for high-dimensional non-equilibrium steady-state systems. EPR-Net leverages a nice mathematical fact that the desired negative potential gradient is simply the orthogonal projection of the driving force of the underlying dynamics in a weighted inner-product space. Remarkably, our loss function has an intimate connection with the steady entropy production rate (EPR), enabling simultaneous landscape construction and EPR estimation. We introduce an enhanced learning strategy for systems with small noise, and extend our framework to include dimensionality reduction and the state-dependent diffusion coefficient case in a unified fashion. Comparative evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the superior accuracy, effectiveness and robustness of EPR-Net compared to existing methods. We apply our approach to challenging biophysical problems, such as an eight-dimensional (8D) limit cycle and a 52D multi-stability problem, which provide accurate solutions and interesting insights on constructed landscapes. With its versatility and power, EPR-Net offers a promising solution for diverse landscape construction problems in biophysics.},

[ Nature 615, 244–250 (2023)] has attracted tremendous attention due to its anticipated great impact on technology. However, the results could not be independently reproduced by other groups worldwide in follow-up studies, which elicited intense controversy. Here, we develop a reliable experimental protocol to minimize the extensively concerned extrinsic influences on the sample by starting the reaction from pure lutetium loaded with an H 2 /N 2 gas mixture in a diamond anvil cell under different pressures and temperatures and simultaneously monitoring the entire chemical reaction process using in situ four-probe resistance measurements. Therefore, we could repeatedly reproduce the near-room temperature upsurge of electrical resistance at a relatively early stage of the chemical reaction. However, the mechanism is suggested to be a metal-to-semiconductor/insulator transition associated with the structural modulation in the non-stoichiometric Lu-H-N, rather than superconductivity.},

In order to further lower the stable pressure and improve superconductivity, researchers have started exploring ternary hydrides and had many achievements in recent years. Here, we discuss recent progress in ternary hydrides, aiming to deepen the understanding of the key factors regulating the structural stability and superconductivity of ternary hydrides, such as structural motifs, bonding features, electronic structures, electron–phonon coupling, etc. Furthermore, the current issues and challenges of superconducting ternary hydrides are presented, together with the prospects and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature superconductivity has been a long-held dream of mankind and a focus of considerable interest in the research field of superconductivity. Significant progress has recently been achieved in hydrogen-based superconductors found in superhydrides (hydrides with unexpectedly high hydrogen contents) that are stabilized under high-pressure conditions and are not capturable at ambient conditions. Of particular interest is the discovery of a class of best-ever-known superconductors in clathrate metal superhydrides that hold the record for high superconductivity (e.g. T c = 250–260 K for LaH 10 ) among known superconductors and have great promise to be those that realize the long-sought room-temperature superconductivity. In these peculiar clathrate superhydrides, hydrogen forms unusual ‘clathrate’ cages containing encaged metal atoms, of which such a kind was first reported in a calcium hexa-superhydride (CaH 6 ) showing a measured high T c of 215 K under a pressure of 170 GPa. In this review, we aim to offer an overview of the current status of research progress on the clathrate metal superhydride superconductors, discuss the superconducting mechanism and highlight the key features (e.g. structure motifs, bonding features, electronic structure, etc.) that govern the high-temperature superconductivity. Future research direction along this line to find room-temperature superconductors will be discussed.},

The diamond anvil cell combined with a laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature. In - situ high pressure transport measurements as a function of temperature with an applied magnetic field were performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature T c 116 K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed the superconducting coherent length of ∼40 Å based on the Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest T c in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main groups IIIA to VIIA in the periodic table.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen is a vital element for life on Earth. Its cycling between the surface (atmosphere + crust) and the mantle has a profound influence on the atmosphere and climate. However, our understanding of the origin and evolution of Earth&#39;s nitrogen is still incomplete. This review presents an overview of the current understanding of Earth&#39;s nitrogen budget and the isotope composition of different reservoirs, laboratory constraints on deep nitrogen geochemistry, and our understanding of the origin of Earth&#39;s nitrogen and the deep nitrogen cycle through plate subduction and volcanism. The Earth may have acquired its nitrogen heterogeneously during the main accretion phase, initially from reduced, enstatite-chondrite-like impactors, and subsequently from increasingly oxidized impactors and minimal CI-chondrite-like materials. Like Earth&#39;s surface, the mantle and core are also significant nitrogen reservoirs. The nitrogen abundance and isotope composition of these three reservoirs may have been fundamentally established during the main accretion phase and have been insignificantly modified afterwards by the deep nitrogen cycle, although there is a net nitrogen ingassing into Earth&#39;s mantle in modern subduction zones. However, it is estimated that the early atmosphere of Earth may have contained ∼1.4 times the present-day atmospheric nitrogen (PAN), with ∼0.4 PAN being sequestered into the crust via biotic nitrogen fixation. In order to gain a better understanding of the origin and evolution of Earth&#39;s nitrogen, directions for future research are suggested.},

Here we assembled 232 chromosome-level genomes based on long-read sequencing data. Coupling the 232 genomes with 15 existing assemblies, we developed a pan-TE map comprising both cultivated and wild Asian rice. We detected 177 084 high-quality TE variations and inferred their derived state using outgroups. We found TEs were one source of phenotypic variation during rice domestication and differentiation. We identified 1246 genes whose expression variation was associated with TEs but not single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as OsRbohB , and validated OsRbohB ’s relative expression activity using a dual-Luciferase (LUC) reporter assays system. Our pan-TE map allowed us to detect multiple novel loci associated with agronomic traits. Collectively, our findings highlight the contributions of TEs to domestication, differentiation and agronomic traits in rice, and there is massive potential for gene cloning and molecular breeding by the high-quality Asian pan-TE map we generated.},

Genetic mutations in lipid metabolism are causative for a subset of patients with Parkinsonism. The role of α-syn&#39;s lipid interactions in its function and aggregation is recognized, yet the specific lipids involved and how lipid metabolism issues trigger α-syn aggregation and neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we found that α-syn shows a preference for binding to lysophospholipids (LPLs), particularly targeting lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) without relying on electrostatic interactions. LPC is capable of maintaining α-syn in a compact conformation, significantly reducing its propensity to aggregate both in vitro and within cellular environments. Conversely, a reduction in the production of cellular LPLs is associated with an increase in α-syn accumulation. Our work underscores the critical role of LPLs in preserving the natural conformation of α-syn to inhibit improper aggregation, and establishes a potential connection between lipid metabolic dysfunction and α-syn aggregation in PD.},

  abstract     = {Fiber electronics with flexible and weavable features can be easily integrated into textiles for wearable applications. However, due to small sizes and curved surfaces of fiber materials, it remains challenging to load robust active layers, thus hindering production of high-sensitivity fiber strain sensors. Herein, functional sensing materials are firmly anchored on the fiber surface in-situ through a hydrolytic condensation process. The anchoring sensing layer with robust interfacial adhesion is ultra-mechanically sensitive, which significantly improves the sensitivity of strain sensors due to the easy generation of microcracks during stretching. The resulting stretchable fiber sensors simultaneously possess an ultra-low strain detection limit of 0.05%, a high stretchability of 100%, and a high gauge factor of 433.6, giving 254-folds enhancement in sensitivity. Additionally, these fiber sensors are soft and lightweight, enabling them to be attached onto skin or woven into clothes for recording physiological signals, e.g. pulse wave velocity has been effectively obtained by them. As a demonstration, a fiber sensor-based wearable smart healthcare system is designed to monitor and transmit health status for timely intervention. This work presents an effective strategy for developing high-performance fiber strain sensors as well as other stretchable electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Vesicle, a microscopic unit that encloses a volume with an ultrathin wall, is ubiquitous in biomaterials. However, it remains a huge challenge to create its inorganic metal-based artificial counterparts. Here, inspired by the formation of biological vesicles, we proposed a novel biomimetic strategy of curling the ultrathin nanosheets into nanovesicles, which was driven by the interfacial strain. Trapped by the interfacial strain between the initially formed substrate Rh layer and subsequently formed RhRu overlayer, the nanosheet begins to deform in order to release a certain amount of strain. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Ru atoms make the curling of nanosheets more favorable in thermodynamics applications. Owing to the unique vesicular structure, the RhRu nanovesicles/C displays excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and stability, which has been proven by both experiments and DFT calculations. Specifically, the HOR mass activity of RhRu nanovesicles/C are 7.52 A mg (Rh+Ru) −1 at an overpotential of 50 mV at the rotating disk electrode (RDE) level; this is 24.19 times that of commercial Pt/C (0.31 mA mg Pt −1 ). Moreover, the hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with RhRu nanovesicles/C displays a peak power density of 1.62 W cm −2 in the H 2 -O 2 condition, much better than that of commercial Pt/C (1.18 W cm −2 ). This work creates a new biomimetic strategy to synthesize inorganic nanomaterials, paving a pathway for designing catalytic reactors.},

  abstract     = {A small fraction of NO x (&lt;1%) always exists in CO 2 feedstock (e.g. exhausted gas), which can significantly reduce the efficiency of CO 2 electroreduction by ∼30%. Hence, electrochemical denitrification is the precondition of CO 2 electroreduction. The pH effect is a key factor, and can be used to tune the selectivity between N 2 and N 2 O production in electrochemical denitrification. However, there has been much controversy for many years about the origin of pH dependence in electrocatalysis. To this end, we present a new scheme to accurately model the pH dependence of the electrochemical mechanism. An extremely small pH variation from pH 12.7 to pH 14 can be accurately reproduced for N 2 O production. More importantly, the obviously different pH dependence of N 2 production, compared to N 2 O, can be attributed to a cascade path. In other words, the N 2 was produced from the secondary conversion of the as-produced N 2 O molecule (the major product), instead of the original reactant NO. This is further supported by more than 35 experiments over varying catalysts (Fe, Ni, Pd, Cu, Co, Pt and Ag), partial pressures (20%, 50% and 100%) and potentials (from −0.2 to 0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). All in all, the insights herein overturn long-lasting views in the field of NO electroreduction and suggest that rational design should steer away from catalyst engineering toward reactor optimization.},

  abstract     = {Lithiated organic cathode materials show great promise for practical applications in lithium-ion batteries owing to their Li-reservoir characteristics. However, the reported lithiated organic cathode materials still suffer from strict synthesis conditions and low capacity. Here we report a thermal intermolecular rearrangement method without organic solvents to prepare dilithium hydroquinone (Li 2 Q), which delivers a high capacity of 323 mAh g −1 with an average discharge voltage of 2.8 V. The reversible conversion between orthorhombic Li 2 Q and monoclinic benzoquinone during charge/discharge processes is revealed by in situ X-ray diffraction. Theoretical calculations show that the unique Li–O channels in Li 2 Q are beneficial for Li + ion diffusion. In situ ultraviolet-visible spectra demonstrate that the dissolution issue of Li 2 Q electrodes during charge/discharge processes can be handled by separator modification, resulting in enhanced cycling stability. This work sheds light on the synthesis and battery application of high-capacity lithiated organic cathode materials.},

  abstract     = {Decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are the most abundant immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy in both mice and humans, and emerging single-cell transcriptomic studies have uncovered various human dNK subsets that are disrupted in patients experiencing recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL) at early gestational stage, suggesting a connection between abnormal proportions or characteristics of dNK subsets and RPL pathogenesis. However, the functional mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Here, we established a mouse model by adoptively transferring human dNK cells into pregnant NOG (NOD/Shi- scid /IL-2Rγ null ) mice, where human dNK cells predominantly homed into the uteri of recipients. Using this model, we observed a strong correlation between the properties of human dNK cells and pregnancy outcome. The transfer of dNK cells from RPL patients (dNK-RPL) remarkably worsened early pregnancy loss and impaired placental trophoblast cell differentiation in the recipients. These adverse effects were effectively reversed by transferring CD56 + CD39 + dNK cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD56 + CD39 + dNK subset facilitates early differentiation of mouse trophoblast stem cells (mTSCs) towards both invasive and syncytial pathways through secreting macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Administration of recombinant M-CSF to NOG mice transferred with dNK-RPL efficiently rescued the exacerbated pregnancy outcomes and fetal/placental development. Collectively, this study established a novel humanized mouse model featuring functional human dNK cells homing into the uteri of recipients and uncovered the pivotal role of M-CSF in fetal-supporting function of CD56 + CD39 + dNK cells during early pregnancy, highlighting that M-CSF may be a previously unappreciated therapeutic target for intervening RPL.},

Among the crucial components of LNPs, ionizable lipids play a pivotal role in determining the efficiency of RNA delivery. In this study, we synthesized a series of ionizable lipids, denoted as HTO, with a higher count of hydroxyl groups compared to SM-102. Remarkably, LNPs based on HTO12 lipid demonstrated comparable mRNA delivery efficiency and biosafety to those based on SM-102. However, the former reduced the ratio of ionizable lipid/total lipids to mRNA in LNPs by 2.5 times compared to SM-102. The HTO12 LNP efficiently encapsulated adenine base editor mRNA and sgRNA targeting Pcsk9 , leading to substantial gene editing within the liver of mice and effective reduction of the target protein. Our study underscores that ionizable lipids with multiple hydroxyl groups may facilitate an improved lipid-to-mRNA ratio to minimize the dosage of ionizable lipids for in vivo delivery.},

Herein, a library of Zn–dipyrrin complexes ( Z-1 − Z-6 ) are rationally designed via precisely controlling their molecular configuration to optimize strong sensitizing Earth-abundant photosensitizers. Upon visible-light excitation, their special geometry enables intramolecular charge transfer to induce a charge-transfer state, which was first demonstrated to accept electrons from electron donors. The resulting long-lived reduced photosensitizer was confirmed to trigger consecutive intermolecular electron transfers for boosting CO 2 -to-CO conversion. Remarkably, the Earth-abundant catalytic system with Z-6 and Fe-catalyst exhibits outstanding performance with a turnover number of &gt;20 000 and 29.7% quantum yield, representing excellent catalytic performance among the molecular catalytic systems and highly superior to that of noble-metal photosensitizer Ir(ppy) 2 (bpy) + under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigations comprehensively unveil the structure–activity relationship, opening up a new horizon for the development of Earth-abundant strong sensitizing chromophores for boosting artificial photosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Dr. Xiankang Dou (窦贤康) was appointed the President of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in April 2023. As a distinguished researcher specializing in studying the middle and upper atmosphere of earth, Dr. Dou had served as the President of Wuhan University during 2016 to 2022 and was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2017. At his new post in NSFC, Dr. Dou&#39;s first priorities include curtailing personal favors in the review process (often known as ‘say hello’ with an intent to lobby), reforming the scoring and renewing mechanisms for the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (DYS), opening the channel for DYS applications to researchers from Hong Kong and Macau, extending the age limit of female scientists for applying for DYS, and initiating funding programs for outstanding doctoral and undergraduate students. Recently, National Science Review (NSR) had an interview with Dr. Dou. He believes only through reform and experimentation can NSFC make steady progress in its efforts to support research of basic science and applied basic science in China and to cultivate promising scholars.},

  abstract     = {Multi-boron-embedded multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters show promise for achieving both high color-purity emission and high exciton utilization efficiency. However, their development is often impeded by a limited synthetic scope and excessive molecular weights, which challenge material acquisition and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) fabrication by vacuum deposition. Herein, we put forward a B‒N covalent bond-involved π-extension strategy via post-functionalization of MR frameworks, leading to the generation of high-order B/N-based motifs. The structurally and electronically extended π-system not only enhances molecular rigidity to narrow emission linewidth but also promotes reverse intersystem crossing to mitigate efficiency roll-off. As illustrated examples, ultra-narrowband sky-blue emitters (full-width at half-maximum as small as 8 nm in n -hexane) have been developed with multi-dimensional improvement in photophysical properties compared to their precursor emitters, which enables narrowband OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQE max ) of up to 42.6%, in company with alleviated efficiency decline at high brightness, representing the best efficiency reported for single-host OLEDs. The success of these emitters highlights the effectiveness of our molecular design strategy for advanced MR-TADF emitters and confirms their extensive potential in high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Although single-atom Cu sites exhibit high efficiency in CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol, they are prone to forming Cu nanoparticles due to reduction and aggregation under reaction conditions, especially at high temperatures. Herein, single-atom Cu sites stabilized by adjacent Na + ions have been successfully constructed within a metal–organic framework (MOF)-based catalyst, namely MOF-808-NaCu. It is found that the electrostatic interaction between the Na + and H δ− species plays a pivotal role in upholding the atomic dispersion of Cu in MOF-808-NaCu during CO 2 hydrogenation, even at temperatures of up to 275°C. This exceptional stabilization effect endows the catalyst with excellent activity (306 g·kg cat −1 ·h −1 ), high selectivity to methanol (93%) and long-term stability at elevated reaction temperatures, far surpassing the counterpart in the absence of Na + (denoted as MOF-808-Cu). This work develops an effective strategy for the fabrication of stable single-atom sites for advanced catalysis by creating an alkali-decorated microenvironment in close proximity.},

In this study, we unveil the potential of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle assembly (SPIOCA) to reshape the dysbiosis of gut microbiota for treating NIHL. This modulation inhibits intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress responses, protecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Consequently, it reduces the transportation of pathogens and inflammatory factors from the bloodstream to the cochlea. Additionally, gut microbiota-modulated SPIOCA-induced metabolic reprogramming in the gut–inner ear axis mainly depends on the regulation of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, which further contributes to the restoration of hearing function. Our study confirms the role of the microbiota–gut–inner ear axis in NIHL and provides a novel alternative for the treatment of NIHL and other microbiota dysbiosis-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances indicate that the amount of carbon released by gradual degassing from the mantle needs to be revised upwards, whereas the carbon supplied by plumes may have been overestimated in the past. Variations in rock types and oxidation state may be very local and exert strong influences on carbon storage and release mechanisms. Deep subduction may be prevented by diapirism in thick sedimentary packages, whereas carbonates in thinner sequences may be subducted. Carbonates stored in the mantle transition zone will melt when they heat up, recognized by coupled stable isotope systems (e.g. Mg, Zn, Ca). There is no single ‘mantle oxygen fugacity’, particularly in the thermal boundary layer (TBL) and lowermost lithosphere, where very local mixtures of rock types coexist. Carbonate-rich melts from either subduction or melting of the uppermost asthenosphere trap carbon by redox freezing or as carbonate-rich dykes in this zone. Deeply derived, reduced melts may form further diamond reservoirs, recognized as polycrystalline diamonds associated with websteritic silicate minerals. Carbon is released by either edge-driven convection, which tears sections of the TBL and lower lithosphere down so that they melt by a mixture of heating and oxidation, or by lateral advection of solids beneath rifts. Both mechanisms operate at steps in lithosphere thickness and result in carbonate-rich melts, explaining the spatial association of craton edges and carbonate-rich magmatism. High-pressure experiments on individual rock types, and increasingly on reactions between rocks and melts, are fine-tuning our understanding of processes and turning up unexpected results that are not seen in studies of single rocks. Future research should concentrate on elucidating local variations and integrating these with the interpretation of geophysical signals. Global concepts such as average sediment compositions and a uniform mantle oxidation state are not appropriate for small-scale processes; an increased focus on local variations will help to refine carbon budget models.},

  abstract     = {Plate tectonics plays an essential role in the redistribution of life-essential volatile elements between Earth&#39;s interior and surface, whereby our planet has been well tuned to maintain enduring habitability over much of its history. Here we present an overview of deep carbon recycling in the regime of modern plate tectonics, with a special focus on convergent plate margins for assessing global carbon mass balance. The up-to-date flux compilation implies an approximate balance between deep carbon outflux and subduction carbon influx within uncertainty but remarkably limited return of carbon to convecting mantle. If correct, carbon would gradually accumulate in the lithosphere over time by (i) massive subsurface carbon storage occurring primarily in continental lithosphere from convergent margins to continental interior and (ii) persistent surface carbon sinks to seafloors sustained by high-flux deep CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. Further assessment of global carbon mass balance requires updates on fluxes of subduction-driven carbon recycling paths and reduction in uncertainty of deep carbon outflux. From a global plate tectonics point of view, we particularly emphasize that continental reworking is an important mechanism for remobilizing geologically sequestered carbon in continental crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. In light of recent advances, future research is suggested to focus on a better understanding of the reservoirs, fluxes, mechanisms, and climatic effects of deep carbon recycling following an integrated methodology of observation, experiment, and numerical modeling, with the aim of decoding the self-regulating Earth system and its habitability from the deep carbon recycling perspective.},

Inspired by human fingertip assessment of softness, the sensory system extracts displacement-pressure information for soft evaluation, achieving high accuracy IOP monitoring (&gt;96%). We further design and custom-make a portable and wearable ophthalmic tonometer based on the sensory system and demonstrate its high efficacy in IOP screening.

Although surrogate gradient-based methods offer a workable solution, trained SNNs frequently fall into local minima because they are still primarily based on gradient dynamics. Inspired by the chaotic dynamics in animal brain learning, we propose a chaotic spiking backpropagation (CSBP) method that introduces a loss function to generate brain-like chaotic dynamics and further takes advantage of the ergodic and pseudo-random nature to make SNN learning effective and robust. From a computational viewpoint, we found that CSBP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both neuromorphic data sets (e.g. DVS-CIFAR10 and DVS-Gesture) and large-scale static data sets (e.g. CIFAR100 and ImageNet) in terms of accuracy and robustness. From a theoretical viewpoint, we show that the learning process of CSBP is initially chaotic, then subject to various bifurcations and eventually converges to gradient dynamics, consistently with the observation of animal brain activity. Our work provides a superior core tool for direct SNN training and offers new insights into understanding the learning process of a biological brain.},

Despite its growing significance, visualizing the antiferromagnetic domain structure remains a challenge, particularly for non-collinear AFMs. Currently, the observation of magnetic domains in non-collinear antiferromagnetic materials is feasible only in Mn 3 Sn, underscoring the limitations of existing techniques that necessitate distinct methods for in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic domain imaging. In this study, we present a versatile method for imaging the antiferromagnetic domain structure in a series of non-collinear antiferromagnetic materials by utilizing the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE), which resolves both the magnetic octupole moments parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface. Temperature modulation due to AEE originating from different magnetic domains is measured by lock-in thermography, revealing distinct behaviors of octupole domains in different antiferromagnets. This work delivers an efficient technique for the visualization of magnetic domains in non-collinear AFMs, which enables comprehensive study of the magnetization process at the microscopic level and paves the way for potential advancements in applications.},

  abstract     = {Surface electrons in axion insulators are endowed with a topological layer degree of freedom followed by exotic transport phenomena, e.g., the layer Hall effect. Here, we propose that such a layer degree of freedom can be manipulated in a dissipationless way based on the antiferromagnetic M n B i 2 T e 4 with tailored domain structure. This makes M n B i 2 T e 4 a versatile platform to exploit the ‘layertronics’ to encode, process and store information. Importantly, the layer filter, layer valve and layer reverser devices can be achieved using the layer-locked chiral domain wall modes. The dissipationless nature of the domain wall modes makes the performance of the layertronic devices superior to those in spintronics and valleytronics. Specifically, the layer reverser, a layer version of the Datta–Das transistor, also fills up the blank in designing the valley reverser in valleytronics. Our work sheds light on constructing new generation electronic devices with high performance and low-energy consumption in the framework of layertronics.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of pre-Cretaceous dinosaur reproduction is hindered by a scarcity of evidence within fossil records. Here we report three adult skeletons and five clutches of embryo-containing eggs of a new sauropodomorph from the Lower Jurassic of southwestern China, displaying several significant reproductive features that are either unknown or unlike other early-diverging sauropodomorphs, such as relatively large eggs with a relatively thick calcareous shell formed by prominent mammillary cones, synchronous hatching and a transitional prehatching posture between the crocodilians and living birds. Most significantly, these Early Jurassic fossils provide strong evidence for the earliest known leathery eggs. Our comprehensive quantitative analyses demonstrate that the first dinosaur eggs were probably leathery, elliptical and relatively small, but with relatively long eggshell units, and that along the line to living birds, the most significant change in reptilian egg morphology occurred early in theropod evolution rather than near the origin of Aves.},

  abstract     = {The phase of secular evolution of continents is manifested as the degree of compositional differentiation, modification and maturation of continental crusts, which is vital in understanding the mechanism of continental evolution but is difficult to quantify. Here we use integrated passive- and active-source seismic profiling to conduct joint analysis and inversion and derive Vs and Vp/Vs section models across the North China Craton (NCC) to southeastern Altaids boundary zone that bears a tectonic transition from a reworked ancient craton margin to a Phanerozoic accretionary orogen. We systematically exploited the imaged multiple physical properties as precise and delicate proxies to constrain the compositional architecture in the crust across this important tectonic transition subject to various crustal evolutional phases. Our Vs and Vp/Vs imaging, together with the existing isotopic data, characterizes the Yin Shan–Yan Shan belt as the northern NCC margin with layered homogeneous compositions that point to an evolved crust. However, the lower-crustal low-Vs/high-Vp/Vs signature that overlaps the shallowly dipping to horizontal reflective fabrics suggests that the crust of the northern NCC margin has undergone considerable reworking through lower-crustal-stretching-assisted melt migration and mixing since the late Paleozoic to Mesozoic eras. The process probably involved crust–mantle interaction and thus resulted in a compositionally modified ancient crustal basement. On the contrary, the southeastern Altaids domain manifests crustal complexity in compositions and structures inferred to be indicative of a juvenile crust of the Phanerozoic accretionary orogen. Our results provide deep physical-property constraints that shed new light on the crustal evolution of a complex craton margin.},

On local scales, the main causes of urban fires are anthropogenic in nature. Yet, on regional to national scales, little is known about the indicators of large-scale co-varying urban fire activity in China. Here, we present the China Fire History Atlas (CFHA), which is based on 19 947 documentary records and represents fires in urban areas of China over the twentieth century (1901–1994). We found that temperature variability is a key indicator of urban fire activity in China, with warmer temperatures being correlated with more urban fires, and that this fire–temperature relationship is seasonally and regionally explicit. In the early twentieth century, however, the fire–temperature relationship was overruled by war-related fires in large urban areas. We further used the fire–temperature relationship and multiple emissions scenarios to project fire activity across China into the twenty-first century. Our projections show a distinct increase in future urban fire activity and fire-related economic loss. Our findings provide insights into fire–climate relationships in China for densely-populated areas and on policy-relevant time scales and they contribute spatial coverage to efforts to improve global fire models.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a poor-prognostic cancer type with extensive intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity in both genomic variations and tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the patterns and drivers of spatial genomic and microenvironmental heterogeneity of ESCC remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a spatial multi-omic atlas by whole-exome, transcriptome, and methylome sequencing of 507 tumor samples from 103 patients. We identified a novel tumor suppressor PREX2 , accounting for 22% of ESCCs with frequent somatic mutations or hyper-methylation, which promoted migration and invasion of ESCC cells in vitro . Analysis of the TME and quantification of subclonal expansion indicated that ESCCs undergo spatially directed evolution, where subclones mostly originated from the tumor center but had a biased clonal expansion to the upper direction of the esophagus. Interestingly, we found upper regions of ESCCs often underwent stronger immunoediting with increased selective fitness, suggesting more stringent immune selection. In addition, distinct TMEs were associated with variable genomic and clinical outcomes. Among them, hot TME was associated with high immune evasion and subclonal heterogeneity. We also found that immunoediting, instead of CD8 + T cell abundance, acts as an independent prognostic factor of ESCCs. Importantly, we found significant heterogeneity in previously considered potential therapeutic targets, as well as BRCAness characteristics in a subset of patients, emphasizing the importance of focusing on heterogeneity in ESCC targeted therapy. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of the spatial evolution of ESCC and inform precision therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is a promising aqueous, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly approach, especially for coupling different alcohols to prolong the carbon chain via co-oxidation. Precisely regulating critical steps to tailor electrode materials and electrolyte composition is key to selectively coupling alcohols for targeted synthesis. However, selectively coupling different alcohols remains challenging due to the lack of effective catalyst and electrolyte design promoting specific pathways. Herein, we demonstrate a paired electrolysis strategy for combining anodic oxidative coupling of ethanol (EtOH) and benzyl alcohol (PhCH 2 OH) to synthesize cinnamaldehyde (CAL) and cathodic ammonia production. The strategies involve: (i) utilizing the salt-out effect to balance selective oxidation and coupling rates; (ii) developing platinum-loaded nickel hydroxide electrocatalysts to accelerate intermediate coupling kinetics; (iii) introducing thermodynamically favorable nitrate reduction at the cathode to improve coupling selectivity by avoiding hydrogenation of products while generating valuable ammonia instead of hydrogen. We achieved 85% coupling selectivity and 278 μmol/h NH 3 productive rate at 100 mA/cm 2 with a low energy input (∼1.63 V). The membrane-free, low energy, scalable approach with a wide substrate scope highlights promising applications of this methodology. This work advances heterogeneous electrocatalytic synthesis through rational design principles that integrate anodic oxidative coupling with cathodic nitrate reduction reactions, having synergistic effects on efficiency and selectivity.},

The decomposition of whole-brain recordings into harmonic modes has revealed a repertoire of gradient-like activity patterns associated with distinct brain functions. However, the way these activity patterns are expressed over time with their changes in various brain states remains unclear. Here, we investigate healthy participants taking the serotonergic psychedelic N,N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with the Harmonic Decomposition of Spacetime (HADES) framework that can characterize how different harmonic modes defined in space are expressed over time. HADES demonstrates significant decreases in contributions across most low-frequency harmonic modes in the DMT-induced brain state. When normalizing the contributions by condition (DMT and non-DMT), we detect a decrease specifically in the second functional harmonic, which represents the uni- to transmodal functional hierarchy of the brain, supporting the leading hypothesis that functional hierarchy is changed in psychedelics. Moreover, HADES’ dynamic spacetime measures of fractional occupancy, life time and latent space provide a precise description of the significant changes of the spacetime hierarchical organization of brain activity in the psychedelic state.},

Moreover, the investigation of SNV expression levels in single cells are capable of visualizing genetic information and revealing the complexity and heterogeneity of single-nucleotide mutation-related diseases. Thus, developing SNV assay approaches in vitro , particularly in single cells, is becoming increasingly in demand. In this review, we summarized recent progress in the enzyme-free and enzyme-mediated strategies enabling SNV assay transition from sensing interface to the test tube and single cells, which will potentially delve deeper into the knowledge of SNV functions and disease associations, as well as discovering new pathways to diagnose and treat diseases based on individual genetic profiles. The leap of SNV assay achievements will motivate observation and measurement genetic variations in single cells, even within living organisms, delve into the knowledge of SNV functions and disease associations, as well as open up entirely new avenues in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases based on individual genetic profiles.},

  abstract     = {Precise and efficient therapy of malignant tumors is always a challenge. Herein, gold nanoclusters co-modified by aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) molecules, copper ion chelator (acylthiourea) and tumor-targeting agent (folic acid) were fabricated to perform AIE-guided and tumor-specific synergistic therapy with great spatio-temporal controllability for the targeted elimination and metastasis inhibition of malignant tumors. During therapy, the functional gold nanoclusters (AuNTF) would rapidly accumulate in the tumor tissue due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect as well as folic acid-mediated tumor targeting, which was followed by endocytosis by tumor cells. After that, the overexpressed copper ions in the tumor cells would trigger the aggregation of these intracellular AuNTF via a chelation process that not only generated the photothermal agent in situ to perform the tumor-specific photothermal therapy damaging the primary tumor, but also led to the copper deficiency of tumor cells to inhibit its metastasis. Moreover, the copper ions were reduced to cuprous ions along with the chelation, which further catalysed the excess H 2 O 2 in the tumor cells to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, resulting in additional chemodynamic therapy for enhanced antitumor efficiency. The aggregation of AuNTF also activated the AIE molecules to present fluorescence, which not only imaged the therapeutic area for real-time monitoring of this tumor-specific synergistic therapy, but also allowed us to perform near-infrared radiation at the correct time point and location to achieve optimal photothermal therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed the strong tumor elimination, effective metastasis inhibition and high survival rate of tumor-bearing mice after treatment using the AuNTF nanoclusters, indicating that this AIE-guided and tumor-specific synergistic strategy could offer a promising approach for tumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA in vivo remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded G PC R a ctivation- b ased (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB OA1.0 . This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB OA1.0 , we monitored OA release in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the fly&#39;s learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB OA1.0 sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.},

  abstract     = {Electro-optical effect-based liquid crystal devices have been extensively used in optical modulation techniques, in which the Kerr coefficient reflects the sensitivity of the liquid crystals and determines the strength of the device’s operational electric field. The Peterlin–Stuart theory and the O&#39;Konski model jointly indicate that a giant Kerr coefficient could be obtained in a material with both a large geometrical anisotropy and an intrinsic polarization, but such a material is not yet reported. Here we reveal a ferroelectric effect in a monolayer two-dimensional mineral vermiculite. A large geometrical anisotropy factor and a large inherent electric dipole together raise the record value of Kerr coefficient by an order of magnitude, till 3.0 × 10 −4 m V −2 . This finding enables an ultra-low operational electric field of 10 2 –10 4 V m −1 and the fabrication of electro-optical devices with an inch-level electrode separation, which has not previously been practical. Because of its high ultraviolet stability (decay &lt;1% under ultraviolet exposure for 1000 hours), large-scale production, and energy efficiency, prototypical displayable billboards have been fabricated for outdoor interactive scenes. This work provides new insights for both liquid crystal optics and two-dimensional ferroelectrics.},

To match the high spatial-temporal dynamics in SNNs, neuromorphic chips are highly desired to execute SNNs in hardware-based neuron and synapse circuits directly. This paper presents a large-scale neuromorphic chip named Darwin3 with a novel instruction set architecture, which comprises 10 primary instructions and a few extended instructions. It supports flexible neuron model programming and local learning rule designs. The Darwin3 chip architecture is designed in a mesh of computing nodes with an innovative routing algorithm. We used a compression mechanism to represent synaptic connections, significantly reducing memory usage. The Darwin3 chip supports up to 2.35 million neurons, making it the largest of its kind on the neuron scale. The experimental results showed that the code density was improved by up to 28.3× in Darwin3, and that the neuron core fan-in and fan-out were improved by up to 4096× and 3072× by connection compression compared to the physical memory depth. Our Darwin3 chip also provided memory saving between 6.8× and 200.8× when mapping convolutional spiking neural networks onto the chip, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and latency compared to other neuromorphic chips.},

It shows extreme sample-tip distance and refractive index dependence, which is promising for nanoscale infrared (IR) imaging of ultrathin samples. However, the existence of PiDF in the mid-IR region has not been experimentally demonstrated due to the coexistence of photoinduced thermal force (PiTF), typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than PiDF. In this study, we demonstrate that, with the assistance of surface phonon polaritons, the PiDF of c-quartz can be enhanced to surpass its PiTF, enabling a clear observation of PiDF spectra reflecting the properties of the real part of permittivity. Leveraging the detection of the PiDF of phonon polaritonic substrate, we propose a strategy to enhance the sensitivity and contrast of photoinduced force responses in transmission images, facilitating the precise differentiation of the heterogeneous distribution of ultrathin samples.},

  abstract     = {Plastics are one of the most produced synthetic materials and largest commodities, used in numerous sectors of human life. To upcycle waste plastics into value-added chemicals is a global challenge. Despite significant progress in pyrolysis and hydrocracking, which mainly leads to the formation of pyrolysis oil, catalytic upcycling to value-added aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), in one step, is still limited by high reaction temperatures (&gt;500°C) and a low yield. We report herein CO 2 -facilitated upcycling of polyolefins and their plastic products to aromatics below 300°C, enabled by a bifunctional Pt/MnO x -ZSM-5 catalyst. ZSM-5 catalyzes cracking of polyolefins and aromatization, generating hydrogen at the same time, while Pt/MnO x catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen with CO 2 , consequently driving the reaction towards aromatization. Isotope experiments reveal that 0.2 kg CO 2 is consumed per 1.0 kg polyethylene and 90% of the consumed CO 2 is incorporated into the aromatic products. Furthermore, this new process yields 0.63 kg aromatics (BTX accounting for 60%), comparing favorably with the conventional pyrolysis or hydrocracking processes, which produce only 0.33 kg aromatics. In this way, both plastic waste and the greenhouse gas CO 2 are turned into carbon resources, providing a new strategy for combined waste plastics upcycling and carbon dioxide utilization.},

Herein, an S-scheme CoS x /ZnS heterojunction with dual active sites is designed as an efficient N 2 fixation photocatalyst. The CoS x /ZnS heterojunction exhibits a unique pocket-like nanostructure with small ZnS nanocrystals adhered on a single-hole CoS x hollow dodecahedron. Within the heterojunction, the electronic interaction between ZnS and CoS x creates electron-deficient Zn sites with enhanced N 2 chemisorption and electron-sufficient Co sites with active hydrogen supply for N 2 hydrogenation, cooperatively reducing the energy barrier for N 2 activation. In combination with the promoted photogenerated electron-hole separation of the S-scheme heterojunction and facilitated mass transfer by the pocket-like nanostructure, an excellent N 2 fixation performance with a high NH 3 yield of 1175.37 μmol g −1 h −1 is achieved.

However, the overarching principle that governs these processes across vastly different materials remains an open question. Substantial analysis has been carried out based on the motions of individual particles. Here, as an alternative, we propose viewing the global configuration as a single entity. We introduce a global order parameter, namely the inherent structure minimal displacement (IS D min ), to quantify the variability of configurations by a pattern-matching technique. Through atomic simulations of seven model glass-forming liquids, we unify the influences of temperature, pressure and perturbation time on the relaxation dissipation, via a scaling law between the mechanical damping factor and IS D min . Fundamentally, this scaling reflects the curvature of the local potential energy landscape. Our findings uncover a universal origin of glassy relaxation and offer an alternative approach to studying disordered systems.},

Although some experimental progress has been made, a high-fidelity heat transfer model for liquid film boiling is lacking. This work develops a thermal-hydrodynamic model by considering both evaporation atop the wick and nucleate boiling inside the wick to simultaneously predict the HTC and CHF. Nucleate boiling is modeled with microlayer evaporation theory, where a unified scaling factor is defined to characterize the change of microlayer area with heat flux. The scaling factor η is found to be independent of wicking structure and can be determined from a few measurements. This makes our model universal to predict the liquid film boiling heat transfer for various micro-structured surfaces including micropillar, micropowder, and micromesh. This work not only sheds light on understanding fundamental mechanisms of phase-change heat transfer, but also provides a tool for designing micro-structured surfaces in thermal management.},

The highly delocalized carriers enable a competitive Hall mobility of 3 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , comparable to that of the reported high-mobility organic single crystals. The PDI dianion films exhibit a high electrical conductivity of 17 S cm −1 and typical band-like transport, as evidenced by the negative temperature linear coefficient of mobility proportional to T −3/2 .

  abstract     = {Catalytic oxidative desulfurization (ODS) using titanium silicate catalysts has emerged as an efficient technique for the complete removal of organosulfur compounds from automotive fuels. However, the precise control of highly accessible and stable-framework Ti active sites remains highly challenging. Here we reveal for the first time by using density functional theory calculations that framework hexa-coordinated Ti (TiO 6 ) species of mesoporous titanium silicates are the most active sites for ODS and lead to a lower-energy pathway of ODS. A novel method to achieve highly accessible and homogeneously distributed framework TiO 6 active single sites at the mesoporous surface has been developed. Such surface framework TiO 6 species exhibit an exceptional ODS performance. A removal of 920 ppm of benzothiophene is achieved at 60°C in 60 min, which is 1.67 times that of the best catalyst reported so far. For bulky molecules such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (DMDBT), it takes only 3 min to remove 500 ppm of DMDBT at 60°C with our catalyst, which is five times faster than that with the current best catalyst. Such a catalyst can be easily upscaled and could be used for concrete industrial application in the ODS of bulky organosulfur compounds with minimized energy consumption and high reaction efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical self-assembly with long-range order above centimeters widely exists in nature. Mimicking similar structures to promote reaction kinetics of electrochemical energy devices is of immense interest, yet remains challenging. Here, we report a bottom-up self-assembly approach to constructing ordered mesoporous nanofibers with a structure resembling vascular bundles via electrospinning. The synthesis involves self-assembling polystyrene (PS) homopolymer, amphiphilic diblock copolymer, and precursors into supramolecular micelles. Elongational dynamics of viscoelastic micelle solution together with fast solvent evaporation during electrospinning cause simultaneous close packing and uniaxial stretching of micelles, consequently producing polymer nanofibers consisting of oriented micelles. The method is versatile for the fabrication of large-scale ordered mesoporous nanofibers with adjustable pore diameter and various compositions such as carbon, SiO 2 , TiO 2 and WO 3 . The aligned longitudinal mesopores connected side-by-side by tiny pores offer highly exposed active sites and expedite electron/ion transport. The assembled electrodes deliver outstanding performance for lithium metal batteries.},

We found that the more similar the brain model is to the biological counterpart in both scale and architecture, the more similarity was found between the assimilated model and the biological brain both in resting states and during tasks by quantitative metrics. The hypothesis that resting state activity reflects internal body states was validated by the interoceptive circuit&#39;s capability to enhance the similarity between the simulation model and the biological brain. We identified that the removal of connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) to downstream visual pathways significantly decreased the similarity at the hippocampus between the model and its biological counterpart, despite a slight influence on the whole brain. In conclusion, the model and methodology present a solid quantitative framework for a digital twin brain for discovering the relationship between brain architecture and functions, and for digitally trying and testing diverse cognitive, medical and lesioning approaches that would otherwise be unfeasible in real subjects.},

We present the use of personalized whole-brain network models in healthy ageing and five clinical diseases: epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we introduce spatial masks for relevant parameters and demonstrate their use based on the physiological and pathophysiological hypotheses.

Herein, an ultra-low frequency magnetic energy focusing (ULFMEF) methodology was developed for the highly effective wireless powering of deep-tissue implantable devices. A portable transmitter was used to output the low-frequency magnetic field (&lt;50 Hz), which remotely drives the synchronous rotation of a magnetic core integrated within the pellet-like implantable device, generating an internal rotating magnetic field to induce wireless electricity on the coupled coils of the device. The ULFMEF can achieve energy transfer across thick tissues (up to 20 cm) with excellent transferred power (4–15 mW) and non-heat effects in tissues, which is remarkably superior to existing wireless powering technologies. The ULFMEF is demonstrated to wirelessly power implantable micro-LED devices for optogenetic neuromodulation, and wirelessly charged an implantable battery for programmable electrical stimulation on the sciatic nerve. It also bypassed thick and tough protective shells to power the implanted devices. The ULFMEF thus offers a highly advanced methodology for the generation of wireless powered biodevices.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the quality of junctions is crucial for optimizing carrier extraction and suppressing recombination in semiconductor devices. In recent years, metal halide perovskite has emerged as the most promising next-generation material for optoelectronic devices. However, the construction of high-quality perovskite junctions, as well as characterization and understanding of their carrier polarity and density, remains a challenge. In this study, using combined electrical and spectroscopic characterization techniques, we investigate the doping characteristics of perovskite films by remote molecules, which is corroborated by our theoretical simulations indicating Schottky defects consisting of double ions as effective charge dopants. Through a post-treatment process involving a combination of biammonium and monoammonium molecules, we create a surface layer of n-type low-dimensional perovskite. This surface layer forms a heterojunction with the underlying 3D perovskite film, resulting in a favorable doping profile that enhances carrier extraction. The fabricated device exhibits an outstanding open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) up to 1.34 V and achieves a certified efficiency of 19.31% for single-junction wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) perovskite solar cells, together with significantly enhanced operational stability, thanks to the improved separation of carriers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this wide-bandgap device by achieving a certified efficiency of 27.04% and a V OC of 2.12 V in a perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell configuration.},

  abstract     = {Flexible sensors have been developed for the perception of various stimuli. However, complex deformation, usually resulting from forces or strains from multi-axes, can be challenging to measure due to the lack of independent perception of multiaxial stimuli. Herein, flexible sensors based on the metamaterial membrane with zero Poisson&#39;s ratio (ZPR) are proposed to achieve independent detection of biaxial stimuli. By deliberately designing the geometric dimensions and arrangement parameters of elements, the Poisson&#39;s ratio of an elastomer membrane can be modulated from negative to positive, and the ZPR membrane can maintain a constant transverse dimension under longitudinal stimuli. Due to the accurate monitoring of grasping force by ZPR sensors that are insensitive to curvatures of contact surfaces, rigid robotic manipulators can be guided to safely grasp deformable objects. Meanwhile, the ZPR sensor can also precisely distinguish different states of manipulators. When ZPR sensors are attached to a thermal-actuation soft robot, they can accurately detect the moving distance and direction. This work presents a new strategy for independent biaxial stimuli perception through the design of mechanical metamaterials, and may inspire the future development of advanced flexible sensors for healthcare, human–machine interfaces and robotic tactile sensing.},

The combination of multimodal brain imaging and free-energy minimization has shown promise in unraveling complex brain dynamics and understanding the interactions among distinct brain regions. The Bayesian mechanics of brain computing gives a unique route to understanding authentic (neuromimetic) intelligence and, more importantly, points towards the development of brain-inspired intelligence. NSR spoke to a leading theoretical neuroscientist and authority on brain imaging—Karl Friston, the inventor of statistical parametric mapping, voxel-based morphometry and dynamic causal modeling. Friston is also known for his contributions to theoretical biology in the form of the free-energy principle and applications such as active inference. Friston is currently the Scientific Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Professor of Neuroscience at Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London and Honorary Consultant at The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK.},

Although various strategies have been proposed for dynamic modulation of surface plasmons, critical issues of device compatibility and extremely low efficiency in the visible spectrum hamper the application of optoplasmonic nanochips. Here we establish an optoplasmonic system based on Au@Cu 2 – x S hybrid core–shell nanoparticles. The optical excitation of hot electrons and their charge transfer to the semiconductor coating (Cu 2 – x S) lead to lowered electron density of Au, which results in the red shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance. The hot electrons can also transport through the Cu 2 – x S layer to the metal substrate, which increases the conductance of the nanogap. As such, the coupled gap plasmon blue-shifts with a magnitude of up to ∼15 nm, depending on the excitation power and the thickness of the coatings, which agrees with numerical simulations. All of this optoelectronic tuning process is highly reversible, controllable and fast with a modulated laser beam, which is highly compatible and sufficiently useful for on-chip integration of nanophotonic devices.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting phase transitions in two dimensions lie beyond the description of the Ginzburg-Landau symmetry-breaking paradigm for three-dimensional superconductors. They are Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions of paired-electron condensate driven by the unbinding of topological excitations, i.e. vortices. The recently discovered monolayers of layered high-transition-temperature ( ⁠|${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$|⁠ ) cuprate superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi2212) meant that this 2D superconductor promised to be ideal for the study of unconventional superconductivity. But inhomogeneity posed challenges for distinguishing BKT physics from charge correlations in this material. Here, we utilize the phase sensitivity of scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy susceptometry to image the local magnetic response of underdoped Bi2212 from the monolayer to the bulk throughout its phase transition. The monolayer segregates into domains with independent phases at elevated temperatures below |${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$|⁠ . Within a single domain, we find that the susceptibility oscillates with flux between diamagnetism and paramagnetism in a Fraunhofer-like pattern up to |${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$|⁠ . The finite modulation period, as well as the broadening of the peaks when approaching |${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$| from below, suggests well-defined vortices that are increasingly screened by the dissociation of vortex-antivortex plasma through a BKT transition. In the multilayers, the susceptibility oscillation differs in a small temperature regime below |${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$|⁠ , consistent with a dimensional crossover led by interlayer coupling. Serving as strong evidence for BKT transition in the bulk, we observe a sharp jump in phase stiffness and paramagnetism at small fields just below |${{{T}}}_{{\rm C}}$|⁠ . These results unify the superconducting phase transitions from the monolayer to the bulk underdoped Bi2212, and can be collectively referred to as the BKT transition with interlayer coupling.},

However, the functional contribution of ND GABAergic neurons (ND GABA ) in animal behavior is largely unknown. Here, we show that ND GABA neurons were selectively activated by different types of fear stimuli, such as predator odor and foot shock. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations revealed that ND GABA neurons mediate freezing behavior. Moreover, using circuit-based optogenetic and neuroanatomical tracing methods, we identified an excitatory pathway from the lateral periaqueductal gray (lPAG) to the ND that induces freezing by exciting ND inhibitory outputs to the motor-related gigantocellular reticular nucleus, ventral part (GiV). Together, these findings indicate the ND GABA population as a novel hub for controlling defensive response by relaying fearful information from the lPAG to GiV, a mechanism critical for understanding how the freezing behavior is encoded in the mammalian brain.},

  abstract     = {Tropospheric reactive bromine is important for atmospheric chemistry, regional air pollution, and global climate. Previous studies have reported measurements of atmospheric reactive bromine species in different environments, and proposed their main sources, e.g. sea-salt aerosol (SSA), oceanic biogenic activity, polar snow/ice, and volcanoes. Typhoons and other strong cyclonic activities (e.g. hurricanes) induce abrupt changes in different earth system processes, causing widespread destructive effects. However, the role of typhoons in regulating reactive bromine abundance and sources remains unexplored. Here, we report field observations of bromine oxide (BrO), a critical indicator of reactive bromine, on the Huaniao Island (HNI) in the East China Sea in July 2018. We observed high levels of BrO below 500 m with a daytime average of 9.7 ± 4.2 pptv and a peak value of ∼26 pptv under the influence of a typhoon. Our field measurements, supported by model simulations, suggest that the typhoon-induced drastic increase in wind speed amplifies the emission of SSA, significantly enhancing the activation of reactive bromine from SSA debromination. We also detected enhanced BrO mixing ratios under high NO x conditions (ppbv level) suggesting a potential pollution-induced mechanism of bromine release from SSA. Such elevated levels of atmospheric bromine noticeably increase ozone destruction by as much as ∼40% across the East China Sea. Considering the high frequency of cyclonic activity in the northern hemisphere, reactive bromine chemistry is expected to play a more important role than previously thought in affecting coastal air quality and atmospheric oxidation capacity. We suggest that models need to consider the hitherto overlooked typhoon- and pollution-mediated increase in reactive bromine levels when assessing the synergic effects of cyclonic activities on the earth system.},

  abstract     = {The Chinese Bayan Obo deposit is a world-class rare earth element (REE) deposit with considerable niobium (Nb) and iron (Fe) resources. A complete genetic understanding on all metals is fundamental for establishing genetic models at Bayan Obo. With extensive research being focused on REE enrichment, the timing and controls of Nb enrichment remain unresolved at Bayan Obo, which is mainly due to the challenges in dating, i.e. multistage thermal events, fine-grained minerals with complex textures and the rare occurrence of uranium-enriched minerals with mature dating methods. Based on robust geological and petrographic frameworks, here we conducted ion probe uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of ferrocolumbite to unravel the timing, hence the genesis of Nb mineralization. Three types of hydrothermal ferrocolumbites—key Nb-bearing minerals—are identified based on their textures and mineral assemblages. They yield U-Pb ages of 1312 ± 47 Ma ( n = 99), 438 ± 7 Ma ( n = 93), and 268 ± 5 Ma ( n = 19), respectively. In line with deposit geology, we tentatively link the first, second and third stage Nb mineralization to Mesoproterozoic carbonatite magmatism, ubiquitous early Paleozoic hydrothermal activity, and Permian granitic magmatism, respectively. While quantifying the contribution of metal endowment from each stage requires further investigation, our new dates highlight that multi-stage mineralization is critical for Nb enrichment at Bayan Obo, which may also have implications for the enrichment mechanism of Nb in REE deposits in general.},

  abstract     = {Due to their uncontrollable assembly and crystallization process, the synthesis of mesoporous metal oxide single crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of single-crystal-like mesoporous Li 2 TiSiO 5 by using soft micelles as templates. The key lies in the atomic-scale self-assembly and step-crystallization processes, which ensure the formation of single-crystal-like mesoporous Li 2 TiSiO 5 microparticles via an oriented attachment growth mechanism under the confinement of an in-situ formed carbon matrix. The mesoporous Li 2 TiSiO 5 anode achieves a superior rate capability (148 mAh g −1 at 5.0 A g −1 ) and outstanding long-term cycling stability (138 mAh g −1 after 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g −1 ) for lithium storage as a result of the ultrafast Li + diffusion caused by penetrating mesochannels and nanosized crystal frameworks (5–10 nm). In comparison, bulk Li 2 TiSiO 5 exhibits poor rate capability and cycle performance due to micron-scale diffusion lengths. This method is very simple and reproducible, heralding a new way of designing and synthesizing mesoporous single crystals with controllable frameworks and chemical functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The water oxidation half-reaction at anodes is always considered the rate-limiting step of overall water splitting (OWS), but the actual bias distribution between photoanodes and cathodes of photoelectrochemical (PEC) OWS cells has not been investigated systematically. In this work, we find that, for PEC cells consisting of photoanodes (nickel-modified n -Si [Ni/ n -Si] and α-Fe 2 O 3 ) with low photovoltage ( V ph &lt; 1 V), a large portion of applied bias is exerted on the Pt cathode for satisfying the hydrogen evolution thermodynamics, showing a thermodynamics-controlled characteristic. In contrast, for photoanodes (TiO 2 and BiVO 4 ) with V ph &gt; 1 V, the bias required for cathode activation can be significantly reduced, exhibiting a kinetics-controlled characteristic. Further investigations show that the bias distribution can be regulated by tuning the electrolyte pH and using alternative half-reaction couplings. Accordingly, a volcano plot is presented for the rational design of the overall reactions and unbiased PEC cells. Motivated by this, an unbiased PEC cell consisting of a simple Ni/ n -Si photoanode and Pt cathode is assembled, delivering a photocurrent density of 5.3 ± 0.2 mA cm −2 .},

To achieve a comprehensive physical landscape for amorphous carbons, a phase diagram was plotted in the sp 3 /sp 2 versus density plane, in which the counterintuitive discontinuity originates from the inherent difference in topological microstructures, further guiding us to discover a variety of phase transitions among different amorphous carbons. Intriguingly, the power law, log(sp 3 /sp 2 ) ∝ ρ n , hints at intrinsic topology and hidden order in amorphous carbons, providing an insightful perspective to reacquaint atomic disorder in non-crystalline carbons.},

  abstract     = {Organic materials with rich active sites are good candidates of high-capacity anodes in aqueous batteries, but commonly low utilization of active sites limits their capacity. Herein, two isomers, symmetric and asymmetric hexaazatribenzanthraquinone (s-HATBAQ and a-HATBAQ), with rich active sites have been synthesized in a controllable manner. It has been revealed for the first time that a sulfuric acid catalyst can facilitate the stereoselective formation of s-HATBAQ. Attributed to the reduced steric hindrance in favor of proton insertion as well as the amorphous structure conducive to electrochemical dynamics, s-HATBAQ exhibits 1.5 times larger specific capacity than a-HATBAQ. Consequently, the electrode of s-HATBAQ with 50% reduced graphene oxide (s-HATBAQ-50%rGO) delivers a record high specific capacity of 405 mAh g −1 in H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. Moreover, the assembled MnO 2 //s-HATBAQ-50%rGO aqueous proton full batteries show an exceptional cycling stability at 25°C and can maintain ∼92% capacity after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 at −80°C. This work demonstrates the controllable synthesis of isomers, showcases a wide-temperature-range prototype proton battery and highlights the significance of precise molecular structure modulation in organic energy storage.},

We proposed a strategy of hydrogel wound dressing with bacteria-responsive self-activating antibacterial property and multiple nanozyme activities to remodel the regeneration microenvironment in order to significantly promote infected wound healing. Specifically, pH-responsive H 2 O 2 self-supplying composite nanozyme (MSCO) and pH/enzyme-sensitive bacteria-responsive triblock micelles encapsulated with lactate oxidase (PPEL) were prepared and encapsulated in hydrogels composed of L-arginine-modified chitosan (CA) and phenylboronic acid-modified oxidized dextran (ODP) to form a cascade bacteria-responsive self-activating antibacterial composite hydrogel platform. The hydrogels respond to multifactorial changes of the bacterial metabolic microenvironment to achieve on-demand antibacterial and biofilm eradication through transformation of bacterial metabolites, and chemodynamic therapy enhanced by nanozyme activity in conjunction with self-driven nitric oxide (NO) release. The composite hydrogel showed ‘self-diagnostic’ treatment for changes in the wound microenvironment. Through self-activating antibacterial therapy in the infection stage to self-adaptive oxidative stress relief and angiogenesis in the post-infection stage, it promotes wound closure, accelerates wound collagen deposition and angiogenesis, and completely improves the microenvironment of infected wound regeneration, which provides a new method for the design of intelligent wound dressings.},

Through transcriptome analysis of the Global Mini-Core Rice Collection consisting of a panel of 202 accessions, we identified 22 345 and 27 610 expression quantitative trait loci associated with the expression of 7787 and 9361 eGenes under normal and salt-stress conditions, respectively, leveraging the super pan-genome map. Notably, combined with genome-wide association studies, we swiftly pinpointed the potential candidate gene STG5 —a major salt-tolerant locus known as qSTS5 . Intriguingly, STG5 is required for maintaining Na + /K + homeostasis by directly regulating the transcription of multiple members of the OsHKT gene family. Our study sheds light on how genetic variants influence the dynamic changes in gene expression responding to salinity stress and provides a valuable resource for the mining of salt-tolerant genes in the future.},

Here, an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) interconnection system integrated by surface-sensitive probing techniques has been developed to investigate the freshly cleaved surface of CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 in situ under given energy stimulation. On this basis, the detailed three-step chemical decomposition pathway of perovskites has been clarified. Meanwhile, the evolution of crystal structure from cubic phase to tetragonal phase on the perovskite surface has been revealed under energy stimulation. Accompanied by chemical composition and crystal structure evolution, electronic structure changes including energy level position, hole effective mass, and Rashba splitting have also been accurately determined. These findings provide a clear perspective on the physical origin of optoelectronic properties and the decomposition mechanism of perovskites.},

However, as a typical hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP), TPZ did not exhibit survival advantages in Phase III clinical trials when used in combination therapy due to the insufficient hypoxia levels in patients’ tumors. In this study, to improve the therapeutic effects of TPZ, we first introduced urea to synthesize a series of urea-containing derivatives of TPZ. All urea-containing TPZ derivatives showed increased hypoxic cytotoxicity (9.51–30.85-fold) compared with TPZ, while maintaining hypoxic selectivity. TPZP, one of these derivatives, showed 20-fold higher cytotoxicity than TPZ while maintaining a similar hypoxic cytotoxicity ratio. To highly efficiently deliver TPZP to the tumors and reduce its side effects on healthy tissues, we further prepared TPZP into a nanodrug with fibrin-targeting ability: FT11-TPZP-NPs. CA4-NPs, a vascular disrupting agent, was used to increase the fibrin level within tumors and exacerbate tumor hypoxia. By being combined with CA4-NPs, FT11-TPZP-NPs can accumulate in the hypoxia-aggravated tumors and activate sufficiently to kill tumor cells. After a single-dose treatment, FT11-TPZP-NPs + CA4-NPs showed a high inhibition rate of 98.1% against CT26 tumor models with an initial volume of ∼480 mm 3 and four out of six tumors were completely eliminated; it thereby exerted a significant antitumor effect.

While the nervous system plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration, current tissue engineering approaches mainly focus on restoring the function of injury-related cells, neglecting the guidance provided by nerves. This has led to unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes. Herein, we propose a new generation of engineered neural constructs from the perspective of neural induction, which offers a versatile platform for promoting multiple tissue regeneration. Specifically, neural constructs consist of inorganic biomaterials and neural stem cells (NSCs), where the inorganic biomaterials endows NSCs with enhanced biological activities including proliferation and neural differentiation. Through animal experiments, we show the effectiveness of neural constructs in repairing central nervous system injuries with function recovery. More importantly, neural constructs also stimulate osteogenesis, angiogenesis and neuromuscular junction formation, thus promoting the regeneration of bone and skeletal muscle, exhibiting its versatile therapeutic performance. These findings suggest that the inorganic-biomaterial/NSC-based neural platform represents a promising avenue for inducing the regeneration and function recovery of varying tissues and organs.},

  abstract     = {The structural engineering of metastable nanomaterials with abundant defects has attracted much attention in energy-related fields. The high-temperature shock (HTS) technique, as a rapidly developing and advanced synthesis strategy, offers significant potential for the rational design and fabrication of high-quality nanocatalysts in an ultrafast, scalable, controllable and eco-friendly way. In this review, we provide an overview of various metastable micro- and nanomaterials synthesized via HTS, including single metallic and bimetallic nanostructures, high entropy alloys, metal compounds (e.g. metal oxides) and carbon nanomaterials. Note that HTS provides a new research dimension for nanostructures, i.e. kinetic modulation. Furthermore, we summarize the application of HTS—as supporting films for transmission electron microscopy grids—in the structural engineering of 2D materials, which is vital for the direct imaging of metastable materials. Finally, we discuss the potential future applications of high-throughput and liquid-phase HTS strategies for non-equilibrium micro/nano-manufacturing beyond energy-related fields. It is believed that this emerging research field will bring new opportunities to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in both fundamental and practical aspects.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondriopathy inspired adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletions have been recognized as a powerful way for controlling tumor growth. Nevertheless, selective sequestration or exhaustion of ATP under complex biological environments remains a prodigious challenge. Harnessing the advantages of in vivo self-assembled nanomaterials, we designed an Intracellular ATP Sequestration (IAS) system to specifically construct nanofibrous nanostructures on the surface of tumor nuclei with exposed ATP binding sites, leading to highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer by induction of mitochondriopathy-like damages. Briefly, the reported transformable nucleopeptide (NLS-FF-T) self-assembled into nuclear-targeted nanoparticles with ATP binding sites encapsulated inside under aqueous conditions. By interaction with KPNA2, the NLS-FF-T transformed into a nanofibrous-based ATP trapper on the surface of tumor nuclei, which prevented the production of intracellular energy. As a result, multiple bladder tumor cell lines (T24, EJ and RT-112) revealed that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NLS-FF-T was reduced by approximately 4-fold when compared to NLS-T. Following intravenous administration, NLS-FF-T was found to be dose-dependently accumulated at the tumor site of T24 xenograft mice. More significantly, this IAS system exhibited an extremely antitumor efficacy according to the deterioration of T24 tumors and simultaneously prolonged the overall survival of T24 orthotopic xenograft mice. Together, our findings clearly demonstrated the therapeutic advantages of intracellular ATP sequestration-induced mitochondriopathy-like damages, which provides a potential treatment strategy for malignancies.},

  abstract     = {Solid solutions are ubiquitous in metals and alloys. Local chemical ordering (LCO) is a fundamental sub-nano/nanoscale process that occurs in many solid solutions and can be used as a microstructure to optimize strength and ductility. However, the formation of LCO has not been fully elucidated, let alone how to provide efficient routes for designing LCO to achieve synergistic effects on both superb strength and ductility. Herein, we propose the formation and control of LCO in negative enthalpy alloys. With engineering negative enthalpy in solid solutions, genetic LCO components are formed in negative enthalpy refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs). In contrast to conventional ‘trial-and-error’ approaches, the control of LCO by using engineering negative enthalpy in RHEAs is instructive and results in superior strength (1160 MPa) and uniform ductility (24.5%) under tension at ambient temperature, which are among the best reported so far. LCO can promote dislocation cross-slip, enhancing the interaction between dislocations and their accumulation at large tensile strains; sustainable strain hardening can thereby be attained to ensure high ductility of the alloy. This work paves the way for new research fields on negative enthalpy solid solutions and alloys for the synergy of strength and ductility as well as new functions.},

  abstract     = {Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) feature complex phase transitions, including polymorphism, melting, vitrification, and polyamorphism. Experimentally probing their structural evolution during transitions involving amorphous phases is a significant challenge, especially at the medium-range length scale. To overcome this challenge, here we first train a deep learning-based force field to identify the structural characteristics of both crystalline and non-crystalline ZIF phases. This allows us to reproduce the structural evolution trend during the melting of crystals and formation of ZIF glasses at various length scales with an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio molecular dynamics, yet at a much lower computational cost. Based on this approach, we propose a new structural descriptor, namely, the ring orientation index, to capture the propensity for crystallization of ZIF-4 (Zn(Im) 2 , Im = C 3 H 3 N 2 − ) glasses, as well as for the formation of ZIF-zni (Zn(Im) 2 ) out of the high-density amorphous phase. This crystal formation process is a result of the reorientation of imidazole rings by sacrificing the order of the structure around the zinc-centered tetrahedra. The outcomes of this work are useful for studying phase transitions in other metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and may thus guide the development of MOF glasses.},

  abstract     = {China currently has the highest acid deposition globally, yet research on its status, impacts, causes and controls is lacking. Here, we compiled data and calculated critical loads regarding acid deposition. The results showed that the abatement measures in China have achieved a sharp decline in the emissions of acidifying pollutants and a continuous recovery of precipitation pH, despite the drastic growth in the economy and energy consumption. However, the risk of ecological acidification and eutrophication showed no significant decrease. With similar emission reductions, the decline in areas at risk of acidification in China (7.0%) lags behind those in Europe (20%) or the USA (15%). This was because, unlike Europe and the USA, China&#39;s abatement strategies primarily target air quality improvement rather than mitigating ecological impacts. Given that the area with the risk of eutrophication induced by nitrogen deposition remained at 13% of the country even under the scenario of achieving the dual targets of air quality and carbon dioxide mitigation in 2035, we explored an enhanced ammonia abatement pathway. With a further 27% reduction in ammonia by 2035, China could largely eliminate the impacts of acid deposition. This research serves as a valuable reference for China&#39;s future acid deposition control and for other nations facing similar challenges.},

However, most existing operator learning methods assume that the data originate from a single physical mechanism, limiting their applicability and performance in more realistic scenarios. To this end, we propose the physical invariant attention neural operator (PIANO) to decipher and integrate the physical invariants for operator learning from the PDE series with various physical mechanisms. PIANO employs self-supervised learning to extract physical knowledge and attention mechanisms to integrate them into dynamic convolutional layers. Compared to existing techniques, PIANO can reduce the relative error by 13.6%–82.2% on PDE forecasting tasks across varying coefficients, forces or boundary conditions. Additionally, varied downstream tasks reveal that the PI embeddings deciphered by PIANO align well with the underlying invariants in the PDE systems, verifying the physical significance of PIANO.},

Quantum chemistry studies reveal that the stability of the cluster arises from the 18-electron shell-closing of the [Fe@Fe 12 ] 16+ core, assisted by its bonding interactions with the peripheral tridentate [(Tp*)WS 3 ] 4− ligands which possess both S→Fe donation and spin-polarized Fe−W σ bonds.

Against this backdrop, National Science Review (NSR) organized a web forum on a climate-related topic that needs more exposure to Chinese public and researchers alike: geoengineering. Compared to commonly-known methods to address climate change such as emission reduction, geoengineering proposes to take much more proactive measures such as injecting aerosol into the stratosphere to increase solar reflection, implementing iron fertilization in the ocean to promote microbial growth, and capturing and liquifying CO 2 and injecting it directly into exhausted oil fields. The forum was hosted by Prof. Tong Zhu of Peking University with four panelists.

  abstract     = {Efficient detection of single optical centres in solids is essential for quantum information processing, sensing and single-photon generation applications. In this work, we use radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry to electrically detect the photoionisation induced by a single Er 3+ ion in Si. The high bandwidth and sensitivity of the RF reflectometry provide sub-100-ns time resolution for the photoionisation detection. With this technique, the optically excited state lifetime of a single Er 3+ ion in a Si nano-transistor is measured for the first time to be 0.49 ± 0.04 μ s. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for detecting a charge state change induced by Er excitation and relaxation. This approach could be used for fast readout of other single optical centres in solids and is attractive for large-scale integrated optical quantum systems thanks to the multi-channel RF reflectometry demonstrated with frequency multiplexing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondria undergo fission and fusion that are critical for cell survival and cancer development, while the regulatory factors for mitochondrial dynamics remain elusive. Herein we found that RNA m 6 A accelerated mitochondria fusion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Metabolomics analysis and function studies indicated that m 6 A triggered the generation of glutathione (GSH) via the upregulation of RRM2B—a p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase subunit with anti-reactive oxygen species potential. This in turn resulted in the mitochondria fusion of CRC cells. Mechanistically, m 6 A methylation of A1240 at 3′UTR of RRM2B increased its mRNA stability via binding with IGF2BP2. Similarly, m 6 A methylation of A2212 at the coding sequence (CDS) of OPA1—an essential GTPase protein for mitochondrial inner membrane fusion—also increased mRNA stability and triggered mitochondria fusion. Targeting m 6 A through the methyltransferase inhibitor STM2457 or the dm 6 ACRISPR system significantly suppressed mitochondria fusion. In vivo and clinical data confirmed the positive roles of the m 6 A/mitochondrial dynamics in tumor growth and CRC progression. Collectively, m 6 A promoted mitochondria fusion via induction of GSH synthesis and OPA1 expression, which facilitated cancer cell growth and CRC development.},

Due to its high chemical reactivity and extreme instability, carbyne was much less explored in contrast to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon allotropes such as graphene. Herein, we report the on-surface synthesis of polyynic carbon chains by demetallization of organometallic polyynes on the Au(111) surface; the longest one observed consists of ∼60 alkyne units (120 carbon atoms). The polyynic structure of carbon chains with alternating triple and single bonds was unambiguously revealed by bond-resolved atomic force microscopy. Moreover, an atomically precise polyyne, C 14 , was successfully produced via tip-induced dehalogenation and ring-opening of the decachloroanthracene molecule (C 14 Cl 10 ) on a bilayer NaCl/Au(111) surface at 4.7 K, and a band gap of 5.8 eV was measured by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, in a good agreement with the theoretical HOMO–LUMO gap (5.48 eV).},

  abstract     = {Stereospecific recognition of chiral molecules plays a crucial role in biological systems. The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) exhibits binding affinity towards (−)-morphine, a well-established gold standard in pain management, while it shows minimal binding affinity for the (+)-morphine enantiomer, resulting in a lack of analgesic activity. Understanding how MOR stereoselectively recognizes morphine enantiomers has remained a puzzle in neuroscience and pharmacology for over half-a-century due to the lack of direct observation techniques. To unravel this mystery, we constructed the binding and unbinding processes of morphine enantiomers with MOR via molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics governing MOR&#39;s stereoselective recognition of morphine enantiomers. Our findings reveal that the binding of (−)-morphine stabilizes MOR in its activated state, exhibiting a deep energy well and a prolonged residence time. In contrast, (+)-morphine fails to sustain the activation state of MOR. Furthermore, the results suggest that specific residues, namely D114 2.50 and D147 3.32 , are deprotonated in the active state of MOR bound to (−)-morphine. This work highlights that the selectivity in molecular recognition goes beyond binding affinities, extending into the realm of residence time.},

However, whether exogenous substances, such as nanoparticles, can be synthesized in situ in the nucleus of live cells has not been reported. Here, we have achieved in-situ synthesis of CdS x Se 1− x quantum dots (QDs) in the nucleus by regulation of the glutathione (GSH) metabolic pathway. High enrichment of GSH in the nucleus can be accomplished by the addition of GSH with the help of the Bcl-2 protein. Then, high-valence Se is reduced to low-valence Se by glutathione-reductase-catalyzed GSH, and interacts with the Cd precursor formed through Cd and thiol-rich proteins, eventually generating QDs in the nucleus. Our work contributes to a new understanding of the syntheses of substances in the cell nucleus and will pave the way for the development of advanced ‘supercells’.},

Previous smog chamber studies found that the SOA contributors in biomass-burning emissions are mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) are efficient SOA precursors and contribute a considerable fraction of biomass-burning emissions, their contribution to SOA formation has not been directly observed. Here, by deploying a newly-developed oxidation flow reactor to study SOA formation from wood burning, we find that IVOCs can contribute ∼70% of the formed SOA, i.e. &gt;2 times more than VOCs. This previously missing SOA fraction is interpreted to be due to the high wall losses of semi-volatile oxidation products of IVOCs in smog chambers. The finding in this study reveals that SOA production from biomass burning is much higher than previously thought, and highlights the urgent need for more research on the IVOCs from biomass burning and potentially other emission sources.},

Here, we use polaron interfacial occupied entropy engineering to break through this intercoupling for a PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(4-styrenesulfonate)) thin film by using photochromic diarylethene (DAE) dopants coupled with UV-light modulation. With a 10-fold enhancement of the thermopower from 13.5 μV K −1 to 135.4 μV K −1 and almost unchanged electrical conductivity, the DAE-doped PEDOT:PSS thin film achieved an extremely high power factor of 521.28 μW m −1 K −2 from an original value of 6.78 μW m −1 K −2 . The thermopower was positively correlated with the UV-light intensity but decreased with increasing temperature, indicating resonant coupling between the planar closed DAE molecule and PEDOT. Both the experiments and theoretical calculations consistently confirmed the formation of an interface state due to this resonant coupling. Interfacial entropy engineering of polarons could play a critical role in enhancing the thermoelectric performance of the organic film.},

  abstract     = {Polysaccharide-based membranes with excellent mechanical properties are highly desired. However, severe mechanical deterioration under wet conditions limits their biomedical applications. Here, inspired by the structural heterogeneity of strong yet hydrated biological materials, we propose a strategy based on heterogeneous crosslink-and-hydration (HCH) of a molecule/nano dual-scale network to fabricate polysaccharide-based nanocomposites with robust wet mechanical properties. The heterogeneity lies in that the crosslink-and-hydration occurs in the molecule-network while the stress-bearing nanofiber-network remains unaffected. As one demonstration, a membrane assembled by bacterial cellulose nanofiber-network and Ca 2+ -crosslinked and hydrated sodium alginate molecule-network is designed. Studies show that the crosslinked-and-hydrated molecule-network restricts water invasion and boosts stress transfer of the nanofiber-network by serving as interfibrous bridge. Overall, the molecule-network makes the membrane hydrated and flexible; the nanofiber-network as stress-bearing component provides strength and toughness. The HCH dual-scale network featuring a cooperative effect stimulates the design of advanced biomaterials applied under wet conditions such as guided bone regeneration membranes.},

To what extent the characteristics of parental epigenomes are conserved between humans and mice is currently unknown. Here, we mapped parental haploid epigenomes using human parthenogenetic and androgenetic embryos. Human embryos have a larger portion of genome with parentally specific epigenetic states than mouse embryos. The allelic patterns of epigenetic states for orthologous regions are not conserved between humans and mice. Nevertheless, it is conserved that maternal DNA methylation and paternal H3K27me3 are associated with the repression of two alleles in humans and mice. In addition, for DNA-methylation-dependent imprinting, we report 19 novel imprinted genes and their associated germline differentially methylated regions. Unlike in mice, H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is not observed in human early embryos. Collectively, allele-specific epigenomic reprogramming is different in humans and mice.},

High-precision spectral tunability is of great importance for some special applications with on-demand adaptability but remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a galvanostatic control strategy to achieve this goal, relying on the finding of the quantitative correlation between optical properties and electrochemical reactions within materials. An electrochromic electro-optical efficiency index is established to optically fingerprint and precisely identify electrochemical redox reactions in the electrochromic device. Consequently, the charge-transfer process during galvanostatic electrochemical reaction can be quantitatively regulated, permitting precise control over the final optical performance and on-demand adaptability of electrochromic devices as evidenced by an ultralow deviation of &lt;3.0%. These findings not only provide opportunities for future adaptive optoelectronic applications with strict demand on precise spectral tunability but also will promote in situ quantitative research in a wide range of spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, and material chemistry.},

Intractable challenges exist in this emerging research area, such as relatively poor controllability in the locomotion of soft robotic systems, mismatch of bioelectronic interfaces, and signal coupling in multi-parameter sensing. By virtue of long-time–optimized materials, structures and processes, natural organisms provide rich sources of inspiration to address these challenges, enabling the design and manufacture of many bioinspired 3D flexible devices/systems. In this Review, we focus on bioinspired 3D flexible devices and functional systems, and summarize their representative design concepts, manufacturing methods, principles of structure-function relationship and broad-ranging applications. Discussions on existing challenges, potential solutions and future opportunities are also provided to usher in further research efforts toward realizing bioinspired 3D flexible devices/systems with precisely programmed shapes, enhanced mechanical/electrical performances, and high-level physical/artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Optical communication is a particularly compelling technology for tackling the speed and capacity bottlenecks in data communication in modern society. Currently, the silicon photodetector plays a dominant role in high-speed optical communication across the visible-near-infrared spectrum. However, its intrinsic rigid structure, high working bias and low responsivity essentially limit its application in next-generation flexible optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report a narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) with a remarkable π-extension in the direction of both central and end units (CH17) with respect to the Y6 series, which demonstrates a more effective and compact 3D molecular packing, leading to lower trap states and energetic disorders in the photoactive film. Consequently, the optimized solution-processed organic photodetector (OPD) with CH17 exhibits a remarkable response time of 91 ns (λ = 880 nm) due to the high charge mobility and low parasitic capacitance, exceeding the values of most commercial Si photodiodes and all NFA-based OPDs operating in self-powered mode. More significantly, the flexible OPD exhibits negligible performance attenuation (&lt;1%) after bending for 500 cycles, and maintains 96% of its initial performance even after 550 h of indoor exposure. Furthermore, the high-speed OPD demonstrates a high data transmission rate of 80 MHz with a bit error rate of 3.5 × 10 −4 , meaning it has great potential in next-generation high-speed flexible optical communication systems.},

However, the time-consuming and complicated processes in establishing a current recombinant-protein–based VLP vaccine has limited its quick launch to the out-bursting pandemic. To simplify and optimize VLP vaccine design, we herein report a kind of viromimetic polymer nanoparticle vaccine (VPNVax), with subunit receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins conjugated to the surface of polyethylene glycol- b -polylactic acid (PEG- b -PLA) nanoparticles for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The preparation of VPNVax based on synthetic polymer particle and chemical post-conjugation makes it possible to rapidly replace the antigens and construct matched vaccines at the emergence of different viruses. Using this modular preparation system, we identified that VPNVax with surface protein coverage of 20%–25% had the best immunostimulatory activity, which could keep high levels of specific antibody titers over 5 months and induce virus neutralizing activity when combined with an aluminum adjuvant. Moreover, the polymer nano-vectors could be armed with more immune-adjuvant functions by loading immunostimulant agents or chemical chirality design. This VPNVax platform provides a novel kind of rapidly producing and efficient vaccine against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viral pandemics.},

  abstract     = {A digital coding metasurface is a platform connecting the digital space and electromagnetic wave space, and has therefore gained much attention due to its intriguing value in reshaping wireless channels and realizing new communication architectures. Correspondingly, there is an urgent need for electromagnetic information theory that reveals the upper limit of communication capacity and supports the accurate design of metasurface-based communication systems. To this end, we propose a macroscopic model and a statistical model of the digital coding metasurface. The macroscopic model uniformly accommodates both digital and electromagnetic aspects of the meta-atoms and predicts all possible scattered fields of the digital coding metasurface based on a small number of simulations or measurements. Full-wave simulations and experimental results show that the macroscopic model is feasible and accurate. A statistical model is further proposed to correlate the mutual coupling between meta-atoms with covariance and to calculate the entropy of the equivalent currents of digital coding metasurface. These two models can help reconfigurable intelligent surfaces achieve more accurate beamforming and channel estimation, and thus improve signal power and coverage. Moreover, the models will encourage the creation of a precoding codebook in metasurface-based direct digital modulation systems, with the aim of approaching the upper limit of channel capacity. With these two models, the concepts of current space and current entropy, as well as the analysis of information loss from the coding space to wave space, is established for the first time, helping to bridge the gap between the digital world and the physical world, and advancing developments of electromagnetic information theory and new-architecture wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {China is among the top nitrous oxide (N 2 O)-emitting countries, but existing national inventories do not provide full-scale emissions including both natural and anthropogenic sources. We conducted a four-decade (1980 – 2020) of comprehensive quantification of Chinese N 2 O inventory using empirical emission factor method for anthropogenic sources and two up-to-date process-based models for natural sources. Total N 2 O emissions peaked at 2287.4 (1774.8 – 2799.9) Gg N 2 O yr −1 in 2018, and agriculture-developed regions, like the East, Northeast, and Central, were the top N 2 O-emitting regions. Agricultural N 2 O emissions have started to decrease after 2016 due to the decline of nitrogen fertilization applications, while, industrial and energetic sources have been dramatically increasing after 2005. N 2 O emissions from agriculture, industry, energy, and waste represented 49.3%, 26.4%, 17.5%, and 6.7% of the anthropogenic emissions in 2020, respectively, which revealed that it is imperative to prioritize N 2 O emission mitigation in agriculture, industry, and energy. Natural N 2 O sources, dominated by forests, have been steadily growing from 317.3 (290.3 – 344.1) Gg N 2 O yr −1 in 1980 to 376.2 (335.5 – 407.2) Gg N 2 O yr −1 in 2020.

Here we report the growth trajectory of frontal appendages of the apex predator Amplectobelua symbrachiata , one of the most common radiodont arthropods from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota ( c . 520 Ma) of China. Analysis of 432 specimens (9.1–137.1 mm length; 1.3–25.6 mm height) reveals that appendages grew isometrically, with an estimated maximum size of the whole animal of c . 90 cm. Individuals grew rapidly compared to extant arthropods, as assessed using the electronic length-frequency analysis (ELEFAN) approach. Therefore, we show that the Cambrian apex predator A. symbrachiata was an extremely fast-growing arthropod, with an unusual life history strategy that formed as part of the escalatory ‘arms race’ that shaped the Cambrian explosion over 500 Ma.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity transition temperature ( T c ) marks the inception of a macroscopic quantum phase-coherent paired state in fermionic systems. For 2D superconductivity, the paired electrons condense into a coherent superfluid state at T c , which is usually lower than the pairing temperature, between which intrinsic physics including Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition and pseudogap state are hotly debated. In the case of monolayer FeSe superconducting films on SrTiO 3 (001), although the pairing temperature ( T p ) is revealed to be 65–83 K by using spectroscopy characterization, the measured zero-resistance temperature ( ⁠ T c 0 ⁠ ) is limited to 20 K. Here, we report significantly enhanced superconductivity in monolayer FeSe films by δ-doping of Eu or Al on SrTiO 3 (001) surface, in which T c 0 is enhanced by 12 K with a narrowed transition width Δ T c ∼ 8 K, compared with non-doped samples. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we demonstrate lowered work function of the δ-doped SrTiO 3 (001) surface and enlarged superconducting gaps in the monolayer FeSe with improved morphology/electronic homogeneity. Our work provides a practical route to enhance 2D superconductivity by using interface engineering.},

  abstract     = {Transformation optics (TO) provides an unprecedented technique to control electromagnetic (EM) waves by engineering the constitutive parameters of the surrounding medium through a proper spatial transformation. In general, ideal transformation optical devices require simultaneous electric and magnetic responses along all three dimensions. To ease the practical implementation, previous studies usually made use of reduced parameters or other simplified approaches, which inevitably introduce extra reflection or unwanted phase shift. Up to today, experimental realizations of full-parameter transformation optical devices in free space are still quite limited. Here, a general design strategy is proposed to solve this problem. As a specific example, a full-parameter spatial-compression TO medium with constitutive parameters taking the diagonal form diag( a, a , 1/ a ) for the TM wave incidence was designed and realized experimentally. Such spatial-compression TO media were then applied to the implementation of an ideal omnidirectional invisibility cloak capable of concealing a large-scale object over a wide range of illumination angles. Both the simulation and experiment confirm that the cloak allows for nearly unity transmission of EM waves in the forward direction without introducing extra scattering or phase shift. This work constitutes an important stepping stone for future practical implementation of arbitrary full-parameter omnidirectional transformation optical devices.},

Through systematic first-principles calculations, we predict that the in-plane magnetization induced QAHE with Chern numbers C = ±1 and the out-of-plane magnetization induced QAHE with high Chern numbers C = ±3 can be realized in a single material candidate, which is composed of van der Waals (vdW) coupled Bi and MnBi 2 Te 4 monolayers. The switching between different phases of QAHE can be controlled in multiple ways, such as applying strain or (weak) magnetic field or twisting the vdW materials. The prediction of an experimentally available material system hosting robust, highly tunable QAHE will stimulate great research interest in the field. Our work opens a new avenue for the realization of tunable QAHE and provides a practical material platform for the development of topological electronics.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials represent a major frontier for research into exotic many-body quantum phenomena. In the extreme two-dimensional limit, electron-electron interaction often dominates over other electronic energy scales, leading to strongly correlated effects such as quantum spin liquid and unconventional superconductivity. The dominance is conventionally attributed to the lack of electron screening in the third dimension. Here, we discover an intriguing metal to Mott insulator transition in 1T-TaSe 2 that defies conventional wisdom. Specifically, we find that dimensionality crossover, instead of reduced screening, drives the transition in atomically thin 1T-TaSe 2 . A dispersive band crossing the Fermi level is found to be responsible for the bulk metallicity in the material. Reducing the dimensionality, however, effectively quenches the kinetic energy of these initially itinerant electrons, and drives the material into a Mott insulating state. The dimensionality-driven metal to Mott insulator transition resolves the long-standing dichotomy between metallic bulk and insulating surface of 1T-TaSe 2 . Our work further reveals a new pathway for modulating two-dimensional materials that enables exploring strongly correlated systems across uncharted parameter space.},

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a critical viral immunogen, is affected by the heterogeneity of its glycan structures and relatively low immunogenicity. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic platform that enables the precise synthesis of homogeneously glycosylated RBD, facilitating the elucidation of carbohydrate structure–function relationships. Five homogeneously glycosylated RBDs bearing biantennary glycans were prepared, three of which were conjugated to T-helper epitope (T pep ) from tetanus toxoid to improve their weak immune response. Relative to natural HEK293-derived RBD, synthetic RBDs with biantennary N -glycan elicited a higher level of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Furthermore, RBDs containing T pep elicited significant immune responses in transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Our collective data suggest that trimming the N -glycans and T pep conjugation of RBD could potentially serve as an effective strategy for developing subunit vaccines providing efficient protection.},

  abstract     = {Iron catalysts are ideal transition metal catalysts because of the Earths abundant, cheap, biocompatible features of iron salts. Iron catalysts often have unique open-shell structures that easily undergo spin crossover in chemical transformations, a feature rarely found in noble metal catalysts. Unfortunately, little is known currently about how the open-shell structure and spin crossover affect the reactivity and selectivity of iron catalysts, which makes the development of iron catalysts a low efficient trial-and-error program. In this paper, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the iron-catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkynes is typical spin-crossover catalysis. Deep insight into the electronic structures of a set of well-defined open-shell active formal Fe(0) catalysts revealed that the spin-delocalization between the iron center and the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand effectively regulates the iron center&#39;s spin and oxidation state to meet the opposite electrostatic requirements of oxidative addition and reductive elimination, respectively, and the spin crossover is essential for this electron transfer process. The triplet transition state was essential for achieving high regioselectivity through tuning the nonbonding interactions. These findings provide an important reference for understanding the effect of catalyst spin state on reaction. It is inspiring for the development of iron catalysts and other Earth-abundant metal catalysts, especially from the point of view of ligand development.},

  abstract     = {In the past 5 years, there has been significant research interest in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator family compounds MnBi 2+2 n Te 4+3 n (where n = 0, 1, 2 …). In particular, exfoliated thin films of MnBi 2 Te 4 have led to numerous experimental breakthroughs, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, axion insulator phase and high-Chern number quantum Hall effect without Landau levels. However, despite extensive efforts, the energy gap of the topological surface states due to exchange magnetic coupling, which is a key feature of the characteristic band structure of the system, remains experimentally elusive. The electronic structure measured by using angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) shows significant deviation from ab initio prediction and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements, making it challenging to understand the transport results based on the electronic structure. This paper reviews the measurements of the band structure of MnBi 2+2 n Te 4+3 n magnetic topological insulators using ARPES, focusing on the evolution of their electronic structures with temperature, surface and bulk doping and film thickness. The aim of the review is to construct a unified picture of the electronic structure of MnBi 2+2 n Te 4+3 n compounds and explore possible control of their topological properties.},

Fortunately, the revolving A-site presents an opportunity to strengthen this interaction by utilizing an external field. Herein, we propose a novel approach to achieving an ordered magnetic dipole moment, which is regulated by a magnetic field via the coupling effect between the chiral passivation molecule and the A-site (formamidine ion) in perovskites. This strategy can increase the molecular interaction energy by approximately four times and ensure a well-ordered molecular arrangement. The quality of the deposited perovskite film is significantly optimized with inhibited nonradiative recombination. It manages to reduce the open-circuit voltage loss of photovoltaic devices to 360 mV and increase the power conversion efficiency to 25.22%. This finding provides a new insight into the exploration of A-sites in perovskites and offers a novel route to improving the device performance of perovskite photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Until now, significant healthcare challenges and growing urgent clinical requirements remain incompletely addressed by presently available biomedical materials. This is due to their inadequate mechanical compatibility, suboptimal physical and chemical properties, susceptibility to immune rejection, and concerns about long-term biological safety. As an alternative, liquid metal (LM) opens up a promising class of biomaterials with unique advantages like biocompatibility, flexibility, excellent electrical conductivity, and ease of functionalization. However, despite the unique advantages and successful explorations of LM in biomedical fields, widespread clinical translations and applications of LM-based medical products remain limited. This article summarizes the current status and future prospects of LM biomaterials, interprets their applications in healthcare, medical imaging, bone repair, nerve interface, and tumor therapy, etc. Opportunities to translate LM materials into medicine and obstacles encountered in practices are discussed. Following that, we outline a blueprint for LM clinics, emphasizing their potential in making new-generation artificial organs. Last, the core challenges of LM biomaterials in clinical translation, including bio-safety, material stability, and ethical concerns are also discussed. Overall, the current progress, translational medicine bottlenecks, and perspectives of LM biomaterials signify their immense potential to drive future medical breakthroughs and thus open up novel avenues for upcoming clinical practices.},

Recent advancements in artificial-intelligence technology have enabled significant strides in extracting features from massive and intricate data sets, thereby presenting a breakthrough in utilizing wearable sensors for practical applications. Beyond traditional machine-learning techniques for classifying simple gestures, advanced machine-learning algorithms have been developed to handle more complex and nuanced motion-based tasks with restricted training data sets. Machine-learning techniques have improved the ability to perceive, and thus machine-learned wearable soft sensors have enabled accurate and rapid human-gesture recognition, providing real-time feedback to users. This forms a crucial component of future wearable electronics, contributing to a robust human–machine interface.

Here, we report that lactate is highly enriched in the nuclei of early embryos when major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs in humans and mice. The inhibition of its production and uptake results in developmental arrest at the 2-cell stage, major ZGA failure, and loss of lactate-derived H3K18lac, which could be rescued by the addition of Lac-CoA and recapitulated by overexpression of H3K18R mutation. By profiling the landscape of H3K18lac during mouse preimplantation development, we show that H3K18lac is enriched on the promoter regions of most major ZGA genes and correlates with their expressions. In humans, H3K18lac is also enriched in ZGA markers and temporally concomitant with their expressions. Taken together, we profile the landscapes of H3K18lac in mouse and human preimplantation embryos, and demonstrate the important role for H3K18lac in major ZGA, showing that a conserved metabolic mechanism underlies preimplantation development of mammalian embryos.},

  abstract     = {Kidney transplantation is the gold standard for the treatment of end-stage renal diseases (ESRDs). However, the scarcity of donor kidneys has caused more and more ESRD patients to be stuck on the waiting list for transplant surgery. Improving the survival rate for renal grafts is an alternative solution to the shortage of donor kidneys. Therefore, real-time monitoring of the surgical process is crucial to the success of kidney transplantation, but efficient methods and techniques are lacking. Herein, a fluorescence technology based on bright, photostable and long-circulating aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active NIR-II nano-contrast agent DIPT-ICF nanoparticles for the whole-process monitoring and evaluation of renal transplantation has been reported. In the aggregated state, DIPT-ICF exhibits superior photophysical properties compared with the commercial dyes IR-26 and IR-1061. Besides, the long-circulating characteristic of the AIE nano-contrast agent helps to achieve renal angiography in kidney retrieval surgery, donor kidney quality evaluation, diagnosing vascular and ureteral complications, and assessment of renal graft reperfusion beyond renovascular reconstruction, which considerably outperforms the clinically approved indocyanine green (ICG).},

The interplay between magnetism and band topology in this family has led to the proposal of various topological phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and quantum magnetoelectric effect. Among these, the quantum anomalous Hall effect has been experimentally observed at record-high temperatures, highlighting the unprecedented potential of this family of materials in fundamental science and technological innovation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the research progress in this intrinsic magnetic topological insulator family, with a focus on single-crystal growth, characterization of chemical disorder, manipulation of magnetism through chemical substitution and external pressure, and important questions that remain to be conclusively answered.},

  abstract     = {Graphene is one of the most promising candidates for integrated circuits due to its robustness against short-channel effects, inherent high carrier mobility and desired gapless nature for Ohmic contact, but it is difficult to achieve satisfactory on/off ratios even at the expense of its carrier mobility, limiting its device applications. Here, we present a strategy to realize high back-gate switching ratios in a graphene monolayer with well-maintained high mobility by forming a vertical heterostructure with a black phosphorus multi-layer. By local current annealing, strain is introduced within an established area of the graphene, which forms a reflective interface with the rest of the strain-free area and thus generates a robust off-state via local current depletion. Applying a positive back-gate voltage to the heterostructure can keep the black phosphorus insulating, while a negative back-gate voltage changes the black phosphorus to be conductive because of hole accumulation. Then, a parallel channel is activated within the strain-free graphene area by edge-contacted electrodes, thereby largely inheriting the intrinsic carrier mobility of graphene in the on-state. As a result, the device can provide an on/off voltage ratio of &gt;10 3 as well as a mobility of ∼8000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, meeting the low-power criterion suggested by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems.},

Using a one-dimensional thermal evolution model, we show that core-mantle friction can sustain global-scale partial melting in the upper lunar mantle until ∼3.1 Ga, thus accounting for the intense volcanic activity on the Moon before ∼3.0 Ga. Besides, core-mantle friction tends to suppress the secular cooling of the lunar core and is unlikely to be an energy source for the long-lived lunar core dynamo. Our model also favours the transition of the Cassini state before the end of the lunar magma ocean phase (∼4.2 Ga), which implies a decreasing lunar obliquity over time after the solidification of the lunar magma ocean. Such a trend of lunar obliquity evolution may allow volcanically released water to be buried in the lunar regolith of the polar regions. As a consequence, local water ice could be more abundant than previously thought when considering only its accumulation caused by solar wind and comet spreading.},

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the tungsten bronze phase H 0.53 WO 3 (HWO) is an exceptionally ideal hydrogen carrier, with salient features including temperature-dependent highly-reductive atomic hydrogen release and broad-spectrum RONS scavenging capability distinct from that of molecular hydrogen. Moreover, its unique pH-responsive biodegradability ensures post-therapeutic clearance at pathological sites. Treatment with HWO of diabetic wounds in an animal model indicates that the solid-state atomic H promotes vascular formation by activating M2-type macrophage polarization and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, resulting in acceleration of chronic wound healing. Our findings significantly expand the basic categories of hydrogen therapeutic materials and pave the way for investigating more physical forms of hydrogen species as efficient RONS scavengers for clinical disease treatment.},

However, whether the beneficial effects of CAAs are equally distributed geographically is unknown. Using high-resolution maps of the distributions of major air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM 2.5 ] and ozone [O 3 ]) and population, we aimed to track spatiotemporal changes in health impacts from, and geographic inequality embedded in, the reduced exposures to PM 2.5 and O 3 from 2013 to 2020. We used a method established by the Global Burden of Diseases Study. By analyzing the changes in loss of life expectancy (LLE) attributable to PM 2.5 and O 3 , we calculated the gain of life expectancy (GLE) to quantify the health benefits of the air-quality improvement. Finally, we assessed the geographic inequality embedded in the GLE using the Gini index (GI). Based on risk assessments of PM 2.5 and O 3 , during the first stage of CAAs (2013 to 2017), the mean GLE was 1.87 months. Half of the sum of the GLE was disproportionally distributed in about one quarter of the population exposed (GI 0.44). During the second stage of CAAs (2017 to 2020), the mean GLE increased to 3.94 months and geographic inequality decreased (GI 0.18). According to our assessments, CAAs were enhanced, from the first to second stages, in terms of not only preventing premature mortality but also ameliorating health inequalities. The enhancements were related to increased sensitivity to the health effects of air pollution and synergic control of PM 2.5 and O 3 levels. Our findings will contribute to optimizing future CAAs.},

To address this issue, in this study, we introduce soft-decision decoding approach into DDS by proposing a DNA-specific error prediction model and a series of novel strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a proof-of-concept DDS system based on Reed-Solomon (RS) code, named as Derrick. Derrick shows significant improvement in error-correcting capability without involving additional redundancy in both in vitro and in silico experiments, using various sequencing technologies such as Illumina, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). Notably, in vitro experiments using ONT sequencing at a depth of 7× reveal that Derrick, compared with the traditional hard-decision decoding strategy, doubles the error-correcting capability of RS code, decreases the proportion of matrices with decoding-failure by 229-fold, and amplifies the potential maximum storage volume by impressive 32 388-fold. Also, Derrick surpasses ‘state-of-the-art’ DDS systems by comprehensively considering the information density and the minimum sequencing depth required for complete information recovery. Crucially, the soft-decision decoding strategy and key steps of Derrick are generalizable to other ECCs’ decoding algorithms.},

Although quantized transport properties have been observed in exfoliated MnBi 2 Te 4 thin flakes, it remains a big challenge to achieve molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown MnBi 2 Te 4 thin films even close to the quantized regime. In this work, we report the realization of quantized anomalous Hall resistivity in MBE-grown MnBi 2 Te 4 thin films with the chemical potential tuned by both controlled in situ oxygen exposure and top gating. We find that elongated post-annealing obviously elevates the temperature to achieve quantization of the Hall resistivity, but also increases the residual longitudinal resistivity, indicating a picture of high-quality QAH puddles weakly coupled by tunnel barriers. These results help to clarify the puzzles in previous experimental studies on MnBi 2 Te 4 and to find a way out of the big difficulty in obtaining MnBi 2 Te 4 samples showing quantized transport properties.},

The random distribution of ionomer, added by the traditional physical mixing method, in the catalyst layer of GDEs affects the transport of ions and CO 2 . Such a phenomenon results in elevated cell voltage and decaying selectivity at high current densities. This paper describes a pre-confinement method to construct GDEs with homogeneously distributed ionomer, which enhances mass transfer locally at the active centers. The optimized GDE exhibited comparatively low cell voltages and high CO Faradaic efficiencies (FE &gt; 90%) at a wide range of current densities. It can also operate stably for over 220 h with the cell voltage staying almost unchanged. This good performance can be preserved even with diluted CO 2 feeds, which is essential for pursuing a high single-pass conversion rate. This study provides a new approach to building efficient mass transfer pathways for ions and reactants in GDEs to promote the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR for practical applications.},

Specifically, we focus on the ubiquitously (nearly) gapless behavior of the topological Dirac surface state observed by photoemission spectroscopy, even though a large Dirac gap is expected because of surface ferromagnetic order. The dichotomy between experiment and theory concerning this gap behavior is perhaps the most critical and puzzling question in this frontier. We discuss various proposals accounting for the lack of magnetic effect on the topological Dirac surface state, which are mainly categorized into two pictures, magnetic reconfiguration and topological surface state redistribution. Band engineering towards opening a magnetic gap of topological surface states provides great opportunities to realize quantized topological transport and axion electrodynamics at higher temperatures.},

They represent a new class of materials exhibiting nontrivial topological phases, and provide a platform for exploring exotic transport phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect. Recently, magnetic topological materials have attracted considerable interests due to the possibility to study the interplay between topological and magnetic orders. In particular, the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator phases can be realized in topological insulators with magnetic order. MnBi 2 Te 4 , as the first intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator discovered, allows the examination of existing theoretical predictions; it has been extensively studied, and many new discoveries have been made. Here we review the progress made on MnBi 2 Te 4 from both experimental and theoretical aspects. The bulk crystal and magnetic structures are surveyed first, followed by a review of theoretical calculations and experimental probes on the band structure and surface states, and a discussion of various exotic phases that can be realized in MnBi 2 Te 4 . The properties of MnBi 2 Te 4 thin films and the corresponding transport studies are then reviewed, with an emphasis on the edge state transport. Possible future research directions in this field are also discussed.},

Here, we reveal a universal origin of the layer Hall effect in terms of the so-called hidden Berry curvature, as well as material design principles. Hence, it gives rise to zero Berry curvature in momentum space but non-zero layer-locked hidden Berry curvature in real space. We show that, compared to that of a trivial insulator, the layer Hall effect is significantly enhanced in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. Our universal picture provides a paradigm for revealing the hidden physics as a result of the interplay between the global and local symmetries, and can be generalized in various scenarios.},

However, its direct observation is yet to be realized due to the demanding magnetic configuration required to gap all surface states. Here, we theoretically propose that axion insulators with a simple ferromagnetic configuration, such as the MnBi 2 Te 4 /(Bi 2 Te 3 ) n family, provide an ideal playground to realize the TME. In the designed triangular prism geometry, all the surface states are magnetically gapped. Under a vertical electric field, the surface Hall currents give rise to a nearly half-quantized orbital moment, accompanied by a gapless chiral hinge mode circulating in parallel. Thus, the orbital magnetization from the two topological origins can be easily distinguished by reversing the electric field. Our work paves the way for direct observation of the TME in realistic axion-insulator materials.},

Here, we developed a reproducible and high-efficiency isolation technology for different types of cell-free nucleic acids (containing cfRNA and viral RNA) in serum/plasma based on the inclusion of nucleic acids by metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, which greatly improved the isolation efficiency and was able to preserve RNA integrity compared with the most widely used research kit method. Importantly, the quality of cfRNA extracted by the MOF method is about 10-fold that of the kit method, and the MOF method isolates more than three times as many different RNA types as the kit method. The whole transcriptome mapping characteristics of cfRNA in serum from patients with liver cancer was described and a cfRNA signature with six cfRNAs was identified to diagnose liver cancer with high diagnostic efficiency (area under curve = 0.905 in the independent validation cohort) using this MOF method. Thus, this new MOF isolation technique will advance the field of liquid biopsy, with the potential to diagnose liver cancer.},

Mechanistic studies revealed that conjugate I upregulated the expression of transcripts associated with innate immunity and metabolism in cancer cells, significantly differing from cisplatin and MSA-2. An analysis of the tumor microenvironment demonstrated that conjugate I could enhance the infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells into tumors and promote the activation of T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells in tumor tissues. These findings indicated that conjugate I , which was created by incorporating a Pt chemotherapeutic drug and STING agonist into one molecule, is a promising and potent anticancer drug candidate, opening new avenues for small-molecule-based cancer metalloimmunotherapy.},

Metallic systems containing buried catalytically active transitional metals and exposed catalytically inert main group metals are constructed, and the electronic interaction between them via metallic bonding is disclosed. Through the electronic interaction, the catalytic properties of subsurface transitional metals (Pd or Rh) can be transferred to outermost main group metals (Al or Mg) for several important transformations like semi-hydrogenation, Suzuki-coupling and hydroformylation. The catalytic force is conductive, in analogy with the magnetic force and electrostatic force. The traditional definition of active centers is challenged by the concept of conductive catalysis and the electronic nature of catalysis is more easily understood. It might provide new opportunities for shielding traditional active centers against poisoning or leaching and allow for precise regulation of their catalytic properties by the conductive layer.},

  abstract     = {The Late Ordovician Mass Extinction was the earliest of the ‘big’ five extinction events and the earliest to affect the trajectory of metazoan life. Two phases have been identified near the start of the Hirnantian period and in the middle. It was a massive taxonomic extinction, a weak phylogenetic extinction and a relatively benign ecological extinction. A rapid cooling, triggering a major ice age that reduced the temperature of surface waters, prompted a drop in sea level of some 100 m and introduced toxic bottom waters onto the shelves. These symptoms of more fundamental planetary processes have been associated with a range of factors with an underlying driver identified as volcanicity. Volcanic eruptions, and other products, may have extended back in time to at least the Sandbian and early Katian, suggesting the extinctions were more protracted and influential than hitherto documented.},

Miniature head-mounted microscopes offer the capability of calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, implanting multiple microscopes on a mouse brain remains challenging due to space constraints and the cumbersome weight of the equipment. Here, we present TINIscope, a Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Proof-of-concept experiments with TINIscope recorded over 1000 neurons in four hippocampal subregions and revealed concurrent activity patterns spanning across these regions. Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The marine losses during the Permo-Triassic mass extinction were the worst ever experienced. All groups were badly affected, especially amongst the benthos (e.g. brachiopods, corals, bryozoans, foraminifers, ostracods). Planktonic populations underwent a fundamental change with eukaryotic algae being replaced by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, green-sulphur bacteria, sulphate-reducing bacteria and prasinophytes. Detailed studies of boundary sections, especially those in South China, have resolved the crisis to a ∼55 kyr interval straddling the Permo-Triassic boundary. Many of the losses occur at the beginning and end of this interval painting a picture of a two-phase extinction. Improved knowledge of the extinction has been supported by numerous geochemical studies that allow diverse proposed extinction mechanisms to be studied. A transition from oxygenated to anoxic-euxinic conditions is seen in most sections globally, although the intensity and timing shows regional variability. Decreased ocean ventilation coincides with rapidly rising temperatures and many extinction scenarios attribute the losses to both anoxia and high temperatures. Other kill mechanisms include ocean acidification for which there is conflicting support from geochemical proxies and, even less likely, siltation (burial under a massive influx of terrigenous sediment) which lacks substantive sedimentological evidence. The ultimate driver of the catastrophic changes at the end of the Permian was likely Siberian Trap eruptions and their associated carbon dioxide emissions with consequences such as warming, ocean stagnation and acidification. Volcanic winter episodes stemming from Siberian volcanism have also been linked to the crisis, but the short-term nature of these episodes (&lt;decades) and the overwhelming evidence for rapid warming during the crisis makes this an unlikely cause. Finally, whilst the extinction is well studied in equatorial latitudes, a different history is found in northern Boreal latitudes including an earlier crisis which merits further study in order to fully understand the course and cause of the Permo-Triassic extinctions.},

  abstract     = {Lipiodol chemotherapeutic emulsions remain one of the main choices for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, the limited stability of Lipiodol chemotherapeutic emulsions would lead to rapid drug diffusion, which would reduce the therapeutic benefit and cause systemic toxicity of administrated chemotherapeutics. Therefore, the development of enhanced Lipiodol-based formulations is of great significance to enable effective and safe TACE treatment. Herein, a stable water-in-oil Lipiodol Pickering emulsion (LPE) stabilized by pH-dissociable calcium carbonate nanoparticles and hemin is prepared and utilized for efficient encapsulation of lipoxygenase (LOX). The obtained LOX-loaded CaCO 3 &amp;hemin-stabilized LPE (LHCa-LPE) showing greatly improved emulsion stability could work as a pH-responsive and self-fueling microreactor to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a main component of Lipiodol, to cytotoxic lipid radicals through the cascading catalytic reaction driven by LOX and hemin, thus inducing ferroptosis of cancer cells. As a result, such LHCa-LPE upon transcatheter embolization can effectively suppress the progression of orthotopic N1S1 HCC in rats. This study highlights a concise strategy to prepare pH-responsive and stable LPE-based self-fueling microreactors, which could serve as bifunctional embolic and ferroptosis-inducing agents to enable proof-of-concept transarterial ferro-embolization therapy of HCC.},

The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is important for initiating these responses. However, the molecular heterogeneities and cellular diversities of the NTS occlude a better understanding of these defensive responses. Here, we constructed the single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of NTS cells and found multiple populations of NTS neurons that may be involved in these defensive responses. Among these, we identified Calbindin1-positive (Calb1 + ) NTS neurons that are molecularly distinct from Tac1 + neurons. These Calb1 + neurons are critical for nausea and retching induced by cereulide; an emetic toxin secreted by Bacillus Cereus . Strikingly, we found that cereulide can directly modulate vagal sensory neurons that innervate Calb1 + NTS neurons, a novel mechanism distinct from that for nausea and retching induced by Staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Together, our transcriptomic atlas of NTS neurons and the functional analyses revealed the neural mechanism for cereulide-induced retching-like behavior. These results demonstrate the molecular and cellular complexities in the brain that underlie defensive responses to the diversities of pathogens and toxins.},

Prof. Erwin has been interested in the end-Permian mass extinction since graduate school. He has worked on a variety of problems, from Permian gastropod systematics to the origin of animals. Currently his work focuses on the nature of evolutionary novelty and innovation. Prof. Shen&#39;s research career is centered upon the end-Permian mass extinction, Permian stratigraphy and global correlations, with taxonomic expertise on brachiopods and conodonts. The International Commission on Stratigraphy recognizes his outstanding singular contribution to stratigraphy and awarded him the ICS Stratigraphy Medal in 2019.},

While nearly all neocortical neurons are generated by radial glial progenitors (RGPs), it remains largely unclear how a complex yet organized neocortex is constructed reliably and robustly. Here, we show that the division behavior and neuronal output of RGPs are highly constrained with patterned variabilities to support the reliable and robust construction of the mouse neocortex. The neurogenic process of RGPs can be well-approximated by a consistent Poisson-like process unfolding over time, producing deep to superficial layer neurons progressively. The exact neuronal outputs regarding layer occupation are variable; yet, this variability is constrained systematically to support all layer formation, largely reflecting the variable intermediate progenitor generation and RGP neurogenic entry and exit timing differences. Together, these results define the fundamental features of neocortical neurogenesis with a balanced reliability and variability for the construction of the complex neocortex.},

  abstract     = {Theory regarding the causation of mass extinctions is in need of systematization, which is the focus of this contribution. Every mass extinction has both an ultimate cause, i.e. the trigger that leads to various climato-environmental changes, and one or more proximate cause(s), i.e. the specific climato-environmental changes that result in elevated biotic mortality. With regard to ultimate causes, strong cases can be made that bolide (i.e. meteor) impacts, large igneous province (LIP) eruptions and bioevolutionary events have each triggered one or more of the Phanerozoic Big Five mass extinctions, and that tectono-oceanic changes have triggered some second-order extinction events. Apart from bolide impacts, other astronomical triggers (e.g. solar flares, gamma bursts and supernova explosions) remain entirely in the realm of speculation. With regard to proximate mechanisms, most extinctions are related to either carbon-release or carbon-burial processes, the former being associated with climatic warming, ocean acidification, reduced marine productivity and lower carbonate δ 13 C values, and the latter with climatic cooling, increased marine productivity and higher carbonate δ 13 C values. Environmental parameters such as marine redox conditions and terrestrial weathering intensity do not show consistent relationships with carbon-cycle changes. In this context, mass extinction causation can be usefully classified using a matrix of ultimate and proximate factors. Among the Big Five mass extinctions, the end-Cretaceous biocrisis is an example of a bolide-triggered carbon-release event, the end-Permian and end-Triassic biocrises are examples of LIP-triggered carbon-release events, and the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian biocrises are examples of bioevolution-triggered carbon-burial events. Whereas the bolide-impact and LIP-eruption mechanisms appear to invariably cause carbon release, bioevolutionary triggers can result in variable carbon-cycle changes, e.g. carbon burial during the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian events, carbon release associated with modern anthropogenic climate warming, and little to no carbon-cycle impact due to certain types of ecosystem change (e.g. the advent of the first predators around the end-Ediacaran; the appearance of Paleolithic human hunters in Australasia and the Americas). Broadly speaking, studies of mass extinction causation have suffered from insufficiently critical thinking—an impartial survey of the extant evidence shows that (i) hypotheses of a common ultimate cause (e.g. bolide impacts or LIP eruptions) for all Big Five mass extinctions are suspect given manifest differences in patterns of environmental and biotic change among them; (ii) the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian events were associated with carbon burial and long-term climatic cooling, i.e. changes that are inconsistent with a bolide-impact or LIP-eruption mechanism; and (iii) claims of periodicity in Phanerozoic mass extinctions depended critically on the now-disproven idea that they shared a common extrinsic trigger (i.e. bolide impacts).},

  abstract     = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology based on magnetic resonance (a basic physical phenomenon) can directly transfer energy from the source to the load without wires and other physical contacts, and has been successfully applied to implantable medical devices, electric vehicles, robotic arms and other fields. However, due to the frequency splitting of near-field coupling, the resonant WPT system has some unique limitations, such as poor transmission stability and low efficiency. Here, we propose anti-resonance with level pinning for high-performance WPT. By introducing the anti-resonance mode into the basic WPT platform, we uncover the competition between dissipative coupling and coherent coupling to achieve novel level pinning, and construct an effective anti-parity-time (anti- PT )-symmetric non-Hermitian system that is superior to previous PT -symmetric WPT schemes. On the one hand, the eigenvalue of the anti- PT -symmetric system at resonance frequency is always pure real in both strong and weak coupling regions, and can be used to overcome the transmission efficiency decrease caused by weak coupling, as brought about by, for example, a large size ratio of the transmitter to receiver, or a long transmission distance. On the other hand, due to the level pinning effect of the two kinds of coupling mechanisms, the working frequency of the system is guaranteed to be locked, so frequency tracking is not required when the position and size of the receiver change. Even if the system deviates from the matching condition, an efficient WPT can be realized, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the level pinning. The experimental results show that when the size ratio of the transmitter coil to the receiver coil is 4.29 (which is in the weak coupling region), the transfer efficiency of the anti- PT -symmetric system is nearly 4.3 (3.2) times higher than that of the PT -symmetric system when the matching conditions are satisfied (deviated). With the miniaturization and integration of devices in mind, a synthetic anti- PT -symmetric system is used to realize a robust WPT. Anti- PT -symmetric WPT technology based on the synthetic dimension not only provides a good research platform for the study of abundant non-Hermitian physics, but also provides a means of going beyond traditional near-field applications with resonance mechanisms, such as resonance imaging, wireless sensing and photonic routing.},

  abstract     = {New particle formation (NPF) in the tropical free troposphere (FT) is a globally important source of cloud condensation nuclei, affecting cloud properties and climate. Oxidized organic molecules (OOMs) produced from biogenic volatile organic compounds are believed to contribute to aerosol formation in the tropical FT, but without direct chemical observations. We performed in situ molecular-level OOMs measurements at the Bolivian station Chacaltaya at 5240 m above sea level, on the western edge of Amazonia. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of OOMs, mainly with 4–5 carbon atoms, in both gas-phase and particle-phase (in terms of mass contribution) measurements in tropical FT air from Amazonia. These observations, combined with air mass history analyses, indicate that the observed OOMs are linked to isoprene emitted from the rainforests hundreds of kilometers away. Based on particle-phase measurements, we find that these compounds can contribute to NPF, at least the growth of newly formed nanoparticles, in the tropical FT on a continental scale. Thus, our study is a fundamental and significant step in understanding the aerosol formation process in the tropical FT.},

  abstract     = {The finite Berry curvature in topological materials can induce many subtle phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), spin Hall effect (SHE), anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), non-linear Hall effect (NLHE) and bulk photovoltaic effects. To explore these novel physics as well as their connection and coupling, a precise and effective model should be developed. Here, we propose such a versatile model—a 3D triangular lattice with alternating hopping parameters, which can yield various topological phases, including kagome bands, triply degenerate fermions, double Weyl semimetals and so on. We reveal that this special lattice can present unconventional transport due to its unique topological surface states and the aforementioned topological phenomena, such as AHE, ANE, NLHE and the topological photocurrent effect. In addition, we also provide a number of material candidates that have been synthesized experimentally with this lattice, and discuss two materials, including a non-magnetic triangular system for SHE, NLHE and the shift current, and a ferromagnetic triangular lattice for AHE and ANE. Our work provides an excellent platform, including both the model and materials, for the study of Berry-curvature-related physics.},

  abstract     = {As compressed hydrides constantly refresh the records of superconducting critical temperatures ( T c ) in the vicinity of room temperature, this further reinforces the confidence to find more high-temperature superconducting hydrides. In this process, metastable phases of superhydrides offer enough possibilities to access superior superconducting properties. Here we report a metastable hexagonal lanthanum superhydride ( P 6 3 /mmc -LaH 10 ) stabilized at 146 GPa by introducing an appropriate proportion of Al, which exhibits high-temperature superconductivity with T c ∼ 178 K, and this value is enhanced to a maximum T c ∼ 223 K at 164 GPa. A huge upper critical magnetic field value H c 2 (0) reaches 223 T at 146 GPa. The small volume expansion of P 6 3 /mmc -(La, Al) H 10 compared with the binary LaH 10 indicates the possible interstitial sites of Al atoms filling into the La–H lattice, instead of forming conventional ternary alloy-based superhydrides. This work provides a new strategy for metastable high-temperature superconductors through the multiple-element system.},

  abstract     = {Precisely acquiring the timing information of individual X-ray photons is important in both fundamental research and practical applications. The timing precision of commonly used X-ray single-photon detectors remains in the range of one hundred picoseconds to microseconds. In this work, we report on high-timing-precision detection of single X-ray photons through the fast transition to the normal state from the superconductive state of superconducting nanowires. We successfully demonstrate a free-running X-ray single-photon detector with a timing resolution of 20.1 ps made of 100-nm-thick niobium nitride film with an active area of 50 μ m by 50 μ m. By using a repeated differential timing measurement on two adjacent X-ray single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a precision of 0.87 ps in the arrival-time difference of X-ray photon measurements. Therefore, our work significantly enhances the timing precision in X-ray photon counting, opening a new niche for ultrafast X-ray photonics and many associated applications.},
