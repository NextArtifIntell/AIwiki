The choice of the spatial resolution is central as poverty measures defined at a coarser level may mask their heterogeneity at finer levels. We introduce a small area multi-scale approach integrating survey and remote sensing data that leverages information at different spatial resolutions and accounts for hierarchical dependencies, preserving estimates coherence. We map poverty rates by proposing a Bayesian Beta-based model equipped with a new benchmarking algorithm accounting for the double-bounded support. A simulation study shows the effectiveness of our proposal and an application on Bangladesh is discussed.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and implement a novel dimension-reduction method for high-dimensional time-varying contingency-tables: the Evolutionary Correspondence Analysis (ECA). ECA enables a comparative analysis of high-dimensional, diachronic processes by identifying a small number of shared latent variables that shape co-evolving data patterns. ECA offers new opportunities for the study of complex social phenomena, such as co-evolving public debates: Its capacity to inductively extract time-varying latent variables from observed contents of evolving debates permits an analysis of meanings shared by linked sub-discourses, such as linked national public spheres or the discourses led by distinct political camps within a shared public sphere. We illustrate the utility of our approach by studying how the Greek and German right-, centre-, and left-leaning news coverage of the European financial crisis evolved between its outbreak in 2009 until its institutional containment in 2012. Comparing the use of 525 unique concepts in six German and Greek outlets with different political leaning over an extended period of time, we identify two common factors accounting for those evolving meanings and analyse how the different sub-discourses influenced one another over time. We allow the factor loadings to be time-varying, and fit to the latent factors a time-varying vector-auto-regressive model with time-varying mean.},

Drawing upon rich administrative data and using a difference-in-differences methodology, we estimate that workers at their first work experience hired on more flexible contracts undergo a reduction in the conversion rate to permanent employment of 6.3 percentage points after the implementation of the incentives (and of 3.2 percentage points over a year), compared to peers hired on more rigid contracts. This reduced conversion rate, which results in a 17% wage penalty even 2 years into their professional journey, points to a significant negative impact of flexible temporary jobs on the future prospects of young workers.},

  abstract     = {The clustered observational study (COS) design is the observational counterpart to the clustered randomized trial. COSs are common in both education and health services research. In education, treatments may be given to all students within some schools but withheld from all students in other schools. In health studies, treatments may be applied to clusters such as hospitals or groups of patients treated by the same physician. In this paper, we study the identification of causal effects in COS designs. We focus on the prospect of differential selection of units to clusters, which occurs when the units’ cluster selections depend on the clusters’ treatment assignments. Extant work on COSs has made an implicit assumption that rules out the presence of differential selection. We derive the identification results for designs with differential selection and that contexts with differential cluster selection require different adjustment sets than standard designs. We outline estimators for designs with and without differential selection. Using a series of simulations, we outline the magnitude of the bias that can occur with differential selection. We then present 2 empirical applications focusing on the likelihood of differential selection.},

  abstract     = {This paper takes a detailed look at socio-economic variation in mortality across England. Generic metrics such as the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) can be effective at the aggregate level of national deciles, but we demonstrate that they perform much less well at the regional, urban–rural, and neighbourhood level. We use local linear regression to develop a new, customized index for neighbourhood mortality that addresses the mortality-specific shortcomings of the IMD based on socio-economic and related, non-spatial predictive variables. We find that old-age income deprivation and employment deprivation are key determinants of mortality, but also that urban–rural class and the presence of care homes in a neighbourhood have an important role to play in assessing underlying mortality rates relative to national mortality. Residual spatial/regional variation in mortality is found to be much less significant than socio-economic variation and much lower than the residual regional variation that results from the use of the IMD.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel procedure to assess the goodness of fit in relational event models. Building on existing auxiliary variable approaches developed in network modelling, the procedure involves a comparison between statistics computed on observed relational event sequences and statistics calculated on event sequences simulated from the fitted model. We argue that the internal time structure of the relational mechanisms assumed to generate the observations under the model is an important aspect of the fit of a model to observed relational event sequences. We establish the empirical value of the proposed goodness of fit approach in an analysis of data that we collected on collaborative patient-referral relations among healthcare organizations. The illustrative case study that we develop reveals distinctive features of relational event models that have been ignored or overlooked in received empirical studies.},

  abstract     = {Social and biomedical scientists have long been interested in the process through which ideas and behaviours diffuse. In this article, we study an urgent social problem, the spatial diffusion of hate crimes against refugees in Germany, which has admitted more than 1 million asylum seekers since the 2015 refugee crisis. Despite its importance, identification of causal diffusion effects, also known as peer and contagion effects, remains challenging because the commonly used assumption of no omitted confounders is often untenable due to contextual confounding and homophily bias. To address this long-standing problem, we examine causal identification using placebo outcomes under a new assumption of structural stationarity , which formalizes the underlying diffusion process with a class of nonparametric structural equation models with recursive structure. We show under structural stationarity that a lagged dependent variable is a general, valid placebo outcome for detecting a wide range of biases, including the 2 types mentioned above. We then propose a difference-in-differences style estimator that can directly correct biases under an additional causal assumption. Analysing fine-grained geo-coded hate crime data from Germany, we show when and how the proposed methods can detect and correct unmeasured confounding in spatial causal diffusion analysis.},

  abstract     = {Ecological inference methods are devised to estimate unknown inner-cells of 2-way contingency tables by inferring conditional distribution probabilities. This outlines one of the more long-standing social science problems, chiefly frequent in political science and sociology. To solve the problem, ecological inference algorithms consider an asymmetric relationship, with a main characteristic (e.g. race or social class) mapped to rows impacting on a dependent variable, usually the vote, mapped to columns. The problem arises because different solutions are reached depending on how variables are assigned to rows and columns. The models are asymmetric. In this paper, we propose 2 new sets of ecological inference algorithms and explore if accuracy could be improved by handling the problem in a symmetric way. We assess the accuracy of the proposed methods using real data from more than 550 concurrent elections where the true district-level cross-classifications of votes (straight- and split-tickets) are known. Our empirical assessment clearly identifies the symmetric solutions as more accurate. They outperform asymmetric methods 90% of the time and reduce error, on average, by 11%. Our results are based on data from simultaneous elections, so further research is required to see whether our conclusions can be maintained in other ecological inference contexts. Interested readers can easily use the proposed methods as they are implemented in the R package lphom.},

  abstract     = {Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) allow researchers to estimate causal effects in an experimental sample with minimal identifying assumptions. However, to generalize or transport a causal effect from an RCT to a target population, researchers must adjust for a set of treatment effect moderators. In practice, it is impossible to know whether the set of moderators has been properly accounted for. I propose a two parameter sensitivity analysis for generalizing or transporting experimental results using weighted estimators. The contributions in the article are threefold. First, I show that the sensitivity parameters are scale-invariant and standardized, and introduce an estimation approach for researchers to account for both bias in their estimates from omitting a moderator, as well as potential changes to their inference. Second, I propose several tools researchers can use to perform sensitivity analysis: (1) numerical measures to summarize the uncertainty in an estimated effect to omitted moderators; (2) graphical summary tools to visualize the sensitivity in estimated effects; and (3) a formal benchmarking approach for researchers to estimate potential sensitivity parameter values using existing data. Finally, I demonstrate that the proposed framework can be easily extended to the class of doubly robust, augmented weighted estimators.},

  abstract     = {The Extended Crosswise design is a randomized response design characterized by a sensitive and an innocuous question and two sub-samples with complementary randomization probabilities of the innocuous question. The response categories are ‘One’ with two different answers and ‘Two’ with two answers that are the same. Due to the complementary randomization probabilities, ‘One’ is the incriminating response in one sub-sample, and ‘Two’ in the other. The use of two sub-samples generates a degree of freedom to test for response biases with a goodness-of-fit test, but this test is unable to detect bias resulting from self-protective respondents giving the non-incriminating response when the incriminating response was required. This raises the question what a significant goodness-of-fit test measures? In this paper, we hypothesize that respondents are largely unaware which response is associated with the sensitive characteristic, and intuitively perceive ‘One’ as the safer response. We present empirical evidence for one-saying in six surveys among a total of 4 , 242 elite athletes, and present estimates of doping use corrected for it. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses are conducted to test the hypothesis that respondents who complete the survey in a short time are more likely to answer randomly, and therefore are less likely to be one-sayers.},

  abstract     = {Recently, attention was drawn to the failure of two very large internet-based probability surveys to correctly estimate COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the U.S. in early 2021. Both the Delphi-Facebook COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) and Census Household Pulse Survey (HPS) overestimated uptake substantially, by 17 and 14 percentage points in May 2021, respectively. These surveys had large numbers of respondents but very low response rates (&lt;10%), thus, nonignorable nonresponse could have had substantial impact. Specifically, it is plausible that ‘anti-vaccine’ individuals were less likely to participate given the topic (impact of the pandemic on daily life). In this article, we use proxy pattern-mixture models (PPMMs) to estimate the proportion of adults (18 + ⁠ ) who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, using data from the CTIS and HPS, under a nonignorable nonresponse assumption. Data from the American Community Survey provide the necessary population data for the PPMMs. We compare these estimates to the true benchmark uptake numbers and show that the PPMM could have detected the direction of the bias and provide meaningful bias bounds. We also use the PPMM to estimate vaccine hesitancy, a measure for which we do not have a benchmark truth, and compare to the direct survey estimates.},

  abstract     = {In low- and middle-income countries, household surveys are the most reliable data source to examine health and demographic indicators at the subnational level, an exercise in small area estimation. Model-based unit-level models are favoured for producing the subnational estimates at fine scale, such as the admin-2 level. Typically, the surveys employ stratified 2-stage cluster sampling with strata consisting of an urban/rural designation crossed with administrative regions. To avoid bias and increase predictive precision, the stratification should be acknowledged in the analysis. To move from the cluster to the area requires an aggregation step in which the prevalence surface is averaged with respect to population density. This requires estimating a partition of the study area into its urban and rural components, and to do this we experiment with a variety of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, Bayesian additive regression trees, and gradient boosted trees. Pixel-level covariate surfaces are used to improve prediction. We estimate spatial HIV prevalence in women of age 15–49 in Malawi using the stratification/aggregation method we propose.},

However, adherence to strict treatment protocols can be challenging for individuals in practice and, when non-adherence is expected, estimates of the effect of sustained use may not be useful for decision making. As an alternative, more relaxed treatment protocols which allow for periods of time off treatment (i.e. grace periods) have been considered in pragmatic randomized trials and observational studies. In this article, we consider the interpretation, identification, and estimation of treatment strategies which include grace periods. We contrast natural grace period strategies which allow individuals the flexibility to take treatment as they would naturally do, with stochastic grace period strategies in which the investigator specifies the distribution of treatment utilization. We estimate the effect of initiation of a thiazide diuretic or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in hypertensive individuals under various strategies which include grace periods.},

Of particular importance are treatment spillover or outcome interference effects. We consider causal inference when the actors are connected via an underlying network structure. Our key contribution is a model for causality when the underlying network is endogenous; where the ties between actors and the actor covariates are statistically dependent. We develop a joint model for the relational and covariate generating process that avoids restrictive separability and fixed network assumptions, as these rarely hold in realistic social settings. While our framework can be used with general models, we develop the highly expressive class of Exponential-family Random Network models (ERNM) of which Markov random fields and Exponential-family Random Graph models are special cases. We present potential outcome-based inference within a Bayesian framework and propose a modification to the exchange algorithm to allow for sampling from ERNM posteriors. We present results of a simulation study demonstrating the validity of the approach. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the framework in a case study of smoking in the context of adolescent friendship networks.},

This problem has three analytical challenges: (a) academic performance is measured by cognitive items under a matrix sampling design; (b) there are many missing values in the non-cognitive variables; and (c) multiple comparisons due to a large number of non-cognitive variables. We consider an application to the Programme for International Student Assessment, aiming to identify non-cognitive variables associated with students’ performance in science.

Development of new diagnostic tests was necessary, but under such enormous pressure risking inadequate evaluation. Against a background of concern about standards applied to the evaluation of in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs), clear statistical thinking was needed on the principles of diagnostic testing in general, and their application in a pandemic. Therefore, in July 2020, the Royal Statistical Society convened a Working Group of six biostatisticians to review the statistical evidence needed to ensure the performance of new tests, especially IVDs for infectious diseases—for regulators, decision-makers, and the public. The Working Group’s review was undertaken when the Covid-19 pandemic shone an unforgiving light on current processes for evaluating and regulating IVDs for infectious diseases. The report’s findings apply more broadly than to the pandemic and IVDs, to diagnostic test evaluations in general. A section of the report focussed on lessons learned during the pandemic and aimed to contribute to the UK Covid-19 Inquiry’s examination of the response to, and impact of, the Covid-19 pandemic to learn lessons for the future. The review made 22 recommendations on what matters for study design, transparency, and regulation.},

Focusing here on regression models for a binary outcome conditional on a binary treatment and other covariates, we motivate the need for regression by composition. We do this first by exhibiting—using L’Abbé plots—the families of relationships between untreated and treated conditional outcome risks that emerge from generalized linear models for many different link functions. These are compared with the relationships (between untreated and treated risks) that arise from mechanistic sufficient component cause models, which are first principles causal models for binary outcomes. By considering mechanistic models that allow for non-monotone causal effects and by allowing sufficient causes to be associated, we expand upon similar discussions in the recent literature. We discuss conditions under which commonly used statistical models for binary data, such as logistic regression, arise from mechanistic models where the sufficient causes are associated in a particular way, as well as other situations in which the statistical models arising do not correspond to a generalized linear model but can be naturally expressed as a regression by composition model.},

Of these multiple sources of biases, in this paper, we focus on understanding selection bias. We present an analytic framework using directed acyclic graphs for guiding applied researchers to dissect how different sources of selection bias may affect estimates of the association between a binary outcome and an exposure (continuous or categorical) of interest. We consider four easy-to-implement weighting approaches to reduce selection bias with accompanying variance formulae. We demonstrate through a simulation study when they can rescue us in practice with analysis of real-world data. We compare these methods using a data example where our goal is to estimate the well-known association of cancer and biological sex, using EHR from a longitudinal biorepository at the University of Michigan Healthcare system. We provide annotated R codes to implement these weighted methods with associated inference.},

  abstract     = {Studies considering competing risks will often aim to estimate the cumulative incidence functions conditional on an individual’s baseline characteristics. While the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard model is tailor-made for analysing only one of the competing events, it may still be used in settings where multiple competing events are of scientific interest, where it is specified for each cause in turn. In this work, we provide an overview of data-generating mechanisms where proportional subdistribution hazards hold for at least one cause. We use these to motivate why the use of multiple Fine–Gray models should be avoided in favour of better alternatives such as cause-specific hazard models.},

  abstract     = {Partial likelihood, introduced in Cox (1975, Partial likelihood. Biometrika , 62 (2),269–276), formalizes the construction of the inference function developed in Cox (1972, Regression models and life-tables (with discussion). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B , 34 (2),187–220) and referred there to as a conditional likelihood. Partial likelihood can also be viewed as a version of composite likelihood, a different example of which was studied in Cox, and Reid (2004, A note on pseudolikelihood constructed from marginal densities. Biometrika, 91(3),729–737). In this note, I describe the links between partial and composite likelihood, and the connections to profile, marginal, and conditional likelihood. Somewhat tangentially, two recent applications of the Cox proportional hazards model from the medical literature are briefly discussed, as they highlight the model’s ongoing relevance while also raising some more general questions about inference.},

  abstract     = {Interest in regional economic issues coupled with advances in administrative data is driving the creation of new regional economic data. Many of these data series could be useful for nowcasting regional economic activity, but they suffer from a short (albeit constantly expanding) time series which makes incorporating them into nowcasting models problematic. Regional nowcasting is already challenging because the release delay on regional data tends to be greater than that at the national level, and ‘short’ data imply a ‘ragged edge’ at both the beginning and the end of regional data sets, which adds a further complication. In this paper, via an application to the UK, we investigate various ways of including a wide range of short data into a regional mixed-frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) model. These short data include hitherto unexploited regional value-added tax turnover data. We address the problem of the two ragged edges by estimating regional factors using different missing data algorithms that we then incorporate into our MF-VAR model. We find that nowcasts of regional output growth are generally improved when we condition them on the factors, but only when the regional nowcasts are produced before the national (UK-wide) output growth data are published.},

The framework takes into account the cost of decision errors in the payoff function, allowing the decision maker to compute the cost of taking a decision when evidence is far from the optimal decision triggers. We show, using a real-world cost-effectiveness study based on clinical trial evidence, how rules derived from a sequential adaptive design approach can lead to quicker decisions when compared to the value of information decision framework.

However, their use is limited since they indirectly reflect migration, capturing migrant transitions over long intervals rather than migration events, whilst also underestimating the number of infants and deaths. Censuses also neglect migration of those who are native-born when they only include questions on country of birth, and have sparse temporal availability. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to overcome these limitations and produce a set of robust annual migration flow estimates for South American countries. Our model translates five-year transition data from censuses into annual series, corrects biases that arise due to differences in measurement and census data quality across countries, and is grounded in migration theory to impute missing migration data between censuses.},

Policymakers often need to rely on experts with disparate fields of expertise when making policy choices in complex, multi-faceted, dynamic environments such as those dealing with ecosystem services. The pressures affecting the survival and pollination capabilities of honey bees ( Apis mellifera ), wild bees, and other pollinators is well documented, but incomplete. In order to estimate the potential effectiveness of various candidate policies to support pollination services, there is an urgent need to quantify the effect of various combinations of variables on the pollination ecosystem service, utilising available information, models and expert judgement. In this paper, we present a new application of the integrating decision support system methodology, using dynamic Bayesian networks, for combining inputs from multiple panels of experts to evaluate policies to support an abundant pollinator population.},

The paper compares two modern ways to estimate groupwise treatment effects, a non-parametric approach and a semi-parametric approach, with the goal of better informing practice. Specifically, we compare (a) the underlying assumptions, (b) efficiency and adaption to the underlying data generating models, and (c) a way to combine the two approaches. We also discuss how to test a key assumption concerning the semi-parametric estimator and to obtain cluster-robust standard errors if study units in the same subgroups are correlated. We demonstrate our findings by conducting simulation studies and reanalysing the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study.},

However, risks are often estimated from non-representative epidemiologic studies, which usually under-represent minorities. Model-based methods use population registries to improve external validity of risk estimation but assume hazard ratios are generalisable from samples to the target finite population. ‘Pseudoweighting’ methods improve representativeness of studies by using an external probability-based survey as the reference, but the resulting estimators can be biased due to propensity model misspecification and inefficient due to highly variable pseudoweights or small sample sizes of minorities in the cohort and/or survey. We propose a two-step pseudoweighting procedure that post-stratifies the event rates among age/race/sex strata in the pseudoweighted cohort to the population rates, to produce efficient and robust pure risk estimation (i.e. a cause-specific absolute risk in the absence of competing events). For developing an all-cause mortality risk model representative for the USA, our findings suggest that hazard ratios for minorities are not generalisable, and that surveys can have inadequate numbers of events for minorities. Post-stratification on event rates is crucial for obtaining reliable risk estimation for minority subgroups.},

To overcome the problem caused by the imbalances between the need for care and the limited resources, we shall improve our understanding of the local HIV epidemics, especially for key populations at high risk of HIV infection. However, HIV prevalence rates for key populations have been difficult to estimate because their HIV surveillance data are very scarce. This paper develops a multivariate spatial model for predicting unknown HIV prevalence rates among key populations. The proposed multivariate conditional auto-regressive model efficiently pools information from neighbouring locations and correlated populations. As the real data analysis illustrates, it provides more accurate predictions than independently fitting the sub-epidemic for each key population. Furthermore, we investigate how different pieces of surveillance data contribute to the prediction and offer practical suggestions for epidemic data collection.},

Exchanges are considered from both a child and parent perspective. In the latter case, we propose a novel approach to account for the correlation between mother and father reports and develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm suitable for large datasets with multiple outcomes.},

Our contribution is twofold: first, our indicator is based on a non-additive aggregation operator (the Choquet Integral), which allows us to model many preferences’ structures and to overcome the limitations embedded in other approaches. Second, we elicit the parameters of the aggregation operator from an expert panel of Italian policymakers in Social Policy, and Economics scholars. Our results highlight that Mediterranean countries exhibit lower Inclusion levels than Northern/Central countries, and that this disparity has grown in the last decade. Our results complement and partially challenge existing evidence from data-driven aggregation methods.},

  abstract     = {As a measure of gender inequality, the gender wage gap has come to play an important role both in academic research and the public debate. In 2016, the majority of full-time employed women in the United States earned significantly less than comparable men. The extent to which women were affected by gender inequality in earnings, however, depended greatly on socio-economic characteristics, such as marital status or educational attainment. In this paper, we analyse data from the 2016 American Community Survey using a high-dimensional wage regression and applying double lasso to quantify heterogeneity in the gender wage gap. We find that the wage gap varied substantially across women and that the magnitude of the gap varied primarily by marital status, having children at home, race, occupation, industry, and educational attainment. These insights are helpful in designing policies that can reduce discrimination and unequal pay more effectively.},

  abstract     = {We propose a flexible link forecast methodology for weighted temporal networks. Our probabilistic model estimates the evolving link dynamics among a set of nodes through Wasserstein barycentric coordinates arising within the optimal transport theory. Optimal transport theory is employed to interpolate among network evolution sequences and to compute the probability distribution of forthcoming links. Besides generating point link forecasts for weighted networks, the methodology provides the probability that a link attains weights in a certain interval, namely a quantile of the weights distribution. We test our approach to forecast the link dynamics of the worldwide Foreign Direct Investments network and of the World Trade Network, comparing the performance of the proposed methodology against several alternative models. The performance is evaluated by applying non-parametric diagnostics derived from binary classifications and error measures for regression models. We find that the optimal transport framework outperforms all the competing models when considering quantile forecast. On the other hand, for point forecast, our methodology produces accurate results that are comparable with the best performing alternative model. Results also highlight the role played by model constraints in the determination of future links emphasising that weights are better predicted when accounting for geographical rather than economic distance.},

For inferential purposes, we develop a bootstrap method for the case where weak correlation presents in both dimensions of the error terms. We examine the finite-sample properties of the proposed model and estimation method through extensive simulated studies. Finally, we use the newly proposed model and method to investigate monthly rainfall, temperature, and sunshine data of the UK, respectively. Overall, we find spring and winter have changed significantly over the past 50 years. Changes vary with respect to locations for the other seasons.},

First, the time series of prices recorded for each hotel encompasses a twofold time frame. For every single asking price for an overnight stay on a specific day, there is a corresponding time series of asking prices along the booking window on the online platforms. Second, the competition relations between different hoteliers is clearly unknown and needs to be discovered using a suitable methodology. We address these problems by proposing a novel Network Autoregressive model which is able to handle the peculiar threefold data structure of the data set with time-varying coefficients over the booking window. This approach allows us to uncover the competition network of the market players by employing a quick data-driven algorithm. Independent, mixed, and leader–follower relationships are detected, revealing the competitive dynamics of the destination, useful to managers and stakeholders.},

A novel trivariate Bernoulli model is considered to incorporate these features, and the Bayesian estimation of the model parameters is suggested using data augmentation. Simulation results show robustness under model misspecification and the superiority of the performance of the proposed method over existing competitors. The method is applied to analyse real case studies on epidemiological surveillance. The results provide interesting insight on the heterogeneity and dependence involved in the capture–recapture mechanism. The methodology proposed can assist in effective decision-making and policy formulation.},

  abstract     = {Economic inequalities referring to specific regions are crucial in deepening spatial heterogeneity. Income surveys are generally planned to produce reliable estimates at countries or macroregion levels, thus we implement a small area model for a set of inequality measures (Gini, Relative Theil, and Atkinson indexes) to obtain reliable microregion estimates. Considering that inequality estimators are unit-interval defined with skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model at the area level involving a Beta mixture. An application on EU-SILC data is carried out and a design-based simulation is performed. Our model outperforms in terms of bias, coverage, and error the standard Beta regression model. Moreover, we extend the analysis of inequality estimators by deriving their approximate variance functions.},

The residual maximum likelihood is employed for estimating the parameters of the proposed model. Analytical and bootstrap approaches for estimating the mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed predictor are also developed. The performance of the proposed predictor and the MSE estimators are evaluated through various simulation studies. The results evidently show that the proposed predictor outperforms the existing predictors. An application of the proposed methodology has also been made using the 2011–12 Consumer Expenditure Survey data of India.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a methodology to detect structural breaks in multivariate time series data using the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) technique and non-parametric spectral density estimates. By applying the proposed algorithm to the exchange rates of Indian rupee against four primary currencies, we establish that the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has indeed caused a structural break in the volatility dynamics. Next, to study the effect of the pandemic on the Indian currency market, we provide a compact and efficient way of combining three models, each with a specific objective, to explain and forecast the exchange rate volatility. We find that a forward-looking regime change makes a drop in persistence, while an exogenous shock like COVID-19 makes the market highly persistent. Our analysis shows that although all exchange rates are found to be exposed to common structural breaks, the degrees of impact vary across the four series. Finally, we develop an ensemble approach to combine predictions from multiple models in the context of volatility forecasting. Using model confidence set procedure, we show that the proposed approach improves the accuracy from benchmark models. Relevant economic explanations to our findings are provided as well.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel system of annual Population Estimates Compiled from Administrative Data Only (PECADO) for Ireland in the absence of a Central Population Register. The system is entirely based on data originated from administrative sources, so that population estimates can be produced even without purposely designed coverage surveys or a periodic census to recalibrate estimates. It requires several extensions to the traditional Dual System Estimation (DSE) methodology, including a restatement of the underlying assumptions, a trimmed DSE method for dealing with erroneous enumerations in the administrative register, and a test for heterogeneous capture probabilities to facilitate the choice of blocking in applications. The PECADO estimates for years 2011–2016 are compared to the Census counts in 2011 and 2016. We demonstrate how the system can be used to investigate the Census 2016 under-count in Ireland, in place of the traditional approach of deploying additional population coverage surveys.},
