  abstract     = {Gregarious mammals interact to varying degrees and in a variety of ways with neighboring groups. Since navigating this wider social environment via conventional means (social knowledge) may be challenging, we hypothesize that between-group socio-spatial dynamics have exerted strong selection on phenotypic markers of individual identity, quality, and competitive ability. Ornaments are sexually selected decorative traits with far-reaching signaling potential. Here, we examined the links between sexual dimorphism in ornamentation, home range use and encounter rates across 144 primate species in a Bayesian framework. We show that home range overlap (shared space among neighbors), an indicator of the complexity of between-group interactions (but not necessarily male-male competition), is positively associated with dimorphism in ornamentation. We find no clear effect for between-group encounter rates. We also find that inter-group interactions were less agonistic when there was greater home range overlap. Taken together, these findings indicate that ornaments play a hitherto underappreciated role in signaling to conspecifics outside the realms of their home groups. Ornaments are traits associated with sexual selection, such as colorful fur or elaborate body features, which signal important information about an individual’s genetic quality and physical strength. We propose that communicating this information via ornaments is particularly crucial in between-group interactions, where individuals encounter unfamiliar members of neighboring groups. By analyzing data from 144 primate species, we found that species with a higher degree of home range overlap (shared living spaces among neighboring groups) exhibited greater levels of dimorphism in ornamentation. Additionally, we discovered that interactions between groups were less aggressive when there was more home range overlap. These findings suggest that ornaments play a significant, previously underestimated role in communication between groups, not just within an individual’s home group.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial function depends on the effective interactions between proteins and RNA encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Evidence suggests that both genomes respond to thermal selection and promote adaptation. However, the contribution of their epistatic interactions to life history phenotypes in the wild remains elusive. We investigated the evolutionary implications of mitonuclear interactions in a real-world scenario that sees populations adapted to different environments, altering their geographical distribution while experiencing flow and admixture. We created a Drosophila melanogaster panel with replicate native populations from the ends of the Australian east-coast cline, into which we substituted the mtDNA haplotypes that were either predominant or rare at each cline-end, thus creating putatively mitonuclear matched and mismatched populations. Our results suggest that mismatching may impact phenotype, with populations harboring the rarer mtDNA haplotype suffering a trade-off between aerobic capacity and key fitness aspects such as reproduction, growth, and survival. We discuss the significance of mitonuclear interactions as modulators of life history phenotypes in the context of future adaptation and population persistence. Mitochondrial function depends on the harmonious coadaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Even trivial incompatibilities can have catastrophic consequences on energy production and individual fitness. As separate populations adapt to their local environments and differ in their sets of mitonuclear genes, remixing mitonuclear variants through admixture events might lead to unpredictable fitness outcomes. This has the potential to alter the course of populations, from driving adaptation to even causing extinction if new mitonuclear combinations are not compatible. Understanding how intergenomic interactions may limit the adaptive capacity of natural populations is an important and timely question to address. Notably, in the light of extreme climate change, which is displacing species from their natural habitats, and for insects, which are experiencing a worldwide decline in abundance. Here, we explore how mitonuclear interactions shape mitochondrial and organismal performance in natural fly populations from the Australian east coast, using mitonuclear-matched populations that are locally adapted to different environments, plus two populations where the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes were reciprocally mismatched. Our results indicate that mitonuclear disruption constrains metabolic plasticity and fitness in mismatched populations, suggesting an important role played by intergenomic interactions in adaptation and population persistence.},

  abstract     = {Differences in interspecific mating traits, such as male sexual signals and female preferences, often evolve quickly as initial barriers to gene flow between nascent lineages, and they may also strengthen such barriers during secondary contact via reinforcement. However, it is an open question whether loci contributing to intraspecific variation in sexual traits are co-opted during the formation and strengthening of mating barriers between species. To test this, we used a population genomics approach in natural populations of Australian cricket sister species that overlap in a contact zone: Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus. First, we identified loci associated with intraspecific variation in T. oceanicus mating signals: advertisement song and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. We then separately identified candidate interspecific barrier loci between the species. Genes showing elevated allelic divergence between species were enriched for neurological functions, indicating potential behavioral rewiring. Only two CHC-associated genes overlapped with these interspecific candidate barrier loci, and intraspecific CHC loci showed signatures of being under strong selective constraints between species. In contrast, 10 intraspecific song-associated genes showed high genetic differentiation between T. commodus and T. oceanicus , and 2 had signals of high genomic divergence. The overall lack of shared loci in intra vs. interspecific comparisons of mating trait and candidate barrier loci is consistent with limited co-option of the genetic architecture of interspecific mating signals during the establishment and maintenance of reproductive isolation. Divergence of sexual signals and preferences can rapidly drive strong barriers to gene flow early on in speciation. Such sexual barriers may subsequently strengthen during periods of contact between species to prevent maladaptive mating. Sexual barriers to gene flow thus have an important, multifaceted role in generating species’ diversity. However, at the genetic level, little is understood about how sexual signals and preferences that coevolve within species are related to sexual signals and preferences that contribute to differences between species. We studied an Australian cricket species pair, Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus , to identify the overlap between genes showing signatures of marked genetic divergence between the two species and genes associated with within-species variation in acoustic and chemical cues used during mate choice. We show that whilst the two species have had little contemporary gene flow, there is convincing evidence of historical, symmetric gene flow. Against a heterogenous genomic backdrop, we detect only a few candidate genes with signals of interspecific divergence that are also associated with acoustic and chemical communication. Our analyses suggest limited co-option of genes responsible for intraspecific variation in sexual signals during the evolution of sexual isolation between species.},

  abstract     = {The genetic mechanisms underlying striking axial patterning changes in wild species are still largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that Apeltes quadracus fish, commonly known as fourspine sticklebacks, have evolved multiple different axial patterns in wild populations. Here, we revisit classic locations in Nova Scotia, Canada, where both high-spined and low-spined morphs are particularly common. Using genetic crosses and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we examine the genetic architecture of wild differences in several axial patterning traits, including the number and length of prominent dorsal spines, the number of underlying median support bones (pterygiophores), and the number and ratio of abdominal and caudal vertebrae along the anterior–posterior body axis. Our studies identify a highly significant QTL on chromosome 6 that controls a substantial fraction of phenotypic variation in multiple dorsal spine and pterygiophore traits (~15%–30% variance explained). An additional smaller-effect QTL on chromosome 14 contributes to the lengths of both the last dorsal spine and anal spine (~9% variance explained). 1 or no QTL were detected for differences in the numbers of abdominal and caudal vertebrae. The major-effect patterning QTL on chromosome 6 is centered on the HOXDB gene cluster, where sequence changes in a noncoding axial regulatory enhancer have previously been associated with prominent dorsal spine differences in Apeltes . The QTL that have the largest effects on dorsal spine number and length traits map to different chromosomes in Apeltes and Gasterosteus , 2 distantly related stickleback genera. However, in both genera, the major-effect QTL for prominent skeletal changes in wild populations maps to linked clusters of powerful developmental control genes. This study, therefore, bolsters the body of evidence that regulatory changes in developmental gene clusters provide a common genetic mechanism for evolving major morphological changes in natural species. Understanding the genetic changes that contribute to evolution is an important goal in biology. Stickleback fish have become exemplary wild species for studying how organisms adapt to natural environments. Sticklebacks are named for the prominent bony spines on their backs that can serve as a defense against some soft-mouthed predators. Previous work has demonstrated that the number and length of these spines vary in Nova Scotia, Canada, depending on exposure to different fish and bird predators. Here, we use the hybrid progeny of two wild sticklebacks caught in different locations around Nova Scotia to uncover the genetic regions that influence major skeletal differences in wild species. Our results suggest that prominent skeletal changes in wild populations can arise from sequence changes that affect the expression of Hox genes, which are important for establishing the body plan during development. Clusters of these genes control various aspects of spine number and length, providing a powerful genetic system for evolving alternative skeletal features in wild species.},

  abstract     = {The Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) is a globally consistent pressure on biological species living in cities. Adaptation to the UHIE may be necessary for urban wild flora to persist in cities, but experimental evidence is scarce. Here, we report evidence of adaptive evolution in a perennial plant species in response to the UHIE. We collected seeds from common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) individuals along an urban–rural gradient in the city of Amsterdam (The Netherlands). In common-environment greenhouse experiments, we assessed the effect of elevated temperatures on plant growth and the effect of vernalization treatments on flowering phenology. We found that urban plants accumulate more biomass at higher temperatures and require shorter vernalization periods, corresponding to milder winters, to induce flowering compared to rural plants. Differentiation was also observed between different intra-urban subhabitats, with park plants displaying a higher vernalization requirement than street plants. Our results show genetic differentiation between urban and rural dandelions in temperature-dependent growth and phenology, consistent with adaptive divergence in response to the UHIE. Adaptation to the UHIE may be a potential explanation for the persistence of dandelions in urban environments. The urban heat island effect (UHIE) is a globally consistent characteristic of cities where temperatures are several degrees higher than their rural surroundings due to the absorption and retention of heat by buildings, pavements, and other artificial surfaces. This has a considerable effect on urban inhabitants, including wild flora and fauna, which may require biological adaptation for survival. Very few experiments, however, have demonstrated how plants evolve in response to the UHIE. We fill this knowledge gap here by providing evidence in urban dandelions ( Taraxacum officinale s.l.) of (1) superior growth at elevated temperatures and (2) a reduced requirement of cold periods to activate flowering, as compared to rural populations of the same species. Temperature conditions in temperate cities, due to the UHIE, reflect future global warming scenarios, providing an insight into the biological adaptation of wild flora and fauna that is required for future survival. Vegetation plays a key role in the mitigation of (urban) heat and other effects of climate change, making knowledge of plant adaptation to urbanization and global warming essential for the sustainable planning of urban environments.},

  abstract     = {How and why genetic diversity varies among species is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Life history traits have been shown to explain a large part of observed diversity. Among them, mating systems have one of the strongest impacts on genetic diversity, with selfing species usually exhibiting much lower diversity than outcrossing relatives. Theory predicts that a high rate of selfing amplifies selection at linked sites, reducing genetic diversity genome-wide, but frequent bottlenecks and rapid population turn-over could also explain low genetic diversity in selfers. However, how linked selection varies with mating systems and whether it is sufficient to explain the observed difference between selfers and outcrossers has never been tested. Here, we used the Aegilops / Triticum grass species, a group characterized by contrasted mating systems (from obligate outcrossing to high selfing) and marked recombination rate variation across the genome, to quantify the effects of mating system and linked selection on patterns of neutral and selected polymorphism. By analyzing phenotypic and transcriptomic data of 13 species, we show that selfing strongly affects genetic diversity and the efficacy of selection by amplifying the intensity of linked selection genome-wide. In particular, signatures of adaptation were only found in the highly recombining regions in outcrossing species. These results bear implications for the evolution of mating systems and, more generally, for our understanding of the fundamental drivers of genetic diversity. Aegilops/Triticum grass species are the wild relatives of cultivated wheat. A main difference among these species is their mating system. Some species need to cross-fertilize to reproduce (outcrossing); some species mostly reproduce by auto-fertilization (selfing), while others reproduce by a mixture of outcrossing and selfing (mixed mating). The mating system has a strong impact on the genetic diversity, with selfing species usually exhibiting much lower diversity than outcrossing relatives. However, the reasons for this are not fully clear. Here, we show that selfing strongly reduces the diversity across the entire genome mainly because genome-wide linkage disequilibrium amplifies the effect of selection either against deleterious mutations or in favor of beneficial ones. Only outcrossing species showed genomic signatures of recurrent adaptation, suggesting that self-fertilization may have a long-term impact on species ability to evolve and adapt.},

  abstract     = {The range of hosts a given virus can infect is widely presumed to be limited by fitness trade-offs between alternative hosts. These fitness trade-offs may arise naturally due to antagonistic pleiotropy if mutations that increase fitness in one host tend to decrease fitness in alternate hosts. Yet there is also growing recognition that positive pleiotropy may be more common than previously appreciated. With positive pleiotropy, mutations have concordant fitness effects such that a beneficial mutation can simultaneously increase fitness in different hosts, providing a genetic mechanism by which selection can overcome fitness trade-offs. How readily evolution can overcome fitness trade-offs therefore depends on the overall distribution of mutational fitness effects between hosts, including the relative frequency of antagonistic versus positive pleiotropy. We therefore conducted a systematic meta-analysis of the pleiotropic fitness effects of viral mutations reported in different hosts. Our analysis indicates that while both antagonistic and positive pleiotropy are common, fitness effects are overall positively correlated between hosts and unconditionally beneficial mutations are not uncommon. Moreover, the relative frequency of antagonistic versus positive pleiotropy may simply reflect the underlying frequency of beneficial and deleterious mutations in individual hosts. Given a mutation is beneficial in one host, the probability that it is deleterious in another host is roughly equal to the probability that any mutation is deleterious, suggesting there is no natural tendency toward antagonistic pleiotropy. The widespread prevalence of positive pleiotropy suggests that many fitness trade-offs may be readily overcome by evolution given the right selection pressures. Evolutionary theory suggests that fitness trade-offs between alternative environments constrain the potential for organisms to simultaneously adapt to multiple environments. Likewise, fitness trade-offs between alternative hosts are widely believed to limit the ability of viruses to adapt to multiple hosts and thereby expand their host range. How strongly viruses are constrained by such trade-offs will largely depend on the fitness effects of new mutations. Fitness trade-offs may inevitably constrain viral evolution if mutations that increase fitness in one host tend to decrease fitness in alternative hosts. However, mutations can sometimes increase fitness in multiple hosts, allowing viruses to adapt to new hosts without paying fitness costs. Geneticists refer to these two scenarios as antagonistic and positive pleiotropy depending on whether mutations have opposite or concordant fitness effects. Because the relative frequency of antagonistic versus positive pleiotropy is centrally important to viral evolution, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of the fitness effects of mutations reported in different hosts. Our analysis reveals that cases of positive pleiotropy where mutations have beneficial effects in more than one host may be sufficiently common for evolution to resolve many apparent fitness trade-offs between hosts.},

  abstract     = {Attractiveness is not solely determined by a single sexual trait but rather by a combination of traits. Because the response of the chooser is based on the combination of sexual traits in the courter, variation in the chooser’s responses that are attributable to the opposite-sex courter genotypes (i.e., the indirect genetic effects [IGEs] on chooser response) can reflect genetic variation in overall attractiveness. This genetic variation can be associated with the genetic basis of other traits in both the chooser and the courter. Investigating this complex genetic architecture, including IGEs, can enhance our understanding of the evolution of mate choice. In the present study on the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus , we estimated (1) genetic variation in overall attractiveness and (2) genetic correlations between overall attractiveness and other pre- and postcopulatory traits (e.g., male latency to sing, female latency to mount, male guarding intensity, male and female body mass, male mandible size, and testis size) within and between sexes. We revealed a genetic basis for attractiveness in both males and females. Furthermore, a genetic variance associated with female attractiveness was correlated with a genetic variance underlying larger male testes. Our findings imply that males that mate with attractive females can produce offspring that are successful in terms of precopulatory sexual selection (daughters who are attractive) and postcopulatory sexual selection (sons with an advantage in sperm competition), potentially leading to runaway sexual selection. Our study exemplifies how the incorporation of the IGE framework provides novel insights into the evolution of mate choice. The attractiveness of an individual is not determined by just one trait but rather by a combination of traits. When an individual chooses a mate, the decision is based on the combination of traits in the individual of the opposite sex. Thus, if the chooser’s reactions depend on the genotype of the courter, it indicates that there is genetic variation in the overall attractiveness of the courting sex. Applying this perspective in our study on field crickets, we found genetic variation in the overall attractiveness of males and females. We further explored whether overall attractiveness was genetically correlated with other traits within a sex or across sexes. We found that a genetic variance that made females more attractive was correlated with a genetic variance increasing male testes size. This suggests that when males mate with attractive females, their daughters are more likely to be chosen as mates themselves and their sons more able to monopolize egg fertilization. This could potentially lead to a positive feedback where attractiveness and the preference for attractiveness reinforce each other. Our study illustrates the utility of calculating the overall attractiveness of the courting individual and its genetic variance based on the choosers’ responses to understand the mechanisms underpinning mate choice and its evolution.},

  abstract     = {Microbial evolution is typically studied in monocultures or in communities of competing species. But microbes do not always compete and how positive inter-species interactions drive evolution is less clear: Initially facilitative communities may either evolve increased mutualism, increased reliance on certain species according to the Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH), or weaker interactions and resource specialization. To distinguish between these outcomes, we evolved four species for 44 weeks either alone or together in a toxic pollutant. These species initially facilitated each other, promoting each other’s survival and pollutant degradation. After evolution, two species ( Microbacterium liquefaciens and Ochrobactrum anthropi ) that initially relied fully on others to survive continued to do so, with no evidence for increased mutualism. Instead, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Comamonas testosteroni ( Ct ) whose ancestors interacted positively, evolved in community to interact more neutrally and grew less well than when they had evolved alone, suggesting that the community limited their adaptation. We detected several gene loss events in Ct when evolving with others, but these events did not increase its reliance on other species, contrary to expectations under the BQH. We hypothesize instead that these gene loss events are a consequence of resource specialization. Finally, co-evolved communities degraded the pollutant worse than their ancestors. Together, our results support the evolution of weakened interactions and resource specialization, similar to what has been observed in competitive communities. Evolutionary adaptation has been well studied in single species of microbes. We know less about how different microbial species affect one another as they evolve, which is key to understanding and predicting how natural microbial communities will change over time. Here we followed a community of four bacterial species as they evolved over 44 weeks. The ancestral community could grow in and degrade a toxic industrial pollutant, in which they increased each otherâs ability to survive. Based on other studies in positively interacting species pairs, we expected that they might evolve to increase their reliance on each other and become even stronger mutualists. Instead, the species reduced their reliance on others, likely specializing on available resources, which is what one typically expects of competing species. One species became better at degrading the pollutant only when evolving alone, while the community as a whole got worse at degrading it over time. Overall, the potential of species to adapt to the environment was limited by the presence of the others. Our study shows that life in a community can limit adaptation, and that positive interactions between species can evolve to weaken, similarly to what we usually see for competing species.},

  abstract     = {The paradox of the great speciators describes a contradictory biogeographic pattern exhibited by numerous avian lineages in Oceania. Specifically, these lineages display broad geographic distributions across the region, implying strong over-water dispersal capabilities; yet, they also display repeated genetic and phenotypic divergence—even between geographically proximate islands—implying poor inter-island dispersal capabilities. One group originally cited as evidence for this paradox is the dwarf kingfishers of the genus Ceyx . Here, using genomic sequencing and comprehensive geographic sampling of the monophyletic Ceyx radiation from northern Melanesia, we find repeated, deep genetic divergence and no evidence for gene flow between lineages found on geographically proximate islands, providing an exceptionally clear example of the paradox of the great speciators. A dated phylogenetic reconstruction suggests a significant burst of diversification occurred rapidly after reaching northern Melanesia, between 3.9 and 2.9 MYA. This pattern supports a shift in net diversification rate, concordant with the expectations of the “colonization cycle” hypothesis, which implies a historical shift in dispersiveness among great speciator lineages during the evolutionary past. Here, we present a formalized framework that explains how repeated founder effects and shifting selection pressures on highly dispersive genotypes are the only ultimate causes needed to generate the paradox of the great speciators. Within this framework, we emphasize that lineage-specific traits and island-specific abiotic factors will result in varying levels of selection pressure against dispersiveness, caused by varying proximate eco-evolutionary mechanisms. Overall, we highlight how understanding patterns of diversification in the Ceyx dwarf kingfishers helped us generate a cohesive framework that provides a rigorous mechanistic explanation for patterns concordant with the paradox of the great speciators and the repeated emergence of geographic radiations in island archipelagoes across the globe. Understanding how and why global biodiversity has evolved is a key goal of evolutionary biology. Today, thanks to exciting advances in DNA sequencing technology, we can sequence thousands of pieces of DNA in a rapid and cost-effective manner. This sequencing revolution allows us to efficiently compare the genomes of organisms across space and time. We can now reconstruct the evolutionary history of entire radiations of organisms from which we can learn more about how evolution has shaped the patterns of biodiversity that we see today. Here, we sequenced DNA from dwarf kingfishers of the genus Ceyx , small colorful birds that are found from tropical Southeast Asia to the islands of the Pacific Ocean. We sequenced over 100 individual birds from “northern Melanesia,” which includes Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Island archipelago off the northeastern coast of Australia. We were able to identify approximately 20,000 single-base pairs of DNA throughout the genome that varied among these 100 individuals. This variation in DNA allowed us to infer how these birds were related to one another, both within and between island populations. We found that all of the species we sequenced were distantly related genetically and diversified rapidly after a common ancestor first colonized the region, roughly 4 million years ago. Based on this evidence, we can reject the notion that these birds achieved their broad distribution by gradually colonizing one island after another and instead support a rapid period of repeated island colonization deep in the evolutionary past, followed by a sharp reduction in the frequency of colonizing new islands. Other researchers have typically explained this type of pattern by suggesting that there was a historical change in the birds’ willingness or ability to fly across oceans sometime in the past. We agree with that interpretation and propose a detailed framework that explains the exact evolutionary forces that could create this pattern. Although we think this framework is broadly applicable across many different organisms and island chains throughout the world, we highlight that the specific properties of each type of organism, like the flight ability of birds, will strongly influence how different evolutionary forces act. In sum, our results indicate that the evolution of new biodiversity is often not a continuous linear process and help us construct a new framework for understanding exactly how evolution shapes the diverse groups of organisms found in island archipelagoes across the world.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive introgression plays a vital role in allowing recipient species to adapt and colonize new environments. However, our understanding of such environment-dependent introgressions is primarily limited to specific plant taxa in particular settings. In Japan, two related orchid species, the autonomously self-pollinating Pogonia minor and the outcrossing Pogonia japonica , typically inhabit dry grasslands and wetlands, respectively. Intriguingly, an island ecotype of P. japonica exists in arid, wind-swept, open sites on volcanic mountain slopes on Kozu Island, in the oceanic Izu Islands. To investigate potential introgression and its implications between P. japonica and P. minor on Kozu Island, we applied a comprehensive approach that included examining morphological traits, genome-wide SNP data, and plastid DNA sequences. We also examined the breeding systems of these species on Kozu Island through artificial pollination experiments to determine if introgression from P. minor has endowed the P. japonica ecotype with selfing capabilities. Extensive sampling on Kozu Island revealed that all P. japonica specimens exhibit signs of introgression from P. minor , suggesting the absence of pure P. japonica populations on the island. Furthermore, the chloroplast haplotypes of the insular P. japonica ecotype consistently match those of P. minor , indicating a predominantly asymmetrical initial hybridization with P. minor acting mainly as the maternal parent in the formation of F1 hybrids. Despite the advantages of self-fertilization in isolated environments, the insular P. japonica does not exhibit autogamy. Consequently, the scarcity of moist habitats, rather than selection pressure for selfing, likely contributes to the observed widespread introgression. Our study strongly suggests that the arid-environment-adapted P. minor has introgressed into the insular ecotype of P. japonica , enabling its successful colonization of arid volcanic mountain slopes of the oceanic island. The capacity of species to adapt to unfamiliar environments is a key driver of ecological diversification. Introgression is one mechanism that enables species to adapt and colonize new environments. In Japan, two related orchid species, the outcrossing Pogonia japonica and the self-pollinating Pogonia minor , typically grow in wetlands and dry grasslands, respectively. Interestingly, an ecotype of P. japonica thrives in the dry, wind-swept, open sites on Kozu Island in the Izu Islands, suggesting potential genetic mixing with P. minor . To explore whether P. japonica and P. minor have hybridized on Kozu Island, we extensively examined the genetic traits of Pogonia individuals on the island. We also investigated their breeding systems through experiments to determine if P. minor has conferred the ability to self-pollinate on P. japoni ca . Our detailed study on Kozu Island revealed that all P. japonica plants show signs of mixing with P. minor , indicating the absence of pure P. japonica plants there. Despite the potential benefits of self-pollination in isolated settings, the island P. japonica does not self-pollinate. Thus, the adaptation to dry habitats, rather than a need for self-pollination, appears to be the primary reason for the extensive genetic mixing observed. Our results strongly suggest that genetic material from P. minor has given the island population of P. japonica the capacity to succeed on wind-swept, open sites on volcanic mountain slopes.},

  abstract     = {Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Population genetic models have shown that the pattern of environmental variation in space can strongly influence the evolution of local adaptation. In particular, when environmental variation is highly autocorrelated in space local adaptation will more readily evolve. However, there have been few attempts to test this prediction empirically or characterize the consequences it would have for the genetic architecture underlying local adaptation. In this study, I analyze a large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine and find suggestive evidence that spatial autocorrelation in environmental variation is related to the strength of local adaptation that has evolved in that species. Motivated by those results, I use simulations to model local adaptation to different spatial patterns of environmental variation. The simulations confirm that local adaptation is expected to increase with the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described. I find that the spatial pattern of environmental variation influences the genetic architectures underlying local adaptation. In highly autocorrelated environments, the genetic architecture of local adaptation tends to be composed of high-frequency alleles with small phenotypic effects. In weakly autocorrelated environments, locally adaptive alleles may have larger phenotypic effects but are present at lower frequencies across species’ ranges and experience more evolutionary turnover. Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution of local adaptation and how spatial autocorrelation should be considered when formulating hypotheses in ecological and genetic studies. Many species exhibit local adaptation to environmental variation across their ranges. Theoretical population genetics predicts that the evolution of local adaptation and patterns of genetic variation underlying it will be influenced by the spatial pattern of variation across a species’ range. However, this prediction has not been thoroughly explored for cases of complex heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, I analyze empirical and simulation-based analyses to characterize the effects that the spatial pattern of environmental variation can have on the evolution of local adaptation. From these analyses, I show that the pattern of environmental variation influences the average level of local adaptation, variation in local adaptation as well as the genetics underlying this important phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {Domestication process effects are manifold, affecting genotype and phenotype, and assumed to be universal in animals by part of the scientific community. While mammals and birds have been thoroughly investigated, from taming to intensive selective breeding, fish domestication remains comparatively unstudied. The most widely bred and traded ornamental fish species worldwide, the goldfish, underwent the effect of long-term artificial selection on differing skeletal and soft tissue modules through ornamental domestication. Here, we provide a global morphological analysis in this emblematic ornamental domesticated fish. We demonstrate that goldfish exhibit unique morphological innovations in whole-body, cranial, and sensory (Weberian ossicles and brain) anatomy compared to their evolutionary clade, highlighting a remarkable morphological disparity within a single species comparable to that of a macroevolutionary radiation. In goldfish, as in the case of dogs and pigeons in their respective evolutionary contexts, the most ornamented varieties are extremes in the occupied morphological space, emphasizing the power of artificial selection for nonadaptive traits. Using 21st century tools on a dataset comprising the 16 main goldfish breeds, 23 wild close relatives, and 39 cypriniform species, we show that Charles Darwin’s expressed wonder at the goldfish is justified. There is a commonality of overall pattern in the morphological differentiation of domesticated forms selected for ornamental purposes, but the singularity of goldfish occupation and extension within (phylo)morphospaces, speaks against a universality in the domestication process. Our study reveals how different goldfish are from their wild counterparts, with an exceptional morphological diversity among breeds. Divergence and innovations are found in their overall external morphology, skull, hearing structures, and brain, in some cases accompanied by physiological impairments. As with pigeons and dogs, artificial selection for ornamental purposes in goldfish has favored the acquisition of unique morphologies nonviable in natural environments. However, the way in which goldfish diverge from their wild counterparts is unique, highlighting also a lack of universality in the domestication process.},

  abstract     = {When two or more individuals cooperate to provision a shared brood, each carer may be able to maximize their payoffs by coordinating provisioning in relation to what others are doing. This investment “game” is not simply a matter of how much to invest but also of the relative timing of investment. Recent studies propose that temporal coordination of care in the forms of alternation (i.e., turn-taking) and synchrony (i.e., provisioning together) function to mitigate conflict between carers and reduce brood predation risk, respectively. Such coordination is widespread in biparental and cooperatively breeding birds, yet the fitness consequences have rarely been empirically tested. Here, we use a long-term study of long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus , a facultative cooperatively breeding bird with active coordination of care, to assess the support for these hypothesized functions for coordination of provisioning visits. First, we found evidence that turn-taking mitigates conflict between carers because, in cooperative groups, provisioning rates and offspring recruitment increased with the level of active alternation exhibited by carers and with the associated increase in provisioning rate parity between carers. In contrast, offspring recruitment did not increase with alternation in biparental nests, although it was positively correlated with parity of provisioning between carers, which is predicted to result from conflict mitigation. Second, synchronous nest visits were associated with a reduced probability of nest predation and thus increased brood survival, especially when provisioning rates were high. We attribute this effect to synchrony reducing carer activity near the nest. We conclude that temporal coordination of provisioning visits in the forms of alternation and synchrony both confer fitness benefits on carers and despite being intrinsically linked, these different kinds of coordination appear to serve different functions. Natural selection dictates that individuals should seek to maximize their genetic contribution to future generations. To achieve this goal, many animals provide parental care, which increases the survival and fitness of their offspring. However, providing care is costly so when multiple individuals care for the same young, as is commonplace in birds, each individual should prefer to contribute less and for other carers to invest more. Offspring will receive suboptimal care if carers cannot resolve this conflict. Taking turns to provision a brood (alternation) is hypothesized to mitigate this conflict, allowing each carer to contribute similar amounts so that the optimal level of care for offspring is achieved. Similarly, carers may also optimize their care by provisioning at the same time (synchrony), which is hypothesized to reduce the period of activity near nests and, hence, decrease the risk of advertising the location of a nest to predators. Both forms of carer coordination are widely reported, but their functions have received little attention. Here, we tested these hypotheses by investigating the relationships between coordination and offspring fitness in long-tailed tits, finding that alternation was associated with increased provisioning and offspring recruitment, while greater synchrony of visits corresponded with increased brood survival.},

Sexual selection and sex differences in reproduction have immense variation in nature, and Charles Darwin proposed this variation is driven by numerous factors that include the number of adult males and females in the population (termed adult sex ratio). Recent papers on sexual selection, sex roles and sex ratios confirm Darwin’s proposition and suggest that sex differences may emerge in a variety of ways in nature. Here we clarify the rationale of our previous study (Mokos et al. 2021), and stand by our argument that to understand the rich variety of sexual behavior we need to incorporate ecological, demographic and life history processes into theoretical and empirical investigations.},

  abstract     = {The Darwin–Bateman paradigm advanced as the central concept to explain the evolutionary origin of sex differences. However, debates regarding its theoretical underpinnings persist, particularly with respect to the role of anisogamy in sexual selection. The theoretical work presented by Lehtonen and Parker suggests that the initial split in gamete production rate drives sex differences in sexual selection but that any further variation in the degree of anisogamy is not expected to alter the strength of sexual selection in males and females. Here, I discuss the historical background of a recently emerged controversy and present empirical data that corroborate the theoretical predictions. Lehtonen and Parker’s contribution refines our understanding of the Darwin–Bateman paradigm by providing a broad theory for large-scale patterns of sex differences that can be observed in nature. Further understanding of how demographic and environmental factors influence sexual selection is essential to predict the vast diversity of sex differences across the tree of life, beyond the primordial impact of anisogamy. The Darwin-Bateman paradigm is a key concept in evolutionary biology, explaining why males and females of many species exhibit different sexual behaviors and morphological traits. It posits that these sex differences ultimately arise from anisogamy (the difference in size between male and female gametes). Until recently, this concept was based primarily on verbal arguments made by the early pioneers of sexual selection theory, with explicit theoretical modeling largely lacking. This gap complicated the interpretation of diverse empirical studies testing the concept across the animal tree of life. In this contribution, I provide a brief history of the Darwin-Bateman paradigm and reflect on how recent theoretical and empirical work align to predict the impact of anisogamy on the evolution of sex differences. Specifically, the evolution of anisogamy from isogamy led to an initial split in sex roles, making males more likely to compete for access to females and their gametes. This prediction aligns with observations that sexual selection is often (though not always) stronger in males. However, once anisogamy has evolved, any further divergence in gamete size between sexes is not expected to lead to additional differentiation in sexual selection between males and females.},

  abstract     = {Darwin and Bateman suggested that precopulatory sexual selection is more intense on males than females, and that this difference is due to anisogamy (i.e., dimorphism in gamete size and number). While a recent paper apparently presents empirical support for this hypothesis, another appears at first sight to present evidence against it. We argue that this is partly due to lack of transparent theoretical predictions, and discuss and analyze sexual selection theory in relation to anisogamy evolution. On one hand, we find that there exists relatively little theory that can directly address all the tested predictions; on the other, the picture painted by current theory indicates that both sets of empirical results broadly match predictions about the causal link between anisogamy and sexual selection, thus reconciling the two apparently opposing claims. We also discuss in a very broad, general sense how anisogamy is expected to affect sexual selection. One hundred and fifty years ago Darwin proposed that sexual selection, with rather rare exceptions, is more intense on males than females, typically causing males to be the sex that competes more intensely for matings. Defining males and females by anisogamy, that is, sperm and ova, an influential paper has shown Darwin’s prediction to be true. However, a more recent paper on the same theme has shown that the degree of anisogamy fails to correlate with the intensity of sexual selection, casting doubt that anisogamy is responsible for the prevalence of male competitiveness for matings. Although at first sight this result seems to contradict long-standing theory, by analyzing existing theory we argue that in fact both findings are entirely compatible with theoretical expectations: while anisogamy is predicted to establish a general binary trend toward higher sexual selection intensity on males, the degree of anisogamy (across the typical range, where sperm vastly outnumber ova) is not predicted to be correlated with sexual selection intensity. Rather, though anisogamy should set a binary trend as Darwin predicted, the degree of anisogamy and variation in the intensity of sexual selection will be established by ecological, social, and other factors relevant to each taxon.},

We measure the ability of P. aeruginosa spontaneous antibiotic-resistant mutants to invade pre-established cultures of commensal respiratory microbes in an assay that allows us to link specific resistance mutations with changes in invasion ability. While commensal respiratory microbes tend to provide some degree of resistance to P. aeruginosa invasion, antibiotic resistance is a double-edged sword that can either help or hinder the ability of P. aeruginosa to invade. The directionality of this help or hindrance depends on both P. aeruginosa genotype and respiratory microbe identity. Specific resistance mutations in genes involved in multidrug efflux pump regulation are shown to facilitate the invasion of P. aeruginosa into Staphylococcus lugdunensis , yet impair invasion into Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Streptococcus species provide the strongest resistance to P. aeruginosa invasion, and this is maintained regardless of antibiotic resistance genotype. Our study demonstrates how the cost of mutations that provide enhanced antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa can crucially depend on community context. We suggest that attempts to manipulate the microbiome should focus on promoting the growth of commensals that can increase the fitness costs associated with antibiotic resistance and provide robust inhibition of both wildtype and antibiotic-resistant pathogen strains. When bacterial pathogens become resistant to antibiotics, one clear outcome is that infections caused by these pathogens will be harder to treat with antibiotics. But is this the only consequence of antibiotic resistance? Here we asked how antibiotic resistance impacts the ability of a bacterial pathogen to interact with and invade communities of other bacteria present in the body (i.e., the microbiome). This question is important for understanding the potential of antibiotic-resistant pathogen strains to transmit between patients, and understanding when and how the microbiome may shape the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogen populations. In this work, we carried out an experiment that allowed us to link specific antibiotic resistance mutations to changes in the ability of a bacterial pathogen to invade populations of different bacteria from the respiratory microbiome. We found that certain antibiotic resistance mutations could increase or decrease the ability of a bacterial pathogen to invade bacteria from the respiratory microbiome. The directionality of this depended on both the specific resistance mutations and the type of bacteria from the respiratory microbiome. Overall, this study highlights that the impact (e.g., cost or benefit) of antibiotic resistance mutations in bacterial pathogens is not uniform and can vary depending on the other bacteria there.},

  abstract     = {The diversification of many lineages throughout natural history has frequently been associated with evolutionary changes in life cycle complexity. However, our understanding of the processes that facilitate differentiation in the morphologies and functions expressed by organisms throughout their life cycles is limited. Theory suggests that the expression of traits is decoupled across life stages, thus allowing for their evolutionary independence. Although trait decoupling between stages is well established, explanations of how said decoupling evolves have seldom been considered. Because the different phenotypes expressed by organisms throughout their life cycles are coded for by the same genome, trait decoupling must be mediated through divergence in gene expression between stages. Gene duplication has been identified as an important mechanism that enables divergence in gene function and expression between cells and tissues. Because stage transitions across life cycles require changes in tissue types and functions, we investigated the potential link between gene duplication and expression divergence between life stages. To explore this idea, we examined the temporal changes in gene expression across the monarch butterfly ( Danaus plexippus ) metamorphosis. We found that within homologous groups, more phylogenetically diverged genes exhibited more distinct temporal expression patterns. This relationship scaled such that more phylogenetically diverse homologous groups showed more diverse patterns of gene expression. Furthermore, we found that duplicate genes showed increased stage-specificity relative to singleton genes. Overall, our findings suggest an important link between gene duplication and the evolution of complex life cycles. How do caterpillars and tadpoles turn into butterflies and frogs? It is well established that although the larval and adult stages have the same genome, larvae and adults up and down regulate the expression of different genes. However, knowing this only tells us how metamorphosis happens, not how it or other forms of complex life cycles evolved. Where did the different genes expressed by different life stages come from, and how did they evolve to generate the incredibly different morphologies seen between life stages? Theory suggests that an important mechanism that generates new genes is when an existing gene gets duplicated. The copies then evolutionarily diverge, resulting in genes with different functions and expression patterns. This theory has been predominately developed around the evolution of different cell and tissue types within an organism. Here, we apply this same concept toward explaining the changes in gene expression between different life stages across the monarch butterfly metamorphosis. Consistent with theory, we found that as genes duplicated and evolutionarily diverged, their patterns of gene expression across life stages became increasingly different. Overall, these findings link the evolution of complex life cycles to a more general understanding of how biological complexity evolves through gene duplication.},

  abstract     = {Organisms gain by anticipating future changes in the environment. Those environmental changes often follow stochastic trends. The steeper the slope of the trend, the more likely the trend’s momentum carries the future trend in the same direction. This article presents a simple biological circuit that measures the momentum, providing a prediction about future trend. The circuit calculates the momentum by the difference between a short-term and a long-term exponential moving average. The time lengths of the two moving averages can be adjusted by changing the decay rates of state variables. Different time lengths for those averages trade off between errors caused by noise and errors caused by lags in predicting a change in the direction of the trend. Prior studies have emphasized circuits that make similar calculations about trends. However, those prior studies embedded their analyses in the details of particular applications, obscuring the simple generality and wide applicability of the approach. The model here contributes to the topic by clarifying the great simplicity and generality of anticipation for stochastic trends. This article also notes that, in financial analysis, the difference between moving averages is widely used to predict future trends in asset prices. The financial measure is called the moving average convergence–divergence indicator. Connecting the biological problem to financial analysis opens the way for future studies in biology to exploit the variety of highly developed trend models in finance. Many aspects of the environment change in irregular ways, partly random but with some tendency to follow temporary trends before reversing. An organism would gain by measuring the current trend and anticipating the future direction of environmental change. This article presents a simple biological circuit to anticipate future change. For example, the production rate of a molecule may be stimulated by the level of the environmental factor of interest, such as temperature. The molecule decays at some constant rate. Thus, molecular abundance is the balance between the stimulated production and the intrinsic decay. That abundance is a running score of the environmental level when averaged over a period of time determined by the decay rate. If there are two such molecules with different decay rates, the organism has estimates for environmental levels over a shorter and a longer time scale. The difference between those two moving averages measures the recent trend in the environment. The stronger the recent trend, the more likely the trend will continue in the same direction in the near future. This simple biological circuit may be widely used throughout life. Financial modeling of stock prices uses a similar method to predict trends.},

  abstract     = {Reciprocal effects of adaptive radiations on the evolution of interspecific interactions, like parasitism, remain barely explored. We test whether the recent radiations of European whitefish ( Coregonus spp.) across and within perialpine and subarctic lakes promote its parasite Proteocephalus fallax (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) to undergo host repertoire expansion via opportunity and ecological fitting, or adaptive radiation by specialization. Using de novo genomic data, we examined P. fallax differentiation across lakes, within lakes across sympatric host species, and the contributions of host genetics versus host habitat use and trophic preferences. Whitefish intralake radiations prompted parasite host repertoire expansion in all lakes, whereas P. fallax differentiation remains incipient among sympatric fish hosts. Whitefish genetic differentiation per se did not explain the genetic differentiation among its parasite populations, ruling out codivergence with the host. Instead, incipient parasite differentiation was driven by whitefish phenotypic radiation in trophic preferences and habitat use in an arena of parasite opportunity and ecological fitting to utilize resources from emerging hosts. Whilst the whitefish radiation provides a substrate for the parasite to differentiate along the same water-depth ecological axis as Coregonus spp., the role of the intermediate hosts in parasite speciation may be overlooked. Parasite multiple-level ecological fitting to both fish and crustacean intermediate hosts resources may be responsible for parasite population substructure in Coregonus spp. We propose parasites’ delayed arrival was key to the initial burst of postglacial intralake whitefish diversification, followed by opportunistic tapeworm host repertoire expansion and a delayed nonadaptive radiation cascade of incipient tapeworm differentiation. At the geographical scale, dispersal, founder events, and genetic drift following colonization of spatially heterogeneous landscapes drove strong parasite differentiation. We argue that these microevolutionary processes result in the mirroring of host–parasite phylogenies through phylogenetic tracking at macroevolutionary and geographical scales. The Earth’s life arose through complex processes, including organisms’ rapid radiations via adaptation to new habitats and resources after environmental changes. Like diverse habitats support diverse communities of free-living species, bursts of host diversities may provide resource-rich habitats favoring symbiont radiations by specialization, a.k.a. radiation cascades, or conversely, fostering symbiont expansion into emerging hosts via ecological fitting. Whilst former studies examined symbionts with simple life cycles in old radiation events, we used the postglacial intralake radiations of European whitefish to investigate how a two-host life-cycle parasite responds to host rapid diversification. The tapeworm populations were only weakly differentiated between fish species, but replicated in most lakes. Parasite differentiation was driven by fish ecology, between fish using different habitats and feeding on different resources. Fish genetics did not influence tapeworm differentiation via adaptation to the host. Instead, parasite “multiple-level ecological fitting” to use both fish and crustacean intermediate hosts resources likely promotes parasite differentiation along the same water-depth ecological axis as the fish. Intermediate hosts may play a more important role than generally recognized in parasite speciation. Across lakes, dispersal, founder events, and genetic drift during colonizations caused strong parasite differentiation. These processes can explain the mirroring of host–parasite evolutionary histories.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of multicellularity represents a major transition in life’s history, enabling the rise of complex organisms. Multicellular groups can evolve through multiple developmental modes, but a common step is the formation of permanent cell–cell attachments after division. The characteristics of the multicellular morphology that emerges have profound consequences for the subsequent evolution of a nascent multicellular lineage, but little prior work has investigated these dynamics directly. Here, we examine a widespread yet understudied emergent multicellular morphology: cuboidal packing. Extinct and extant multicellular organisms across the tree of life have evolved to form groups in which spherical cells divide but remain attached, forming approximately cubic subunits. To experimentally investigate the evolution of cuboidal cell packing, we used settling selection to favor the evolution of simple multicellularity in unicellular, spherical Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast. Multicellular clusters with cuboidal organization rapidly evolved, displacing the unicellular ancestor. These clusters displayed key hallmarks of an evolutionary transition in individuality: groups possess an emergent life cycle driven by physical fracture, group size is heritable, and they respond to group-level selection via multicellular adaptation. In 2 out of 5 lineages, group formation was driven by mutations in the ace2 gene, preventing daughter cell separation after division. Remarkably, ace2 mutations also underlie the transition to multicellularity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata , lineages that last shared a common ancestor &gt; 300 million years ago. Our results provide insight into the evolution of cuboidal cell packing, an understudied multicellular morphology, and highlight the deeply convergent potential for a transition to multicellular individuality within fungi. Mother-daughter cellular adhesion is one of the most common ways that organisms evolve to form multicellular groups. Prior work with the snowflake yeast model system has shown that the physical constraints of cellular packing that result from mother-daughter adhesion can underpin the transition to multicellularity, allowing groups to become Darwinian entities capable of adaptation. However, it remains unclear whether this principle applies to other multicellular geometries arising from different mother-daughter cell adhesion patterns, such as those resulting from binary fission. In this paper, we investigate the origins of multicellularity via “cuboidal packing,” a growth form found across the tree of life in which cells form groups composed of cubic subunits. We evolved unicellular spherical fission yeast with daily selection for larger group size, and multicellular groups with cuboidal packing rapidly evolved. These had an emergent multicellular life cycle through which groups grow and reproduce and in which group size was a heritable trait, allowing multicellular groups to become units of selection. Taken together, our work sheds light on the origin of multicellularity via cuboidal packing and demonstrates that the spontaneous origin of multicellular groups as Darwinian entities is not a feature of specific growth forms like snowflake yeast, but instead seems to be a general feature of mother-daughter cell adhesion.},

  abstract     = {Despite large differences in morphology, behavior and lek-mating strategies the birds-of-paradise are known to hybridize occasionally, even across different genera. Many of these bird-of-paradise hybrids were originally described as distinct species based on large morphological differences when compared to recognized species. Nowadays, these specimens are generally recognized as hybrids based on morphological assessments. Having fascinated naturalists for centuries, hybrid specimens of birds-of-paradise have been collected and the specimens kept in Natural History Collections. In the present study, we utilize this remarkable resource in a museomics framework and evaluate the genomic composition of most described intergeneric hybrids and some intrageneric hybrids. We show that the majority of investigated specimens are first-generation hybrids and that the parental species, in most cases, are in line with prior morphological assessments. We also identify two specimens that are the result of introgressive hybridization between different genera. Additionally, two specimens exhibit hybrid morphologies but have no identifiable signals of hybridization, which may indicate that minor levels of introgression can have large morphological effects. Our findings provide direct evidence of contemporary introgressive hybridization taking place between genera of birds-of-paradise in nature, despite markedly different morphologies and lek-mating behaviors. In this study, we use DNA analyses to investigate 37 bird-of-paradise hybrids collected in the wild in New Guinea during the last two centuries. We provide evidence that deeply divergent bird-of-paradise species are able to reproduce with each other in nature despite having very different plumages and mating behaviors, and confirm the identity of the parental species for all except three hybrids. Furthermore, two of these hybrids are identified to be backcrosses, i.e., the offspring of a hybrid mating with a pure species. These hybrids provide the first direct evidence that genetic material can be transferred between divergent species of birds-of-paradise with large differences in morphology and mating behaviors.},

  abstract     = {A decline in diversity from the equator to the poles is a common feature of Earth’s biodiversity. Here, we examine body shape diversity in marine fishes across latitudes and explore the role of time and evolutionary rate in explaining the diversity gradient. Marine fishes’ occupation of upper latitude environments has increased substantially over the last 80 million years. Fishes in the highest latitudes exhibit twice the rate of body shape evolution and one and a third times the disparity compared to equatorial latitudes. The faster evolution of body shape may be a response to increased ecological opportunity in polar and subpolar oceans due to (1) the evolution of antifreeze proteins allowing certain lineages to invade regions of cold water, (2) environmental disturbances driven by cyclical warming and cooling in high latitudes, and (3) rapid transitions across depth gradients. Our results add to growing evidence that evolutionary rates are often faster at temperate, not tropical, latitudes. Regions of Earth that are closer to the tropics tend to have more biodiversity than regions that are closer to the poles. We explored this pattern by examining body shape diversity across marine fishes, a group of aquatic animals that span latitudes from tropical waters at the equator to polar and subpolar oceans at the poles. We found that modern marine fishes moved into polar and subpolar oceans relatively recently, with the invasion of these oceans occurring within the last 80 million years. Contrary to the common pattern, marine fishes’ body shape diversity is higher in high temperate regions than in tropical regions. Underlying this pattern, we find that polar and subpolar marine fishes evolve body shapes faster than species in the tropics. The more rapid evolution of body shape in temperate species may be due to the evolution of unique antifreeze proteins that have allowed polar and subpolar fishes to exist in icy seawater, cyclical changes in the climate at polar and subpolar latitudes, and a higher rate of transition across depth habitats. Despite the typical biodiversity pattern, our results add to growing evidence that evolutionary rates are often faster at temperate, not tropical, latitudes.},

  abstract     = {Recent discoveries of sex chromosome diversity across the tree of life have challenged the canonical model of conserved sex chromosome evolution and evoked new theories on labile sex chromosomes that maintain less differentiation and undergo frequent turnover. However, theories of labile sex chromosome evolution lack direct empirical support due to the paucity of case studies demonstrating ongoing sex chromosome turnover in nature. Two divergent lineages (viz. WL &amp; EL) of nine-spined sticklebacks ( Pungitius pungitius ) with different sex chromosomes (linkage group [LG] 12 in the EL, unknown in the WL) hybridize in a natural secondary contact zone in the Baltic Sea, providing an opportunity to study ongoing turnover between coexisting sex chromosomes. In this study, we first identify an 80 kbp genomic region on LG3 as the sex-determining region (SDR) using whole-genome resequencing data of family crosses of a WL population. We then verify this region as the SDR in most other WL populations and demonstrate a potentially ongoing sex chromosome turnover in admixed marine populations where the evolutionarily younger and homomorphic LG3 sex chromosome replaces the older and heteromorphic LG12 sex chromosome. The results provide a rare glimpse of sex chromosome turnover in the wild and indicate the possible existence of additional yet undiscovered sex chromosome diversity in Pungitius sticklebacks. Sex chromosomes are highly conserved in mammals and birds but much more labile in other species, such as reptiles, amphibians, and fish. In the species having labile sex chromosomes, even different populations of the same species have the potential to evolve different sex chromosomes and sex-determining systems. In the nine-spined stickleback fish ( Pungitius pungitius ), the eastern European lineage has heteromorphic sex chromosomes on linkage group 12 (LG12), whereas our study identified the western European lineage to have homomorphic sex chromosomes on LG3, where an 80 kbp region determines sex. Interestingly, although the two lineages have different pairs of sex chromosomes, they mate and reproduce in the Baltic Sea. We show that in the hybrid marine populations, the western lineage’s homomorphic sex chromosomes (LG3) are taking over the eastern lineage’s heteromorphic sex chromosomes (LG12). This suggests that a transition of sex chromosomes (i.e., sex chromosome turnover) is happening in these populations. This study shows that sex chromosomes can be highly diverse in stickleback fish populations, even within the same species. Lastly, we also show a likely different and uncharacterized sex-determining system in UK populations of nine-spined sticklebacks, which indicates high sex chromosome diversity in Pungitius sticklebacks.},

  abstract     = {Mortality generally is higher around birth and then progressively declines through the juvenile stage. In species where offspring depend upon their parents during maturation, a factor behind this mortality decline could be sibling replacement: offspring sacrifice their survival to benefit future or present siblings as early as possible in order to minimize losses in parental investment. Here, we propose a kin-selection model of sibling replacement. Theoretical analysis of the model and its application to demographic data of mammals suggest that sibling replacement consistently generates a selective incentive for increasing juvenile mortality at early ages when this mortality increment is the result of positive selection for juvenile altruism within the nuclear family. The model highlights how sibling replacement goes beyond optimal allocation of parental resources into dependents and can provoke greater mortality closer to birth also in response to a more favorable ratio of actors to recipients of altruism among siblings. Parental care is costly. From an evolutionary perspective, investment into suboptimal offspring may yield a smaller return than investment into other existing offspring or into the production of new ones. Reasoning about this, evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton hypothesized that if suboptimal offspring were altruistic toward their family, they would initiate their own death as early as possible to minimize parental losses and maximize the fitness of family members. This form of altruism toward kin would eventually produce a tendency towards higher mortality at early juvenile ages, an observation consistent with demographic data for species with parental care. The present work may be the first translation of Hamilton’s hypothesis into a formal kin-selection model. The model confirms Hamiltonâs intuition that, if offspring are altruistic, the force of selection against juvenile mortality is attenuated at early juvenile ages.},

  abstract     = {Sperm function is suggested to evolve by sexual selection but is also reduced by microbial damage. Here, we provide experimental evidence that male fertility can adapt to microbes. We found that in vivo, male fertility was reduced by one-fifth if sperm encountered microbes in the females that they had not previously been exposed to, compared to sperm from males that coevolved with these microbes. The female immune system activation reduced male fertility by an additional 13 percentage points. For noncoevolved males, fertility was larger if microbes were injected into females after they had stored away the sperm, indicating microbial protection as a previously unrecognized benefit of female sperm storage. Both medical and evolutionary research on reproductive health and fertility will benefit from considering our findings that the impact of microbes on sperm depends on their joint evolutionary history. Our results may assist in reconciling contradictory results of sexually transmitted disease effects on sperm and bring empirical realism to a recently proposed role of locally adapted reproductive microbiomes to speciation. Male fertility in animals, including humans, is believed to evolve mainly via sexual selection or genetic drift. Whilst microbes are known to damage sperm, we lack evidence of whether male fertility can evolve by adaptation to microbes. Here, we provide such evidence by exposing sperm to microbes within females. Male fertility was reduced when sperm and microbes had no joint evolutionary history. However, it was not affected when microbes and sperm were evolutionarily familiar, indicating that male fertility had adapted. These results provide a novel link between sexual selection and host–parasite theory and can significantly inform medical research.},

  abstract     = {Evolution proceeds unevenly across the tree of life, with some lineages accumulating diversity more rapidly than others. Explaining this disparity is challenging as similar evolutionary triggers often do not result in analogous shifts across the tree, and similar shifts may reflect different evolutionary triggers. We used a combination of approaches to directly consider such context-dependency and untangle the complex network of processes that shape macroevolutionary dynamics, focusing on Pleurodonta, a diverse radiation of lizards. Our approach shows that some lineage-wide signatures are lost when conditioned on sublineages: while viviparity appears to accelerate diversification, its effect size is overestimated by its association with the Andean mountains. Conversely, some signals that erode at broader phylogenetic scales emerge at shallower ones. Mountains, in general, do not affect speciation rates; rather, the occurrence in the Andean mountains specifically promotes diversification. Likewise, the evolution of larger sizes catalyzes diversification rates, but only within certain ecological and geographical settings. We caution that conventional methods of fitting models to entire trees may mistakenly assign diversification heterogeneity to specific factors despite evidence against their plausibility. Our study takes a significant stride toward disentangling confounding factors and identifying plausible sources of ecological opportunities in the diversification of large evolutionary radiations. Across epochal timescales, lineages encounter numerous sources of ecological opportunity, such as key innovations and environments undersaturated with species. Isolating the effects of different opportunities on evolutionary rates remains challenging. We help resolve this issue by untangling and quantifying macroevolutionary rates, focusing on a hyperdiverse lizard radiation. Our combination of approaches resolves both false positives and false negatives: some lineage-wide signatures are lost when conditioned on sublineages, and some signals erode at broader phylogenetic scales but emerge at shallower ones. Universal signatures of ecological opportunity, therefore, remain elusive: many innovations weakly affect diversification, and others promote speciation under limited conditions. We challenge conventional model-fitting methods and disentangle confounding factors, moving forward in identifying genuine drivers that fuel the expansion of evolutionary radiations.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves in response to the contrasting selection pressures that arise when organisms face environmental heterogeneity. Despite its importance for understanding how organisms successfully cope with environmental change, adaptive plasticity is often assumed but rarely demonstrated. We study here the adaptive nature of the extreme seasonal within-individual floral polyphenism exhibited by the crucifer Moricandia arvensis , a Mediterranean species that produces two different types of flowers depending on the season of the year. During spring, this species has large, cross-shaped, lilac flowers, while during summer, it develops small, rounded, white flowers. Although floral polyphenism was associated with increased plant fitness, selection moved floral traits away from their local optimum values during the harsh summer. This result strongly suggests that floral polyphenism is not adaptive in M. arvensis . The main factor selecting against floral polyphenism was pollinators, as they select for the same floral morph in all environments. Despite not being adaptive, floral polyphenism occurs throughout the entire distribution range of M. arvensis and has probably been present since the origin of the species. To solve this paradox, we explored the factors causing floral polyphenism, finding that floral polyphenism was triggered by summer flowering. Summer flowering was beneficial because it led to extra seed production and was favored by adaptive plasticity in leaf functional traits. Taken together, our study reveals a complex scenario in which nonadaptive floral polyphenism has been indirectly maintained over M. arvensis evolutionary history by selection operating to favor summer flowering. Our study provides thus strong evidence that nonadaptive plasticity may evolve as a byproduct of colonizing stressful environments. Moricandia arvensis is a Mediterranean weed that produces two different types of flowers depending on the season of the year. During spring, the individuals of this species have large, cross-shaped, lilac flowers, while during summer, the same individuals produce small, rounded, white flowers. We explored whether this polyphenism is the result of natural selection, making the plant better adapted to the dominant pollinators each season. Our integrative study has found out that, despite its morphological complexity and uniqueness, M. arvensis floral polymorphism is not adaptive because pollinators select the same floral morph in all environments. Although not adaptive, floral polyphenism occurs throughout the entire distribution range of M. arvensis and has probably been present since the origin of the species. To solve this dilemma, we explored the ecological mechanisms causing floral polyphenism and found that floral polyphenism was a consequence of flowering during summer, a season with extreme weather conditions in the Mediterranean.

  abstract     = {Human transport of species across oceans disrupts natural dispersal barriers and facilitates hybridization between previously allopatric species. The recent introduction of the North Pacific sea squirt, Ciona robusta , into the native range of the North Atlantic sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis , is a good example of this outcome. Recent studies have revealed an adaptive introgression in a single chromosomal region from the introduced into the native species. Here, we monitored this adaptive introgression over time, examining both the frequency of adaptive alleles at the core and the hitchhiking footprint in the shoulders of the introgression island by studying a thousand Ciona spp. individuals collected in 22 ports of the contact zone, 14 of which were sampled 20 generations apart. For that purpose, we developed a KASP multiplex genotyping approach, which proved effective in identifying native, nonindigenous and hybrid individuals and in detecting introgressed haplotypes. We found no early generation hybrids in the entire sample, and field observations suggest a decline in the introduced species. At the core region of the introgression sweep, where the frequency of C. robusta alleles is the highest and local adaptation genes must be, we observed stable frequencies of adaptive alien alleles in both space and time. In contrast, we observed erosion of C. robusta ancestry tracts in flanking chromosomal shoulders on the edges of the core, consistent with the second phase of a local sweep and a purge of hitchhiked incompatible mutations. We hypothesize that adaptive introgression may have modified the competition relationships between the native and invasive species in human-altered environments. Humans transport species across oceans, enabling hybridization between native and introduced species. Human activities also change selective pressures, favoring individuals that are better able to survive in altered environments. Adaptive introgression is gaining recognition as a way for species to respond to these changing conditions. While examples of anthropogenic adaptive introgression are growing, particularly for resistance to pollutants or pesticides, much remains to be explored. This study examines adaptive introgression from the North Pacific sea squirt, Ciona robusta , into the native North Atlantic sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis , within a specific genomic region of one of their 14 chromosomes. By analyzing a thousand sea squirts across 22 locations and over 10 years, researchers developed a simple method to distinguish native and alien alleles in the introgression region. Remarkably, C. robusta alleles in the core of the introgression region remained at stable frequencies over 20 generations. This core region is likely to contain genes critical for adaptation, including a tandem repeat of a detoxification gene called cytochrome P450. Researchers also studied the flanking chromosomal regions, known as the shoulders of the introgression region. Alien ancestry has declined in the shoulders, possibly due to selection against maladaptive gene combinations or migration of native alleles from nonintrogressed populations.},

  abstract     = {One of the longstanding puzzles of antimicrobial resistance is why the frequency of resistance persists at intermediate levels. Theoretical explanations for the lack of fixation of resistance include cryptic costs of resistance or negative frequency-dependence but are seldom explored experimentally. β -lactamases, which detoxify penicillin-related antibiotics, have well-characterized frequency-dependent dynamics driven by cheating and cooperation. However, bacterial physiology determines whether β -lactamases are cooperative, and we know little about the sociality or fitness of β -lactamase producers in infections. Moreover, media-based experiments constrain how we measure fitness and ignore important parameters such as infectivity and transmission among hosts. Here, we investigated the fitness effects of broad-spectrum AmpC β -lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae in broth, biofilms, and gut infections in a model insect. We quantified frequency- and dose-dependent fitness using cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin. We predicted that infection dynamics would be similar to those observed in biofilms, with social protection extending over a wide dose range. We found evidence for the sociality of β -lactamases in all contexts with negative frequency-dependent selection, ensuring the persistence of wild-type bacteria, although cooperation was less prevalent in biofilms, contrary to predictions. While competitive fitness in gut infections and broth had similar dynamics, incorporating infectivity into measurements of fitness in infections significantly affected conclusions. Resistant bacteria had reduced infectivity, which limited the fitness benefits of resistance to infections challenged with low antibiotic doses and low initial frequencies of resistance. The fitness of resistant bacteria in more physiologically tolerant states (in biofilms, in infections) could be constrained by the presence of wild-type bacteria, high antibiotic doses, and limited availability of β -lactamases. One conclusion is that increased tolerance of β -lactams does not necessarily increase selection pressure for resistance. Overall, both cryptic fitness costs and frequency dependence curtailed the fitness benefits of resistance in this study. Antimicrobial resistance is a pressing healthcare challenge. A key issue is understanding the conditions that can increase or decrease the rate of resistance spread, i.e. bacterial “fitness”. Important questions include how antibiotic doses affect the fitness of resistant bacteria. Secondly, we know that bacteria in infections can behave very differently from bacteria in laboratory conditions: they can grow more slowly and are typically more tolerant of antibiotics. Another important question is whether this higher level of tolerance makes resistance more likely to spread. However, measuring fitness in animal models (and especially humans) can be very challenging as we need to know precisely the proportion of resistant mutants and wild-type susceptible bacteria at the beginning and end of infections. In this study, we used gut infections in a model insect host to study how antibiotic doses and initial prevalence of resistance affect the fitness of resistant bacteria: we compared these results to experiments with fast- and slow-growing bacteria in the laboratory. Our study focused on β -lactamases, resistance genes that break down clinically important penicillin-based or “ β -lactam” antibiotics. We observed that some wild-type bacteria within infections exhibited high susceptibility while others demonstrated high tolerance, similar to bacteria in biofilms. Key findings were that wild-type bacteria in infections could be protected by resistant mutants breaking down antibiotics, even at very high doses. Overall, the fitness of resistant bacteria in infections was restricted by a surprising number of factors. In particular, resistant bacteria had low fitness at high antibiotic doses, while resistant mutants were also less able to colonize hosts compared to their susceptible counterparts. Experiments in insect models can shed light on some important microbiological questions, such as how tolerance of bacteria in infections and different antibiotic doses are likely to affect selection for resistance.},

  abstract     = {Chromosomal rearrangements can lead to the coupling of reproductive barriers, but whether and how they contribute to the completion of speciation remains unclear. Marine snails of the genus Littorina repeatedly form hybrid zones between populations segregating for multiple inversion arrangements, providing opportunities to study their barrier effects. Here, we analyzed 2 adjacent transects across hybrid zones between 2 ecotypes of Littorina fabalis (“large” and “dwarf”) adapted to different wave exposure conditions on a Swedish island. Applying whole-genome sequencing, we found 12 putative inversions on 9 of 17 chromosomes. Nine of the putative inversions reached near differential fixation between the 2 ecotypes, and all were in strong linkage disequilibrium. These inversions cover 20% of the genome and carry 93% of divergent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Bimodal hybrid zones in both transects indicated that the 2 ecotypes of Littorina fabalis maintain their genetic and phenotypic integrity following contact. The bimodality reflects the strong coupling between inversion clines and the extension of the barrier effect across the whole genome. Demographic inference suggests that coupling arose during a period of allopatry and has been maintained for &gt; 1,000 generations after secondary contact. Overall, this study shows that the coupling of multiple chromosomal inversions contributes to strong reproductive isolation. Notably, 2 of the putative inversions overlap with inverted genomic regions associated with ecotype differences in a closely related species ( Littorina saxatilis ), suggesting the same regions, with similar structural variants, repeatedly contribute to ecotype evolution in distinct species. The details of biological speciation remain enigmatic. In particular, it is unclear how initial barriers to gene flow are reinforced to complete reproductive isolation. Local barriers in the genome, established by divergent selection and/or stochastic events, need to be coupled together to form genome-wide barriers. Chromosomal rearrangements, such as inversions, establish the coupling of large numbers of genes and facilitate divergent adaptation despite gene flow. Here we report ecotypes of a marine snail in which 12 putative inversions covering 20% of the genome have established barriers in contact zones between two ecotypes. Despite being distributed over nine different chromosomes, the inversions are all strongly genetically associated and this strengthens the overall barrier to gene flow that extends outside the inversions.},

  abstract     = {Plasticity is found in all domains of life and is particularly relevant when populations experience variable environmental conditions. Traditionally, evolutionary models of plasticity are non-mechanistic: they typically view reactions norms as the target of selection, without considering the underlying genetics explicitly. Consequently, there have been difficulties in understanding the emergence of plasticity, and in explaining its limits and costs. In this paper, we offer a novel mechanistic approximation for the emergence and evolution of plasticity. We simulate random “epigenetic mutations” in the genotype–phenotype mapping, of the kind enabled by DNA-methylations/demethylations. The frequency of epigenetic mutations at loci affecting the phenotype is sensitive to organism stress (trait–environment mismatch), but is also genetically determined and evolvable. Thus, the “random motion” of epigenetic markers enables developmental learning-like behaviors that can improve adaptation within the limits imposed by the genotypes. However, with random motion being “goal-less,” this mechanism is also vulnerable to developmental noise leading to maladaptation. Our individual-based simulations show that epigenetic mutations can hide alleles that are temporarily unfavorable, thus enabling cryptic genetic variation. These alleles can be advantageous at later times, under regimes of environmental change, in spite of the accumulation of genetic loads. Simulations also demonstrate that plasticity is favored by natural selection in constant environments, but more under periodic environmental change. Plasticity also evolves under directional environmental change as long as the pace of change is not too fast and costs are low. This paper proposes a mechanism for phenotypic plasticity based on DNA-methylation and studies its operation and evolutionary fixation under different scenarios of environmental change. Our model simulates epigenetic modification as random changes of expression activity at multiple sites of the genome (e.g., adding/removal of methyl groups), thus altering traits on which individual fitness depends. Rates of epigenetic change increase with the mismatch between individual phenotypes and the environment (i.e., more mismatch = frequent “epigenetic mutations”), enabling a kind of “learning-like behavior” that can improve adaptation within the limits imposed by the genotypes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this mechanism allows the canalization of diverse genotypes toward common well-adapted phenotypes, but at the same time, it leads to large genetic loads that could be detrimental for populations. If the epigenetic mechanism here proposed is also genetically encoded, simulations show that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity is favored by natural selection when environments change periodically, or when the change is directional but moderate.},

  abstract     = {The shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the main evolutionary transitions in plants and has broad effects on evolutionary trajectories. In Brassicaceae, the ability to inhibit self-fertilization is controlled by 2 genes, SCR and SRK , tightly linked within the S -locus. A series of small non-coding RNAs also encoded within the S -locus regulates the transcriptional activity of SCR alleles, resulting in a linear dominance hierarchy between them. In Brassicaceae, natural allopolyploid species are often self-compatible (SC) even when one of the progenitor species is self-incompatible, but the reason why polyploid lineages tend to lose self-incompatibility (SI) and the timing of the loss of SI (immediately after ancestral hybridization between the progenitor species, or at a later stage after the formation of allopolyploid lineages) have generally remained elusive. We used a series of synthetic diploid and tetraploid hybrids obtained between self-fertilizing Capsella orientalis and outcrossing Capsella grandiflora to test whether the breakdown of SI could be observed immediately after hybridization, and whether the occurrence of SC phenotypes could be explained by the dominance interactions between S -haplotypes inherited from the parental lineages. We used RNA-sequencing data from young inflorescences to measure allele-specific expression of the SCR gene and infer dominance interactions in the synthetic hybrids. We then evaluated the seed set from autonomous self-pollination in the synthetic hybrids. Our results demonstrate that self-compatibility of the hybrids depends on the relative dominance between S -alleles inherited from the parental species, confirming that SI can be lost instantaneously upon formation of the ancestral allopolyploid lineage. They also confirm that the epigenetic regulation that controls dominance interactions between S -alleles can function between subgenomes in allopolyploids. Together, our results illustrate how a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms controlling SI can illuminate our understanding of the patterns of co-variation between the mating system and changes in ploidy. Polyploidy is the inheritable condition of carrying more than two sets of chromosomes. It can result from within-species genome duplication (autopolyploidy), or from the merging of sets of chromosomes from different species following hybridization (allopolyploidy). Because sexual reproduction between individuals of different levels of ploidy is generally not successful, self-fertilization has been considered a key component of the establishment success of polyploid lineages. However, the reasons why the mating system of polyploids may differ from that of their parental species remains mysterious. In plants of the Brassicaceae family, several allopolyploid species arose from hybridization between an outcrossing and a self-fertilizing species, and in most cases, the resulting lineages are self-fertilizing. It has been proposed that the mating system of these allopolyploids depends on the dominance relationships between the functional and non-functional self-incompatibility alleles inherited from the parental species. Here, we tested this prediction by characterizing at the transcriptional (RNA-seq) and phenotypic levels (estimation of autonomous seed production) a series of synthetic Capsella diploid and tetraploid hybrids. We found that the predicted dominance relationships closely matched the observed expression of self-incompatibility alleles, as well as the self-compatibility phenotypes. Hence, the mating system of newly formed Capsella allotetraploids depends on the dominance relationship between self-incompatibility alleles inherited from the parents. Overall, our results improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which changes in ploidy can alter the system of mating over the course of evolution.},

  abstract     = {Almost all life on earth is facing environmental change, and understanding how populations will respond to these changes is of urgent importance. One factor that is known to affect the speed by which a population can evolve when faced with changes in the environment is strong sexual selection. This increases the adaptive capacity of a population by increasing reproductive skew toward well-adapted (usually) males who will, on average, be best able to compete for matings. This effect could potentially be disrupted when males pursue alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), whereby males within a species exhibit qualitatively different behaviors in their pursuit of matings. ARTs are diverse, but one common class is those expressed through condition-dependent polyphenism such that high-quality, well-adapted males compete aggressively for mates and low-quality, poorly adapted males attempt to acquire matings via other, nonaggressive behaviors. Here, using an individual-based modeling approach, we consider the possible impacts of ARTs on adaptation and evolutionary rescue. When the ART is simultaneous, meaning that low-quality males not only engage in contests but also pursue other tactics, adaptive capacity is reduced and evolutionary rescue, where a population avoids extinction by adapting to a changing environment, becomes less likely. This is because the use of the ART allows low-quality males to contribute more maladaptive genes to the population than would happen otherwise. When the ART is fixed, however, such that low-quality males will only use the alternative tactic and do not engage in contests, we find the opposite: adaptation happens more quickly and evolutionary rescue when the environment changes is more likely. This surprising effect is caused by an increase in the mating success of the highest quality males who face many fewer competitors in this scenario—counterintuitively, the presence of males pursuing the ART increases reproductive skew toward those males in the best condition. When the environment is changing, organisms can either migrate, go extinct, or become adapted to the new environment—this last process is called “evolutionary rescue.” Whether evolutionary rescue happens is strongly affected how mating occurs in the species, with extinction being less likely when mating is like that found in birds of paradise or red deer, where males compete strongly to mate with females. Evolutionary rescue occurs in these systems because the successful males tend to be in good condition and able to cope with the new environment and their “good quality” genes get transmitted to more of the next generation. In many of these species, however, there are some males who “cheat”: These are often low-quality, poorly adapted males who would not be successful if they competed normally, so they try to gain matings by other means by, e.g., sneaking past males guarding females or by trying to mate with females on their way to the places where other males compete. We asked how these “alternative reproductive tactics” (ARTs) could change evolutionary rescue by using a simulation model of populations evolving under environmental change. We found that if males using the ART also compete normally for females, the extinction risk is increased because the low-quality, poorly adapted males are better able to get matings and father offspring. When the ART is “fixed,” however, with poor-quality males only able to use the alternative tactic and not engaging in contests, we found that the presence of males following the ART decreased the risk of extinction. This surprising result is because when these males exclude themselves from the contests for females, the males with the best, most adapted genes father even more offspring than they would do otherwise, more than counterbalancing the input of low-quality genes from the males pursuing the ART.},

  abstract     = {Numerous studies have been devoted to individual cases of horizontally acquired genes in fungi. It has been shown that such genes expand the hosts’ metabolic capabilities and contribute to their adaptations as parasites or symbionts. Some studies have provided an extensive characterization of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Dikarya. However, in the early diverging fungi (EDF), a similar characterization is still missing. In order to fill this gap, we have designed a computational pipeline to obtain a statistical sample of reliable HGT events with a low false discovery rate. We have analyzed 44 EDF proteomes and identified 829 xenologs in fungi ranging from Chytridiomycota to Mucoromycota . We have identified several patterns and statistical properties of EDF HGT. We show that HGT is driven by bursts of gene exchange and duplication, resulting in highly divergent numbers and molecular properties of xenologs between fungal lineages. Ancestrally aquatic fungi are generally more likely to acquire foreign genetic material than terrestrial ones. Endosymbiotic bacteria can be a source of useful xenologs, as exemplified by NOD-like receptors transferred to Mortierellomycota . Closely related fungi have similar rates of intronization of xenologs. Posttransfer gene fusions and losses of protein domains are common and may influence the encoded proteins’ functions. We argue that there is no universal approach for HGT identification and inter- and intra-kingdom transfers require tailored identification methods. Our results help to better understand how and to what extent HGT has shaped the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of fungi. Horizontal gene transfer is a transmission of genes between organisms, distinct from vertical inheritance from parents to offspring. HGT seems to occur among all living forms. Our study focuses on horizontally transferred genes present in early diverging fungi (EDF). EDF is a relatively understudied group of organisms with vastly diverse lifestyles and tremendous ecological importance. They include arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomeromycota , the gut-dwelling symbionts of herbivores Neocallimastigomycota , or the parasitic Batrachochytrium . HGT has been reported to contribute to this diversity by facilitating niche adaptations in certain lineages. In our work, we have analyzed horizontally acquired genes in 44 fungal genomes, focusing on cases with clear phylogenetic evidence. We have designed a computational pipeline that detects a statistical sample of reliable HGTs. The pipeline is published alongside the article. We have analyzed the donors, acceptors, and properties of the transferred genes. We found transfers of genes that can expand the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of fungi.},

  abstract     = {Competition over resources is often decided via aggressive interactions, which may or may not escalate to all-out fights. Weapons and body size play important roles in such interactions, as they often provide reliable cues of an individual’s fighting ability. In contrast, traits like nonfunctional display “weapons” may dishonestly exaggerate fighting ability in order to intimidate opponents into retreating. Signals used in the context of aggressive interactions potentially evolve via very different mechanisms than courtship signals, but have received far less theoretical attention. Here, we contrast the evolution of honest and dishonest signals of fighting ability using a game-theoretic model. Contests are assumed to consist of three discrete stages: display from a distance, low-intensity physical contact, and fighting. At each stage, contestants evaluate the fighting ability of their opponents in comparison to their own based on body size and an aggressive signal. After making this evaluation, contestants decide whether to escalate the interaction or cede to their opponent. Our model predicts that both honest and dishonest aggressive signals can exaggerate far beyond their ecological optima, but that exaggeration is more pronounced for honest signals. Equilibrium levels of aggressiveness—as measured by individuals’ propensity to escalate aggressive interactions to the next stage—are independent of the honesty of signals. We additionally develop a novel approach, based on causal inference theory, to understand how changes in underlying parameters shape the coevolution of multiple traits. We use this approach to study how aggression coevolves with body and signal size in response to changes in the cost of losing a fight. Animals often compete over resources in interactions that range from relatively tame aggressive displays to all-out physical fights. Fights are typically won by larger, better-armed individuals. As a consequence, body size and weapons may serve as trustworthy indicators of an individual&#39;s fighting ability during aggressive displays. Other display traits may instead dishonestly exaggerate an individual’s fighting ability in an effort to frighten opponents into fleeing. For example, male fiddler crabs sometimes replace lost claws with lighter and less robust versions, which resemble normal claws but are inferior as weapons. Here, we present a multistage mathematical model of contests between two individuals over a resource. At each stage, both participants gauge their opponent&#39;s fighting ability before either escalating or conceding. We study how aggressive signals can evolve to exaggerated sizes when expressed alongside other, potentially reliable, cues of fighting ability, such as body size, and contrast the evolution of honest signals of fighting ability (e.g., weapons) with that of dishonest signals that serve only to intimidate opponents. We show that both honest and dishonest aggressive signals can evolve to be strongly exaggerated, but predict that individuals will invest more in honest signals than in dishonest signals. We frame our model in terms of competition between males for access to females. However, the model itself is broadly applicable to any situation in which two individuals compete for a given resource.},

  abstract     = {Microbes are key drivers of global biogeochemical cycles, and their functional roles arey dependent on temperature. Large population sizes and rapid turnover rates mean that the predominant response of microbes to environmental warming is likely to be evolutionary, yet our understanding of evolutionary responses to temperature change in microbial systems is rudimentary. Natural microbial communities are diverse assemblages of interacting taxa. However, most studies investigating the evolutionary response of bacteria to temperature change are focused on monocultures. Here, we utilize high-throughput experimental evolution of bacteria in both monoculture and community contexts along a thermal gradient to determine how interspecific interactions influence the thermal adaptation of community members. We found that community-evolved isolates tended toward higher maximum growth rates across the temperature gradient compared to their monoculture-evolved counterparts. We also saw little evidence of systematic evolutionary change in the shapes of bacterial thermal tolerance curves along the thermal gradient. However, the effect of community background and selection temperature on the evolution of thermal tolerance curves was variable and highly taxon-specific,with some taxa exhibiting pronounced changes in thermal tolerance while others were less impacted. We also found that temperature acted as a strong environmental filter, resulting in the local extinction of taxa along the thermal gradient, implying that temperature-driven ecological change was a key factor shaping the community background upon which evolutionary selection can operate. These findings offer novel insight into how community background impacts thermal adaptation. Microbes perform key ecosystem functions, such as contributing to the cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. As these functions are temperature-dependent, it is important to understand how they will evolve in response to global warming. To date, research on thermal adaptation in microbes has focused on single-taxon cultures. However, in natural environments, microbes exist in complex communities, and how the community background can influence evolution in response to changes in temperature remains untested. Here, we evolved several bacterial taxa across a temperature gradient, both individually and combined into communities, and then measured their thermal performance (how their growth rate depends on temperatures). We found that broadly, evolution in a community led to faster growth, although the exact effects varied between species. Surprisingly, we observed a relatively minimal direct impact of temperature on thermal performance; however, we did observe the extinction of certain taxa at specific temperatures, but only in communities. These findings show that for microbes, the community background and the thermal environment can interact to shape community composition and the evolutionary trajectories of individual taxa.},

  abstract     = {Reindeer have long been served as vital subsistence resources for inhabitants of Arctic and subarctic regions owing to their domestication. However, the evolutionary relationships and divergence times among different reindeer populations, genetic traits that distinguish domesticated reindeer, and factors that contribute to their relative docility compared with that of other Cervidae specie, remain unclear. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 32 individuals from wild and domestic reindeer populations that inhabit Arctic and subarctic regions. We found that reindeer experienced 2 or more independent domestication events characterized by weak artificial selection pressure and limited significant differences in genomic parameters between wild and domestic populations. Alterations in conserved noncoding elements in the reindeer genomes, particularly those associated with nervous system development, may have contributed to their domestication by rendering the nervous system less responsive. Together, our results suggest that inherent species-specific traits, rather than intense artificial selection, may have played a significant role in the relatively docile behavior of reindeer and offer valuable insights into the domestication process of these animals. The domestication of various species has significantly benefited human life and production. However, the genetic mechanisms that underlie domestication vary among the species. Reindeer, an important domesticated species in Arctic and subarctic regions, have played a crucial role in improving human livelihoods in those areas. Understanding when and how different reindeer populations were domesticated requires further investigation. We found that reindeer underwent at least 2 independent domestication events. Interestingly, compared with many other domesticated species (e.g., zebu cattle, dogs, and sheep), reindeer experienced fewer artificial selection pressures, and a clear distinction between wild and domestic reindeer is not evident. However, we detected greater variation in neurological development-related elements in the genome of ancestral populations of both wild and domestic reindeer compared with those in the genomes of other Cervidae species. These genetic variations likely contribute to the inherent docility of reindeer, making them more amenable to domestication.},

  abstract     = {The use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections often imposes strong selection for antibiotic resistance. However, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance varies greatly across different combinations of pathogens and drugs. What underlies this variation? Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and literature surveys capable of integrating data across many studies have tried to answer this question, but the vast majority of these studies have focused only on cases where resistance is common or problematic. Yet much could presumably be learned from the cases where resistance is infrequent or absent. Here we conducted a literature survey and a systematic review to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance across a wide range of pathogen-by-drug combinations (57 pathogens and 53 antibiotics from 15 drug classes). Using Akaike information criterion-based model selection and model-averaged parameter estimation we explored 14 different factors posited to be associated with resistance evolution. We find that the most robust predictors of high resistance are nosocomial transmission (i.e., hospital-acquired pathogens) and indirect transmission (e.g., vector-, water-, air-, or vehicle-borne pathogens). While the former was to be expected based on prior studies, the positive correlation between high resistance frequencies and indirect transmission is, to our knowledge, a novel insight. The most robust predictor of low resistance is zoonosis from wild animal reservoirs. We also found partial support that resistance was associated with pathogen type, horizontal gene transfer, commensalism, and human-to-human transmission. We did not find support for correlations between resistance and environmental reservoirs, mechanisms of drug action, and global drug use. This work explores the relative explanatory power of various pathogen and drug factors on resistance evolution, which is necessary to identify priority targets of stewardship efforts to slow the spread of drug-resistant pathogens. We are currently in the middle of an antibiotic resistance crisis. While basic evolutionary theory has provided insights on how to slow the spread of resistance, it has not yet been able to eliminate the crisis, and a common assumption is that antibiotic resistance is an inevitable consequence of antibiotic use. Yet there are numerous pathogen × drug combinations in which resistance has not yet become common. By identifying differences between the cases where resistance is common and the cases where it is not, it may be possible to develop new evolutionarily informed mitigation strategies to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis. Here, we have compiled published data on the frequency of antibiotic resistance for many pathogen × drug combinations, including those where resistance is common and those where it is absent or rare. By identifying correlations between the frequency of resistance and the features of these drugs and pathogens we have identified that high frequencies of resistance are associated with bacteria that exhibit hospital-associated transmission, that have an indirect mode of transmission, and that do not spread in wild animal populations. Our hope is that these conclusions will help identify novel strategies for controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract     = {Almost all species in the genus Salix (willow) are dioecious and willows have variable sex-determining systems, the role of this variation in maintaining species barriers is relatively untested. We first analyzed the sex determination systems (SDS) of two species, Salix cardiophylla and Salix interior , whose positions in the Salix phylogeny make them important for understanding a sex chromosome turnover that has been detected in their relatives, and that changed the system from male (XX/XY) to female (ZW/ZZ) heterogamety. We show that both species have male heterogamety, with sex-linked regions (SLRs) on chromosome 15 (termed a 15XY system). The SLRs occupy 21.3% and 22.8% of the entire reference chromosome, respectively. By constructing phylogenetic trees, we determined the phylogenetic positions of all the species with known SDSs. Reconstruction of ancestral SDS character states revealed that the 15XY system is likely the ancestral state in willows. Turnovers of 15XY to 15ZW and 15XY to 7XY likely contributed to early speciation in Salix and gave rise to major groups of the Vetrix and Salix clades. Finally, we tested introgression among species in the phylogenetic trees based on both autosomes and SLRs separately. Frequent introgression was observed among species with 15XY, 15ZW, and 7XY on autosomes, in contrast to the SLR datasets, which showed less introgression, and in particular no gene flow between 15ZW and 7XY species. We argue that, although SDS turnovers in willow speciation may not create complete reproductive barriers, the evolution of SLRs plays important roles in preventing introgression and maintaining species boundaries. Sex chromosomes could accumulate reproductive barriers faster than autosomes (chromosomes that do not determine sex) and thus play important roles during speciation. Sex determination systems (SDS) include both XY (males have a pair of different chromosomes) and ZW (females have a pair of different chromosomes) systems. Three SDSs are found in different lineages of willows (genus Salix ): species of the Salix clade have an XY system on chromosome 7 (termed 7XY), early-diverging species of Vetrix clade have a 15XY system, while the remaining species of Vetrix clade have a 15ZW system. The diverse SDSs and frequent turnovers within Salix , even in closely related lineages, provide an ideal example to study the role of sex chromosome evolution in speciation. This study takes Salix cardiophylla and Salix interior , both in the early-diverging portion of the Vetrix clade, as examples and reveals that both have 15XY systems. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that possible turnovers (i.e., 15XY to 7XY and 15XY to 15ZW) have accelerated speciation in Salix . Finally, gene flow was more reduced among sex-linked regions than among autosomes, indicating that sex chromosomes maintain reproductive barriers among species. In conclusion, sex chromosome evolution in willows may shed light on the multiple roles of sex chromosomes in the speciation process of dioecious plants.},

  abstract     = {Paternal genome elimination (PGE) is a non-Mendelian inheritance system, described in numerous arthropod species, in which males develop from fertilized eggs, but their paternally inherited chromosomes are eliminated before or during spermatogenesis. Therefore, PGE males only transmit their maternally inherited set of chromosomes to their offspring. In addition to the elimination of paternal chromosomes, diverse PGE species have also repeatedly evolved the transcriptional silencing of the paternal genome, making males effectively haploid. However, it is unclear if this paternal chromosome silencing is mechanistically linked to the chromosome elimination or has evolved at a later stage, and if so, what drives the haploidization of males under PGE. In order to understand these questions, here we study the human louse, Pediculus humanus , which represents an ideal model system, as it appears to be the only instance of PGE where males eliminate, but not silence their paternal chromosomes, although the latter remains to be shown conclusively. In this study, we analyzed parent-of-origin allele-specific expression patterns in male offspring of crosses between head and body lice ecotypes. We show that hybrid adult males of P. humanus display biparental gene expression, which constitutes the first case of a species with PGE in which genetic activity of paternal chromosomes in the soma is not affected by embryonic silencing or (partial or complete) elimination. We did however also identify a small number of maternally biased genes (potentially imprinted genes), which may be involved in the elimination of paternal chromosomes during spermatogenesis. Finally, we have identified genes that show ecotype-specific expression bias. Given the low genetic diversity between ecotypes, this is suggestive for a role of epigenetic processes in ecotype differences. Many organisms pass on a random set of chromosomes to their offspring. However, in some species, this process is biased, species with a form of inheritance called paternal genome elimination (PGE) have males that only pass on the chromosomes they themselves inherited from their mother (maternal chromosomes). The chromosomes from their father (paternal chromosomes) are “eliminated” from the sperm. These males also usually silence their paternal genes within their somatic tissues. However, we do not know if these two genetic “quirks” are mechanistically linked or if they have evolved separately. Head and body lice represent a potentially ancestral form of PGE in which to explore this question. In this study, we carried out crosses between head and body lice to track the parental genes in the male offspring and examine expression levels. We find the first case of somatic expression of paternal genes in a species with PGE. We also find some genes with higher maternal expression that may be involved in eliminating the paternal chromosomes from the sperm. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of PGE. Additionally, by identifying candidate “control” genes, we provide the vital groundwork for later mechanistic studies.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of behavioral isolation is often the first step toward speciation. While past studies show that behavioral isolation will sometimes evolve as a by-product of divergent ecological selection, we lack a more nuanced understanding of factors that may promote or hamper its evolution. The environment in which mating occurs may be important in mediating whether behavioral isolation evolves for two reasons. Ecological speciation could occur as a direct outcome of different sexual interactions being favored in different mating environments. Alternatively, mating environments may vary in the constraint they impose on traits underlying mating interactions, such that populations evolving in a “constraining” mating environment would be less likely to evolve behavioral isolation than populations evolving in a less constraining mating environment. In the latter, mating environment is not the direct cause of behavioral isolation but rather permits its evolution only if other drivers are present. We test these ideas with a set of 28 experimental fly populations, each of which evolved under one of two mating environments and one of two larval environments. Counter to the prediction of ecological speciation by mating environment, behavioral isolation was not maximal between populations evolved in different mating environments. Nonetheless, mating environment was an important factor as behavioral isolation evolved among populations from one mating environment but not among populations from the other. Though one mating environment was conducive to the evolution of behavioral isolation, it was not sufficient: assortative mating only evolved between populations adapting to different-larval environments within that mating environment, indicating a role for ecological speciation. Intriguingly, the mating environment that promoted behavioral isolation is characterized by less sexual conflict compared to the other mating environment. Our results suggest that mating environments play a key role in mediating ecological speciation via other axes of divergent selection. Behavioral isolation occurs when individuals preferentially mate with others from their own population, a key step in the formation of new species. We studied a set of experimental fruit fly populations to gain insights into factors affecting the evolution of behavioral isolation. Surprisingly, we found that evolving in different mating environments did not drive the evolution of behavioral isolation directly. Rather, there was strong evidence that adaptation to different-larval environments caused behavioral isolation, but this divergent larval selection was not sufficient on its own. If both populations had evolved in a highly simplified mating environment (one of two used here), then behavioral isolation did not evolve, whereas a more complex mating environment was conducive to its evolution. Our results suggest that mating environments may play a key role in constraining or facilitating speciation via other sources of divergent selection.},

  abstract     = {In facultative symbioses, only a fraction of hosts are associated with symbionts. Specific host and symbiont pairings may be the result of host–symbiont coevolution driven by reciprocal selection or priority effects pertaining to which potential symbiont is associated with a host first. Distinguishing between these possibilities is important for understanding the evolutionary forces that affect facultative symbioses. We used the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum , and its symbiont, Paraburkholderia bonniea , to determine whether ongoing coevolution affects which host–symbiont strain pairs naturally cooccur within a facultative symbiosis. Relative to other Paraburkholderia , including another symbiont of D. discoideum , P. bonniea features a reduced genome size that indicates a significant history of coevolution with its host. We hypothesized that ongoing host–symbiont coevolution would lead to higher fitness for naturally cooccurring (native) host and symbiont pairings compared to novel pairings. We show for the first time that P. bonniea symbionts can horizontally transmit to new amoeba hosts when hosts aggregate together during the social stage of their life cycle. Here we find evidence for a virulence–transmission trade-off without host specificity. Although symbiont strains were significantly variable in virulence and horizontal transmission rate, hosts and symbionts responded similarly to associations in native and novel pairings. We go on to identify candidate virulence factors in the genomes of P. bonniea strains that may contribute to variation in virulence. We conclude that ongoing coevolution is unlikely for D. discoideum and P. bonniea. The system instead appears to represent a stable facultative symbiosis in which naturally cooccurring P. bonniea host and symbiont pairings are the result of priority effects. Symbiotic relationships between hosts and their microbial partners are prolonged and intimate associations. Some of these relationships are obligatory for both a host and symbiont to survive, while others are facultative and each partner can survive without the other. In the latter case, some host individuals may be associated with a symbiont while others are not. Specific host and symbiont pairings can be the result of reciprocal adaptation between host and symbiont partners so that naturally cooccurring pairings are best suited for each other in terms of their biological fitness. On the other hand, the symbiont that a host is associated with may simply be the symbiont that arrived first, in what is called a priority effect. We sought to determine which possibility best explained naturally cooccurring pairings of host and symbiont strains of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and its symbiont Paraburkholderia bonniea . Our work demonstrates that D. discoideum and P. bonniea are in a stable facultative relationship. Specific host and symbiont pairings appear to be the result of priority effects, and D. discoideum hosts without symbionts are simply uncolonized. This work fills a gap in our understanding of the evolutionary forces affecting facultative symbiotic relationships. We also show for the first time that P. bonniea symbionts can spread to new amoeba hosts when hosts aggregate together during the social stage of their life cycle.},

  abstract     = {Pathogen adaptation to multiple selective pressures challenges our ability to control their spread. Here we analyze the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens spreading in a heterogeneous host population where selection varies periodically in space. We study both the transient dynamics taking place at the front of the epidemic and the long-term evolution far behind the front. We identify five types of epidemic profiles arising for different levels of spatial heterogeneity and different costs of adaptation. In particular, we identify the conditions where a generalist pathogen carrying multiple adaptations can outrace a coalition of specialist pathogens. We also show that finite host populations promote the spread of generalist pathogens because demographic stochasticity enhances the extinction of locally maladapted pathogens. But higher mutation rates between genotypes can rescue the coalition of specialists and speed up the spread of epidemics for intermediate levels of spatial heterogeneity. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between migration, local selection, mutation, and genetic drift on the spread and on the evolution of pathogens in heterogeneous environments. This work extends our fundamental understanding of the outcome of the competition between two specialists and a generalist strategy (single- vs. multiadapted pathogens). These results have practical implications for the design of more durable control strategies against multiadapted pathogens in agriculture and in public health. Pathogen adaptation is constantly eroding the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic measures against the spread of infectious diseases. A promising way to limit the spread of multiadapted pathogens is to distribute different control measures across space (e.g., different vaccines, different resistant varieties of crop in agriculture). Yet, the influence of the spatial deployment of these interventions on the genetic composition of spreading epidemics remains unclear. Is it possible to identify optimal deployment strategies that reduce the spread and the speed of adaptation of resistant pathogens? We analyze the evolution of pathogen adaptations throughout an epidemic spreading in a heterogeneous host population where selection varies periodically in space. We show how an increase in the period of the spatial fluctuations of host composition can speed up the epidemic spread and disfavor multiadapted pathogens. But this effect can be altered qualitatively by the demographic stochasticity taking place at the edge of the front and by higher rates of mutation between different pathogen genotypes. We predict the composition of the pathogen population both far behind and at the front of the epidemic. This analysis allows us to elucidate the consequences of the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the coexistence between specialist (single-adaptated) and generalist (multiadapted) pathogen strategies.},

  abstract     = {Whole-genome duplication is a common macromutation with extensive impacts on gene expression, cellular function, and whole-organism phenotype. As a result, it has been proposed that polyploids have “general-purpose” genotypes that perform better than their diploid progenitors under stressful conditions. Here, we test this hypothesis in the context of stresses presented by anthropogenic pollutants. Specifically, we tested how multiple neotetraploid genetic lineages of the mostly asexually reproducing greater duckweed ( Spirodela polyrhiza ) perform across a favorable control environment and 5 urban pollutants (iron, salt, manganese, copper, and aluminum). By quantifying the population growth rate of asexually reproducing duckweed over multiple generations, we found that across most pollutants, but not all, polyploidy decreased the growth rate of actively growing propagules but increased that of dormant ones. Yet, when considering total propagule production, polyploidy increased tolerance to most pollutants, and polyploids maintained population-level fitness across pollutants better than diploids. Furthermore, broad-sense genetic correlations in growth rate among pollutants were all positive in neopolyploids but not so for diploids. Our results provide a rare test and support for the hypothesis that polyploids are more tolerant of stressful conditions and can maintain fitness better than diploids across heterogeneous stresses. These results may help predict that polyploids may be likely to persist in stressful environments, such as those caused by urbanization and other human activities. Many organisms exist in heavily anthropogenically impacted habitats. A major, but common, genetic alteration known as polyploidy, which results from the complete doubling of an organism’s genome, may allow these “polyploids” to better handle the stress of these polluted environments than their unaltered “diploid” parents. We provide a rare test of this idea across 5 different urban pollutants using duckweed ( Spirodela polyrhiza ), a small rapidly clonally reproducing aquatic plant. We show that polyploids grew as fast or faster than their diploid progenitors when exposed to 2 of the pollutants, considering actively growing propagules, and all 5 when considering dormant propagules. Polyploids can also maintain population sizes across the various pollutants, compared to benign conditions, better than the diploids. This supports the hypothesis that polyploids may perform better under polluted conditions, with important implications for their distribution in the face of environmental stressors, including those caused by human urbanization.},

  abstract     = {Camouflage and warning signals are different antipredator strategies, which offer an excellent opportunity to study the evolutionary forces acting on prey appearance. Edible prey often escape detection via camouflage, which usually leads to apostatic selection favoring rare morphs. By contrast, defended prey often display conspicuous coloration acting as warning signals to predators, which usually leads to positive frequency dependence and signal uniformity. However, when two morphs of the same species vary greatly in conspicuousness, the maintenance of both cryptic and conspicuous forms in profitable prey populations remains enigmatic. Using the white and melanic morphs of the invasive box tree moth ( Cydalima perspectalis ) presented at three different frequencies, we investigate (a) the palatability of caterpillars and adult moths to birds, (b) predation rates on the less conspicuous melanic morph, and (c) the role of frequency dependence in balancing morph frequencies. Our results show that caterpillars are distasteful for birds but not adult moths that are fully palatable. We found that the less conspicuous, melanic morph, benefits from reduced predation due to its lower detectability. The more conspicuous, white morph, instead, is more predated and is best off when common, suggesting positive frequency dependence. These results offer new insights into the evolution of color polymorphism and prey defenses in a polymorphic moth species. Further investigation is required to understand the role of different predation regimes on the maintenance of the polymorphism in this species and test whether additional selection pressures operate in natural populations. Understanding the factors influencing character variation in natural populations is a key question in evolutionary ecology. Color is one of the most studied characteristics since the beginning of evolutionary biology because it is easy to observe and is influenced by evolutionary and ecological processes. Predation is one of the main drivers of color evolution in prey communities and prey evolved camouflage or warning colors because of their role in reducing predation. Camouflage evolves because it lowers the probability of being detected by predators. Since predators are more efficient at finding prey that they are familiar with, prey that display a rare phenotype have higher survival rates (i.e., negative frequency-dependent selection). By contrast, aposematism is defined by conspicuous appearance in toxic or otherwise unprofitable prey and evolves because birds identify defended prey by learning to use their appearance as a warning signal. In this case, the most common signals are usually best identified and avoided (i.e., positive frequency-dependent selection). It is not clear, however, which form of selection predators may exert when facing cryptic and conspicuous morphs of the same species and whether predation may explain their coexistence. Here we investigate this question in a laboratory experiment, by presenting wild birds with a melanic and a white morph of the same moth., as well as caterpillars. We show that caterpillars of this species are unpalatable, whereas adults are fully palatable, showing opposite strategies of predator defense in different life stages of the same species. Unexpectedly, our results show that despite both being palatable to birds, the white morph is more predated than the melanic, but benefits from positive frequency-dependent selection, which is usually observed in species displaying warning colorations. The melanic morph instead is less predated than the white, and contrasting what is predicted by theory, it does not show negative frequency-dependent selection. Our findings help us understanding how predation acts on morph frequencies in an invasive moth species and particularly how predators influence morph ratios in a system where a conspicuous and an inconspicuous morph coexist.},

  abstract     = {Non-genetic variation is the phenotypic variation induced by the differential expression of a genotype in response to varying environmental cues and is broadly categorized into two types: phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise. These aspects of variation have been suggested to play an important role in adaptive evolution. However, the mechanisms by which these two types of non-genetic variations influence the evolutionary process are currently poorly understood. Using a machine-learning-based phenotyping tool, we independently quantified phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in the wing morphological traits of the fruit fly Drosophila simulans. Utilizing a rearing experiment, we demonstrated plastic responses in both wing size and shape as well as non-zero heritability of both phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, which suggests that adaptive phenotypic plasticity can evolve via genetic accommodation in the wing morphology of D. simulans . We found a positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, while the correlation between the plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors that were examined (nutrient condition, temperature, and light–dark cycle) was poor. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise contribute to evolvability in a similar manner, however, the mechanisms that underlie the correspondence between these two types of variation remain to be elucidated. Non-genetic variations consist of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, and these variations have been suggested to influence the direction and rate of phenotypic evolution. However, the role of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in the evolutionary process is still poorly understood. In this study, we examined the broad-sense heritability of plasticity and developmental noise, as well as the correlation between the degree of plasticity in response to three kinds of environmental factors and between the degree of plasticity and developmental noise in wing size and wing shape in Drosophila simulans . We found that phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise were heritable and positively correlated with each other, while the correlation between plasticity induced by different environmental cues was poor.

  abstract     = {In the field of social evolution, inclusive fitness theory has been successful in making a wide range of qualitative predictions on expected patterns of cooperation and conflict. Nevertheless, outside of sex ratio theory, inclusive fitness models that make accurate quantitative predictions remain relatively rare. Past models dealing with caste fate conflict in insect societies, for example, successfully predicted that if female larvae can control their own caste fate, an excess should opt to selfishly develop as queens. Available models, however, were unable to accurately predict levels of queen production observed in Melipona bees—a genus of stingless bees where caste is self-determined—as empirically observed levels of queen production are approximately two times lower than the theoretically predicted ones. Here, we show that this discrepancy can be resolved by explicitly deriving the colony-level cost of queen overproduction from a dynamic model of colony growth, requiring the incorporation of parameters of colony growth and demography, such as the per-capita rate at which new brood cells are built and provisioned, the percentage of the queen’s eggs that are female, costs linked with worker reproduction and worker mortality. Our revised model predicts queen overproduction to more severely impact colony productivity, resulting in an evolutionarily stable strategy that is approximately half that of the original model, and is shown to accurately predict actual levels of queen overproduction observed in different Melipona species. Altogether, this shows how inclusive fitness models can provide accurate quantitative predictions, provided that costs and benefits are modeled in sufficient detail and are measured precisely. Bee societies have a strict reproductive division of labor between reproductively active queens and mostly sterile workers. In honeybees and also in most tropical stingless bees, who gets to become a queen is decided by nutrition: only larvae that receive enough high-quality food can make it into a queen. In one particular group of Melipona stingless bees, however, developing larvae themselves have been found to have the power to determine their own caste fate. Under such circumstances, the question becomes what processes prevent most from selfishly opting to become queens. The present article uses an inclusive fitness model to show that the proportion that develops as a queen (ca. 10%) is such that the individual reproductive benefit of developing as a queen exactly balances with the collective, indirect fitness costs caused by decreased swarm and male production. This is the first time that such an accurate match between theoretically predicted and empirically observed levels of queen production is obtained, which was possible thanks to the use of a dynamic model that determined how overproducing queens would reduce the success of the colony as a whole. Model predictions were further validated by comparison with other bee species where caste is nutritionally determined, and where queens were shown to be produced in line with colony needs, at a rate that was two orders of magnitude lower than in Melipona . Overall, this analysis demonstrates the power of inclusive fitness theory in being able to make accurate quantitative predictions in the field of social evolution and shows how conflicts between individual and collective interests play out in animal societies.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive plasticity allows populations to cope with environmental variation but is expected to fail as conditions become unfamiliar. In novel conditions, populations may instead rely on rapid adaptation to increase fitness and avoid extinction. Adaptation should be fastest when both plasticity and selection occur in directions of the multivariate phenotype that contain abundant genetic variation. However, tests of this prediction from field experiments are rare. Here, we quantify how additive genetic variance in a multivariate phenotype changes across an elevational gradient, and test whether plasticity and selection align with genetic variation. We do so using two closely related, but ecologically distinct, sister species of Sicilian daisy ( Senecio , Asteraceae) adapted to high and low elevations on Mt. Etna. Using a quantitative genetic breeding design, we generated and then reciprocally planted c. 19,000 seeds of both species, across an elevational gradient spanning each species’ native elevation, and then quantified mortality and five leaf traits of emergent seedlings. We found that genetic variance in leaf traits changed more across elevations than between species. The high-elevation species at novel lower elevations showed changes in the distribution of genetic variance among the leaf traits, which reduced the amount of genetic variance in the directions of selection and the native phenotype. By contrast, the low-elevation species mainly showed changes in the amount of genetic variance at the novel high elevation, and genetic variance was concentrated in the direction of the native phenotype. For both species, leaf trait plasticity across elevations was in a direction of the multivariate phenotype that contained a moderate amount of genetic variance. Together, these data suggest that where plasticity is adaptive, selection on genetic variance for an initially plastic response could promote adaptation. However, large environmental effects on genetic variance are likely to reduce adaptive potential in novel environments. The potential for populations to adapt rapidly to new environments will depend on the amount of genetic variation in multiple traits that make up a multidimensional phenotype. If traits are tightly correlated at the genetic level, then selection will change all traits together and adaptation will be forced into directions determined by the genetic architecture of the traits. However, genotypes can produce different phenotypes in different environments, known as plasticity. If genotypes vary in their responses to the environment, then plasticity in a novel environment could determine how much genetic variation lies in the direction of selection, and therefore the potential for rapid adaptation. We focus on two closely related sister species of Sicilian daisy ( Senecio ) that are native to low and high elevations on Mt. Etna. We generated and then reciprocally planted seeds of both species at four elevations on Mt. Etna, including their native habitats and two intermediate elevations. We tested how genetic variation in ecologically important leaf traits changed across elevations, and whether such changes should help or hinder rapid adaptation at the edge of species’ native ranges, and in novel environments beyond their existing ranges. We found that genetic variance in leaf traits changed less between species than across elevations. Genetic variance in the high-elevation species changed most across elevations, which occurred in ways that would be likely to prevent adaptation to low elevations and, by extension, the warmer conditions being created by climate change. Genetic variance in the low-elevation species changed least across elevations and showed more potential to aid adaptation to high-elevation habitats. Together, our results show that two sister species vary in their phenotypic and genotypic responses to the environment, which suggests that closely related species can differ greatly in their potential to persist and then adapt to novel environments.},

  abstract     = {The breeder’s equation, Δ z ¯ = G β ⁠ , allows us to understand how genetics (the genetic covariance matrix, G ) and the vector of linear selection gradients β interact to generate evolutionary trajectories. Estimation of β using multiple regression of trait values on relative fitness revolutionized the way we study selection in laboratory and wild populations. However, multicollinearity, or correlation of predictors, can lead to very high variances of and covariances between elements of β , posing a challenge for the interpretation of the parameter estimates. This is particularly relevant in the era of big data, where the number of predictors may approach or exceed the number of observations. A common approach to multicollinear predictors is to discard some of them, thereby losing any information that might be gained from those traits. Using simulations, we show how, on the one hand, multicollinearity can result in inaccurate estimates of selection, and, on the other, how the removal of correlated phenotypes from the analyses can provide a misguided view of the targets of selection. We show that regularized regression, which places data-validated constraints on the magnitudes of individual elements of β , can produce more accurate estimates of the total strength and direction of multivariate selection in the presence of multicollinearity and limited data, and often has little cost when multicollinearity is low. We also compare standard and regularized regression estimates of selection in a reanalysis of three published case studies, showing that regularized regression can improve fitness predictions in independent data. Our results suggest that regularized regression is a valuable tool that can be used as an important complement to traditional least-squares estimates of selection. In some cases, its use can lead to improved predictions of individual fitness, and improved estimates of the total strength and direction of multivariate selection. To understand how traits will evolve in populations, it is necessary to determine which traits are under natural or sexual selection, and the strength and direction of that selection. Organisms are comprised of many correlated traits and selection often acts on these traits simultaneously, necessitating multiple traits to be included in evolutionary predictions. Estimating selection on multiple correlated traits, however, is a well-known statistical challenge. In this article, we use simulations and reanalyses of published data to show that modern regularized regression methods can generate more accurate estimates of the total strength and direction of multivariate selection in the presence of correlated traits and have minimal cost when correlations between traits are low. Our results suggest that regularized regression can improve our understanding of some aspects of selection and should be employed alongside traditional least-squares approaches in selection analyses.},

  abstract     = {How repeatable is evolution at genomic and phenotypic scales? We studied the repeatability of evolution during 8 generations of colonization using replicated microcosm experiments with the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum . Based on the patterns of shared allele frequency changes that occurred in populations from the same generation or experimental location, we found adaptive evolution to be more repeatable in the introduction and establishment phases of colonization than in the spread phase, when populations expand their range. Lastly, by studying changes in allele frequencies at conserved loci, we found evidence for the theoretical prediction that range expansion reduces the efficiency of selection to purge deleterious alleles. Overall, our results increase our understanding of adaptive evolution during colonization, demonstrating that evolution can be highly repeatable while also showing that stochasticity still plays an important role. When organisms colonize a new location, they may not be well suited to the novel environment they find themselves in. As such, natural selection can play an important role in the survival of a colonizing population. Previous studies of natural populations have shown evidence that natural selection has occurred after completion of the process, but few have done so in an experimental setting and in real time. Experimental studies of colonization can enhance our understanding of precisely when and how adaptation occurs and the degree to which the process is or is not repeatable. In this study, we conducted a well-replicated microcosm experiment with the red flour beetle to better understand the evolutionary processes that take place during colonization and to determine which aspects of the process are repeatable. We studied colonization in three phases: introduction, establishment, and spread. We found that the introduction and establishment phases of colonization had similar genetic signatures of adaptation. In contrast, the spread phase had weaker signatures of adaptation across replicates. During the spread phase, we also found evidence of a process called gene surfing, where deleterious mutations can increase in frequency due to the weakened efficiency of natural selection at lower population densities. Together, these results provide insights into the colonization process and the role adaptation plays therein.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive colonization is a process wherein a colonizing population exhibits an adaptive change in response to a novel environment, which may be critical to its establishment. To date, theoretical models of adaptive colonization have been based on single-species introductions. However, given their pervasiveness, symbionts will frequently be co-introduced with their hosts to novel areas. We present an individual-based model to investigate adaptive colonization by hosts and their symbionts across a parasite–mutualist continuum. The host must adapt in order to establish itself in the novel habitat, and the symbiont must adapt to track evolutionary change in the host. First, we classify the qualitative shifts in the outcome that can potentially be driven by non-neutral effects of the symbiont–host interaction into three main types: parasite-driven co-extinction, parasite release, and mutualistic facilitation. Second, we provide a detailed description of a specific example for each type of shift. Third, we disentangle how the interplay between symbiont transmissibility, host migration, and selection strength determines: (a) which type of shift is more likely to occur and (b) the size of the interaction effects necessary to produce it. Overall, we demonstrate the crucial role of host and symbiont dispersal scales in shaping the impacts of parasitism and mutualism on adaptive colonization. Global change is forcing many species to shift their ranges. Colonizing new areas often requires adaptation to novel environmental conditions. Without adaptation, a colonizing population may only be temporarily sustained, thanks to migration. However, although immigrants are poorly adapted to the new habitat, they provide a source of genetic variation that might help the population to adapt to local conditions and persist. Theoretical models have been used to explore this “adaptive colonization” process, but without accounting for the role of symbionts, not withstanding the fact that practically all plant and animal species host symbionts on or inside their bodies. When colonizing new areas, host species also introduce their symbionts. Symbionts range from beneficial mutualists through simple passengers to harmful parasites, so some may help and some may hinder colonization. Furthermore, colonizing symbionts may also experience new selective pressures that would be likely to influence the colonization process. Here we bring together two fields in evolutionary biology—colonization of novel habitats and host–symbiont interactions—to address an important issue for understanding the response of populations to global change: How does the interaction between a colonizing host population and its co-introduced symbionts influence their respective abilities to adapt to new conditions? To do this, we developed a simulation that follows the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a host and its symbiont after being introduced into an empty island with external environmental conditions that differ from those in their source habitats. We considered different types of impact of the symbiont on the host, from strongly negative to strongly positive. Our results show that sometimes neither of the species can establish a population on the island, sometimes both do, and sometimes only the host succeeds. The outcome depends on the dispersal rates of both partners, on the interaction type and strength, and on their need for local adaptation.},

  abstract     = {As climate change causes the environment to shift away from the local optimum that populations have adapted to, fitness declines are predicted to occur. Recently, methods known as genomic offsets (GOs) have become a popular tool to predict population responses to climate change from landscape genomic data. Populations with a high GO have been interpreted to have a high “genomic vulnerability” to climate change. GOs are often implicitly interpreted as a fitness offset, or a change in fitness of an individual or population in a new environment compared to a reference. However, there are several different types of fitness offset that can be calculated, and the appropriate choice depends on the management goals. This study uses hypothetical and empirical data to explore situations in which different types of fitness offsets may or may not be correlated with each other or with a GO. The examples reveal that even when GOs predict fitness offsets in a common garden experiment, this does not necessarily validate their ability to predict fitness offsets to environmental change. Conceptual examples are also used to show how a large GO can arise under a positive fitness offset, and thus cannot be interpreted as a population vulnerability. These issues can be resolved with robust validation experiments that can evaluate which fitness offsets are correlated with GOs. Genomes hold important clues to how species adapt to their environments. “Genomic vulnerability” is a rapidly growing subfield of evolution and ecology that uses genomic data to predict how maladapted species will be in the future under climate change. This study employs critical reasoning to show that current interpretations of “genomic vulnerability” have limitations, as the way that it is measured does not necessarily relate to ecological and evolutionary definitions of maladaptation. Carefully designed experiments can be used, however, to validate and improve predictions of species responses to climate change.},

  abstract     = {Phenotypic plasticity is one way for organisms to deal with variable environments through generalism. However, plasticity is not found universally and its evolution may be constrained by costs and other limitations such as complexity: the need for multiple mutational steps before the adaptation is realized. Theory predicts that greater experienced heterogeneity, such as organisms may encounter when spatial heterogeneity is fine-grained relative to dispersal, should favor the evolution of a broader niche. Here we tested this prediction via simulation. We found that, contrary to classical predictions, coarse-grained landscapes can be the most favorable for the evolution of plasticity, but only when populations encounter those landscapes through range expansion. During these range expansions, coarse-grained landscapes select for each step in the complex mutational pathway to plastic generalism by blocking the dispersal of specialists. These circumstances provide ecological opportunities for innovative mutations that change the niche. Our results indicate a new mechanism by which range expansion and spatially structured landscapes interact to shape evolution and reveal that the environments in which a complex adaptation has the highest fitness may not be the most favorable for its evolution. Organisms regularly encounter uncertainty and variety in the types of environments they encounter. Phenotypic plasticity, a strategy in which organisms produce different traits based on cues they receive from the environment, seems like an ideal solution to cope with this variation. Phenotypic plasticity is present in nature, but it is not ubiquitous, which points to the possibility that its evolution is constrained. One possible constraint is that multiple mutations might be required to produce a plastic organism. The waiting time to assemble these multiple mutations might be prohibitively long unless each one provides an immediate benefit to the individuals who carry it. Here we use computer simulations to look at how the evolution of plasticity plays out during range expansion events, in which a population enters a new area for the first time. We find that landscapes with large, clustered patches of each environment most readily promote the evolution of phenotypic plasticity during range expansions, because these large patches inhibit the movement of specialists that can only thrive in one environment. These results contradict older predictions with regard to which type of landscapes would be most favorable for the evolution of this complex trait and point us toward new complexities in the ways in which expanding populations adapt.},

  abstract     = {In ecological speciation, incipient species diverge due to natural selection that is ecologically based. In flowering plants, different pollinators could mediate that selection (pollinator-mediated divergent selection) or other features of the environment that differ between habitats of 2 species could do so (environment-mediated divergent selection). Although these mechanisms are well understood, they have received little rigorous testing, as few studies of divergent selection across sites of closely related species include both floral traits that influence pollination and vegetative traits that influence survival. This study employed common gardens in sites of the 2 parental species and a hybrid site, each containing advanced generation hybrids along with the parental species, to test these forms of ecological speciation in plants of the genus Ipomopsis . A total of 3 vegetative traits (specific leaf area, leaf trichomes, and photosynthetic water-use efficiency) and 5 floral traits (corolla length and width, anther insertion, petal color, and nectar production) were analyzed for impacts on fitness components (survival to flowering and seeds per flower, respectively). These traits exhibited strong clines across the elevational gradient in the hybrid zone, with narrower clines in theory reflecting stronger selection or higher genetic variance. Plants with long corollas and inserted anthers had higher seeds per flower at the Ipomopsis tenuituba site, whereas selection favored the reverse condition at the Ipomopsis aggregata site, a signature of divergent selection. In contrast, no divergent selection due to variation in survival was detected on any vegetative trait. Selection within the hybrid zone most closely resembled selection within the I. aggregata site. Across traits, the strength of divergent selection was not significantly correlated with width of the cline, which was better predicted by evolvability (standardized genetic variance). These results support the role of pollinator-mediated divergent selection in ecological speciation and illustrate the importance of genetic variance in determining divergence across hybrid zones. The remarkable diversity of the flowering plants has been attributed to evolutionary effects of pollinators since the time of Darwin. Despite that long history, there are few tests of whether differences in appearance between closely related plant species reflect adaptation to different animal pollinators or adaptation to other differences between habitats such as soil types or climatic conditions. This study examines the relationships of plant traits to fitness in field gardens planted with two closely related species of subalpine plants and their hybrids. It presents strong evidence that divergence between the two species is driven by pollinator-mediated natural selection rather than habitat-mediated selection. It focuses on both floral and vegetative traits that show clines, i.e., gradual changes in trait value, across an elevational gradient. Natural selection due to differences in seed production favored long flowers in the site occupied by slender skyrocket ( Ipomopsis tenuituba ) but short flowers in the site occupied by scarlet gilia ( Ipomopsis aggregata ), a signature of divergent selection mediated by pollinators. Similar results were obtained for another reproductive trait, position of the anthers. In contrast, vegetative traits (leaf thickness, leaf hairs, and water-use efficiency during photosynthesis) did not experience divergent selection across the parental sites, thus providing no support for habitat-mediated selection. Across all measured traits, the strength of divergent selection did not correlate with the steepness of the cline, as frequently assumed, which was better predicted by the relative amount of genetic variability in the trait and thus its potential to evolve. Results elucidate the mechanism of plant speciation between these two species. They also illustrate the importance of combining data on spatial patterns in traits and natural selection measurements to understand how species diverge in nature.},

  abstract     = {Little is known about the metabolic basis of life-history trade-offs but lipid stores seem to play a pivotal role. During reproduction, an energetically highly costly process, animals mobilize fat reserves. Conversely, reduced or curtailed reproduction promotes lipid storage in many animals. Systemic signals from the gonad seem to be involved: Caenorhabditis elegans lacking germline stem cells display endocrine changes, have increased fat stores and are long-lived. Similarly, germline-ablated Drosophila melanogaster exhibit major somatic physiological changes, but whether and how germline loss affects lipid metabolism remains largely unclear. Here we show that germline-ablated flies have profoundly altered energy metabolism at the transcriptional level and store excess fat as compared to fertile flies. Germline activity thus constrains or represses fat accumulation, and this effect is conserved between flies and worms. More broadly, our findings confirm that lipids represent a major energetic currency in which costs of reproduction are paid. Evolutionary theory predicts that energy allocation to reproduction occurs at the expense of investment into somatic maintenance and survival. Notably, lipids are thought to be a central energetic currency in which such “costs of reproduction” are paid but still little is understood about the underlying mechanisms. Previous work in the nematode worm and the fruit fly has found that loss of proliferating germ cells (and hence curtailed reproduction) alters hormonal signaling and extends lifespan; in the worm, germline removal also leads to excess fat stores. Here, we sought to test whether the lack of a proliferating germline in the fly also impacts fat metabolism as observed in the worm. Using gene expression and lipid measurements we show that—similar to the worm—germline-ablated flies exhibit profound changes in lipid metabolism and excess fat storage. Our findings confirm that lipids play a central role in mediating costs of reproduction and suggest that the regulatory principles governing reproductive trade-offs are evolutionarily conserved.},

  abstract     = {Mate preferences may target traits (a) enhancing offspring adaptation and (b) reducing heterospecific matings. Because similar selective pressures are acting on traits shared by different sympatric species, preference-enhancing offspring adaptation may increase heterospecific mating, in sharp contrast with the classical case of so-called “magic traits.” Using a mathematical model, we study which and how many traits will be used during mate choice, when preferences for locally adapted traits increase heterospecific mating. In particular, we study the evolution of preference toward an adaptive versus a neutral trait in sympatric species. We take into account sensory trade-offs, which may limit the emergence of preference for several traits. Our model highlights that the evolution of preference toward adaptive versus neutral traits depends on the selective regimes acting on traits but also on heterospecific interactions. When the costs of heterospecific interactions are high, mate preference is likely to target neutral traits that become a reliable cue limiting heterospecific matings. We show that the evolution of preference toward a neutral trait benefits from a positive feedback loop: The more preference targets the neutral trait, the more it becomes a reliable cue for species recognition. We then reveal the key role of sensory trade-offs and the cost of choosiness favoring the evolution of preferences targeting adaptive traits, rather than traits reducing heterospecific mating. When sensory trade-offs and the cost of choosiness are low, we also show that preferences targeting multiple traits evolve, improving offspring fitness by both transmitting adapted alleles and reducing heterospecific mating. Altogether, our model aims at reconciling “good gene” and reinforcement models to provide general predictions on the evolution of mate preferences within natural communities. Mate preferences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom and generate powerful selective forces impacting the diversification of traits and species. The evolution of such preferences has been the focus of multiple theoretical and empirical studies and intense scientific debates. The evolution of mate preference (a) enhancing offspring fitness and (b) reducing heterospecific mating have been mostly studied separately, except in the specific case of preference for so-called “magic traits” that increase both offspring survival and species divergence. However, in many cases, the evolution of traits in sympatric species generates conflicting evolutionary forces acting on preferences. On one hand, enhanced offspring survival promotes preference toward locally adaptive traits and may thus lead to convergent evolution of traits among sympatric species. On the other hand, the evolution of similar traits in sympatric species may generate costly heterospecific sexual interactions promoting preference toward traits that diverge between species. Here, we thus build a general mathematical model to investigate the evolutionary factors determining which and how many traits are targeted by mate choice. We especially determine whether preferences will likely target adaptive versus neutral traits. Our model highlights that the evolution of preferences for adaptive versus neutral traits in sympatric species depends not only on within-species mating opportunities but also on the niche overlap between species, tuning heterospecific interactions. By jointly considering (a) the selection regimes acting on the targeted traits within species, as well as (b) interactions with other species living in sympatry, our theoretical study provides a general framework reconciling these research fields.},

  abstract     = {Apoptosis is regulated cell death that depends on caspases. A specific initiator caspase is involved upstream of each apoptotic signaling pathway. Characterized in nematode, fly, and mammals, intrinsic apoptosis is considered to be ancestral, conserved among animals, and depends on shared initiators: caspase-9, Apaf-1 and Bcl-2. However, the biochemical role of mitochondria, the pivotal function of cytochrome c and the modality of caspase activation remain highly heterogeneous and hide profound molecular divergence among apoptotic pathways in animals. Uncovering the phylogenetic history of apoptotic actors, especially caspases, is crucial to shed light on the evolutionary history of intrinsic apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate with phylogenetic analyses that caspase-9, the fundamental key of intrinsic apoptosis, is deuterostome-specific, while caspase-2 is ancestral to bilaterians. Our analysis of Bcl-2 and Apaf-1 confirms heterogeneity in functional organization of apoptotic pathways in animals. Our results support emergence of distinct intrinsic apoptotic pathways during metazoan evolution. Apoptosis is a type of cell death which is ubiquitous in animals. Two apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, are described at the molecular level. In both pathways a multigene family, the caspases, are crucial in triggering apoptosis. Until now the description of apoptotic pathways in nematode, fly and mammals have suggested that intrinsic apoptosis is common and conserved across animals. However, several functional differences exist between these models, inviting us to revisit our understanding of apoptotic pathway evolution. Here, based on phylogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that actors involved in intrinsic apoptosis, especially caspases, are not common between animals, but conversely present a complex evolutionary history. Thus, our results support the emergence of distinct intrinsic apoptotic pathways in animals.},

  abstract     = {While temperature has been shown to affect the survival and growth of bacteria and their phage parasites, it is unclear if trade-offs between phage resistance and other bacterial traits depend on the temperature. Here, we experimentally compared the evolution of phage resistance–virulence trade-offs and underlying molecular mechanisms in phytopathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum bacterium at 25 °C and 35 °C temperature environments. We found that while phages reduced R. solanacearum densities relatively more at 25 °C, no difference in the final level of phage resistance was observed between temperature treatments. Instead, small colony variants (SCVs) with increased growth rate and mutations in the quorum-sensing (QS) signaling receptor gene, phcS , evolved in both temperature treatments. Interestingly, SCVs were also phage-resistant and reached higher frequencies in the presence of phages. Evolving phage resistance was costly, resulting in reduced carrying capacity, biofilm formation, and virulence in planta, possibly due to loss of QS-mediated expression of key virulence genes. We also observed mucoid phage-resistant colonies that showed loss of virulence and reduced twitching motility likely due to parallel mutations in prepilin peptidase gene, pilD . Moreover, phage-resistant SCVs from 35 °C-phage treatment had parallel mutations in type II secretion system (T2SS) genes ( gspE and gspF ). Adsorption assays confirmed the role of pilD as a phage receptor, while no loss of adsorption was found with phcS or T2SS mutants, indicative of other downstream phage resistance mechanisms. Additional transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of CBASS and type I restriction-modification phage defense systems in response to phage exposure, which coincided with reduced expression of motility and virulence-associated genes, including pilD and type II and III secretion systems. Together, these results suggest that while phage resistance–virulence trade-offs are not affected by the growth temperature, they could be mediated through both pre- and postinfection phage resistance mechanisms. Ralstonia solanacearum is a notorious plant-pathogenic bacterium, capable of infecting several important crop plants. In the absence of effective chemical control strategies, phage therapy has been proposed as an alternative strategy for biocontrol of R. solanacearum . Here we tested whether phage efficacy is limited by the growth temperature, which could potentially affect the rate of phage resistance. We find that phage resistance evolves regardless of the temperature, leading to trade-offs with pathogen virulence. Sequencing and validation experiments with mutants revealed that phage uses type IV pilus as a receptor, while defects in type II secretion system (T2SS) and quorum-sensing signaling genes provided phage resistance irrespective of phage adsorption. Activation of restriction-modification and abortive infection (CBASS) phage defense systems upon short-term phage exposure was also observed, which was coupled with downregulation of several virulence-associated genes. Together, these results suggest that phages could be used to select less virulent R. solanacearum strains, expanding their biocontrol potential beyond pathogen density control.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary compromises are thought to be common under fluctuating selection because the mutations that best enable adaptation to one environmental context can often be detrimental to others. Yet, prior experimental work has shown that generalists can sometimes perform as well as specialists in their own environments. Here we use a highly replicated evolutionary experiment ( N = 448 asexual lineages of the brewer’s yeast) to show that even though fluctuation between two environmental conditions often induces evolutionary compromises (at least early on), it can also help reveal difficult to reach adaptive outcomes that ultimately improve performance in both environments. Specifically, we begin by showing that yeast adaptation to chemical stress can involve fitness trade-offs with stress-free environments and that, accordingly, lineages that are repeatedly exposed to occasional stress tend to respond by trading performance for breadth of adaptation. We then show that on rare occasions, fluctuating selection leads to the evolution of no-cost generalists that can even outcompete constant selection specialists in their own environments. We propose that the discovery of these broader and more effective adaptive outcomes under fluctuating selection could be partially facilitated by changes in the adaptive landscape that result from having to deal with fitness trade-offs across different environmental conditions. Overall, our findings indicate that reconciling the short- and long-term evolutionary consequences of fluctuating selection could significantly improve our understanding of the evolution of specialization and generalism. Environmental conditions often fluctuate. Adaptation to fluctuating environments can involve trade-offs, whereby increasing fitness in one environmental condition lowers fitness in other conditions. Faced with such trade-offs organisms can evolve to be specialists or generalists, but the later outcome is thought to come with a cost relative to specialists in particular environments. We used the experimental evolution of yeast to evaluate such outcomes in the face of fluctuating levels of two environmental stresses, salt and copper. We found that when adaptation involves fitness trade-offs between fluctuating environments most populations suffer a cost compared to those that evolved in constant environments, but a small number of populations achieved high fitness in both environments. Our results improve our understanding of how organisms adapt to fluctuating environments.},

  abstract     = {Parallel clines in traits related to adaptation in a species can be due to independent selection on a pair of traits, or due to selection in one trait resulting in a parallel cline in a correlated trait. To distinguish between the mechanisms giving rise to parallel adaptive population divergence of multiple traits along an environmental gradient we need to study variation, correlations, and selective forces within individual populations along the gradient. In many tree species, budset timing (BST) forms a latitudinal cline, and parallel clinal variation is also found in other seedling traits, such as first-year height (FYH) and fall frost injury (FFI). In this study, we set up a common garden experiment with open pollinated progeny from natural populations of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ), with one large sample from single population (500 families) and smaller samples from across a latitudinal gradient. BST, FYH and induced FFI were first measured in a greenhouse. The seedlings were then planted in the field, where survival and height were measured at the age of 9 years as fitness proxies. We compared between- and within-population variation and genetic correlations of these three seedling traits, and estimated selection gradients at the family level in our main population, taking into account the potential effects of seed weight. Between-population genetic correlations between seedling traits were high (0.76–0.95). Within-population genetic correlations in the main population were lower (0.14–0.35), as in other populations (0.10–0.39). Within population, extensive adaptive variation persists in the seedling traits, in line with rather weak selection gradients, yet maintaining the clines. Although our sampling does not cover the whole cline equally, the results suggest that the individual clines in these traits are maintained by largely independently acting selection, which results in fewer constraints in adaptation under changing climate. Clines in genetically governed traits result from adaptation to gradually varying environmental gradients. Genetic dependencies between traits can influence adaptation. As the climate warms, northern Scots pine must adapt to new combinations of photoperiod and temperature to time its yearly growth period optimally along the cline. Here, we examined the dependency between adaptive traits clines in budset timing, height, and cold tolerance of first-year Scots pine seedlings. While these clines are highly correlated between populations along the cline, within-population analysis with a large natural population sample revealed much weaker genetic correlations. Further, selection was shown to act mostly independently on each trait. The lack of strong genetic correlations between adaptive traits results in fewer constraints on adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Embryonic lethal mutations are arguably the earliest and most severe manifestation of inbreeding depression, but their impact on wild populations is not well understood. Here, we combined genomic, fitness, and life-history data from 5,925 wild Soay sheep sampled over nearly three decades to explore the impact of embryonic lethal mutations and their evolutionary dynamics. We searched for haplotypes that in their homozygous state are unusually rare in the offspring of known carrier parents and found three putatively semi-lethal haplotypes with 27%–46% fewer homozygous offspring than expected. Two of these haplotypes are decreasing in frequency, and gene-dropping simulations through the pedigree suggest that this is partially due to purifying selection. In contrast, the frequency of the third semi-lethal haplotype remains relatively stable over time. We show that the haplotype could be maintained by balancing selection because it is also associated with increased postnatal survival and body weight and because its cumulative frequency change is lower than in most drift-only simulations. Our study highlights embryonic mutations as a largely neglected contributor to inbreeding depression and provides a rare example of how harmful genetic variation can be maintained through balancing selection in a wild mammal population. Every time DNA is copied, mistakes happen. Most often, these mistakes, called mutations, are deleterious to the organism carrying them. In the worst case, embryonic lethal mutations can prevent an individual from being born in the first place. However, natural selection tends to remove such strongly deleterious mutations from populations very quickly, because when their carriers die early, the mutations disappear too. Unfortunately, especially in small populations, deleterious mutations sometimes spread to higher frequencies. This is due to genetic drift and the fact that deleterious mutations are usually recessive, so their full detrimental effects are only expressed if an individual inherits two identical copies of the mutation from their parents, causing the mutation to be homozygous. In this study, we explored the impact of embryonic lethal mutations in a small, wild population of Bronze Age sheep on the Scottish St. Kilda archipelago. Overall, we detected three semi-lethal mutations, which caused mortality in some, but not all embryos. Two of these mutations have decreased in frequency in the population over the last 25 years, and simulations show that this is partly due to natural selection rather than mere chance. Against our expectations, however, the third mutation has persisted in the population without signs of decrease, and we went on to explore why this is. We found that the mutation is linked not only to embryonic lethality but also to increased survival and body weight in lambs. This demonstrates that the same part of the genome can be subject to opposing forces of selection, which balance each other out and therefore cause the mutation to persist in the population. Overall, our study shows that embryonic mutations can prevent substantial numbers of individuals from being born in wild populations and explores the complicated evolutionary dynamics of deleterious mutations.},

  abstract     = {For aging to evolve, selection against mortality must decrease with age. This prevailing view in the evolutionary theory of senescence posits that mutations with deleterious effects happening late in life—when purging selection is weak—may become fixed via genetic drift in the germline, and produce a senescent phenotype. Theory, however, has focused primarily on growing populations and the fate of single deleterious mutations. In a mathematical model, we demonstrate that relaxing both of these simplifying assumptions leads to unrealistic outcomes. In density-regulated populations, previously fixed deleterious mutations should promote the fixation of other deleterious mutations that lead to senescence at ever younger ages, until death necessarily occurs at sexual maturity. This sequential fixation of deleterious mutations is not promoted by a decrease in population size, but is due to a change in the strength of selection. In an individual-based model, we also show that such evolutionary dynamics should lead to the extinction of most populations. Our models therefore make rather unrealistic predictions, underlining the need for a reappraisal of current theories. In this respect, we have further assumed in our models that the deleterious effects of mutations can only occur at certain ages, marked, for instance, by somatic or physiological changes. Under this condition, we show that the catastrophic accumulation of deleterious mutations in the germline can stop. This new finding emphasizes the importance of investigating somatic factors, as well as other mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of mutations, to understand senescence evolution. More generally, our model therefore establishes that patterns of senescence in nature depend not only on the decrease in selection strength with age but also on any mechanism that stops the catastrophic accumulation of mutations. Selection is ineffective in eliminating from the population a deleterious mutation with negative effects occurring late in life. The fixation of such a mutation then contributes to senescence, characterized by increased mortality with age. Nevertheless, we lack a theory on how the fixation of one deleterious mutation affects the subsequent invasion of other deleterious mutations. In a mathematical model, we demonstrate that in density-regulated populations, deleterious mutation accumulates through a positive feedback, leading to senescence at ever younger ages. In an individual-based model, this even leads to population collapse. Although this positive feedback may be widespread in nature, since it should occur even when population size is high, we show that mutation accumulation can stop when mutations have negative effects only at certain ages, marked, for example, by somatic changes. We thus underline the importance of (somatic) triggers of genetic effects in the evolution of senescence and, more generally, the crucial role of any mechanism that could halt this catastrophic accumulation of mutations. We believe this should be at the heart of future research into the evolution of senescence.},

However, our knowledge of selection for thermoregulation and the potential for evolutionary responses is limited, particularly for large organisms experiencing extreme temperature fluctuations. Here we use thermal imaging to quantify selection and genetic variation in thermoregulation in ostriches ( Struthio camelus ), the world’s largest bird species that is experiencing increasingly volatile temperatures. We found that females who are better at regulating their head temperatures (“thermoregulatory capacity”) had higher egg-laying rates under hotter conditions. Thermoregulatory capacity was both heritable and showed signatures of local adaptation: females originating from more unpredictable climates were better at regulating their head temperatures in response to temperature fluctuations. Together these results reveal that past and present evolutionary processes have shaped genetic variation in thermoregulatory capacity, which appears to protect critical organs, such as the brain, from extreme temperatures during reproduction.},

  abstract     = {Identifying along which lineages shifts in diversification rates occur is a central goal of comparative phylogenetics; these shifts may coincide with key evolutionary events such as the development of novel morphological characters, the acquisition of adaptive traits, polyploidization or other structural genomic changes, or dispersal to a new habitat and subsequent increase in environmental niche space. However, while multiple methods now exist to estimate diversification rates and identify shifts using phylogenetic topologies, the appropriate use and accuracy of these methods are hotly debated. Here we test whether five Bayesian methods—Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures ( BAMM ), two implementations of the Lineage-Specific Birth–Death–Shift model (LSBDS and PESTO), the approximate Multi-Type Birth–Death model ( MTBD ; implemented in BEAST2), and the Cladogenetic Diversification Rate Shift model (ClaDS2)—produce comparable results. We apply each of these methods to a set of 65 empirical time-calibrated phylogenies and compare inferences of speciation rate, extinction rate, and net diversification rate. We find that the five methods often infer different speciation, extinction, and net-diversification rates. Consequently, these different estimates may lead to different interpretations of the macroevolutionary dynamics. The different estimates can be attributed to fundamental differences among the compared models. Therefore, the inference of shifts in diversification rates is strongly method dependent. We advise biologists to apply multiple methods to test the robustness of the conclusions or to carefully select the method based on the validity of the underlying model assumptions to their particular empirical system. Understanding why some groups of organisms have more species than others is key to understanding the origin of biodiversity. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that multiple distinct historical events, such as the evolution of particular morphological features (e.g., the flower, the tetrapod limb) and competition among species, can produce this pattern of divergent species richness. Identifying when and where on the tree of life shifts in diversification rates occur is important for explaining the origin of modern-day biodiversity and understanding how disparity among species evolves. Several statistical methods have been developed to infer diversification rates and identify these shifts. While these methods each attempt to make inferences about changes in the tempo of diversification, they differ in their underlying statistical models and assumptions. Here we test if these methods draw similar conclusions using a data set of 65 time-calibrated phylogenies from across multicellular life. We find that inferences of where rate shifts occur strongly depend on the chosen method. Therefore, biologists should choose the model whose assumptions they believe to be the most valid and justify their model choice a priori , or consider using several independent methods to test an evolutionary hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Predicting if, when, and how populations can adapt to climate change constitutes one of the greatest challenges in science today. Here, we build from contributions to the special issue on evolutionary adaptation to climate change, a survey of its authors, and recent literature to explore the limits and opportunities for predicting adaptive responses to climate change. We outline what might be predictable now, in the future, and perhaps never even with our best efforts. More accurate predictions are expected for traits characterized by a well-understood mapping between genotypes and phenotypes and traits experiencing strong, direct selection due to climate change. A meta-analysis revealed an overall moderate trait heritability and evolvability in studies performed under future climate conditions but indicated no significant change between current and future climate conditions, suggesting neither more nor less genetic variation for adapting to future climates. Predicting population persistence and evolutionary rescue remains uncertain, especially for the many species without sufficient ecological data. Still, when polled, authors contributing to this special issue were relatively optimistic about our ability to predict future evolutionary responses to climate change. Predictions will improve as we expand efforts to understand diverse organisms, their ecology, and their adaptive potential. Advancements in functional genomic resources, especially their extension to non-model species and the union of evolutionary experiments and “omics,” should also enhance predictions. Although predicting evolutionary responses to climate change remains challenging, even small advances will reduce the substantial uncertainties surrounding future evolutionary responses to climate change. Preventing biological impacts from climate change will require accurate predictions about which species and ecosystems are most at risk and how best to protect them. Despite some progress, most predictive efforts still omit the potential for evolution to mediate climate change impacts. Here, we evaluate what is predictable now, in the future, and likely never based on recent literature, a survey of authors, and authors’ contributions to a special issue on climate change evolution. Evidence indicates a growing ability to predict at least some components underlying evolutionary dynamics. For instance, the direct effects of climate change often alter natural selection regimes that could elicit evolutionary responses assuming sufficient additive genetic variation. We found no evidence for an increase or decrease in evolvability under future climate conditions, but we did find an overall moderate level of evolvability. However, the specific genetics underlying potential adaptive changes are still a “black box” that remains difficult to predict. We not only discuss the opportunities afforded by new genomic techniques to elucidate these genetic black boxes but also caution that the costs and limitations of such techniques for many species might not warrant their general practicality. We highlight further progress and challenges in predicting gene flow and population persistence, both of which can facilitate evolutionary rescue. We finish by listing ten activities that are needed to accelerate future progress in predicting climate change evolution. Despite the many complexities, we are relatively optimistic that evolutionary responses to climate change are becoming more accurate through time, especially assuming a more focused effort to fill key knowledge gaps in the coming years.},

  abstract     = {Organisms are experiencing higher average temperatures and greater temperature variability because of anthropogenic climate change. Some populations respond to changes in temperature by shifting their ranges or adjusting their phenotypes via plasticity and/or evolution, while others go extinct. Predicting how populations will respond to temperature changes is challenging because extreme and unpredictable climate changes will exert novel selective pressures. For this reason, there is a need to understand the physiological mechanisms that regulate organismal responses to temperature changes. In vertebrates, glucocorticoid hormones mediate physiological and behavioral responses to environmental stressors and thus are likely to play an important role in how vertebrates respond to global temperature changes. Glucocorticoids have cascading effects that influence the phenotype and fitness of individuals, and some of these effects can be transmitted to offspring via trans- or intergenerational effects. Consequently, glucocorticoid-mediated responses could affect populations and could even be a powerful driver of rapid evolutionary change. Here, we present a conceptual framework that outlines how temperature changes due to global climate change could affect population persistence via glucocorticoid responses within and across generations (via epigenetic modifications). We briefly review glucocorticoid physiology, the interactions between environmental temperatures and glucocorticoid responses, and the phenotypic consequences of glucocorticoid responses within and across generations. We then discuss possible hypotheses for how glucocorticoid-mediated phenotypic effects might impact fitness and population persistence via evolutionary change. Finally, we pose pressing questions to guide future research. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that underpin the responses of vertebrates to elevated temperatures will help predict population-level responses to the changing climates we are experiencing. Humans have drastically altered the global climate, resulting in extreme temperature changes. Animals may be able to tolerate temperature changes through physiological modifications. However, such physiological modifications could also affect an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce, with ultimate consequences for the persistence of populations. In vertebrate animals, hormones called glucocorticoids (known colloquially as “stress hormones”) regulate physiological responses to stressors such as extreme temperatures. Glucocorticoids also affect individual survival and reproduction and can influence future generations through inherited changes in gene expression. In these ways, glucocorticoids could be a physiological mechanism that drives evolutionary change in response to global climate change. Here, we discuss the effects of heat stress on glucocorticoid production, the effects of glucocorticoids on individuals, and how these hormone-mediated effects could span generations and affect the survival of populations.},

  abstract     = {One of the most pressing questions we face as biologists is to understand how climate change will affect the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations and how these dynamics will in turn affect population recovery. Increasing evidence shows that sexual selection favors population viability and local adaptation. However, sexual selection can also foster sexual conflict and drive the evolution of male harm to females. Male harm is extraordinarily widespread and has the potential to suppress female fitness and compromise population growth, yet we currently ignore its net effects across taxa or its influence on local adaptation and evolutionary rescue. We conducted a comparative meta-analysis to quantify the impact of male harm on female fitness and found an overall negative effect of male harm on female fitness. Negative effects seem to depend on proxies of sexual selection, increasing inversely to the female relative size and in species with strong sperm competition. We then developed theoretical models to explore how male harm affects adaptation and evolutionary rescue. We show that, when sexual conflict depends on local adaptation, population decline is reduced, but at the cost of slowing down genetic adaptation. This trade-off suggests that eco-evolutionary feedback on sexual conflict can act like a double-edged sword, reducing extinction risk by buffering the demographic costs of climate change, but delaying genetic adaptation. However, variation in the mating system and male harm type can mitigate this trade-off. Our work shows that male harm has widespread negative effects on female fitness and productivity, identifies potential mechanistic factors underlying variability in such costs across taxa, and underscores how acknowledging the condition-dependence of male harm may be important to understand the demographic and evolutionary processes that impact how species adapt to environmental change. For species to persist in the face of climate change, adaptation needs to be fast enough to prevent extinction. If population decline is too abrupt, adaptation will be less likely to promote recovery, leading to extinction. Therefore, numerous studies have sought to determine how species can adapt and escape extinction. Sexual selection can promote genetic adaptation, but often has a by-product, sexual conflict, that promotes adaptations beneficial for one sex and detrimental to the other. Such is the case of male adaptations that increase male reproduction by harming females (male harm). Male harm is widespread and has been shown to decrease female and population productivity in some species, facilitating extinction. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the degree of male harm to females depends on environmental changes and how well males are adapted to them. However, we ignore how strong the effects of sexual conflict across taxa are, or how ecological feedback on sexual conflict may affect the rate of adaptation and population recovery. Here, we first conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of male harm on female fitness and show, across taxa, that there is an overall negative effect that seems to be dependent on proxies of sexual selection. Then, we used a series of theoretical models to show that, although eco-evolutionary feedback on sexual conflict can limit population decline, this comes at the cost of slowing down the rate of adaptation and population recovery. Our study suggests that understanding how quick environmental changes affect sexual conflict can increase our understanding of how populations adapt and recover in the face of climate change.},

  abstract     = {Changes in avian breeding phenology are among the most apparent responses to climate change in free-ranging populations. A key question is whether populations will be able to keep up with the expected rates of environmental change. There is a large body of research on the mechanisms by which avian lay-dates track temperature change and the consequences of (mal)adaptation on population persistence. Often overlooked is the role of males, which can influence the lay-date of their mate through their effect on the prelaying environment. We explore how social plasticity causing male indirect genetic effects can help or hinder population persistence when female genes underpinning lay-date and male genes influencing female’s timing of reproduction both respond to climate-mediated selection. We extend quantitative genetic moving optimum models to predict the consequences of social plasticity on the maximum sustainable rate of temperature change, and evaluate our model using a combination of simulated data and empirical estimates from the literature. Our results suggest that predictions for population persistence may be biased if indirect genetic effects and cross-sex genetic correlations are not considered and that the extent of this bias depends on sex differences in how environmental change affects the optimal timing of reproduction. Our model highlights that more empirical work is needed to understand sex-specific effects of environmental change on phenology and the fitness consequences for population dynamics. While we discuss our results exclusively in the context of avian breeding phenology, the approach we take here can be generalized to many different contexts and types of social interaction. Climate change alters environmental conditions for locally adapted populations and is a main driver of declines in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Some of the strongest evidence for climate effects on wild populations comes from studies on the timing of reproduction (lay-date) in temperate birds, where lay-dates continue to advance in response to increasingly warmer springs. Understanding the factors affecting the evolutionary dynamics of laying dates is therefore crucial for predicting how populations will cope with climate change. Our study is motivated by increasing empirical evidence for indirect genetic effects of male breeding partners on female lay-dates, which suggests that evolutionary trajectories of lay-date are determined by the combined evolutionary dynamics of both members of the pair. We extend current mathematical theory to explore how social evolutionary effects can change predicted rates of climate change adaptation and the consequences this has for population persistence under constant environmental change. Our study underscores the need for empirical work to better understand how climate change affects the fitness of each sex and the degree of female plastic responses to their breeding partner phenotype.},

  abstract     = {Rates of hybridization are predicted to increase due to climate change and human activity that cause redistribution of species and bring previously isolated populations into contact. At the same time climate change leads to rapid changes in the environment, requiring populations to adapt rapidly in order to survive. A few empirical cases suggest hybridization can facilitate adaptation despite its potential for incompatibilities and deleterious fitness consequences. Here we use simulations and Fisher’s Geometric model to evaluate the conditions and time frame of adaptation via hybridization in both diploids and haplodiploids. We find that hybrids adapt faster to new environments compared to parental populations in nearly all simulated scenarios, generating a fitness advantage that can offset intrinsic incompatibilities and last for tens of generations, regardless of whether the population was diploid or haplodiploid. Our results highlight the creative role of hybridization and suggest that hybridization may help contemporary populations adapt to the changing climate. However, adaptation by hybrids may well happen at the cost of reduced biodiversity, if previously isolated lineages collapse into one. Climate change causes rapid changes in the environment and in order to adapt, natural populations need genetic variation. In this article we highlight one potential route to rapid adaptation: hybridization with a related lineage. In contrast to standing genetic variation or new mutations, hybridization between populations with a history of adaptation instantaneously increases genetic variation at numerous loci with variants already proven functional in another genomic background. We simulated adaptation in a novel environment forward in time for traits that have a polygenic basis (i.e., multiple genes underlie the trait), while varying the history of parental adaptation. Our results show that hybrids adapt faster than parental populations in most of our simulated scenarios, except when parental populations have experienced the new environment in their recent past. In some of the previous literature, deleterious consequences of hybridization are emphasized and hybrid fitness is measured in parental environment(s), where parents are fit and hybrids unfit. However, upon rapid environmental change, like that under climate change, parental environment may no longer exist and both parents and hybrids need to adapt to the novel environment.},

  abstract     = {Investigating how climate change alters selection regimes is a crucial step toward understanding the potential of populations to evolve in the face of changing conditions. Previous studies have mainly focused on understanding how changing climate directly influences selection, while the role of species’ interactions has received little attention. Here, we used a transplant experiment along an elevation gradient to estimate how climate warming and competitive interactions lead to shifts in directional phenotypic selection on morphology and phenology of four alpine plants. We found that warming generally imposed novel selection, with the largest shifts in regimes acting on specific leaf area and flowering time across species. Competitors instead weakened the selection acting on traits that was imposed directly by warming. Weakened or absent selection in the presence of competitors was largely associated with the suppression of absolute means and variation of fitness. Our results suggest that although climate change can impose strong selection, competitive interactions within communities might act to limit selection and thereby stymie evolutionary responses in alpine plants facing climate change. Climate change can alter the strength and direction of natural selection acting on plant populations. This could be caused both directly by changing climate itself and indirectly by changes to the way that species interact with each other in ecological communities. The ability of species to adapt in response to these novel selection regimes might be crucial for their persistence in future environments. An important first step toward a better understanding of how species may evolve is to investigate how changing climate and species’ interactions alter selection. To this end, we transplanted four alpine plant species along an elevational gradient in the Swiss Alps to simulate possible future scenarios in which alpine plants experience climate warming either in the absence or presence of competitors. We estimated the impact of warming and competitors on selection acting on stalk height, specific leaf area, floral size, and flowering time. We found that climate warming mainly introduced new selection pressures on alpine plants, for example, by favoring individuals with smaller specific leaf area and earlier flowering. However, competitors limited selection imposed by climate warming, mainly by suppressing fitness. More generally, our study highlights how biotic interactions, such as those with competitors, can play an important role in shaping the ability of species to experience, and potentially respond to, selection imposed by climate change.},

  abstract     = {Climates are changing rapidly, demanding equally rapid adaptation of natural populations. Whether sexual selection can aid such adaptation is under debate; while sexual selection should promote adaptation when individuals with high mating success are also best adapted to their local surroundings, the expression of sexually selected traits can incur costs. Here we asked what the demographic consequences of such costs may be once climates change to become harsher and the strength of natural selection increases. We first adopted a classic life history theory framework, incorporating a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance, and applied it to the male germline to generate formalized predictions for how an evolutionary history of strong postcopulatory sexual selection (sperm competition) may affect male fertility under acute adult heat stress. We then tested these predictions by assessing the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) in replicated lineages of seed beetles maintained for 68 generations under three alternative mating regimes manipulating the opportunity for sexual and natural selection. In line with the theoretical predictions, we find that males evolving under strong sexual selection suffer from increased TSF. Interestingly, females from the regime under strong sexual selection, who experienced relaxed selection on their own reproductive effort, had high fertility in benign settings but suffered increased TSF, like their brothers. This implies that female fertility and TSF evolved through genetic correlation with reproductive traits sexually selected in males. Paternal but not maternal heat stress reduced offspring fertility with no evidence for adaptive transgenerational plasticity among heat-exposed offspring, indicating that the observed effects may compound over generations. Our results suggest that trade-offs between fertility and traits increasing success in postcopulatory sexual selection can be revealed in harsh environments. This can put polyandrous species under immediate risk during extreme heat waves expected under future climate change. How will populations respond to a warming world? Of increasing concern are the negative effects of elevated temperatures on fertility, which in many species are observed for temperatures substantially lower than the ones causing death. Incorporating knowledge on species-specific thermal fertility limits has improved estimates of current species’ ranges but renders a more pessimistic view of the potential for adaptive responses under climate change. Sexual selection is a process that can interact with the thermal sensitivity of fertility and is strongest in males of polyandrous species, in which females mate multiply and sperm of multiple males compete for fertilization of female eggs. Therefore, males of polyandrous species often invest heavily in sperm competition. However, given finite resources, increased investment in sperm competition can come at an expense of other processes needed to maintain the integrity of the male germline, which when compromised can reduce fertility and offspring quality. How may such male investment, fueled by sexual selection, affect species’ responses to climate warming? To address this question, we first evolved populations under different laboratory settings that independently manipulated the levels of natural and sexual selection. We exposed adults from these populations to acute heat stress and measured the fertility of males and females. We find that sexual selection on males leads to a fertility debt that is revealed under heat stress. This debt was also apparent in females, who themselves were not selected for increased reproductive investment. Thus, genes under sexual selection in males seem to have impaired fertility in both sexes under heat stress. Forecasts of species’ response to climate change that do not incorporate thermal fertility limits and sexual selection may therefore underestimate species’ vulnerability to increasing temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Species are altering their ranges as a response to climate change, but the magnitude and direction of observed range shifts vary considerably among species. The ability to persist in current areas and colonize new areas plays a crucial role in determining which species will thrive and which decline as climate change progresses. Several studies have sought to identify characteristics, such as morphological and life-history traits, that could explain differences in the capability of species to shift their ranges together with a changing climate. These characteristics have explained variation in range shifts only sporadically, thus offering an uncertain tool for discerning responses among species. As long-term selection to past climates have shaped species’ tolerances, metrics describing species’ contemporary climatic niches may provide an alternative means for understanding responses to on-going climate change. Species that occur in a broader range of climatic conditions may hold greater tolerance to climatic variability and could therefore more readily maintain their historical ranges, while species with more narrow tolerances may only persist if they are able to shift in space to track their climatic niche. Here, we provide a first-filter test of the effect of climatic niche dimensions on shifts in the leading range edges in three relatively well-dispersing species groups. Based on the realized changes in the northern range edges of 383 moth, butterfly, and bird species across a boreal 1,100 km latitudinal gradient over c. 20 years, we show that while most morphological or life-history traits were not strongly connected with range shifts, moths and birds occupying a narrower thermal niche and butterflies occupying a broader moisture niche across their European distribution show stronger shifts towards the north. Our results indicate that the climatic niche may be important for predicting responses under climate change and as such warrants further investigation of potential mechanistic underpinnings. Over time, species have evolved to live in specific environments, and climatic conditions provide some of the most important boundaries for species’ ranges. As climate changes, temperatures tend to increase and precipitation regimes change, whereby the conditions where species currently occur will also change. If species have evolved to tolerate climate variability, they may persist by staying in place and withstanding the changing environmental conditions. However, if they are highly selective in their climate niche preferences, they may be more likely to move in space , together with the climatic conditions that match their specific requirements. On the other hand, generalists may be able to colonize new areas more effectively, in addition to adjusting in place. Thus, which option is more readily available to a species might be predictable by measuring the variability in climatic conditions across the species’ current, realized niche. Using distribution data on 383 species, we calculated the mean and breadth of climatic conditions that the species occupy within Europe. We found that the breadth of species’ climatic niche is a strong predictor of range shifts observed in Finland, northern Europe, over the past 20 years. Moths and birds that have adapted to a narrow range of temperatures are moving northward, while those tolerating a wider range of temperatures are staying put. Butterfly range shifts, however, seemed connected to broader moisture niches. Our results indicate that past evolutionary processes that have formed a continuum of species that differ in their climatic tolerance, may currently dictate how species respond to rapid anthropogenic climate change. Species’ flexibility vs. selectivity for climatic conditions may thus provide a key to understanding both observed and future range shifts.},

  abstract     = {Due to global change, many species are shifting their distribution and are thereby confronted with novel thermal conditions at the moving range edges. Especially during the initial phases of exposure to a new environment, it has been hypothesized that plasticity and associated epigenetic mechanisms enable species to cope with environmental change. We tested this idea by capitalizing on the well-documented southward range expansion of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from France into Spain where the species invaded warmer regions in the 1950s in eastern Spain (old edge region) and in the 2010s in central Spain (new edge region). Using a common garden experiment at rearing temperatures matching the ancestral and invaded thermal regimes, we tested for evolutionary changes in (thermal plasticity in) larval life history and heat tolerance in these expansion zones. Through the use of de- and hypermethylating agents, we tested whether epigenetic mechanisms play a role in enabling heat tolerance during expansion. We used the phenotype of the native sister species in Spain, I. graellsii , as proxy for the locally adapted phenotype. New edge populations converged toward the phenotype of the native species through plastic thermal responses in life history and heat tolerance while old edge populations (partly) constitutively evolved a faster life history and higher heat tolerance than the core populations, thereby matching the native species. Only the heat tolerance of new edge populations increased significantly when exposed to the hypermethylating agent. This suggests that the DNA methylation machinery is more amenable to perturbation at the new edge and shows it is able to play a role in achieving a higher heat tolerance. Our results show that both (evolved) plasticity as well as associated epigenetic mechanisms are initially important when facing new thermal regimes but that their importance diminishes with time. Climate change is confronting species with new conditions, yet it remains a key uncertainty of what processes underlie successful responses to cope with novel thermal regimes. Plasticity is considered to be especially important during the initial phases of exposure to a new environment, while evolution is assumed to act in the longer term. The many range expansions whereby species encounter new thermal conditions provide powerful ‘natural experiments’ to study these processes ‘in action’. We capitalized on the range expansion of a damselfly from France into a warmer region in Spain. This allowed to compare French core populations that are the source of the expansion with new edge populations and with old edge populations. The latter has been the longest exposed to the new thermal regime. We used the phenotype of the native sister species in Spain as a proxy for the locally adapted phenotype. Using a common garden experiment at rearing temperatures matching the ancestral and invaded thermal regimes, we tested how plasticity and evolution contribute to larval life history and heat tolerance changes in these expansion zones. New edge populations became more similar to the phenotype of the native species through plastic thermal responses in life history and heat tolerance while old edge populations (partly) evolved a faster life history and higher heat tolerance toward the phenotype of the native species (i.e., at both rearing temperatures). Our results also suggest that epigenetic mechanisms (i.c., DNA methylation) are able to play a role in achieving a higher heat tolerance in new edge populations. Our results provide unique insights into how populations adapt to new environments and support the theory that both (evolved) plasticity as well as associated epigenetic mechanisms are initially important when facing new thermal regimes but that their importance diminishes with time whereby evolution gets more important.},

  abstract     = {Phenotypic plasticity is often posited as an avenue for adaptation to environmental change, whereby environmental influences on phenotypes could shift trait expression toward new optimal values. Conversely, plastic trait expression may inhibit adaptation to environmental change by reducing selective pressure on ill-adapted traits. While plastic responses are often assumed to be linear, nonlinear phenotype–environment relationships are common, especially in thermally sensitive traits. Here we examine nonlinear plasticity in a trait with great ecological and evolutionary significance: sexual phenotype in species with environmental sex determination (ESD). In species with ESD, development switches between male and female at an environmental threshold (the inflection point). The inflection point is a key trait for adaptive responses to changing environments and should evolve toward the new optimum in order to maintain evolutionarily stable sex ratios. We used an individual-based theoretical model to investigate how two forms of plasticity in the ESD reaction norm—the nonlinear slope of the reaction norm and a linear shift in the inflection point—influence the evolution of the inflection point under climate warming. We found that steeper reaction norm slopes (high nonlinear plasticity) promoted evolution toward new optimal phenotypes (higher inflection points). In contrast, increased linear plasticity in the inflection point (shift) hindered adaptive evolution. Additionally, populations in moderate warming scenarios showed greater adaptive evolution of the inflection point compared with populations in extreme warming scenarios, suggesting that the proximity of existing phenotypes to new optimal phenotypes influences evolutionary outcomes. Unexpectedly, we found greater population persistence under high climate variability, due to the increased production of rare-sex individuals in unusually cold years. Our results demonstrate that different forms of phenotypic plasticity have crucially different effects on adaptive evolution. Plasticity that prevented sex ratio bias hindered the evolution of the inflection point, while plasticity that exacerbated sex ratio bias promoted adaptation to environmental change. Trait variation in response to the environment, known as phenotypic plasticity, is common among living organisms and likely contributes to survival in variable environments. However, little is known about how plasticity in response to environmental upheaval, such as that caused by anthropogenic climate change, could influence evolution in the long term. This is especially true of traits where the relationship between phenotype and environment is not linear, that is, a change in environment does not result in a proportional trait change. We created a computer simulation to examine differences in how linear and nonlinear plasticity influence the evolution of plastic traits in a changing environment. We used an ecologically important plastic trait—sex (male/female) in species with environmental sex determination (ESD)—as a model for our investigation. Many reptiles, fish, and invertebrates display ESD, and while this form of sex determination can be advantageous, environmental change could put these species at risk. We found that nonlinear and linear plasticity can have different effects on adaptation to novel environments. The range of phenotypes that a trait with nonlinear plasticity can produce changes across environments, and as a result, nonlinear plasticity that provides a benefit in a species’ normal range can become disadvantageous in an extreme environment. In contrast, in traits with linear plasticity, phenotype varies consistently with the environment, making changes in fitness outcome less likely. In our simulation, these differences led nonlinear plasticity to increase sex ratio bias in extreme environments, promoting the adaptive evolution of ESD. Linear plasticity balanced sex ratios, which hindered adaptation. This is an important result in understanding evolutionary responses to climate change, as many thermally sensitive traits have nonlinear relationships with temperature. Additionally, rising temperatures could reveal new nonlinear plasticity, as linear trait–environment relationships become less consistent under extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Because of ongoing rapid climate change, many ecosystems are becoming both warmer and more variable, and these changes are likely to alter the magnitude and variability of natural selection acting on wild populations. Critically, changes and fluctuations in selection can impact both population demography and evolutionary change. Therefore, predicting the impacts of climate change depends on understanding the magnitude and variation in selection on traits across different life stages and environments. Long-term experiments in wild settings are a great opportunity to determine the impact of environmental conditions on selection. Here we examined variability in the strength of selection on size traits of nestling black-legged kittiwakes ( Rissa tridactyla ) in a 25-year study including a food supplementation experiment on Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Using mixed effect models, we examined the annual variability of stage-specific and resource-specific selection gradients across 25 years. We found that (a) larger and heavier hatchlings were the most likely to survive during early ontogeny, (b) non-food supplemented younger nestlings in a brood experienced the strongest selection, and (c) warmer conditions increased the magnitude of selection on nestling mass and affected non-food supplemented and second-hatched nestlings the most. Our results suggested that variable resource dynamics likely caused some of the changes in selection from year to year and that warming conditions increased the strength of selection on subarctic seabird growth. However, our experimental manipulation revealed that local environmental heterogeneity could buffer the selection expected from broader climatic changes. Consequently, understanding the interactive effects of local conditions and general changes in climate seems likely to improve our ability to predict future selection gradients. Measuring natural selection in wild populations is necessary to (a) determine which phenotypes result in improved reproduction and survival, (b) determine which individuals are likely to be removed from the population, and (c) make evolutionary predictions. However, climate change is thought to be changing natural selection in a wide variety of environments across the globe. Differences in environmental conditions mean that some populations are likely to experience stronger changes in natural selection than others under climate change. Local differences in natural selection could mean that some populations will be more affected by changes induced by climate change. In this study, we use data from a long-term experimental study of black-legged kittiwakes ( Rissa tridactyla ) to compare strength and variation in natural selection on nestling size traits between experimentally fed nestlings and unfed nestlings, among nestlings at different ages, and between first and second-hatched nestlings in a nest. We evaluated (a) whether natural food conditions and later hatching rank increased the strength and variation of selection experienced by nestlings, and (b) whether climatic variation correlated with selection on nestlings. We found that natural selection was strongest early in life and that it was consistent in direction, such that heavier nestlings were more likely to survive to the next age category. Selection was strongest on second-hatched nestlings and nestlings that did not receive food supplementation. Warmer climatic conditions increased the strength of selection on nestling mass, and non-food supplemented and second-hatched nestlings experienced the strongest changes in selection under warmer conditions. Therefore, warming climatic conditions have the potential to change natural selection acting on groups within a population differently. These findings indicate the importance of considering the interaction among climate change, life stage, and competition when trying to understand changes in natural selection associated with climate change in wild populations.},

  abstract     = {Rapid evolutionary adaptation could reduce the negative impacts of climate change if sufficient heritability of key traits exists under future climate conditions. Plastic responses to climate change could also reduce negative impacts. Understanding which populations are likely to respond via evolution or plasticity could therefore improve estimates of extinction risk. A large body of research suggests that the evolutionary and plastic potential of a population can be predicted by the degree of spatial and temporal climatic variation it experiences. However, we know little about the scale at which these relationships apply. Here, we test if spatial and temporal variation in temperature affects genetic variation and plasticity of fitness and a key thermal tolerance trait (critical thermal maximum; CT max ) at microgeographic scales using a metapopulation of Daphnia magna in freshwater rock pools. Specifically, we ask if (a) there is a microgeographic adaptation of CT max and fitness to differences in temperature among the pools, (b) pools with greater temporal temperature variation have more genetic variation or plasticity in CT max or fitness, and (c) increases in temperature affect the heritability of CT max and fitness. Although we observed genetic variation and plasticity in CT max and fitness, and differences in fitness among pools, we did not find support for the predicted relationships between temperature variation and genetic variation or plasticity. Furthermore, the genetic variation and plasticity we observed in CT max are unlikely sufficient to reduce the impacts of climate change. CT max plasticity was minimal and heritability was 72% lower when D. magna developed at the higher temperatures predicted under climate change. In contrast, the heritability of fitness increased by 53% under warmer temperatures, suggesting an increase in overall evolutionary potential unrelated to CT max under climate change. More research is needed to understand the evolutionary and plastic potential under climate change and how that potential will be altered in future climates. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, scientists predict the extinction of nearly 1 million species. However, the accuracy of those predictions is highly debated because studies estimating extinction risk often ignore important aspects of biology. For example, most studies exclude the ability for a species’ climatic tolerances to evolve or change through a nonevolutionary process called plasticity, despite ample evidence for these processes in nature. Understanding which populations are likely to respond via evolution or plasticity could therefore improve extinction-risk estimates and help guide conservation resources to the most vulnerable populations. At large spatial scales (e.g., temperate versus tropical locations), the evolutionary and plastic potential of a population can often be predicted by the degree of spatial and temporal climatic variation the population experiences. These relationships offer a promising avenue to predict evolutionary and plastic potential at the smaller spatial scales necessary to accurately estimate extinction risk. Here, we test if relationships between climatic variation and evolutionary or plastic potential apply at fine spatial scales (e.g., populations just meters apart). Although we observed evolutionary and plastic potential within our focal metapopulation, we did not observe the predicted relationships with climatic variation. Furthermore, we observed conflicting results about how evolutionary potential is likely to change under climate change. Evolutionary potential decreased by 72% for an important thermal tolerance trait, but increased by 53% for fitness when our focal species was exposed to potential future climates. In order to accurately predict extinction risk under climate change, more research is needed to understand evolutionary and plastic potential and how those factors will change in the future.},

  abstract     = {Short-term adaptive evolution represents one of the primary mechanisms allowing species to persist in the face of global change. Predicting the adaptive response at the species level requires reliable estimates of the evolutionary potential of traits involved in adaptive responses, as well as understanding how evolutionary potential varies across a species’ range. Theory suggests that spatial variation in the fitness landscape due to environmental variation will directly impact the evolutionary potential of traits. However, empirical evidence on the link between environmental variation and evolutionary potential across a species range in the wild is lacking. In this study, we estimate multivariate evolutionary potential (via the genetic variance–covariance matrix, or G-matrix) for six morphological and life history traits in 10 wild populations of great tits ( Parus major ) distributed across Europe. The G-matrix significantly varies in size, shape, and orientation across populations for both types of traits. For life history traits, the differences in G-matrix are larger when populations are more distant in their climatic niche. This suggests that local climates contribute to shaping the evolutionary potential of phenotypic traits that are strongly related to fitness. However, we found no difference in the overall evolutionary potential (i.e., G-matrix size) between populations closer to the core or the edge of the distribution area. This large-scale comparison of G-matrices across wild populations emphasizes that integrating variation in multivariate evolutionary potential is important to understand and predict species’ adaptive responses to new selective pressures. Adaptive evolution of phenotypes is a key mechanism for species persistence in the face of global change, and predicting these responses is a major challenge to implementing biodiversity scenarios. The quality of these predictions relies notably on our estimates of evolutionary potential, and several questions need to be answered: How different is evolutionary potential across a species distribution? Will it change under new environmental conditions? Can we use information on evolutionary potential from one population to infer adaptive responses in another population? Here we address these questions in the great tit ( Parus major ) by evaluating how evolutionary potential is influenced by climatic conditions across the species’ range. Our study is based on the long-term monitoring of 10 wild populations of great tits distributed across Europe for which information about life history and morphological traits have been collected. We find significant differences in evolutionary potential between populations for both categories of traits, and for life history traits, these differences are linked to population differences in climatic conditions. These results show that evolutionary potential is not a “one-size-fits-all” measure and that its variation needs to be taken into account when predicting adaptive responses to climate change.},

  abstract     = {The recognition that climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate means that there is increased urgency in understanding how organisms can adapt to a changing environment. Wild great tit ( Parus major ) populations represent an attractive ecological model system to understand the genomics of climate adaptation. They are widely distributed across Eurasia and they have been documented to respond to climate change. We performed a Bayesian genome-environment analysis, by combining local climate data with single nucleotide polymorphisms genotype data from 20 European populations (broadly spanning the species’ continental range). We found 36 genes putatively linked to adaptation to climate. Following an enrichment analysis of biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms, we identified over-represented terms and pathways among the candidate genes. Because many different genes and GO terms are associated with climate variables, it seems likely that climate adaptation is polygenic and genetically complex. Our findings also suggest that geographical climate adaptation has been occurring since great tits left their Southern European refugia at the end of the last ice age. Finally, we show that substantial climate-associated genetic variation remains, which will be essential for adaptation to future changes.},

  abstract     = {In the context of rapid climate change, phenological advance is a key adaptation for which evidence is accumulating across taxa. Among vertebrates, phenotypic plasticity is known to underlie most of this phenological change, while evidence for micro-evolution is very limited and challenging to obtain. In this study, we quantified phenotypic and genetic trends in timing of spring migration using 8,032 dates of arrival at the breeding grounds obtained from observations on 1,715 individual common terns ( Sterna hirundo ) monitored across 27 years, and tested whether these trends were consistent with predictions of a micro-evolutionary response to selection. We observed a strong phenotypic advance of 9.3 days in arrival date, of which c. 5% was accounted for by an advance in breeding values. The Breeder’s equation and Robertson’s Secondary Theorem of Selection predicted qualitatively similar evolutionary responses to selection, and these theoretical predictions were largely consistent with our estimated genetic pattern. Overall, our study provides rare evidence for micro-evolution underlying (part of) an adaptive response to climate change in the wild, and illustrates how a combination of adaptive micro-evolution and phenotypic plasticity facilitated a shift towards earlier spring migration in this free-living population of common terns. Empirical evidence for evolutionary change underlying vertebrate adaptation to current global change is very rare. This may be due to phenotypic plasticity being the main mechanism underlying adaptation, or to challenges associated with the empirical testing of genetic changes in the wild, in particular data limitations. In this study, we tested whether an observed phenotypic advance in the timing of arrival from spring migration in a wild seabird population was due to an evolutionary response (i.e., genetic change) and/or to phenotypic plasticity or other non-genetic effects. To do so, we applied a bivariate “animal model” to a 27-year data set from a pedigreed population of common terns located at the North Sea coast of Germany. We found an evolutionary response to selection favoring earlier arriving individuals. Additionally, we could show that two different theoretical models predict a qualitatively similar evolutionary response as the one we estimated, both in terms of direction and magnitude. As such, our study provides a rare empirical case where estimated and predicted evolutionary responses agree, and suggests an evolutionary response in the timing of avian spring migration, although it played a smaller role than phenotypic plasticity in the common tern response to rapid climate change. Overall, these findings show the use of disentangling the relative, and often complementary, contributions of plastic and evolutionary changes to better understand adaptive processes and predict responses to future changes.},

  abstract     = {When the notion of climate change emerged over 200 years ago, few speculated as to the impact of rising atmospheric temperatures on biological life. Tens of decades later, research clearly demonstrates that the impact of climate change on life on Earth is enormous, ongoing, and with foreseen effects lasting well into the next century. Responses to climate change have been widely documented. However, the breadth of phenotypic traits involved with evolutionary adaptation to climate change remains unclear. In addition, it is difficult to identify the genetic and/or epigenetic bases of phenotypes adaptive to climate change, in part because it often is not clear whether this change is plastic, genetic, or some combination of the two. Adaptive responses to climate-driven selection also interact with other processes driving genetic changes in general, including demography as well as selection driven by other factors. In this Special Issue, we explore the factors that will impact the overall outcome of climate change adaptation. Our contributions explain that traits involved in climate change adaptation include not only classic phenomena, such as range shifts and environmentally dependent sex determination, but also often overlooked phenomena such as social and sexual conflicts and the expression of stress hormones. We learn how climate-driven selection can be mediated via both natural and sexual selection, effectively influencing key fitness-related traits such as offspring growth and fertility as well as evolutionary potential. Finally, we explore the limits and opportunities for predicting adaptive responses to climate change. This contribution forms the basis of 10 actions that we believe will improve predictions of when and how organisms may adapt genetically to climate change. We anticipate that this Special Issue will inform novel investigations into how the effects of climate change unfold from phenotypes to genotypes, particularly as methodologies increasingly allow researchers to study selection in field experiments. What are the major factors driving evolutionary adaptation to climate change? How can we harness this understanding to better predict how populations can adapt to a rapidly changing climate? The urgency of answering these questions is critical as more than a million species are currently directly facing the risk of extinction due to climate-driven environmental change. This puts research exploring processes and mechanisms that affect evolutionary rescue at the core of mounting a global response to the current climate crisis. Here, we highlight key contributions that collectively demonstrate the breadth of evolutionary responses that organisms exhibit in response to climate change, including classic responses (e.g., range shifts, plasticity, and evolutionary responses), but also less conspicuous phenomena such as social and sexual conflicts. Some contributions go right to the heart of understanding the genetic and epigenetic bases of the observed responses, ultimately linking the environmental effects to the genotype–phenotype map. Other contributions investigate the interplay between different types of selection with climate-driven selection in facilitating or hindering evolutionary adaptation, a major uncertainty that has been the focus of evolutionary research for a long time. These are pressing issues that require a deep understanding of processes that determine our ability to predict evolutionary outcomes of ongoing climate change. The final contribution of the Special Issue therefore explores the limits and opportunities for predicting adaptive responses to climate change. It builds on all the contributions of the Special Issue, and the viewpoints of many of their authors, to provide a road map for how we might be able to improve predictions with our current knowledge and what might be possible to predict in the future. We anticipate that this Special Issue will ignite investigations of how the effects of climate change unfold from phenotypes to genotypes and the selective forces that produce evolutionary rescue in response to climate change.},
