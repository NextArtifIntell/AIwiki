  abstract = {Over the past two decades, following the early developments on maximally localized Wannier functions, an ecosystem of electronic-structure simulation techniques and software packages leveraging the Wannier representation has flourished. This environment includes codes to obtain Wannier functions and interfaces with first-principles simulation software, as well as an increasing number of related postprocessing packages. Wannier functions can be obtained for isolated or extended systems (both crystalline and disordered) and can be used to understand chemical bonding; to characterize electric polarization, magnetization, and topology; and as an optimal basis set, providing accurate interpolations in reciprocal space or large-scale Hamiltonians in real space. This review summarizes the current landscape of techniques, materials properties, and simulation codes based on Wannier functions that have been made accessible to the research community and that are now well integrated into what is referred to as a Wannier-function software ecosystem. To begin, the theory and practicalities of Wannier functions, starting with their broad domains of applicability to advanced minimization methods using alternative approaches beyond maximal localization, are introduced. The concept of a Wannier ecosystem and its interactions and interoperability with many quantum simulations engines and postprocessing packages are then defined. The review focuses on some of the key properties and capabilities that are empowered by such an ecosystem (from band interpolations and large-scale simulations to electronic transport, Berryology, topology, electron-phonon couplings, dynamical mean-field theory, embedding, and Koopmans functionals) and concludes with the current status of interoperability and automation. The review aims at highlighting the basic theory and concepts behind codes while providing mentions of more in-depth references. It also elucidates the relationships and connections between codes and, where relevant, the different motivations and objectives behind their development strategies. Finally, an outlook on future developments is provided and comments are made on the goals of biodiversity and sustainability for the entire software ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The simplicity of hard spheres as a model system is deceptive. Although the particles interact solely through volume exclusion, that nevertheless suffices for a wealth of static and dynamical phenomena to emerge, making the model an important target for achieving a comprehensive understanding of matter. In addition, while real colloidal suspensions are typically governed by complex interactions, Pusey and Van Megen [Nature 320 , 340 (1986)] demonstrated that suitably tuned suspensions result in hard-sphere-like behavior, thus bringing a valuable experimental complement to the renowned theoretical model. Colloidal hard spheres are thus both a material in their own right and a platform upon which phenomena exhibited by simple materials can be explored in great detail. The various purposes enable a particular synergy between experiment, theory, and computer simulation. The extensive body of work on colloidal hard spheres, which ranges from their equilibrium properties, such as phase behavior, interfaces, and confinement, to some of the nonequilibrium phenomena they exhibit, such as sedimentation, glass formation, and nucleation, is reviewed here.},

However, a PT -symmetric Hamiltonian can also define a physically acceptable quantum-mechanical system even if the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian. The study of PT -symmetric quantum systems is a young and extremely active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics. The purpose of this review is to provide established scientists as well as graduate students with a compact, easy-to-read introduction to this field that will enable them to understand more advanced publications and to begin their own theoretical or experimental research activity. The ideas and techniques of PT symmetry have been applied in the context of many different branches of physics. This review introduces the concepts of PT symmetry by focusing on elementary one-dimensional PT -symmetric quantum and classical mechanics and relies, in particular, on oscillator models to illustrate and explain the basic properties of PT -symmetric quantum theory.},

This review discusses such an impressive advance, from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. The review commences by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. The opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers are examined. The core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN and DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, and ICARUS) for the observation of rare events are then delved into. The review concludes by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, and all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology’s scope toward novel research fields.},

  abstract = {Cell growth and gene expression, two essential elements of all living systems, have long been the focus of biophysical interrogation. Advances in experimental single-cell methods have invigorated theoretical studies into these processes. However, until recently there was little dialogue between the two areas of study. In particular, most theoretical models for gene regulation assumed gene activity to be oblivious to the progression of the cell cycle between birth and division. But in fact there are numerous ways in which the periodic character of all cellular observables can modulate gene expression. The molecular factors required for transcription and translation [ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, transcription factors, and ribosomes] increase in number during the cell cycle but are also diluted due to the continuous increase in cell volume. The replication of the genome changes the dosage of those same cellular players but also provides competing targets for regulatory binding. Finally, cell division reduces their number again, and so forth. Stochasticity is inherent to all of these biological processes, manifested in fluctuations in the synthesis and degradation of new cellular components as well as the random partitioning of molecules at each cell division event. The notion of gene expression as stationary is thus difficult to justify. In this review, the emerging paradigm of cell-cycle coupled gene expression is surveyed, with an emphasis on the global expression patterns rather than gene-specific regulation. Recent experimental reports where cell growth and gene expression were simultaneously measured in individual cells are discussed, providing first glimpses into the coupling between the two and prompting several questions. How do the levels of gene expression products (messenger RNA and protein) scale with the cell volume and cell-cycle progression? What are the molecular origins of the observed scaling laws, and when do they break down to yield noncanonical behavior? What are the consequences of cell-cycle dependence for the heterogeneity (“noise”) in gene expression within a cell population? While the experimental findings differ among genes, organisms, and environmental conditions, several theoretical models have emerged that attempt to reconcile these differences and form a unifying framework for understanding gene expression in growing cells.},

  abstract = {Ultrahigh dose rate, FLASH radiotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising innovations over the past decade in the field of radiation oncology, with the potential to eradicate radiation resistant primary tumors and improve the therapeutic outcome for cancer patients. FLASH is based on delivering radiation doses at ultrahigh dose rates (UHDR; &gt; 4 0 Gy / s ), more than 1000 times faster than irradiation at conventional dose rates (CONV). The experimental evidence demonstrating the differential effect of dose rate modulation on tumors and normal tissue is reviewed. Preclinical data consistently show that the antitumor efficacy of cytotoxic doses is not dependent on dose rate, but in normal tissues UHDR significantly reduces normal tissue toxicities compared to CONV, as observed in vivo . These observations define the FLASH effect. The FLASH effect has been reported to occur when using single or hypofractionated dose regimens in several experimental animal models (mice, rat, zebrafish, pig, and cats) and in multiple organs (lung, skin, gut, and brain) by numerous groups worldwide. Note that the FLASH effect has been demonstrated with electron, photon, and hadron (proton and heavier ion) beams. The current status and future technological development are reviewed, with an emphasis on critical beam parameters, future beam modalities, and prerequisites for safe clinical translation in terms of dosimetry, radioprotection, and treatment planning systems. Mechanistic investigations at the physicochemical and biological levels are presented, as are strategies to support and initiate clinical translation. This comprehensive review provides multidisciplinary radiation scientists with a road map of the technological, physical, chemical, biological, and clinical considerations that have made FLASH topical. These considerations are presented with a realistic and practical backdrop of the limitations and challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {Active systems are driven out of equilibrium by exchanging energy and momentum with their environment. This endows them with anomalous mechanical properties that are reviewed in this Colloquium. The case of dry scalar active matter is considered, which encompasses systems whose large-scale behaviors are entirely captured by their density—a scalar field. Arguably the simplest of active-matter systems, they have attracted considerable attention due to their unusual properties when put in contact with boundaries, inclusions, tracers, or disordered potentials. Indeed, studies of the mechanical pressure of active fluids and of the dynamics of passive tracers have shown that active systems impact their environment in nontrivial ways, for example, by propelling and rotating anisotropic inclusions. Conversely, the long-range density and current modulations induced by localized obstacles show how the environment can have a far-reaching impact on active fluids. This is best exemplified by the propensity of bulk and boundary disorder to destroy bulk phase separation in active matter, thereby showing active systems to be much more sensitive to their surroundings than passive ones. This Colloquium aims to provide a unifying perspective on the rich interplay between active systems and their environments.},

  abstract = {Thermally driven turbulent flows are omnipresent in nature and technology. A good understanding of the physical principles governing such flows is key for numerous problems in oceanography, climatology, geophysics, and astrophysics for problems involving energy conversion, heating and cooling of buildings and rooms, and process technology. In the physics community, the most popular system to study wall-bounded thermally driven turbulence has been Rayleigh-Bénard flow, i.e., the flow in a box heated from below and cooled from above. The dimensionless control parameters are the Rayleigh number Ra (the dimensionless heating strength), the Prandtl number Pr (the ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity), and the aspect ratio of the container. The key response parameters are the Nusselt number Nu (the dimensionless heat flux from the bottom to the top) and the Reynolds number Re (the dimensionless strength of the turbulent flow). While there is good agreement and understanding of the dependences up to (the “classical regime”), for even larger Ra in the so-called ultimate regime of Rayleigh-Bénard convection the experimental results and their interpretations are more diverse. The transition of the flow to this ultimate regime, which is characterized by strongly enhanced heat transfer, is due to the transition of laminar-type flow in the boundary layers to turbulent-type flow. Understanding this transition is of the utmost importance for extrapolating the heat transfer to large or strongly thermally driven systems. Here the theoretical results on this transition to the ultimate regime are reviewed and an attempt is made to reconcile the various experimental and numerical results. The transition toward the ultimate regime is interpreted as a non-normal–nonlinear and thus subcritical transition. Experimental and numerical strategies are suggested that can help to further illuminate the transition to the ultimate regime and the ultimate regime itself, for which a modified model for the scaling laws in its various subregimes is proposed. Similar transitions in related wall-bounded turbulent flows such as turbulent convection with centrifugal buoyancy and Taylor-Couette turbulence are also discussed.},

This interest was solidified by my mentor, Arnold Schmidt, and deepened by Paul Corkum, during the 1990s in Vienna. They have influenced my path most profoundly. It has been a tremendous privilege to stand on the shoulders of scientists, including many Nobel laureates, who made seminal contributions to our understanding of electrons and light, when walking the path to exploring sub-atomic motions.

In matter, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect, due to neutrino interactions with the background particles, triggers resonant flavor modification. In dense environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and compact mergers, sizable neutrino-neutrino interactions, shock waves, and turbulence impact the neutrino flavor content under a variety of phenomena. Theoretical approaches of neutrino propagation range from the mean-field approximation to the full quantum kinetic equations. Interesting connections have been uncovered between weakly interacting dense neutrino gases and other many-body systems and domains, from condensed matter and nuclear physics to quantum computing. Besides the intrinsic theoretical interest, establishing how neutrinos change flavor contributes to answering the long-standing open questions of how massive stars explode and of the r -process sites. It is also important for future observations of core-collapse supernova neutrinos and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background that should be discovered in the foreseeable future.},

  abstract = {New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often surprising forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the past decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. This review presents a two-pronged investigation into such superconductors, with an emphasis on those that have come to be understood to belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. The nature of this “crossover” superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases, is a focus here. Multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime are addressed in the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. Such developments should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory, as it is now clear that, even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can be extended in a natural way to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. In particular, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.},

  abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) relates to the interaction between an electron’s motion and its spin and is ubiquitous in solid-state systems. Although the effect of SOC in normal-state phenomena has been extensively studied, its role in superconducting hybrid structures and devices elicits many unexplored questions. In conjunction with broken symmetries and material inhomogeneities within superconducting hybrid structures, SOC may have contributions beyond its effects in homogeneous materials. Notably, even with well-established magnetic or nonmagnetic materials and conventional s -wave spin-singlet superconductors, SOC leads to emergent phenomena including equal-spin-triplet pairing and topological superconductivity (hosting Majorana states), a modified current-phase relationship in Josephson junctions, and nonreciprocal transport, including superconducting diode effects. SOC is also responsible for transforming quasiparticles in superconducting structures, which enhances the spin Hall effect and changes the spin dynamics. Taken together, SOC in superconducting hybrid structures and the potential for electric tuning of the SOC strength create interesting possibilities to advance superconducting spintronic devices for energy-efficient computing and enable topological fault-tolerant quantum computing. By providing a description of experimental techniques and theoretical methods to study SOC, this Colloquium describes the current understanding of resulting phenomena in superconducting structures and offers a framework to select and design a growing class of materials systems where SOC plays an important role.},

From a physicist’s perspective, magnetotactic bacteria can be seen at the interface between bacterial active matter and magnetic colloids, which gives them unique properties at both the individual and collective levels. In crowded media and/or when they are submitted to external flows, their motion can be efficiently driven by magnetic fields, which leads to surprising effects.

  abstract = {The striking success of the standard model in explaining precision data and, at the same time, its lack of explanations for various fundamental phenomena, such as dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, suggest new physics at an energy scale that greatly exceeds the electroweak scale. In the absence of a short-range–long-range conspiracy, the standard model can be viewed as the leading term of an effective “remnant” theory (referred to as the SMEFT) of a more fundamental structure. In recent years, many aspects of the SMEFT have been investigated, and it has become a standard tool for analyzing experimental results in an integral way. In this review, after a presentation of the salient features of the standard model, the construction of the SMEFT is reviewed. The range of its applicability and bounds on its coefficients imposed by general theoretical considerations are discussed. Since new-physics models are likely to exhibit exact or approximate accidental global symmetries, especially in the flavor sector, their implications for the SMEFT are also discussed. The main focus of the review is the phenomenological analysis of experimental results. How to use various effective field theories to study the phenomenology of theories beyond the standard model is explicitly shown. Descriptions of the matching procedure and the use of the renormalization group equations are given, allowing one to connect multiple effective theories that are valid at different energy scales. Explicit examples from low-energy experiments and from high- p T physics illustrate the workflow. Also commented upon are the nonlinear realization of electroweak symmetry breaking and its phenomenological implications.},

  abstract = {The remanent magnetization of ferromagnets has long been studied and used to store binary information. While early magnetic memory designs relied on magnetization switching by locally generated magnetic fields, key insights in condensed matter physics later suggested the possibility of doing it by electrical means instead. In the 1990s, Slonczewski and Berger formulated the concept of current-induced spin torques in magnetic multilayers through which a spin-polarized current generated by a first ferromagnet may be used to switch the magnetization of a second one. This discovery drove the development of spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access memories (MRAMs). More recent fundamental research revealed other types of current-induced torques named spin-orbit torques (SOTs) and will lead to a new generation of devices including SOT MRAMs and skyrmion-based devices. Parallel to these advances, multiferroics and their magnetoelectric coupling, first investigated experimentally in the 1960s, experienced a renaissance. Dozens of multiferroic compounds with new magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms were discovered and high-quality multiferroic films were synthesized (notably of BiFeO 3 ), also leading to novel device concepts for information and communication technology such as the magnetoelectric spin-orbit (MESO) transistor. The story of the electrical switching of magnetization, which is discussed in this review, is that of a dance between fundamental research (in spintronics, condensed matter physics, and materials science) and technology (MRAMs, MESO transistors, microwave emitters, spin diodes, skyrmion-based devices, components for neuromorphics, etc.). This pas de deux has led to major scientific and technological breakthroughs in recent decades (such as the conceptualization of pure spin currents, the observation of magnetic skyrmions, and the discovery of spin-charge interconversion effects). As a result, this field has not only propelled MRAMs into consumer electronics products but also fueled discoveries in adjacent research areas such as ferroelectrics or magnonics. In this review, recent advances in the control of magnetism by electric fields and by current-induced torques are covered. Fundamental concepts in these two directions are reviewed first, their combination is then discussed, and finally current various families of devices harnessing the electrical control of magnetic properties for various application fields are addressed. The review concludes by giving perspectives in terms of both emerging fundamental physics concepts and new directions in materials science.},

  abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), with its exceptional sensitivity to both the binding energy and the momentum of valence electrons in solids, provides unparalleled insight into the electronic structure of quantum materials. Over the past two decades, the advent of femtosecond lasers, which can deliver ultrashort and coherent light pulses, has ushered the ARPES technique into the time domain. Currently time-resolved ARPES (TR-ARPES) can probe ultrafast electron dynamics and the out-of-equilibrium electronic structure, providing a wealth of information that is otherwise unattainable in conventional ARPES experiments. This review begins with an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of TR-ARPES followed by a description of recent advances in state-of-the-art ultrafast sources and optical excitation schemes. It then reviews paradigmatic phenomena investigated by TR-ARPES thus far, such as out-of-equilibrium electronic states and their spin dynamics, Floquet-Volkov states, photoinduced phase transitions, electron-phonon coupling, and surface photovoltage effects. Each section highlights TR-ARPES data from diverse classes of quantum materials, including semiconductors, charge-ordered systems, topological materials, excitonic insulators, Van der Waals materials, and unconventional superconductors. These examples demonstrate how TR-ARPES has played a critical role in unraveling the complex dynamical properties of quantum materials. The conclusion outlines possible future directions and opportunities.},

Compared with conventional schemes, metamaterials provide an unprecedented potential for governing diffusion processes, based on emerging theories like the transformation and the scattering-cancellation theory that expanded the original concepts and suggested innovative metamaterial-based devices. The term diffusionics is used in the review to generalize these noteworthy achievements in various energy and mass diffusion systems. Examples include heat diffusion systems and particle and plasma diffusion systems. For clarity the numerous studies published over the past decade are categorized by diffusion field (i.e., heat, particles, and plasmas) and discussed from three different perspectives: the theoretical perspective, to detail how the transformation principle is applied to each diffusion field; the application perspective, to introduce various interesting metamaterial-based devices, such as cloaks and radiative coolers; and the physics perspective, to connect them with concepts of recent concern, such as non-Hermitian topology, nonreciprocal transport, and spatiotemporal modulation. The possibility of controlling diffusion processes beyond metamaterials is also discussed. Finally, several future directions for diffusion metamaterial research, including the integration of metamaterials with artificial intelligence and topology concepts, are examined.},

  abstract = {A plethora of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been introduced in physics and engineering in the past two decades. Their robust, membranelike sheets permit (mostly require) deposition, giving rise to solid-solid dry interfaces whose mobility, pinning, and general tribological properties under shear stress are currently being understood and controlled, both experimentally and theoretically. In this Colloquium simulated case studies of twisted graphene systems are used as a prototype workhorse tool to demonstrate and discuss the general picture of 2D material interface sliding. First highlighted is the crucial mechanical difference, often overlooked, between small and large incommensurabilities, which corresponds to, for example, small and large twist angles in graphene interfaces. In both cases, focusing on flat, structurally lubric or “superlubric” geometries, the generally separate scalings with the area of static friction in pinned states and of kinetic friction during sliding are elucidated and reviewed, tangled as they are with the effects of velocity, temperature, load, and defects. The roles of island boundaries and elasticity are also discussed, and compared when possible to results in the literature for systems other than graphene. It is proposed that the resulting picture of pinning and sliding should be applicable to interfaces in generic 2D materials that are of importance for the physics and technology of existing and future bilayer and multilayer systems.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive theory of the Lamb shift in light muonic atoms such as μ H , μ D , μ 3 He + , and μ 4 He + is presented, with all quantum electrodynamic corrections included at the precision level constrained by the uncertainty of nuclear structure effects. This analysis can be used in the global adjustment of fundamental constants and in the determination of nuclear charge radii. Further improvements in the understanding of electromagnetic interactions of light nuclei will allow for a promising test of fundamental interactions by comparison with “normal” atomic spectroscopy, in particular, with H-D and He 3 − He 4 isotope shifts.},

  abstract = {The burgeoning field of “fractons,” a class of models where quasiparticles are strictly immobile or display restricted mobility that can be understood through generalized multipolar symmetries and associated conservation laws, is reviewed. With a focus on merely a corner of this fast-growing subject, it is demonstrated how one class of such theories, symmetric tensor and coupled-vector gauge theories, surprisingly emerge from familiar elasticity of a two-dimensional quantum crystal. The disclination and dislocation crystal defects, respectively, map onto charges and dipoles of the fracton gauge theory. This fracton-elasticity duality leads to predictions of fractonic phases and quantum phase transitions to their descendants that are duals of the commensurate crystal, supersolid, smectic, and hexatic liquid crystals, as well as amorphous solids, quasicrystals, and elastic membranes. It is shown how these dual gauge theories provide a field-theoretic description of quantum melting transitions through a generalized Higgs mechanism. It is demonstrated how they can be equivalently constructed as gauged models with global multipole symmetries. Extensions of such gauge-elasticity dualities to generalized elasticity theories are expected to provide a route to the discovery of new fractonic models and their potential experimental realizations.},
