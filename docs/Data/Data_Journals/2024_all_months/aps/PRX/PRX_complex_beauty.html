  abstract     = {The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1 / T 1 just below the critical temperature T c , serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in 1 / T 1 has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 , pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin I &gt; 1 / 2 comprises the magnetic relaxation rate 1 / T 1 mag , which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate 1 / T 1 quad , which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing Cu 63 and Cu 65 isotopes, we successfully distinguish 1 / T 1 mag and 1 / T 1 quad of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in 1 / T 1 quad but not in 1 / T 1 mag , in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in 1 / T 1 when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of 1 / T 1 for the chains of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Among the wealth of single fluorescent defects recently detected in silicon, the G center catches interest for its telecom single-photon emission that could be coupled to a metastable electron spin triplet. The G center is a unique defect where the standard Born-Oppenheimer approximation used in solid-state physics breaks down as one of its atoms, a silicon atom in interstitial position , can move between six sites. The impact of its displacement, due either to coherent tunneling or to random jumps from one site to another, on the optical properties of G centers is still largely unknown, especially in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Here, we investigate the displacement of the center of mass of the G center in silicon. By performing photoluminescence experiments at single-defect scale, we show that individual G defects in SOI exhibit several emission dipoles and zero-phonon line fine structures with splittings up to approximately 1 meV, both indicating a motion of the defect central atom over time. Combining polarization and spectral analysis at the single-photon level, we evidence that the reconfiguration dynamics is drastically different from the one of the unperturbed G center in bulk silicon where the mobile atom is fully delocalized over all six sites through tunneling. The SOI structure freezes the delocalization of the G defect and, as a result, enables one to isolate linearly polarized optical lines. Under above-band-gap optical excitation, the central atom of G centers in SOI behaves as if it were in a six-slot roulette wheel, randomly alternating between localized crystal sites at each optical cycle. Comparative measurements in a bulk silicon sample and ab initio calculations highlight that strain is likely the dominant perturbation impacting the G center geometry. These results shed light on the importance of the atomic reconfiguration dynamics to understand and control the photoluminescence properties of the G center in silicon. More generally, these findings emphasize the impact of strain fluctuations inherent to SOI wafers for future quantum integrated photonics applications based on color centers in silicon.},

  abstract     = {The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder . Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.},

  abstract     = {We study quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large “thermal” subspace and the small “nonthermal” subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional nonlocal conserved quantities in the commutant; hence, it unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity-breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann double commutant theorem to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin- ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY -bimagnon, and the electronic -pairing towers of states; in each of these cases, we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS. Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous “brute-force” numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians—those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and we discuss its implications to dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Quantum complexity is a measure of the minimal number of elementary operations required to approximately prepare a given state or unitary channel. Recently, this concept has found applications beyond quantum computing—in studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems and the long-time properties of anti–de Sitter black holes. In this context, Brown and Susskind [ Phys. Rev. D 97 , 086015 (2018) ] conjectured that the complexity of a chaotic quantum system grows linearly in time up to times exponential in the system size, saturating at a maximal value, and remaining maximally complex until undergoing recurrences at doubly exponential times. In this work, we prove the saturation and recurrence of complexity in two models of chaotic time evolutions based on (i) random local quantum circuits and (ii) stochastic local Hamiltonian evolution. Our results advance an understanding of the long-time behavior of chaotic quantum systems and could shed light on the physics of black-hole interiors. From a technical perspective, our results are based on establishing new quantitative connections between the Haar measure and high-degree approximate designs, as well as the fact that random quantum circuits of sufficiently high depth converge to approximate designs.},

  abstract     = {We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions . We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charge distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings with available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features with the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a nonmonotonic behavior with increasing , the dynamics, quantified by the microgels’ mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with the simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian model, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. Thanks to our analysis, we are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes, e.g., high temperature, and internal architectures, such as for hollow and ultralow-cross-linked microgels, where experimental evidence is still limited.},

  abstract     = {Masers once represented the state of the art in low-noise microwave amplification technology but eventually became obsolete due to their need for cryogenic cooling. Masers based on solid-state spin systems perform most effectively as amplifiers, since they provide a large density of spins and can, therefore, operate at relatively high powers. While solid-state maser oscillators have been demonstrated at room temperature, continuous-wave amplification in these systems has only ever been realized at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we report on a continuous-wave solid-state maser amplifier operating at room temperature. We achieve this feat using a practical setup that includes an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy center spins in a diamond crystal, a strong permanent magnet, and a simple laser diode. We describe important amplifier characteristics including gain, bandwidth, compression power, and noise temperature and discuss the prospects of realizing a room-temperature near-quantum-noise-limited amplifier with this system. Finally, we show that in a different mode of operation the spins can be used to reduce the microwave noise in an external circuit to cryogenic levels, all without the requirement for physical cooling.},

  abstract     = {We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure and buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin-flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the frequency spectrum of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent spin-flip pattern on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has instantaneous bandwidth centered around 13 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.},

  abstract     = {Attosecond physics enables the study of ultrafast coherent electron dynamics in matter upon photoexcitation and photoionization, revealing spectacular effects such as hole migration and coherent Auger dynamics in molecules. In the photoionization scenario, there has been a strong focus on probing the physical manifestations of internal quantum coherence within the individual parent ion and photoelectron systems. However, quantum correlations between these two subsystems emerging from attosecond photoionization events have thus far remained much more elusive. In this work, we design theoretically and model numerically a direct probe of quantum entanglement in attosecond photoionization in the form of a Bell test. We simulate from first principles a Bell test protocol for the case of noble gas atoms photoionized by ultrashort, circularly polarized infrared laser pulses in the strong-field regime predicting robust violation of the Bell inequality. This theoretical result paves the way for the direct observation of entanglement in the context of ultrafast photoionization of many-electron systems. Our work provides a novel perspective on attosecond physics directed toward the detection of quantum correlations between systems born during attosecond photoionization and unraveling the signatures of entanglement in ultrafast coherent molecular dynamics, including in the chemical decomposition pathways of molecular ions.},

  abstract     = {Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of intrinsic nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram, which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.},

  abstract     = {We study a model of electrons moving in a parent band of uniform Berry curvature. At sufficiently high parent Berry curvature, we show that strong repulsive interactions generically lead to the formation of an anomalous Hall crystal: a topological state with spontaneously broken continuous translation symmetry. Our results are established via a mapping to a problem of Wigner crystallization in a regular 2D electron gas. Interestingly, we find that a periodic electrostatic potential induces a competing state with opposite Chern number. Our theory offers a unified perspective for understanding several aspects of the recently observed integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene and provides a recipe for engineering new topological states.},

  abstract     = {Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors and enables their diverse applications. However, the underlying mechanism of vortex pinning has long been elusive, lacking a clear microscopic explanation. Here, using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from , creating a “mini” gap that effectively lowers the system energy and enhances pinning. By measuring the local density of states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force via the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results are consistent with bulk critical current measurement. Furthermore, we showed that a general microscopic quantum model incorporating defect-vortex interaction can naturally capture our observation. It suggests that the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced compared to unpinned vortex, which is beyond the traditional understanding that nonsuperconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus unveils a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors and provides insights for enhancing the critical current of practical superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Heat engines and information engines have each historically served as motivating examples for the development of thermodynamics. While these two types of systems are typically thought of as two separate kinds of machines, recent empirical studies of specific systems have hinted at possible connections between the two. Inspired by molecular machines in the cellular environment, which in many cases have separate components in contact with distinct sources of fluctuations, we study bipartite heat engines. We show that a bipartite heat engine can produce net output work only by acting as an information engine. Conversely, information engines can extract more work than the work consumed to power them only if they have access to different sources of fluctuations, i.e., act as heat engines. We illustrate these findings first through an analogy to economics and a cyclically controlled 2D ideal gas. We then explore two analytically tractable model systems in more detail: a Brownian-gyrator heat engine, which we show can be reinterpreted as a feedback-cooling information engine, and a quantum-dot information engine, which can be reinterpreted as a thermoelectric heat engine. Our results suggest design principles for both heat engines and information engines at the nanoscale and ultimately imply constraints on how free-energy transduction is carried out in biological molecular machines.},

  abstract     = {We study paramagnetic quantum criticality in the periodic Anderson model (PAM) using cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT), with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) as a cluster impurity solver. The PAM describes itinerant electrons hybridizing with a lattice of localized electrons. At zero temperature, it exhibits a much-studied quantum phase transition from a Kondo phase to a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) phase when the hybridization is decreased through a so-called Kondo breakdown quantum critical point (KB QCP). There, Kondo screening of spins by electrons breaks down, so that excitations change their character from somewhat itinerant to mainly localized, while excitations remain itinerant. Building on Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 , 256404 (2008) , which interpreted the KB transition as an orbital-selective Mott transition, we here elucidate its nature in great detail by performing a high-resolution, real-frequency study of various dynamical quantities (susceptibilities, self-energies, and spectral functions). NRG allows us to study the quantum critical regime governed by the QCP and located between two temperature scales, . In this regime, we find fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior in several dynamical susceptibilities. Surprisingly, CDMFT self-consistency is essential to stabilize the QCP and the NFL regime. The Fermi-liquid (FL) scale decreases toward and vanishes at the KB QCP; at temperatures below , FL behavior emerges. At , we find the following properties. The KB transition is continuous. The quasiparticle weight decreases continuously as the transition is approached from either side, vanishing only at the KB QCP. Therefore, the quasiparticle weight of the band is nonzero not only in the Kondo phase, but also in the RKKY phase; hence, the FL quasiparticles comprise and electrons in both phases. The Fermi surface (FS) volumes in the two phases differ, implying a FS reconstruction at the KB QCP. Whereas the large-FS Kondo phase has a two-band structure as expected, the small-FS RKKY phase unexpectedly has a three-band structure. We provide a detailed analysis of quasiparticle properties of both the Kondo and, for the first time, also the RKKY phase and uncover their differences. The FS reconstruction is accompanied by the appearance of a Luttinger surface on which the self-energy diverges. The volumes of the Luttinger and Fermi surfaces are related to the charge density by a generalized Luttinger sum rule. We interpret the small FS volume and the emergent Luttinger surface as evidence for -electron fractionalization in the RKKY phase. Finally, we compute the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient and the specific heat, finding good qualitative agreement with experiments.},

  abstract     = {Virtually all Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms used for sampling a given distribution are reversible, and they satisfy the detailed-balance condition. For local chains, this leads to a slow, diffusive exploration of sample space. Significant speedups can be achieved through nonreversible algorithms with the given distribution as a targeted steady state. However, nonreversible algorithms for sampling are difficult to set up and to analyze, and exact speedup results for interacting many-particle systems are very rare. Here, we introduce the “lifted” totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) as an exactly solvable paradigm for nonreversible many-particle Markov chains. It samples the same hard-sphere distribution as the Metropolis algorithm for symmetrically diffusing hard-core particles on a one-dimensional lattice. We solve the lifted TASEP by an unusual kind of coordinate Bethe ansatz and show that it exhibits polynomial (in particle number) speedups in the relaxation time for the asymptotic approach of the steady state, as well as the nonasymptotic mixing time, compared to both Metropolis and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang-based dynamics. The lifted TASEP is the reduction onto the one-dimensional lattice of the successful hard-sphere event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and we discuss that it can likewise be generalized to soft interaction potentials.},

By combining two recently developed methods to theoretically describe quantum electro-optic sampling, we analytically relate the photon-count probability distribution of the electro-optic signal to a transformed phase-space quasiprobability distribution of the sampled quantum state as a function of the time delay between the sampled midinfrared pulsed state and an ultrabroadband near-infrared probe pulse. We catalog and analyze sources of noise and show that in quantum electro-optic sampling with an ultrabroadband probe pulse one can expect to observe thermalization due to entanglement breaking. Mitigation of the thermalization noise enables a tomographic reconstruction of broadband quantum states while granting access to its dynamics on a subcycle scale.},

For Markovian quantum (classical) dynamics, these steady states are extremal eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian operators that generate the dynamics, i.e., quantum channels (Markov chains). However, since these operators are non-Hermitian, their spectra are an unreliable guide to dynamical relaxation timescales or to stability against perturbations. We propose an alternative dynamical criterion for a steady state to be in a stable phase, which we name uniformity: Informally, our criterion amounts to requiring that, under sufficiently small local perturbations of the dynamics, the unperturbed and perturbed steady states are related to one another by a finite-time dissipative evolution. We show that this criterion implies many of the properties one would want from any reasonable definition of a phase. We prove that uniformity is satisfied in a canonical classical cellular automaton, and we provide numerical evidence that the gap determines the relaxation rate between nearby steady states in the same phase, a situation we conjecture holds generically whenever uniformity is satisfied. We further conjecture some sufficient conditions for a channel to exhibit uniformity and therefore stability.},

Here, we propose and realize a high-speed on-chip quantum processor that supports reconfigurable all-to-all coupling with a large on-off ratio.

  abstract     = {Grover’s algorithm is one of the primary algorithms offered as evidence that quantum computers can provide an advantage over classical computers. It involves an “oracle” (external quantum subroutine), which must be specified for a given application and whose internal structure is not part of the formal scaling of the quadratic quantum speedup guaranteed by the algorithm. Grover’s algorithm also requires exponentially many calls to the quantum oracle (approximately calls where n is the number of qubits) to succeed, raising the question of its implementation on both noisy and error-corrected quantum computers. In this work, we construct a quantum-inspired algorithm executable on a classical computer that performs Grover’s task in a linear number of calls to (simulations of) the oracle—an exponentially smaller number than Grover’s algorithm—and demonstrate this algorithm explicitly for Boolean satisfiability problems. The complexity of our algorithm depends on the cost to simulate the oracle once, which may or may not be exponential, depending on its internal structure. Indeed, Grover’s algorithm does not have an a priori quantum speedup as soon as one is given access to the “source code” of the oracle, which may reveal an internal structure of the problem. Our findings illustrate this point explicitly, as our algorithm exploits the structure of the quantum circuit used to program the quantum computer to speed up the search. There are still problems where Grover’s algorithm would provide an asymptotic speedup if it could be run accurately for large enough sizes. Our quantum-inspired algorithm provides lower bounds, in terms of the quantum-circuit complexity, for the quantum hardware to beat classical approaches for these problems. These estimates, combined with the unfavorable scaling of the success probability of Grover’s algorithm, which in the presence of noise decays as the exponential of the exponential of the number of qubits, makes a practical speedup unrealistic even under extremely optimistic assumptions of the evolution of both hardware quality and availability.},

  abstract     = {Quantum processors based on linear arrays of trapped ions have achieved exceptional performance, but scaling to large qubit numbers requires realizing two-dimensional ion arrays as envisioned in the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Here, we present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface-electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining cowiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the sitewise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site-dependent operations can be achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using Yb + 171 − Ba + 138 crystals and the other Ba + 137 − Sr + 88 , we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intrasite crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multisite region of interest, we measure subquanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. In this initial demonstration, the logic controlling the voltage exchange occurs in software, but the applied signals mimic a proposed hardware implementation using crossover switches. These techniques can be further extended to implement other conditional operations in the QCCD architecture such as gates, initialization, and measurement.},

  abstract     = {Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schrödinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite-size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over 4 orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many-worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states, or ensemble averages.},

  abstract     = {Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement. Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer α − RuCl 3 , the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations unique to α − RuCl 3 . Numerical simulations suggest that the observed oscillation can be reproduced by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects like Friedel oscillations in metals.},

  abstract     = {In a lattice model subject to a perpendicular magnetic field, when the lattice constant is comparable to the magnetic length, one enters the “Hofstadter regime,” where continuum Landau levels become fractal magnetic Bloch bands. Strong mixing between bands alters the nature of the resulting quantum phases compared to the continuum limit; lattice potential, magnetic field, and Coulomb interaction must be treated on equal footing. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and density matrix renormalization group techniques, we study this regime numerically in the context of the Hubbard-Hofstadter model on a triangular lattice. In the field-filling phase diagram, we find a broad wedge-shaped region of ferromagnetic ground states for filling factor ν ≤ 1 , bounded below by filling factor ν = 1 and bounded above by half filling the lowest Hofstadter subband. We observe signatures of SU(2) quantum Hall ferromagnetism at filling factors ν = 1 and ν = 3 . The phases near ν = 1 are particle-hole asymmetric, and we observe a rapid decrease in ground-state spin polarization consistent with the formation of skyrmions only on the electron doped side. At large fields, above the ferromagnetic wedge, we observe a low-spin metallic region with spin correlations peaked at small momenta. We argue that the phenomenology of this region likely results from exchange interaction mixing fractal Hofstadter subbands. The phase diagram derived beyond the continuum limit points to a rich landscape to explore interaction effects in magnetic Bloch bands.},

However, it is challenging due to the elusive interface between magnetic phases. In this study, we report an unprecedented exchange-bias phenomenon observed in ultrathin, uncompensated, antiferromagnetic MnBi 2 Te 4 . The magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be intentionally controlled by designing a magnetic-field sweep protocol without a field cooling process. The combined experimental and theoretical simulation results indicate that the spin-flip process assisted by the ubiquitous defect-induced pinning domain sites with varying inner exchange interactions might give rise to the emergence and robustness of this peculiar exchange bias. The temperature and thickness dependence of the exchange-bias phenomena are systematically investigated for further study and exploitation of its unique properties. This mechanism allows for highly tunable exchange bias in prevalent magnetic systems by engineering the properties of domain structures and also offers promising avenues for the design of spintronic devices combing its topology based on MnBi 2 Te 4 .},

In this work, we elucidate the nature of this dynamical process, which we refer to as transmon ionization. We develop a comprehensive framework which provides a physical picture of the origin of transmon ionization. This framework consists of three complementary levels of descriptions: a fully quantized transmon-resonator model, a semiclassical model where the resonator is treated as a classical drive on the transmon, and a fully classical model. Crucially, all three approaches preserve the full cosine potential of the transmon and lead to similar predictions. This framework identifies the multiphoton resonances responsible for transmon ionization. It also allows one to efficiently compute numerical estimates of the photon number threshold for ionization, which are in remarkable agreement with recent experimental results. The tools developed within this work are both conceptually and computationally simple, and we expect them to become an integral part of the theoretical underpinning of all circuit QED experiments.},

In this work, we show that boron acceptors in silicon constitute a TLS bath that leads to an energy dissipation channel for superconducting circuits. We discuss how the electronic structure of boron acceptors leads to an effective TLS response in silicon. We sweep the boron concentration in silicon and demonstrate the bulk dielectric loss limit from boron acceptors. We show that boron-induced dielectric loss can be reduced in a magnetic field due to the spin-orbit structure of boron.

  abstract     = {Superconducting nickelates are a new family of strongly correlated electron materials with a phase diagram closely resembling that of superconducting cuprates. While analogy with the cuprates is natural, very little is known about the metallic state of the nickelates, making these comparisons difficult. We probe the electronic dispersion of thin-film superconducting five-layer ( n = 5 ) and metallic three-layer ( n = 3 ) nickelates by measuring the Seebeck coefficient S . We find a temperature-independent and negative S / T for both n = 5 and n = 3 nickelates. These results are in stark contrast to the strongly temperature-dependent S / T measured at similar electron filling in the cuprate La 1.36 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.24 CuO 4 . The electronic structure calculated from density-functional theory can reproduce the temperature dependence, sign, and amplitude of S / T in the nickelates using Boltzmann transport theory. This demonstrates that the electronic structure obtained from first-principles calculations provides a reliable description of the fermiology of superconducting nickelates and suggests that, despite indications of strong electronic correlations, there are well-defined quasiparticles in the metallic state. Finally, we explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficient between nickelates and cuprates as originating in strong dissimilarities in impurity concentrations. Our study demonstrates that the high elastic scattering limit of the Seebeck coefficient reflects only the underlying band structure of a metal, analogous to the high magnetic field limit of the Hall coefficient. This opens a new avenue for Seebeck measurements to probe the electronic band structures of relatively disordered quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotes, DNA replication constitutes a complex process whereby multiple origins are stochastically fired, and from which the replication machinery proceeds along chromosomes to achieve the faithful synthesis of two identical copies of the genome during the S phase of the cell cycle. Experimental evidence shows a functional correlation between the dynamics of replication and the spatial organization of the genome inside cell nuclei, suggesting that the process of replicating DNA may impact chromosome folding. However, the theoretical and mechanistic bases of such a hypothesis remain elusive. To address that question, we propose a quantitative, minimal framework that integrates the dynamics of replication along a polymer chain by accounting explicitly for the progression of the replication machinery and the resulting formation of sister chromatids. By systematically characterizing the 3D structural consequences of replication, and of possible interactions between active replication machineries, we show that the formation of transient loops may potentially impact chromosome organization across multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the level of individual origins to that of the global polymer chain. Comparison with available microscopy and chromosome conformation capture data in yeast suggests that a replication-dependent loop extrusion process may be acting in vivo , and may shape chromosomes as loose polymer bottle brushes during the S phase. Lastly, we explore the postreplication relative organization of sister chromatids and demonstrate the emergence of catenations and intertwined structures, which are regulated by the density of fired origins.},

  abstract     = {Many chronic, age-related disorders could be mitigated by enhancing the activity of enzymes that regulate biochemical signaling pathways, but all known modes of enzyme activation rely on allosteric binding sites, which have only been identified in less than 10% of proteins. Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + )-dependent deacylases playing critical roles in lifespan and age-related diseases. The physiological importance of sirtuins and the reduction in their catalytic activity with the age-related decline in NAD + levels have stimulated intense interest in designing sirtuin-activating compounds; however, except for substrate-specific allosteric SIRT1 activators, methodologies for rational design of sirtuin-activating compounds are lacking. Here, we introduce methods for the activation of such enzymes that do not rely on allosteric binding sites, and we demonstrate their successful application to the discovery of first-in-class activators of sirtuin enzymes. We establish how all-atom simulations of an enzyme’s active site under the potential of a small molecule modulator can be used to identify molecular properties that achieve desired changes in local enzyme conformational degrees of freedom conducive to the enhancement of catalytic activity. We apply computational high-throughput screening based on this biophysical model for activation of sirtuin enzymes to the major mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT3, which plays a critical role in age-related disorders but does not have a known allosteric site; we thereby identify first-in-class, nonallosteric activators of this enzyme. These compounds are the first reported steady-state activators of the major mitochondrial sirtuin enzyme, and they operate according to a mode of action not shared by any existing drug. Two such compounds can almost double the catalytic efficiency of SIRT3 with respect to NAD + , thus compensating for the loss in SIRT3 activity that occurs due to the age-related decline in NAD + , and they may be developed for therapeutic applications to combat multiple types of age-related disorders. These discoveries establish a foundation for the development of a new class of drugs that function through the activation of enzymes by modulation of local conformational ensembles.},

This class of processes is described by a tensor network with treelike geometry whose component tensors are (1) causality-preserving maps (superprocesses) and (2) locality-preserving temporal change-of-scale transformations. We show that the long-range correlations in this class of processes tends to originate almost entirely from memory effects and can accommodate genuinely quantum power-law correlations in time. Importantly, this class allows efficient computation of multitime correlation functions. To showcase the potential utility of this model-agnostic class for numerical simulation of physical models, we show how it can efficiently approximate the strong memory dynamics of the paradigmatic spin-boson model, in terms of arbitrary multitime features. In contrast to an equivalently costly matrix-product-operator representation, the ansatz produces a fiducial characterization of the relevant physics. Finally, leveraging 2D tensor-network renormalization-group methods, we detail an algorithm for deriving a process tree from an underlying Hamiltonian via the Feynmann-Vernon influence functional. Our work lays the foundation for the development of more efficient numerical techniques in the field of strongly interacting open quantum systems, as well as the theoretical development of a temporal renormalization-group scheme.},

  abstract     = {Qubits based on ions trapped in linear radio-frequency traps form a successful platform for quantum computing, due to their high fidelity of operations, all-to-all connectivity, and degree of local control. In principle, there is no fundamental limit to the number of ion-based qubits that can be confined in a single 1D register. However, in practice, there are two main issues associated with long trapped-ion crystals, that stem from the “softening” of their modes of motion, upon scaling up: high heating rates of the ions’ motion and a dense motional spectrum; both impede the performance of high-fidelity qubit operations. Here, we propose a holistic, scalable architecture for quantum computing with large ion crystals that overcomes these issues. Our method relies on dynamically operated optical potentials that instantaneously segment the ion crystal into cells of a manageable size. We show that these cells behave as nearly independent quantum registers, allowing for parallel entangling gates on all cells. The ability to reconfigure the optical potentials guarantees connectivity across the full ion crystal and also enables efficient midcircuit measurements. We study the implementation of large-scale parallel multiqubit entangling gates that operate simultaneously on all cells and present a protocol to compensate for crosstalk errors, enabling full-scale usage of an extensively large register.

  abstract     = {Driven by physical questions pertaining to quantifying particle dynamics, microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single-particle level, from cellular organisms to individual ions. Yet, available analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and heterogeneous systems where accurately labeling particles is difficult. Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the measurement of collective effects. Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique that probes dynamics of interacting particle suspensions based on a remarkably simple principle: counting particles in finite observation boxes. Using colloidal experiments, advanced simulations, and theory, we first demonstrate that statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine self-diffusion coefficients, so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We also provide a recipe for practically extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data at variable particle densities, which is sensitive to steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Remarkably, by increasing the observation box size, counting naturally enables the study of collective dynamics in dense suspensions. Using our novel analysis of particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behavior due to hydrodynamics as well as a new length scale which can be connected with hyperuniform structure. Our counting framework, the “countoscope,” thus enables efficient measurements of self and collective dynamics in dense suspensions and opens the way to quantifying dynamics and identifying novel physical mechanisms in diverse complex systems where single particles can be resolved.},

Here, we point out that for axion masses 10 − 9 ≲ m a ≲ 10 − 4 eV a sizable fraction of the sourced axion population will be gravitationally confined to the neutron star. These axions accumulate over astrophysical timescales, thereby forming a dense “axion cloud” around the star. We argue that the existence of such a cloud, with densities reaching and potentially exceeding O ( 10 22 ) GeV cm − 3 , is a generic expectation across a wide range of parameter space. For axion masses m a ≳ 10 − 7 eV , energy is primarily radiated from the axion cloud via resonant axion-photon mixing, generating a number of distinctive signatures that include a sharp line in the radio spectrum of each pulsar (located at the axion mass, and with an order percent-level width) and transient events arising from the reconfiguration of charge densities in the magnetosphere. While a deeper understanding of the systematic uncertainties in these systems is required, our current estimates suggest that existing radio telescopes could improve sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling by more than an order of magnitude.},

While fully protected qubits are expected to offer exponential protection against both energy relaxation and pure dephasing, simpler circuits may grant partial protection with currently achievable parameters. Here, we study a fluxonium circuit in which the wave functions are engineered to minimize their overlap while benefiting from a first-order-insensitive flux sweet spot. Taking advantage of a large superinductance ( ), our circuit incorporates a resonant tunneling mechanism at zero external flux that couples states with the same fluxon parity, thus enabling bifluxon tunneling. The states and are encoded in wave functions with parities 0 and 1, respectively, ensuring a minimal form of protection against relaxation. Two-tone spectroscopy reveals the energy-level structure of the circuit and the presence of quantum-phase slips between different potential wells corresponding to fluxons, which can be precisely described by a simple fluxonium Hamiltonian or by an effective bifluxon Hamiltonian. Despite suboptimal fabrication, the measured relaxation ( ) and dephasing ( ) times not only demonstrate the relevance of our approach but also open an alternative direction toward quantum computing using partially protected fluxonium qubits.},

We use the full tunability of the microcavity to selectively address individual tin-vacancy centers within the cavity mode volume. Purcell enhancement of the tin-vacancy center optical transition is evidenced both by optical excited state lifetime reduction and by optical linewidth broadening. As the emitter selectively reflects the single-photon component of the incident light, the coupled emitter-cavity system exhibits strong quantum nonlinear behavior. On resonance, we observe a transmission dip of 50% for low incident photon number per Purcell-reduced excited state lifetime, while the dip disappears as the emitter is saturated with higher photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the emitter strongly modifies the photon statistics of the transmitted light by observing photon bunching. This work establishes a versatile and tunable platform for advanced quantum optics experiments and proof-of-principle demonstrations on quantum networking with solid-state qubits.},

In macroscopic quantum systems, this collapse arises via a continuous measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) at a critical value of the strength of interaction with the measurement apparatus. MIPTs lie outside established paradigms for equilibrium or nonequilibrium critical phenomena and delineate distinct, stable dynamical and computational phases of matter. Quantum computers enable programmable simulation of the interaction of a measurement apparatus with a dynamical quantum system, to explore MIPT phenomena over a range of system sizes while retaining quantum coherence. Yet, existing experimental protocols rely on fundamentally nonscalable postselection techniques or direct classical simulation of quantum circuits. Here, we report the scalable observation of finite-size scaling evidence for an observable-sharpening MIPT in monitored quantum circuits in a chain of Yb + 171 ions in Quantinuum’s H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor. By leveraging an equivalent description as a statistical physics problem, we implement scalable classical algorithms to infer the value of the measured observable from a single experimental shot. This technique enables a truly scalable protocol to observe observable-sharpening MIPTs in generic classes of circuits that cannot be directly classically simulated and also provides enhanced means to detect and suppress errors in the quantum simulation.},

Our measurements show that the planar 𝜅 x y from electrons in cuprates is zero, as expected from the absence of a Lorentz force in the planar configuration. By contrast, we observe a sizable planar 𝜅 x y in those samples where the thermal Hall response is due to phonons, even though it should, in principle, be forbidden by the high crystal symmetry.

We quantify key parameters of this process, including the localization size of the stress field and the photon energy conversion efficiency into elastic energy. The parameters are determined by the photoelectron and Auger electron cascade dynamics, as well as the electron-phonon interaction. In particular, we obtain the localization size of the observed strain wave packet to be 1.5 and 2.5 nm for bulk SrTiO 3 and KTaO 3 single crystals, respectively.

  abstract     = {In organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), understanding the efficiency loss mechanism known as exciton-polaron quenching (EPQ) has been a longstanding challenge. Traditionally, EPQ was believed to occur mainly within the bulk of the OLED emission layer (EML) due to the coexistence of polarons and excitons, limiting our understanding of its full impact. Here, we report a previously overlooked phenomenon termed “interfacial EPQ (Inf. EPQ),” which occurs at the heterointerface between the EML and the adjacent charge transport layer (CTL). We observe the direct transfer of EML excitons to CTL polarons across this interface, spanning distances of up to 4 nm. Notably, Inf. EPQ exceeds EPQ within the EML bulk, even in devices with a slight interfacial energy barrier ( &gt; 0.2 eV ). We propose a methodology that enables independent probing of Inf. EPQ, systematic validation of its essential parameters, and the identification of Dexter energy transfer as its governing mechanism. Importantly, our findings highlight Inf. EPQ as a ubiquitous phenomenon across devices with various luminescent mechanisms, wavelengths, and injection levels. By effectively addressing Inf. EPQ, we achieve efficiency enhancements in red, green, and blue phosphorescent OLEDs, by 70 % ± 8 % , 47 % ± 5 % , and 66 % ± 6 % , respectively. Our work advances the physical understanding of exciton and polaron dynamics at organic heterointerfaces, providing universally applicable solutions to Inf. EPQ-related issues in practical devices.},

  abstract     = {To control and measure the state of a quantum system, it must necessarily be coupled to external degrees of freedom. This inevitably leads to spontaneous emission via the Purcell effect, photon-induced dephasing from measurement backaction, and errors caused by unwanted interactions with nearby quantum systems. To tackle this fundamental challenge, we make use of the design flexibility of superconducting quantum circuits to form a multimode element—an artificial molecule—with symmetry-protected modes. The proposed circuit consists of three superconducting islands coupled to a central island via Josephson junctions. It exhibits two essential nonlinear modes, one of which is flux insensitive and used as the protected qubit mode. The second mode is flux tunable and serves via a cross-Kerr-type coupling as a mediator to control the dispersive coupling of the qubit mode to the readout resonator. We demonstrate the Purcell protection of the qubit mode by measuring relaxation times that are independent of the mediated dispersive coupling. We show that the coherence of the qubit is not limited by photon-induced dephasing when detuning the mediator mode from the readout resonator and thereby reducing the dispersive coupling. The resulting highly protected qubit, which we refer to as P-mon, with tunable interactions may serve as a basic building block of a scalable quantum processor architecture, in which qubit decoherence is strongly suppressed.},

For instance, flagellated bacteria swim in helical trajectories but chirality seems absent from the active turbulence dynamics they display in dense suspensions. We address this question by examining multiscale dynamics in Paenibacillus vortex colonies. We find active turbulence without manifest chirality in the bulk, but wide, clockwise (viewed from the air side) circulation all along the tortuous centimeter-scale external boundary, while similar but counterclockwise flows follow internal boundaries. We trace the origin of these robust edge flows to an unexpected asymmetry at the individual level that is amplified by local interactions. We rationalize our findings with a model of noisy self-propelled particles immersed in a Stokes fluid that accounts faithfully for our observations. Our modeling and experimental efforts reveal that local nematic alignment and hydrodynamic interactions amplify the weak chiral bias in individual motion, promoting the formation of strong edge flows. The likely topological protection of these flows provides robust transport mechanism over large scales. Such robust boundary phenomena in weakly chiral active fluids may inspire new control strategies for active and biological matter.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the concept of “quantum geometric nesting” (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bilinear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g., chiral or time reversal) and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics have elucidated various relations between the entropy production rate (thermodynamic dissipation) and the physical limits of information processing in nonequilibrium dynamical systems. These findings have been actively utilized and have opened new perspectives in the analysis of real biological systems. In neuroscience also, the importance of quantifying entropy production has attracted increasing attention as a means to understand the properties of information processing in the brain. However, the relationship between entropy production rate and oscillations, which is prevalent in many biological systems, is unclear. For example, neural oscillations, such as delta, theta, and alpha waves, play crucial roles in brain information processing. Here, we derive a novel decomposition of the entropy production rate of linear Langevin systems. We show that one of the components of the entropy production rate, called the housekeeping entropy production rate, can be decomposed into independent positive contributions from oscillatory modes. Our decomposition enables us to calculate the contribution of oscillatory modes to the housekeeping entropy production rate. In addition, when the noise matrix of the Langevin equation is diagonal, the contribution of each oscillatory mode is further decomposed into the contribution of each element of the system. To demonstrate the utility of our decomposition, we apply our decomposition to an electrocorticography dataset recorded during awake and anesthetized conditions in monkeys, wherein the properties of oscillations change drastically. We show the consistent trends across different monkeys; i.e., the contribution of oscillatory modes from the delta band are larger in the anesthetized condition than in the awake condition, while those from the higher-frequency bands, such as the theta band, are smaller. These results allow us to interpret the change in neural oscillation in terms of stochastic thermodynamics and the physical limit of information processing.},

  abstract     = {Active nematic liquid crystals have the remarkable ability to spontaneously deform and flow in the absence of any external driving force. While living materials with orientational order, such as the mitotic spindle, can self-assemble in quiescent active phases, reconstituted active systems often display chaotic, periodic, or circulating flows under confinement. Quiescent in vitro active nematics are, therefore, quite rare, despite the prediction from active hydrodynamic theory that confinement between two parallel plates can suppress flows. This spontaneous flow transition—named the active Fréedericksz transition by analogy with the conventional Fréedericksz transition in passive nematic liquid crystals under a magnetic field—has been a cornerstone of the field of active matter. Here, we report experimental evidence that confinement in spherical droplets can stabilize the otherwise chaotic dynamics of a 3D extensile active nematics, giving rise to a quiescent—yet still out-of-equilibrium—nematic liquid crystal. The active nematics spontaneously flow when confined in larger droplets. The composite nature of our model system composed of extensile bundles of microtubules and molecular motors dispersed in a passive colloidal liquid crystal allows us to demonstrate how the interplay of activity, nematic elasticity, and confinement impacts the spontaneous flow transition. The critical diameter increases when motor concentration decreases or nematic elasticity increases. Experiments and simulations also demonstrate that the critical confinement depends on the confining geometry, with the critical diameter in droplets being larger than the critical width in channels. Biochemical assays reveal that neither confinement nor nematic elasticity impacts the energy-consumption rate, confirming that the quiescent active phase is the stable out-of-equilibrium phase predicted theoretically. Further experiments in dense arrays of monodisperse droplets show that fluctuations in the droplet composition can smooth the flow transition close to the critical diameter. In conclusion, our work provides experimental validation of the active Fréedericksz transition in 3D active nematics, with potential applications in human health, ecology, and soft robotics.},

The study focuses on the formation dynamics of D 2 H + and H 2 D + cations, shedding light on the interplay between translational and vibrational motions of the nuclei steering the bimolecular reactions. Our observations reveal a notable yield ratio of 1 : 1.6 between H 2 D + and D 2 H + channels, accompanied with a faster formation of D 2 H + compared to H 2 D + . Molecular dynamics simulations unveil that the faster vibrational motion of H 2 + than that of D 2 + upon single ionization within the dimer accounts for these differences.

However, a theoretical understanding of their performance remains elusive. We develop such understanding for the case of the coherent Ising machine (CIM), a network of optical parametric oscillators that can be applied to any quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. We focus on how the CIM finds low-energy solutions of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass. As the laser gain of this system is annealed, the CIM interpolates between gradient descent on coupled soft spins to descent on coupled binary spins. By combining the Kac-Rice formula, the replica method, and supersymmetry breaking, we develop a detailed understanding of the evolving geometry of the high-dimensional energy landscape of the CIM as the laser gain increases, finding several phase transitions in the landscape, from flat to rough to rigid. Additionally, we develop a novel cavity method that provides a geometric interpretation of supersymmetry breaking in terms of the reactivity of a rough landscape to specific external perturbations. Our energy landscape theory successfully matches numerical experiments, provides geometric insights into the principles of CIM operation, and yields optimal annealing schedules.},

  abstract     = {Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is often an unwanted loss mechanism in both active and passive fibers. Highly multimode excitation of fibers has been proposed as a novel route toward efficient SBS suppression. Here, we develop a detailed, quantitative theory which confirms this proposal and elucidates the physical mechanisms involved. Starting from the vector optical and scalar acoustic equations, we derive appropriate nonlinear coupled mode equations for the signal and Stokes modal amplitudes and an analytical formula for the SBS (Stokes) gain with applicable approximations, such as the neglect of shear effects. This allows us to calculate the exponential growth rate of the Stokes power as a function of the distribution of power in a highly multimode signal. The peak value of the gain spectrum across the excited modes determines the SBS threshold—the maximum SBS-limited power that can be sent through the fiber. The theory shows that the peak SBS gain is greatly reduced by highly multimode excitation due to gain broadening and relatively weaker intermodal SBS gain. The inclusion of exact vector optical modes in the calculation is crucial in order to capture the incomplete intermodal coupling due to mismatch of polarization patterns of higher-order modes. We demonstrate that equal excitation of the 160 modes of a commercially available, highly multimode circular step index fiber raises the SBS threshold by a factor of 6.5 and find comparable suppression of SBS in similar fibers with a D -shaped cross section.},

  abstract     = {We describe coupled nonequilibrium electron-phonon systems semiclassically—Ehrenfest dynamics for the phonons and quantum mechanics for the electrons—using a classical Monte Carlo approach that determines the nonequilibrium response to a large pump field. The semiclassical approach is expected to be accurate, because the phonons are excited to average energies much higher than the phonon frequency, eliminating the need for a quantum description. The numerical efficiency of this method allows us to perform a self-consistent time evolution out to very long times (tens of picoseconds), enabling us to model pump-probe experiments of a charge-density-wave (CDW) material. Our system is a half-filled, one-dimensional (1D) Holstein chain that exhibits CDW ordering due to a Peierls transition. The chain is subjected to a time-dependent electromagnetic pump field that excites it out of equilibrium, and then a second probe pulse is applied after a time delay. By evolving the system to long times, we capture the complete process of lattice excitation and subsequent relaxation to a new equilibrium, due to an exchange of energy between the electrons and the lattice, leading to lattice relaxation at finite temperatures. We employ an indirect (impulsive) driving mechanism of the lattice by the pump pulse due to the direct driving of the electrons. We identify two driving regimes, where the pump can either cause small perturbations or completely invert the initial CDW order. Our work successfully describes the ringing of the amplitude mode in CDW systems that has long been seen in experiment but never successfully explained by microscopic theory. We also describe the fluence-dependent crossover that inverts the CDW order parameter and changes the phonon dynamics. Finally, we illustrate how this method can examine a number of different types of experiments including photoemission, x-ray diffraction, and two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy.},

Unbound ensembles composed of a deuteron and a third nucleon have been investigated in the past using scattering experiments, and they constitute a fundamental reference in nuclear physics to constrain nuclear interactions and the properties of nuclei. In this work, K + − d and p − d femtoscopic correlations measured by the ALICE Collaboration in proton-proton ( p p ) collisions at s = 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. It is demonstrated that correlations in momentum space between deuterons and kaons or protons allow us to study three-hadron systems at distances comparable with the proton radius. The analysis of the K + − d correlation shows that the relative distances at which deuterons and protons or kaons are produced are around 2 fm. The analysis of the p − d correlation shows that only a full three-body calculation that accounts for the internal structure of the deuteron can explain the data. In particular, the sensitivity of the observable to the short-range part of the interaction is demonstrated. These results indicate that correlations involving light nuclei in p p collisions at the LHC will also provide access to any three-body system in the strange and charm sectors.},

In this study, we use a statistical mechanics approach—the pairwise maximum entropy model—to infer microscopic network features from collective patterns of activity in the larval zebrafish brain and relate these features to the emergence of observed whole-brain dynamics. Our findings indicate that the pairwise interactions between neural populations and their intrinsic activity states are sufficient to explain observed whole-brain dynamics. In fact, the pairwise relationships between neuronal populations estimated with the maximum entropy model strongly correspond to observed structural connectivity patterns. Model simulations also demonstrated how tuning pairwise neuronal interactions drives transitions between observed physiological regimes and pathologically hyperexcitable whole-brain regimes. Finally, we use virtual resection to identify the brain structures that are important for maintaining the brain in a physiological dynamic regime. Together, our results indicate that whole-brain activity emerges from a complex dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction whose strength and topology depend on the connectivity between brain areas.},

We identify new time-dependent states where topological defects periodically oscillate between translational and rotational regimes, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of chirality. Our simulations of active nematohydrodynamics demonstrate that, beyond topology and activity, the dynamics of the active material are profoundly influenced by the local curvature and viscous anisotropy of the underlying droplet, as well as by external hydrodynamic forces stemming from the self-sustained rotational motion of defects.

  abstract     = {Understanding the ability of particles to maneuver through disordered environments is a central problem in innumerable settings, from active matter and biology to electronics. Macroscopic particles ultimately exhibit diffusive motion when their energy exceeds the characteristic potential barrier of the random landscape. In stark contrast, wave-particle duality causes electrons in disordered media to come to rest even when the potential is weak—a remarkable phenomenon known as Anderson localization. Here, we present a hydrodynamic active system with wave-particle features, a millimetric droplet self-guided by its own wave field over a submerged random topography, whose dynamics exhibits localized statistics analogous to those of electronic systems. Consideration of an ensemble of particle trajectories reveals a suppression of diffusion when the guiding wave field extends over the disordered topography. We rationalize mechanistically the emergent statistics by virtue of the wave-mediated resonant coupling between the droplet and topography, which produces an attractive wave potential about the localization region. This hydrodynamic analog, which demonstrates how a classical particle may localize like a wave, suggests new directions for future research in various areas, including active matter, wave localization, many-body localization, and topological matter.},

  abstract     = {In an ideal perfectly straight multimode fiber with a circular core, the symmetry ensures that rotating the input wave front leads to a corresponding rotation of the output wave front. This invariant property, known as the rotational memory effect (RME), remains independent of the typically unknown output profile. The RME thus offers significant potential for imaging and telecommunication applications. However, in real-life fibers, this effect is degraded by intrinsic imperfections and external perturbations, and is challenging to observe because of its acute sensitivity to misalignments and aberrations in the optical setup. Building on a previously established method for precisely estimating fiber transmission properties, we demonstrate an accurate extraction of RME properties. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for both qualitative and quantitative analysis, which specifically links the angular-dependent correlation of the RME to the core deformation’s geometrical properties and the fiber’s mode characteristics. Our theoretical predictions align well with experimental data and simulations for various amounts of fiber distorsion. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to engineer wave fronts with significantly enhanced correlation across all rotation angles. This work enables accurate characterization of distributed disorder from the fabrication process and facilitates calibration-free imaging in multimode fibers.},

  abstract     = {The interplay of dynamical correlations and electronic ordering is pivotal in shaping phase diagrams of correlated quantum materials. In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, transport, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic experiments pinpoint a competition between distinct low-energy states with and without electronic order, as well as between localized and delocalized charge carriers. In this study, we utilize dynamical mean-field theory on the topological heavy fermion model of twisted bilayer graphene to investigate the emergence of electronic correlations and long-range order in the absence of strain. We contrast moment formation, Kondo screening, and ordering on a temperature basis and explain the nature of emergent correlated states based on three central phenomena: (i) the formation of local spin and valley isospin moments around 100 K, (ii) the ordering of the local isospin moments around 10 K preempting Kondo screening, and (iii) a cascadic redistribution of charge between localized and delocalized electronic states upon doping. At integer fillings, we find that low-energy spectral weight is depleted in the symmetric phase, while we find insulating states with gaps enhanced by exchange coupling in the zero-strain ordered phases. Doping away from integer filling results in distinct metallic states: a “bad metal” above the ordering temperature, where scattering off the disordered local moments suppresses electronic coherence, and a “good metal” in the ordered states with coherence of quasiparticles facilitated by isospin order. This finding reveals coherence from order as the microscopic mechanism behind the Pomeranchuk effect observed experimentally by Rozen et al. [ Nature (London) 592 , 214 (2021) ] and by Saito et al. [ Nature (London) 592 , 220 (2021) ]. Upon doping, there is a periodic charge reshuffling between localized and delocalized electronic orbitals leading to cascades of doping-induced Lifshitz transitions, local spectral weight redistributions, and periodic variations of the electronic compressibility ranging from nearly incompressible to negative. Our findings highlight the essential role of charge transfer, hybridization, and ordering in shaping the electronic excitations and thermodynamic properties in twisted bilayer graphene and provide a unified understanding of the most puzzling aspects of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, transport, and compressibility experiments.},

To establish that two mixed states are in the same phase, as defined by their two-way connectivity via local quantum channels, we use the renormalization group (RG) and decoders of quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a real-space RG scheme for mixed states based on local channels which ideally preserve correlations with the complementary system, and we prove this is equivalent to the reversibility of the channel’s action. As an application, we demonstrate an exact RG flow of finite temperature toric code in two dimensions to infinite temperature, thus proving it is in the trivial phase. In contrast, for toric code subject to local dephasing, we establish a mixed-state toric code phase using local channels obtained by truncating an RG-type decoder and the minimum weight perfect matching decoder. We also discover a precise relation between mixed-state phase and decodability, by proving that local noise acting on toric code cannot destroy logical information without bringing the state out of the toric code phase.},

In this work, we show that the resulting Markovian quantum many-body problems can be solved (numerically) exactly and efficiently using tensor network methods for a series of paradigmatic examples, consisting of driven quantum systems coupled to waveguides at several distant points. In particular, we show that our method allows solving problems in so far inaccessible regimes, including problems with arbitrary long time delays and arbitrary numbers of excitations in the delay lines. We obtain solutions for the full real-time dynamics as well as the steady state in all these regimes. Finally, motivated by our results, we develop a novel mean-field approach, which allows us to find the solution semianalytically, and we identify parameter regimes where this approximation is in excellent agreement with our tensor network results.},

  abstract     = {In solution, DNA, the “most important molecule of life,” is a highly charged macromolecule that bears a unit of negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although partially compensated by counterions (cations of the solution) adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened by buffer electrolytes at longer distances from the DNA. This electric field is experienced by any charged or dipolar species approaching and interacting with the DNA. So far, such a field has been explored predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of the water solvent. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of electric field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of such a theory with specially performed, fully atomistic, large-scale, molecular dynamics simulations. Both approaches are applied to unravel the role of the structure of water at close distances to and within the grooves of a DNA molecule in the formation of the electric field. As predicted by the theory and reported by the simulations, the main finding of this study is that oscillations in the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations and are rather distributed according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA leads to a positive electrostatic potential core relative to the bulk, (ii) the Debye length some 10 Å away from the DNA surface is reduced, effectively renormalized by the helical pitch of the DNA molecule, and (iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water, effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA surface, enhance the overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in biology.},

The disease reproduction number or growth rate are universally assumed to measure controllability because and define when infections stop growing and hence the state of critical stability. Outbreaks with larger or are therefore interpreted as less controllable and requiring more stringent interventions. We prove this common interpretation is impractical and incomplete. We identify a positive feedback loop among infections intrinsically underlying disease transmission and evaluate controllability from how interventions disrupt this loop. The epidemic gain and delay margins, which, respectively, define how much we can scale infections (this scaling is known as gain) or delay interventions on this loop before stability is lost, provide rigorous measures of controllability. Outbreaks with smaller margins necessitate more control effort. Using these margins, we quantify how presymptomatic spread, surveillance limitations, variant dynamics, and superspreading shape controllability and demonstrate that and measure controllability only when interventions do not alter timings between the infections and are implemented without delay. Our margins are easily computed, interpreted, and reflect complex relationships among interventions, their implementation, and epidemiological dynamics.},

We have observed, for the first time, the spectroscopic fingerprint of a quantum double-well Hamiltonian when its barrier height is increased: a pairwise level kissing (coalescence) corresponding to the exponential reduction of tunnel splitting in the excited states as they sink under the barrier. The discrete levels in the wells also manifest themselves in the activation time across the barrier which, instead of increasing smoothly as a function of the barrier height, presents steps each time a pair of excited states is captured by the wells. This experiment illustrates the quantum regime of Arrhenius’s law, whose observation is made possible here by the unprecedented combination of low dissipation, time-resolved state control, 98.5% quantum nondemolition single shot measurement fidelity, and complete microwave control over all Hamiltonian parameters in the quantum regime.

Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic (pseudo)vector fields, however, are described by the spin-space groups (SSGs), which were initially used to describe the symmetries of magnetic orders. In SSGs, the real-space and spin degrees of freedom are unlocked in the sense that an operation could have different spatial and spin rotations. SSGs give a complete symmetry description of magnetic structures and have natural applications in the band theory of itinerary electrons in magnetically ordered systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Altermagnetism , a concept raised recently that belongs to the symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders but has nonrelativistic spin plitting, is well described by SSGs. Because of the vast number and complicated group structures, SSGs have not yet been systematically enumerated. In this work, we exhaust SSGs based on the invariant subgroups of SGs, with spin operations constructed from three-dimensional (3D) real representations of the quotient groups for the invariant subgroups. For collinear and coplanar magnetic orders, the spin operations can be reduced into lower-dimensional real representations. As the number of SSGs is infinite, we consider only SSGs that describe magnetic unit cells up to 12 times crystal unit cells. We obtain 157 289 noncoplanar, 24 788 coplanar-noncollinear, and 1421 collinear SSGs. The enumerated SSGs are stored in an online database with a user-friendly interface. We develop an algorithm to identify SSGs for realistic materials and find SSGs for 1626 magnetic materials. We also discuss several potential applications of SSGs, including the representation theory, topological states protected by SSGs, structures of spin textures, and refinement of magnetic neutron diffraction patterns using SSGs. Our results serve as a solid starting point for further studies of symmetry and topology in magnetically ordered materials.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental physical properties, such as phase transitions, electronic structures, and spin excitations, in all magnetic ordered materials, were ultimately believed to rely on the symmetry theory of magnetic space groups. Recently, it has come to light that a more comprehensive group, known as the spin space group (SSG), which combines separate spin and spatial operations, is necessary to fully characterize the geometry and underlying properties of magnetic ordered materials. However, the basic theory of SSG has seldom been developed. In this work, we present a systematic study of the enumeration and the representation theory of the SSG. Starting from the 230 crystallographic space groups and finite translation groups with a maximum order of eight, we establish an extensive collection of over 100 000 SSGs under a four-index nomenclature as well as international notation. We then identify inequivalent SSGs specifically applicable to collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic configurations. To facilitate the identification of the SSG, we develop an online program that can determine the SSG symmetries of any magnetic ordered crystal. Moreover, we derive the irreducible corepresentations of the little group in momentum space within the SSG framework. Finally, we illustrate the SSG symmetries and physical effects beyond the framework of magnetic space groups through several representative material examples, including a candidate altermagnet , spiral spin polarization in the coplanar antiferromagnet , and geometric Hall effect in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet . Our work advances the field of group theory in describing magnetic ordered materials, opening up avenues for deeper comprehension and further exploration of emergent phenomena in magnetic materials.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we exhaust all the spin space symmetries, which fully characterize collinear, noncollinear, and commensurate spiral as well as incommensurate spiral magnetism, etc., and investigate enriched features of electronic bands that respect these symmetries. We achieve this by systematically classifying the so-called spin space groups (SSGs)—joint symmetry groups of spatial and spin operations that leave the magnetic structure unchanged. Generally speaking, they are accurate (approximate) symmetries in systems where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is negligible (finite but weaker than the energy scale of interest), but we also show that specific SSGs could remain valid even in the presence of strong SOC. In recent years, SSGs have played increasingly pivotal roles in various fields such as altermagnetism, topological electronic states, and topological magnon, etc. However, due to its complexity, a complete SSG classification has not been completed up to now. By representing the SSGs as representations, we—for the first time—obtain the complete classifications of 1421, 9542, and 56 512 distinct SSGs for collinear ( ), coplanar ( ), and noncoplanar ( ) magnetism, respectively. SSG not only fully characterizes the symmetry of spin degrees of freedom, but also gives rise to exotic electronic states, which, in general, form projective representations of magnetic space groups (MSGs). Surprisingly, electronic bands in SSGs exhibit features never seen in MSGs, such as (i) nonsymmorphic SSG Brillouin zone, where SSG operations behave as a glide or screw when acting on momentum, (ii) effective flux, where translation operators anticommute with each other and yield duplicate bands, (iii) higher-dimensional representations unexplained by MSGs, and (iv) unconventional spin texture on a Fermi surface, which is completely determined by SSGs, independent of Hamiltonian details. To apply our theory, we identify the SSG for each of the 1595 published magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. Material examples exhibiting the novel features (i)–(iv) are discussed with emphasis. We also investigate new types of SSG-protected topological electronic states that are unprecedented in MSGs. In particular, we propose a 3D topological insulator state with a fourfold degenerate Dirac point on the surface and a new scenario of anomalous helical states that appear on magnetic domain walls.},

  abstract     = {Group-IV color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum networks due to their dominant zero-phonon line and symmetry-protected optical transitions that connect to coherent spin levels. The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV) center possesses long electron spin lifetimes due to its large spin-orbit splitting. However, the magnetic dipole transitions required for microwave spin control are suppressed, and strain is necessary to enable these transitions. Recent work has shown spin control of strained emitters using microwave lines that suffer from Ohmic losses, restricting coherence through heating. We utilize a superconducting coplanar waveguide to measure SnV centers subjected to strain, observing substantial improvement. A detailed analysis of the SnV center electron spin Hamiltonian based on the angle-dependent splitting of the ground and excited states is performed. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation and obtain a Hahn echo coherence time of up to . With dynamical decoupling, we can prolong coherence to , about a sixfold improvement compared to earlier works. We also observe a nearby coupling spin, which may serve as a quantum memory, thus substantiating the potential of SnV centers in diamond and demonstrates the benefit of superconducting microwave structures.},

  abstract     = {Estimating global properties of many-body quantum systems such as entropy or bipartite entanglement is a notoriously difficult task, typically requiring a number of measurements or classical postprocessing resources growing exponentially in the system size. In this work, we address the problem of estimating global entropies and mixed-state entanglement via partial-transposed (PT) moments and show that efficient estimation strategies exist under the assumption that all the spatial correlation lengths are finite. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we identify a set of approximate factorization conditions (AFCs) on the system density matrix, which allow us to reconstruct entropies and PT moments from information on local subsystems. This identification yields a simple and efficient strategy for entropy and entanglement estimation. Our method could be implemented in different ways, depending on how information on local subsystems is extracted. Focusing on randomized measurements providing a practical and common measurement scheme, we prove that our protocol requires only polynomially many measurements and postprocessing operations, assuming that the state to be measured satisfies the AFCs. We prove that the AFCs hold for finite-depth quantum-circuit states and translation-invariant matrix-product density operators and provide numerical evidence that they are satisfied in more general, physically interesting cases, including thermal states of local Hamiltonians. We argue that our method could be practically useful to detect bipartite mixed-state entanglement for large numbers of qubits available in today’s quantum platforms.},

  abstract     = {We present a deterministic algorithm for the efficient evaluation of imaginary-time diagrams based on the recently introduced discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of imaginary-time Green’s functions. In addition to the efficient discretization of diagrammatic integrals afforded by its approximation properties, the DLR basis is separable in imaginary-time, allowing us to decompose diagrams into linear combinations of nested sequences of one-dimensional products and convolutions. Focusing on the strong-coupling bold-line expansion of generalized Anderson impurity models, we show that our strategy reduces the computational complexity of evaluating an M th-order diagram at inverse temperature β and spectral width ω max from O ( ( β ω max ) 2 M − 1 ) for a direct quadrature to O ( M ( log ( β ω max ) ) M + 1 ) , with controllable high-order accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm using third-order expansions for multiband impurity problems with off-diagonal hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, presenting comparisons with exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo approaches. In particular, we perform a self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory calculation for a three-band Hubbard model with strong spin-orbit coupling representing a minimal model of Ca 2 RuO 4 , demonstrating the promise of the method for modeling realistic strongly correlated multiband materials. For both strong and weak coupling expansions of low and intermediate order, in which diagrams can be enumerated, our method provides an efficient, straightforward, and robust blackbox evaluation procedure. In this sense, it fills a gap between diagrammatic approximations of the lowest order, which are simple and inexpensive but inaccurate, and those based on Monte Carlo sampling of high-order diagrams.},

Theories of Z ′ bosons generically contain “noninvertible” chiral symmetries, whose presence indicates a natural paradigm to break this symmetry by an exponentially small amount in an ultraviolet completion. For example, in models of gauged lepton family difference such as the phenomenologically well motivated U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ , there is a noninvertible lepton number symmetry which protects neutrino masses. We embed these theories in gauged non-Abelian horizontal lepton symmetries, e.g., U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ ⊂ SU ( 3 ) H , where the generalized symmetries are broken nonperturbatively by the existence of lepton family magnetic monopoles. In such theories, either Majorana or Dirac neutrino masses may be generated through quantum gauge theory effects from the charged lepton Yukawas, e.g., y ν ∼ y τ exp ( − S inst ) . These theories require no bevy of new fields nor ad hoc additional global symmetries but are instead simple, natural, and predictive: The discovery of a lepton family Z ′ at low energies will reveal the scale at which L μ − L τ emerges from a larger gauge symmetry.},

This work addresses a critical gap in this context by proposing two microcanonical random null models for directed hypergraphs: the directed hypergraph degree model ( dhdm ) and the directed hypergraph JOINT model ( dhjm ). These models preserve essential structural properties of directed hypergraphs such as node in- and out-degree sequences and hyperedge head- and tail-size sequences, or their joint tensor. We also describe two efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, nudhy - degs and nudhy - joint , to sample random hypergraphs from these ensembles. To showcase the interdisciplinary applicability of the proposed null models, we present three distinct use cases in sociology, epidemiology, and economics. First, we reveal the oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the U.S. Congress over a 40-year span, emphasizing the role of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily. Second, we investigate a nonlinear contagion in contact hypernetworks, demonstrating that disparities between simulations and theoretical predictions can be explained by considering higher-order joint degree distributions. Last, we examine the economic complexity of countries in the global trade network, showing that local network properties preserved by nudhy explain the main structural economic complexity indexes. This work advances the development of null models for directed hypergraphs, addressing the intricate challenges posed by their complex entity relations, and providing a versatile suite of tools for researchers across various domains.},

After defining a microscopic model for these systems, we derive continuum equations, exhibiting the formation of active supramolecular assemblies such as micelles, bilayers, and foams. The transition between these structures is driven by a branching instability, which destabilizes the orientational order within the micelles, leading to the growth of bilayers at high microtubule densities. Additionally, we identify a fingering instability, modulating the shape of the micelle interface at high motor densities. We study the role of various mechanisms in these two instabilities, such as contractility, active splay, and anchoring, allowing for generalization beyond the system considered here.},

These bilayer crystals are made possible by the inclusion of an anharmonic trapping potential, which is readily implementable with current technology. We study the normal modes of this system and discover salient differences compared to the modes of single-plane crystals. The bilayer geometry and the unique properties of the normal modes open new opportunities—in particular, in quantum sensing and quantum simulation—that are not straightforward in single-plane crystals. Furthermore, we illustrate that it may be possible to extend the ideas presented here to realize multilayer crystals with more than two layers. Our work increases the dimensionality of trapped-ion systems by efficiently utilizing all three spatial dimensions, and it lays the foundation for a new generation of quantum information processing experiments with multilayer 3D crystals of trapped ions.},

Our focus is on correlations between eigenstates that are specific to spatially extended systems and that characterize entanglement dynamics and operator spreading. In order to isolate these aspects of dynamics from those arising as a result of local conservation laws, we consider Floquet systems in which there are no conserved densities. The correlations associated with scrambling of quantum information lie outside the standard framework established by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In particular, ETH provides a statistical description of matrix elements of local operators between pairs of eigenstates, whereas the aspects of dynamics we are concerned with arise from correlations among sets of four or more eigenstates. We establish the simplest correlation function that captures these correlations and discuss features of its behavior that are expected to be universal at long distances and low energies. We also propose a maximum-entropy ansatz for the joint distribution of a small number n of eigenstates. In the case n = 2 , this ansatz reproduces ETH. For n = 4 it captures both the growth with time of entanglement between subsystems, as characterized by the purity of the time-evolution operator, and also operator spreading, as characterized by the behavior of the out-of-time-order correlator. We test these ideas by comparing results from Monte Carlo sampling of our ansatz with exact diagonalization studies of Floquet quantum circuits.},

While high-resolution magnetic imaging of thin nanoscale samples is well established with electron and soft x-ray microscopy, the extension to micrometer-thick systems currently requires hard x rays, which limits high-resolution imaging to rare-earth magnets. Here, we overcome this limitation by establishing soft x-ray magnetic imaging of micrometer-thick systems using the pre-edge phase x-ray magnetic circular dichroism signal, thus making possible the study of a wide range of magnetic materials. By performing dichroic spectroptychography, we demonstrate high spatial resolution imaging of magnetic samples up to thick, an order of magnitude higher than conventionally possible with soft x-ray absorption-based techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique by harnessing the pre-edge phase to image thick chiral helimagnets, and naturally occurring magnetite particles, gaining insight into their three-dimensional magnetic configuration. This new regime of magnetic imaging makes possible the study of extended non-rare-earth systems that have until now been inaccessible, including magnetic textures for future spintronic applications, non-rare-earth permanent magnets for energy harvesting, and the magnetic configuration of giant magnetofossils.},

  abstract     = {Circumnutations are widespread in plants and typically associated with exploratory movements; however, a quantitative understanding of their role remains elusive. In this study we report, for the first time, the role of noisy circumnutations in facilitating an optimal growth pattern within a crowded group of mutually shading plants. We revisit the problem of self-organization observed for sunflowers, mediated by shade response interactions. Our analysis reveals that circumnutation movements conform to a bounded random walk characterized by a remarkably broad distribution of velocities, covering 3 orders of magnitude. In motile animal systems such wide distributions of movement velocities are frequently identified with enhancement of behavioral processes, suggesting that circumnutations may serve as a source of functional noise. To test our hypothesis, we developed a Langevin-type parsimonious model of interacting growing disks, informed by experiments, successfully capturing the characteristic dynamics of individual and multiple interacting plants. Employing our simulation framework we examine the role of circumnutations in the system, and find that the observed breadth of the velocity distribution represents a sharp transition in the force-noise ratio, conferring advantageous effects by facilitating exploration of potential configurations, leading to an optimized arrangement with minimal shading. These findings represent the first report of functional noise in plant movements and establish a theoretical foundation for investigating how plants navigate their environment by employing computational processes such as task-oriented processes, optimization, and active sensing. Since plants move by growing, space and time are coupled, and dynamics of self-organization lead to emergent 3D patterns. As such, this system provides conceptual insight for other interacting growth-driven systems such as fungal hyphae, neurons and self-growing robots, as well as active matter systems where agents interact with past trajectories of their counterparts, such as stigmergy in social insects. This foundational insight has implications in statistical physics, ecological dynamics, agriculture, and even swarm robotics.},

  abstract     = {The initial immune response to an acute primary infection is a coupled process of antigen proliferation, molecular recognition by naive B cells, and their subsequent clonal expansion. This process contains a fundamental problem: the recognition of an exponentially time-dependent antigen signal. Here, we show that an efficient immune response must be stringently constrained to B-cell lineages with high antigen binding affinity. We propose a tuned proofreading mechanism for primary recognition of new antigens, where the molecular recognition machinery is adapted to the complexity of the immune repertoire. We show that this process produces potent, specific, and fast recognition of antigens, maintaining a spectrum of genetically distinct B-cell lineages as input for affinity maturation. Our analysis maps the proliferation-recognition dynamics of a primary infection to a generalized Luria-Delbrück process, akin to the dynamics of the classic fluctuation experiment. This map establishes a link between signal recognition dynamics and evolution. We derive the resulting statistics of the activated immune repertoire: Antigen binding affinity, expected size, and frequency of active B-cell clones are related by power laws, which define the class of generalized Luria-Delbrück processes. Their exponents depend on the antigen and B-cell proliferation rate, the number of proofreading steps, and the lineage density of the naive repertoire. We extend the model to include spatiotemporal processes, including the diffusion-recognition dynamics of a vaccination. Empirical data of activated mouse immune repertoires are found to be consistent with activation involving about three proofreading steps. The model predicts key clinical characteristics of acute infections and vaccinations, including the emergence of elite neutralizers and the effects of immune aging. More broadly, our results establish infections and vaccinations as a new probe into the global architecture and functional principles of immune repertoires.},

  abstract     = {Exciton-exciton interactions are key to understanding nonlinear optical and transport phenomena in van der Waals heterobilayers, which emerged as versatile platforms to study correlated electronic states. We present a combined theory-experiment study of excitonic many-body effects based on first-principle band structures and Coulomb interaction matrix elements. Key to our approach is the explicit treatment of the fermionic substructure of excitons and dynamical screening effects for density-induced energy renormalization and dissipation. We demonstrate that dipolar blueshifts are almost perfectly compensated by many-body effects, mainly by screening-induced self-energy corrections. Moreover, we identify a crossover between attractive and repulsive behavior at elevated exciton densities. Theoretical findings are supported by experimental studies of spectrally narrow, mobile interlayer excitons in atomically reconstructed, h -BN-encapsulated MoSe 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers. Both theory and experiment show energy renormalization on a scale of a few meV even for high injection densities in the vicinity of the Mott transition. Our results revise the established picture of dipolar repulsion dominating exciton-exciton interactions in van der Waals heterostructures and open up opportunities for their external design.},

In these structures, a promising and yet unexplored avenue for harnessing spin and parity degrees of freedom is offered by JJs with three or more superconducting terminals, where phase-induced spin polarization and transitions of the ground state to an odd parity were predicted to arise. Here we spectroscopically probe the two-dimensional band structure of ABSs in a phase-controlled InAs / Al three-terminal JJ. Andreev bands show signatures of spin-degeneracy breaking, with level splitting in excess of ∼ 9 GHz , and zero-energy crossings associated to ground state fermion parity transitions. Spin splitting and parity transitions are enabled and controlled by locally applied magnetic fluxes, in the absence of Zeeman effect or Coulomb blockade. Our results underscore the potential of multiterminal hybrid devices for phase engineering ABSs, with significant implications for spin- and parity-based quantum devices.},

We have introduced a number of innovations in this field, demonstrating the practical approach of optimizing all the relevant parameters of axion haloscopes, extending presently available technology. The CAPP 12 T magnet with an aperture of 320 mm made of and NbTi superconductors surrounding a 37 l ultralight-weight copper cavity is expected to convert Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky axions into approximately microwave photons per second. A powerful dilution refrigerator, capable of keeping the core system below 40 mK, combined with quantum-noise-limited readout electronics, achieved a total system noise of about 200 mK or below, which corresponds to a background of roughly photons per second within the axion bandwidth. The combination of all those improvements provides unprecedented search performance, imposing the most stringent exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in this frequency range to date. These results also suggest an experimental capability suitable for highly sensitive searches for axion dark matter above 1 GHz.},

Therefore, hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically gated waveguide architecture for field induced dipolar polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and antiblockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are explained using a simple density-dependent dipolar polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world systems undergo abrupt changes in dynamics as they move across critical points, often with dramatic and irreversible consequences. Much existing theory on identifying the time-series signatures of nearby critical points, such as increased signal variance and slower timescales, is derived from analytically tractable systems, typically considering the case of fixed, low-amplitude noise. However, real-world systems are often corrupted by unknown levels of noise that can distort these temporal signatures. Here we aim to develop noise-robust indicators of the distance to criticality (DTC) for systems affected by dynamical noise in two cases: when the noise amplitude is either fixed or is unknown and variable across recordings. We present a highly comparative approach to this problem that compares the ability of over 7000 candidate time-series features to track the DTC in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Our method recapitulates existing theory in the fixed-noise case, highlighting conventional time-series features that accurately track the DTC. But in the variable-noise setting, where these conventional indicators perform poorly, we highlight new types of high-performing time-series features and show that their success is accomplished by capturing the shape of the invariant density (which depends on both the DTC and the noise amplitude) relative to the spread of fast fluctuations (which depends on the noise amplitude). We introduce a new high-performing time-series statistic, the rescaled autodensity (RAD), that combines these two algorithmic components. We then use RAD to provide new evidence that brain regions higher in the visual hierarchy are positioned closer to criticality, supporting existing hypotheses about patterns of brain organization that are not detected using conventional metrics of the DTC. Our results demonstrate how large-scale algorithmic comparison can yield theoretical insights that can motivate new theory and interpretable algorithms for solving important real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {The approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor ⟨ n ( x , t ) n ⟩ , in the presence of a single U ( 1 ) or SU ( 2 ) charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1D Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT, which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore nonlinear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the nonlinear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.},

By analyzing such anomalous assemblies represented in the Protein Data Bank, we identify a series of shells with square-triangular local order and find that most of them originate from short-period approximants of a dodecagonal tiling consisting of square and triangular tiles. Examining the nonequilibrium assembly of such packings, we propose a new method for obtaining periodic square-triangle approximants and then construct the simplest models of tetragonal, octahedral, and icosahedral shells based on cubic and icosahedral nets cut from the approximant structures. Since gluing the nets can change the distances between adjacent vertices of the resulting shell, we introduce an effective energy, the minimization of which equalizes these distances. While the obtained spherical polyhedra reproduce the structures of experimentally observed protein shells and nanoparticles, the principles of protein organization that we lay out, and the ensuing structural models, can help to discover and investigate similar systems in the future.},

By identifying several general structures associated with such problems, we develop a formalism for the robust dynamical decoupling and Hamiltonian engineering of strongly interacting qudit systems. Our formalism significantly simplifies qudit pulse-sequence design while naturally incorporating robustness conditions necessary for experimental practicality. We experimentally demonstrate these techniques in a strongly interacting, disordered ensemble of spin-1 nitrogen-vacancy centers, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in coherence time over existing pulse sequences. We further describe how our techniques enable the engineering of exotic many-body phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, and open up new opportunities for quantum metrology with enhanced sensitivities.

  abstract     = {Fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic qubits often necessitates the use of noisy discrete-variable ancillae. In this work, we establish a comprehensive and practical fault-tolerance framework for such a hybrid system and synthesize it with fault-tolerant protocols by combining bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) and advanced quantum control techniques. We introduce essential building blocks of error-corrected gadgets by leveraging ancilla-assisted bosonic operations using a generalized variant of path-independent quantum control. Using these building blocks, we construct a universal set of error-corrected gadgets that tolerate a single-photon loss and an arbitrary ancilla fault for four-legged cat qubits. Notably, our construction requires only dispersive coupling between bosonic modes and ancillae, as well as beam-splitter coupling between bosonic modes, both of which have been experimentally demonstrated with strong strengths and high accuracy. Moreover, each error-corrected bosonic qubit is comprised of only a single bosonic mode and a three-level ancilla, featuring the hardware efficiency of bosonic QEC in the full fault-tolerant setting. We numerically demonstrate the feasibility of our schemes using current experimental parameters in the circuit-QED platform. Finally, we present a hardware-efficient architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing by concatenating the four-legged cat qubits with an outer qubit code utilizing only beam-splitter couplings. Our estimates suggest that the overall noise threshold can be reached using existing hardware. These developed fault-tolerant schemes extend beyond their applicability to four-legged cat qubits and can be adapted for other rotation-symmetrical codes, offering a promising avenue toward scalable and robust quantum computation with bosonic qubits.},

  abstract     = {Ever since the discovery of the charge density wave (CDW) transition in the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 , the nature of its symmetry breaking has been under intense debate. While evidence suggests that the rotational symmetry is already broken at the CDW transition temperature ( T CDW ), an additional electronic nematic instability well below T CDW has been reported based on the diverging elastoresistivity coefficient in the anisotropic channel ( m E 2 g ). Verifying the existence of a nematic transition below T CDW is not only critical for establishing the correct description of the CDW order parameter, but also important for understanding low-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report elastoresistivity measurements of CsV 3 Sb 5 using three different techniques probing both isotropic and anisotropic symmetry channels. Contrary to previous reports, we find the anisotropic elastoresistivity coefficient m E 2 g is temperature independent, except for a step jump at T CDW . The absence of nematic fluctuations is further substantiated by measurements of the elastocaloric effect, which show no enhancement associated with nematic susceptibility. On the other hand, the symmetric elastoresistivity coefficient m A 1 g increases below T CDW , reaching a peak value of 90 at T * = 20 K . Our results strongly indicate that the phase transition at T * is not nematic in nature and the previously reported diverging elastoresistivity is due to the contamination from the A 1 g channel.},

  abstract     = {A characteristic feature of “quantum chaotic” systems is that their eigenspectra and eigenstates display universal statistical properties described by random matrix theory (RMT). However, eigenstates of local systems also encode structure beyond RMT. To capture this feature, we introduce a framework that allows us to compare the ensemble properties of eigenstates in local systems with those of pure random states. In particular, our framework defines a notion of distance between quantum state ensembles that utilizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to compare the microcanonical distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) of eigenstates with a reference RMT distribution generated by pure random states (with appropriate constraints). This notion gives rise to a quantitative metric for quantum chaos that not only accounts for averages of the distributions but also higher moments. The differences in moments are compared on a highly resolved scale set by the standard deviation of the RMT distribution, which is exponentially small in system size. As a result, the metric can distinguish between chaotic and integrable behaviors and, in addition, quantify and compare the degree of chaos (in terms of proximity to RMT behavior) between two systems that are assumed to be chaotic. We implement our framework in local, minimally structured, Floquet random circuits, as well as a canonical family of many-body Hamiltonians, the mixed-field Ising model (MFIM). Importantly, for Hamiltonian systems, we find that the reference random distribution must be appropriately constrained to incorporate the effect of energy conservation in order to describe the ensemble properties of midspectrum eigenstates. The metric captures deviations from RMT across all models and parameters, including those that have been previously identified as strongly chaotic, and for which other diagnostics of chaos such as level spacing statistics look strongly thermal. In Floquet circuits, the dominant source of deviations is the second moment of the distribution, and this persists for all system sizes. For the MFIM, we find significant variation of the KL divergence in parameter space. Notably, we find a small region where deviations from RMT are minimized, suggesting that “maximally chaotic” Hamiltonians may exist in fine-tuned pockets of parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and manipulating emergent phases, which are themes at the forefront of quantum-materials research, rely on identifying their underlying symmetries. This general principle has been particularly prominent in materials with coupled electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom, in which magnetic order influences the electronic band structure and can lead to exotic topological effects. However, identifying symmetry of a magnetically ordered phase can pose a challenge, particularly in the presence of small domains. Here we introduce a multimodal approach for determining magnetic structures, which combines symmetry-sensitive optical probes, scattering, and group-theoretical analysis. We apply it to , a material that has received attention as a candidate axion insulator. While first-principles calculations predict this state on the assumption of a simple collinear antiferromagnetic structure, subsequent neutron-scattering measurements reveal a much more intricate magnetic ground state characterized by two coexisting magnetic wave vectors reached by successive thermal phase transitions. The proposed high- and low-temperature phases are a spin helix and a state with interpenetrating helical and Néel antiferromagnetic order termed a “broken helix,” respectively. Employing a multimodal approach, we identify the magnetic structure associated with these two phases of . We find that the higher-temperature phase is characterized by a variation of the magnetic moment amplitude from layer to layer, with the moment vanishing entirely in every third Eu layer. The lower-temperature structure is similar to the broken helix, with one important difference: Because of local strain, the relative orientation of the magnetic structure and the lattice is not fixed. Consequently, the symmetry required to protect the axion phase is not generically protected in , but we show that it can be restored if the magnetic structure is tuned with uniaxial strain. Finally, we present a spin Hamiltonian that identifies the spin interactions that account for the complex magnetic order in . Our work highlights the importance of a multimodal approach in determining the symmetry of complex order parameters.},

  abstract     = {Convincing evidence of domain growth in the heating of ultrastable glasses suggests that the equilibration dynamics of supercooled liquids could be driven by a nucleation and growth mechanism. We investigate this possibility by simulating the equilibration dynamics of a model glass during both heating and cooling between poorly and well-annealed states. Though we do observe the growth of domains during heating, we find that domains are absent during cooling. This absence is inconsistent with classical nucleation theory. By comparing the equilibration dynamics of our glass with that of two models with kinetic constraints, we demonstrate that dynamical facilitation generically leads to heating driven by domain growth and cooling without domains. Our results provide strong evidence that dynamical facilitation, not nucleation and interfacial-tension-driven domain growth, is the driving mechanism for the equilibration dynamics of glass formers.},

  abstract     = {Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here, we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence. The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low-dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.},

A number of approaches exist to recover well-defined evolutions under additional Markovian assumptions, but much less is known beyond this regime. Here, we propose a numerical method to cure the complete-positivity violation issue while preserving the non-Markovian features of an arbitrary original dynamical map. The idea is to replace its unphysical Choi operator with its closest physical one, mimicking recent work on quantum process tomography. We also show that the regularized dynamics is more accurate in terms of reproducing the exact dynamics, which allows us to heuristically push the utilization of these master equations in moderate coupling regimes, where the loss of positivity can have a relevant impact.},

  abstract     = {Numerous natural and human-made systems exhibit critical transitions whereby slow changes in environmental conditions spark abrupt shifts to a qualitatively distinct state. These shifts very often entail severe consequences; therefore, it is imperative to devise robust and informative approaches for anticipating the onset of critical transitions. Real-world complex systems can comprise hundreds or thousands of interacting entities, and implementing prevention or management strategies for critical transitions requires knowledge of the exact condition in which they will manifest. However, most research so far has focused on low-dimensional systems and small networks containing fewer than ten nodes or has not provided an estimate of the location where the transition will occur. We address these weaknesses by developing a deep-learning framework which can predict the specific location where critical transitions happen in networked systems with size up to hundreds of nodes. These predictions do not rely on the network topology, the edge weights, or the knowledge of system dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our machine-learning-based framework by considering a diverse selection of systems representing both smooth (second-order) and explosive (first-order) transitions: the synchronization transition in coupled Kuramoto oscillators; the sharp decline in the resource biomass present in an ecosystem; and the abrupt collapse of a Wilson-Cowan neuronal system. We show that our method provides accurate predictions for the onset of critical transitions well in advance of their occurrences, is robust to noise and transient data, and relies only on observations of a small fraction of nodes. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world systems by considering empirical vegetated ecosystems in Africa.},

  abstract     = {Flocking, as paradigmatically exemplified by birds, is the coherent collective motion of active agents. As originally conceived, flocking emerges through alignment interactions between the agents. Here, we report that flocking can also emerge through interactions that turn agents away from each other. Combining simulations, kinetic theory, and experiments, we demonstrate this mechanism of flocking in self-propelled Janus colloids with stronger repulsion on the front than on the rear. The polar state is stable because particles achieve a compromise between turning away from left and right neighbors. Unlike for alignment interactions, the emergence of polar order from turn-away interactions requires particle repulsion. At high concentration, repulsion produces flocking Wigner crystals. Whereas repulsion often leads to motility-induced phase separation of active particles, here it combines with turn-away torques to produce flocking. Therefore, our findings bridge the classes of aligning and nonaligning active matter. Our results could help to reconcile the observations that cells can flock despite turning away from each other via contact inhibition of locomotion. Overall, our work shows that flocking is a very robust phenomenon that arises even when the orientational interactions would seem to prevent it.},

  abstract     = {The fundamental optical excitations of correlated transition-metal compounds are typically identified with multielectronic transitions localized at the transition-metal site, such as transitions. In this vein, intense interest has surrounded the appearance of sharp, below-band-gap optical transitions, i.e., excitons, within the magnetic phase of correlated van der Waals magnets. The interplay of magnetic and charge-transfer insulating ground states in systems raises intriguing questions on the roles of long-range magnetic order and of metal-ligand charge transfer in the exciton nature, which inspired microscopic descriptions beyond typical excitations. Here we study the impact of charge transfer and magnetic order on the excitation spectrum of the nickel dihalides ( , Br, and I) using Ni- edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In all compounds, we detect sharp excitations, analogous to the recently reported excitons, and assign them to spin-singlet multiplets of octahedrally coordinated stabilized by intra-atomic Hund’s exchange. Additionally, we demonstrate that these excitons are dispersive using momentum-resolved RIXS. Our data evidence a ligand-mediated multiplet dispersion, which is tuned by the charge-transfer gap and independent of the presence of long-range magnetic order. This reveals the mechanisms governing nonlocal interactions of on-site excitations with the surrounding crystal or magnetic structure, in analogy to ground-state superexchange. These measurements thus establish the roles of magnetic order, self-doped ligand holes, and intersite-coupling mechanisms for the properties of excitations in charge-transfer insulators.},

  abstract     = {A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact diagonalization quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size, variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: Energy is minimized over a subset of all possible states and then different physical quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success, rigorously speaking, all that variational methods offer are upper bounds on the ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy. However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin- Heisenberg models. To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in a scalable way.},

Here, we demonstrate direct loading of an ensemble of up to 70 atoms into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit. Efficient trap loading is achieved by employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling in the microtrap, where a built-in spin-motion coupling arises directly from the vector light shift of the evanescent-field potential on a microring. Atoms are cooled into the trap via optical pumping with a single free space beam. We have achieved a trap lifetime approaching 700 ms under continuous cooling. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.},

To address this challenge we propose a new logical state-preparation protocol based on locally entangling qubits into small Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states prior to making the stabilizer measurements that place them in the XY-code state. We prove that in this new procedure high-rate errors along a single lattice boundary can cause a logical failure, leading to an almost quadratic reduction in the number of fault configurations compared to the standard state-preparation approach. Moreover, the code becomes equivalent to a repetition code for high-rate errors, guaranteeing a 50% code-capacity threshold during state preparation for infinitely biased noise. With a simple matching decoder we confirm that our preparation protocol outperforms the standard protocol in terms of both threshold and logical error rate in the fault-tolerant regime where measurements are unreliable and at experimentally realistic biases. We also discuss how our state-preparation protocol can be inverted for similar fragile-boundary-mitigated logical-state measurement.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning algorithms demonstrate a surprising ability to learn high-dimensional tasks from limited examples. This is commonly attributed to the depth of neural networks, enabling them to build a hierarchy of abstract, low-dimensional data representations. However, how many training examples are required to learn such representations remains unknown. To quantitatively study this question, we introduce the random hierarchy model: a family of synthetic tasks inspired by the hierarchical structure of language and images. The model is a classification task where each class corresponds to a group of high-level features, chosen among several equivalent groups associated with the same class. In turn, each feature corresponds to a group of subfeatures chosen among several equivalent groups and so on, following a hierarchy of composition rules. We find that deep networks learn the task by developing internal representations invariant to exchanging equivalent groups. Moreover, the number of data required corresponds to the point where correlations between low-level features and classes become detectable. Overall, our results indicate how deep networks overcome the curse of dimensionality by building invariant representations and provide an estimate of the number of data required to learn a hierarchical task.},

This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian and chiral or nonchiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain antiunitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their quantum anomalies, which are sometimes known as Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify chiral states and non-Abelian states enriched by a or symmetry and topological orders and topological orders enriched by a , or symmetry, where , and are lattice symmetries while SO(3) and are spin rotation and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar topological order.},

  abstract     = {In thermal equilibrium the dynamics of phase transitions is largely controlled by fluctuation-dissipation relations: On the one hand, friction suppresses fluctuations, while on the other hand, the thermal noise is proportional to friction constants. Out of equilibrium, this balance dissolves and one can have situations where friction vanishes due to antidamping in the presence of a finite noise level. We study a wide class of field theories where this situation is realized at a phase transition, which we identify as a critical exceptional point. In the ordered phase, antidamping induces a continuous limit cycle rotation of the order parameter with an enhanced number of Goldstone modes. Close to the critical exceptional point, however, fluctuations diverge so strongly due to the suppression of friction that in dimensions they universally either destroy a preexisting static order or give rise to a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. This is demonstrated within a full resummation of loop corrections via Dyson-Schwinger equations for , and a generalization for arbitrary , which can be solved in the long wavelength limit. We show that in order to realize this physics it is not necessary to drive a system far out of equilibrium: Using the peculiar protection of Goldstone modes, the transition from an magnet to a ferrimagnet is governed by an exceptional critical point once weakly perturbed away from thermal equilibrium.},

Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of T d − WTe 2 , 1 T ′ − MoTe 2 , and 2 H − MoTe 2 , as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metallized with an ultrathin layer of palladium. This class of TMDs is known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Transportation and distribution networks are a class of spatial networks that have been of interest in recent years. These networks are often characterized by the presence of complex structures such as central loops paired with peripheral branches, which can appear both in natural and manmade systems, such as subway and railway networks. In this study, we investigate the conditions for the emergence of these nontrivial topological structures in the context of human transportation in cities. We propose a simple model for spatial networks generation, where a network lattice acts as a planar substrate and edge speeds define an effective temporal distance which we aim to optimize and quantifies the efficiency in exploring the urban space. Complex network topologies can be recovered from the optimization of edges’ speeds and we study how the interplay between a flow probability between two nodes in space and the associated travel cost influences the resulting optimal network. In the perspective of urban transportation we simulate these flows by means of human mobility models to obtain origin-destination matrices. We find that when using simple lattices, the obtained optimal topologies transition from treelike structures to more regular networks, depending on the spatial range of flows. Remarkably, we find that branches paired to large loops structures appear as optimal structures when the network is optimized for an interplay between heterogeneous mobility patterns of small range travels and longer-range ones typical of commuting. Moreover, when congestion dynamics in traffic routing is considered, we study the emergence of additional edges from the tree structure to mitigate temporal delays. Finally, we show that our framework is able to recover the statistical spatial properties of the Greater London area subway network.},

  abstract     = {A topological “Thouless” pump represents the quantized motion of particles in response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in physics, because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be robust against perturbations and, thus, technologically useful. So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and interparticle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here, we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilize a two-component Fermi gas in a dynamical superlattice which does not exhibit a sliding motion and remains trivial in the single-particle regime. However, when tuning interparticle interactions from zero to positive values, the system undergoes a transition from being stationary to drifting in one direction, consistent with quantized pumping in the first cycle. Remarkably, the topology of the interacting pump trajectory cannot be adiabatically connected to a noninteracting limit, highlighted by the fact that only one atom is transferred per cycle. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body systems, particularly, the ones with large near- E F density states, are well known for exhibiting rich phase diagrams as a result of enhanced electron correlations. The recently discovered locally noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CeRh 2 As 2 has stimulated extensive attention due to its unusual H − T phase diagram consisting of two-phase superconductivity, antiferromagnetic order, and possible quadrupole-density wave orders. However, the critical near- E F electronic structure remains experimentally elusive. Here, we provide this key information by combining soft-x-ray and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) angle-resolved-photoemission-spectroscopy measurements and atom-resolved density-functional-theory ( DFT ) + U calculations. With bulk-sensitive soft x ray, we reveal quasi-2D hole and electron pockets near the E F . On the other hand, under VUV light, the Ce flat bands are resolved with the c − f hybridization persisting up to well above the Kondo temperature. Most importantly, we observe a symmetry-protected fourfold Van Hove singularity (VHS) coexisting with the Ce 4 f 5 / 2 1 flat bands at the X point, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported before. Such a rare coexistence is expected to lead to a large density of states at the zone edge, a large upper critical field of the odd-parity phase, as well as spin and/or charge instabilities with a vector of ( 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 , 0). Uniquely, it will also result in a new type of f -VHS hybridization that alters the order and fine electronic structure of the VHS and flat bands. Our findings provide not only key insights into the nature of multiple phases in CeRh 2 As 2 but also open up new prospects for exploring the novelties of many-body systems with f -VHS hybridization.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new electrical breakdown mechanism for exciton insulators in the BCS limit, which differs fundamentally from the Zener breakdown mechanism observed in traditional band insulators. Our new mechanism results from the instability of the many-body ground state for exciton condensation, caused by the strong competition between the polarization and condensation energies in the presence of an electric field. We refer to this mechanism as “many-body breakdown.” To investigate this new mechanism, we propose a BCS-type trial wave function under finite electric fields and use it to study the many-body breakdown numerically. Our results reveal two different types of electric breakdown behavior. If the system size is larger than a critical value, the Zener tunneling process is first turned on when an electrical field is applied, but the excitonic gap remains until the field strength reaches the critical value of the many-body breakdown, after which the excitonic gap disappears and the system becomes a highly conductive metallic state. However, if the system size is much smaller than the critical value, the intermediate tunneling phase disappears since the many-body breakdown happens before the onset of Zener tunneling. The sudden disappearance of the local gap leads to an “off-on” feature in the current-voltage ( ) curve, providing a straightforward way to distinguish excitonic insulators from normal insulators.},

  abstract     = {Berry curvature multipoles appearing in topological quantum materials have recently attracted much attention. Their presence can manifest in novel phenomena, such as nonlinear anomalous Hall effects (NLAHE). The notion of Berry curvature multipoles extends our understanding of Berry curvature effects on the material properties. Hence, research on this subject is of fundamental importance and may also enable future applications in energy harvesting and high-frequency technology. It was shown that a Berry curvature dipole can give rise to a second-order NLAHE in materials of low crystalline symmetry. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally new mechanism for Berry curvature multipoles in antiferromagnets that are supported by the underlying magnetic symmetries. Carrying out electric transport measurements on the kagome antiferromagnet FeSn, we observe a third-order NLAHE, which appears as a transverse voltage response at the third harmonic frequency when a longitudinal ac drive is applied. Interestingly, this NLAHE is strongest at and above room temperature. We combine these measurements with a scaling law analysis, a symmetry analysis, model calculations, first-principle calculations, and magnetic Monte Carlo simulations to show that the observed NLAHE is induced by a Berry curvature quadrupole appearing in the spin-canted state of FeSn. At a practical level, our study establishes NLAHE as a sensitive probe of antiferromagnetic phase transitions in other materials—such as moiré superlattices, two-dimensional van der Waal magnets, and quantum spin liquid candidates, which remain poorly understood to date. More broadly, Berry curvature multipole effects are predicted to exist for 90 magnetic point groups. Hence, our work opens a new research area to study a variety of topological magnetic materials through nonlinear measurement protocols.},

The inverse spin Hall current in nickel is found to oscillate with its film thickness, in contrast to nonmagnetic materials, and that the oscillation period quantitatively agrees with theoretical predictions based on differences in the Fermi wave vector between majority and minority carriers.

  abstract     = {The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) is an example of phase transitions beyond the Landau symmetry-breaking paradigm that attracts wide interest. However, its nature has not been settled after decades of study. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed fuzzy-sphere regularization to study the SO(5) nonlinear sigma model with a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten term, which serves as a dual description of the DQCP with an exact SO(5) symmetry. We demonstrate that the fuzzy sphere functions as a powerful microscope, magnifying and revealing a wealth of crucial information about the DQCP, ultimately paving the way toward its final answer. In particular, through exact diagonalization, we provide clear evidence that the DQCP exhibits approximate conformal symmetry. The evidence includes the existence of a conserved SO(5) symmetry current, a stress tensor, and integer-spaced levels between conformal primaries and their descendants. Most remarkably, we identify 23 primaries and 76 conformal descendants. Furthermore, by examining the renormalization group flow of the lowest symmetry singlet as well as other primaries, we provide numerical evidence in favor of DQCP being pseudo-critical, with the approximate conformal symmetry plausibly emerging from nearby complex fixed points. The primary spectrum we compute also has important implications, including the conclusion that the SO(5) DQCP cannot describe a direct transition from the Néel to valence bond solid phase on the honeycomb lattice.},

The bulk electronic structure of FTS is predicted to be topologically nontrivial due to the band inversion between the d x z and p z bands along Γ − Z . However, there remain debates in both the authenticity of the Dirac surface states (DSSs) and the experimental deviations of band structure from the theoretical band inversion picture. Here we resolve these debates through a comprehensive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy investigation. We first observe a persistent DSS independent of k z . Then, by comparing FTS with FeSe, which has no band inversion along Γ − Z , we identify the spectral weight fingerprint of both the presence of the p z band and the inversion between the d x z and p z bands. Furthermore, we propose a renormalization scheme for the band structure under the framework of a tight-binding model preserving crystal symmetry. Our results highlight the significant influence of correlation on modifying the band structure and make a strong case for the existence of topological band structure in this unconventional superconductor.},

Here, we present the first comprehensive study of interacting electrons in finite magnetic field while varying the electron density, twist angle, and heterostrain. Within a panoply of correlated Chern phases emerging at a range of twist angles, we uncover a unified description for the ubiquitous sequence of states with the Chern number for , and . We also find correlated Chern insulators at unconventional sequences with , as well as with fractional , and elucidate their nature.},

  abstract     = {Paramagnetic transition metals play a crucial role as cofactors in various cellular catalytic processes. However, their high concentrations in reactive oxidation states can induce oxidative stress, resulting in cell dysfunction or death. Hence, it is vital to have methods to monitor metal concentrations and paramagnetic properties in cells for medicine and cell biology. Here we present a novel multimodal method for in-cell magnetometry enabling direct measurement of metal magnetic properties within individual cells in tissue, without prior isolation and at room temperature. Individual cell magnetic moments are measured using superresolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) microscopy at 9.4 T by detecting microscopic magnetic-field perturbations around the cells. The cellular metal content is quantified using ion-beam microscopy or synchrotron micro-x-ray fluorescence for the same cells. The metal magnetic susceptibility at 9.4 T is then obtained from the slope of the cell magnetic moments’ dependence on cell metal content. To estimate the susceptibility at lower fields, multifield MR relaxometry and biophysical modeling are employed, extrapolating the 9.4-T susceptibility values to fields as low as 3 T. We apply the new method to determine the susceptibility of iron accumulated in human dopaminergic neurons inside neuromelanin, the by-product of dopamine synthesis. The susceptibility of iron in neuromelanin is measured to be providing unique insights into the biochemistry of iron inside dopaminergic neurons. The obtained value reveals a predominant monoatomic low-affinity iron-binding site within neuromelanin, indicating a higher neurotoxicity of iron than previously suggested. Furthermore, the measured susceptibility value establishes a quantitative relationship between cellular iron concentration and iron-sensitive MRI parameters, which can be noninvasively measured in vivo . This breakthrough paves the way for the in vivo detection of dopaminergic neuron density and iron load, requiring a standard clinical MRI scanner only. It promises to facilitate early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. In conclusion, our presented novel method enables the direct measurements of magnetic properties of paramagnetic metals within single cells with high sensitivity and across large cell groups within a macroscopic volume, providing invaluable information about the cellular biology of metals.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental distinction between many-body quantum states are those with short- and long-range entanglement (SRE and LRE). The latter cannot be created by finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schrödinger cat states, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are known where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such as the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a systematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE is still lacking. Here, we establish that LRE appears upon performing measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases—of which the cluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the Kramers-Wannier transformation by adding a cluster SPT to an input state followed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE and LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the input state is the Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of fermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class of SPT phases protected by symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE upon measuring -charges, and we prove that this persists for generic points in the SPT phase under certain conditions. Our work introduces a new practical tool for using SPT phases as resources for creating LRE, and we uncover the classification result that all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by Jordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment finite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any topological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained from a product state in this way.},

  abstract     = {As a schematic model of the complexity economic agents are confronted with, we introduce the “Sherrington-Kirkpatrick game,” a discrete time binary choice model inspired from mean-field spin glasses. We show that, even in a completely static environment, agents are unable to learn collectively optimal strategies. This is either because the learning process gets trapped in a suboptimal fixed point or because learning never converges and leads to a never-ending evolution of agent intentions. Contrarily to the hope that learning might save the standard “rational expectation” framework in economics, we argue that complex situations are generically unlearnable and agents must do with satisficing solutions, as argued long ago by Simon [ Q. J. Econ. 69 , 99 (1955) ]. Only a centralized, omniscient agent endowed with enormous computing power could qualify to determine the optimal strategy of all agents. Using a mix of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we find that (i) long memory of past rewards is beneficial to learning, whereas overreaction to recent past is detrimental and leads to cycles or chaos; (ii) increased competition (nonreciprocity) destabilizes fixed points and leads first to chaos and, in the high competition limit, to quasicycles; (iii) some amount of randomness in the learning process, perhaps paradoxically, allows the system to reach better collective decisions; (iv) nonstationary, “aging” behavior spontaneously emerges in a large swath of parameter space of our complex but static world. On the positive side, we find that the learning process allows cooperative systems to coordinate around satisficing solutions with rather high (but markedly suboptimal) average reward. However, hypersensitivity to the game parameters makes it impossible to predict ex ante who will be better or worse off in our stylized economy. The statistical description of the space of satisficing solutions is an open problem.},

  abstract     = {Detection of critical slowing down (CSD) is the dominant avenue for anticipating critical transitions from noisy time-series data. Most commonly, changes in variance and lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)] are used as CSD indicators. However, these indicators will only produce reliable results if the noise driving the system is white and stationary. In the more realistic case of time-correlated red noise, increasing (decreasing) the correlation of the noise will lead to spurious (masked) alarms for both variance and AC(1). Here, we propose two new methods that can discriminate true CSD from possible changes in the driving noise characteristics. We focus on estimating changes in the linear restoring rate based on Langevin-type dynamics driven by either white or red noise. We assess the capacity of our new estimators to anticipate critical transitions and show that they perform significantly better than other existing methods both for continuous-time and discrete-time models. In addition to conceptual models, we apply our methods to climate model simulations of the termination of the African Humid Period. The estimations rule out spurious signals stemming from nonstationary noise characteristics and reveal a destabilization of the African climate system as the dynamical mechanism underlying this archetype of abrupt climate change in the past.},

These states have received little attention but are thought to play an important role in laser cooling of such molecules and may be a useful resource for testing fundamental physics. We study a series of inner-shell excited states in YbF using resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy. We investigate the excited states of lowest energy, 8474, 9013, and above the ground state, all corresponding to the configuration of the ion. They are metastable, since they have no electric dipole allowed transitions to the ground state. We also characterize a state at that is easily excited from both the ground and metastable states, which makes it especially useful for this spectroscopic study. Finally, we study two states at 48 720 and , which are above the ionization limit and feature strong autoionizing resonances that prove useful for efficient detection of the molecules and for identifying the rotational quantum number of each line in the spectrum. We resolve the rotational structures of all these states and find that they can all be described by a very simple model based on Hund’s case (c). Our study provides information necessary for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping of YbF, which is an important species for testing fundamental physics. We also consider whether the low-lying inner-shell states may themselves be useful as probes of the electron’s electric dipole moment or of varying fundamental constants, since they are long-lived states in a laser-coolable molecule featuring closely spaced levels of opposite parity.},

These models can be regarded either as random circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics and include many familiar examples of constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax, they must “work out” the other states in the sector to which they belong. When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic but can be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product state. This finding manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved densities. In one example, density modulations of wave vector exhibit almost no relaxation until times , at which point they abruptly collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.},

A nonzero magnetic dipole moment per unit area or “surface magnetization” can arise on particular surfaces of many antiferromagnets due to the bulk magnetic symmetries. Such surface magnetization underlies intriguing physical phenomena like interfacial magnetic coupling and can be used as a readout method of antiferromagnetic domains. However, a universal description of antiferromagnetic surface magnetization is lacking. We first introduce a classification system based on whether the surface magnetization is either sensitive or robust to roughness and on whether the magnetic dipoles at surface of interest are compensated or uncompensated when the bulk magnetic order is retained at the surface. We show that roughness-sensitive categories can be identified by a simple extension of a previously established group-theory formalism for identifying roughness-robust surface magnetization. We then map the group-theory method of identifying surface magnetization to a novel description in terms of bulk magnetic multipoles, which are already established as symmetry indicators for bulk magnetoelectric responses at both linear and higher orders. We use density-functional calculations to illustrate that nominally compensated surfaces in magnetoelectric and centrosymmetric altermagnetic develop a finite magnetization density at the surface, in agreement with our predictions based on both group theory and the ordering of the bulk multipoles. Our analysis provides a comprehensive basis for understanding the surface magnetic properties and their intimate correspondence to bulk magnetoelectric effects in antiferromagnets and has important implications for technologically relevant phenomena such as exchange-bias coupling.},

Knowledge of optimal driving protocols is particularly valuable at the microscale, where energy supply is often limited. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the paradigmatic optimization problem of moving a potential carrying a load through a fluid, in a finite time and over a given distance, in such a way that the required work is minimized. An important step towards more realistic systems is the consideration of memory effects in the surrounding fluid, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Therefore, our experiments were performed in viscous and viscoelastic media, which are typical environments for synthetic and biological processes on the microscale. Despite marked differences between the protocols in both fluids, we find that the optimal control protocol and the corresponding average particle trajectory always obey a time-reversal symmetry. We show that this symmetry, which surprisingly applies here to a class of processes far from thermal equilibrium, holds universally for various systems, including active, granular, and long-range correlated media in their linear regimes. The uncovered symmetry provides a rigorous and versatile criterion for optimal control that greatly facilitates the search for energy-efficient transport strategies in a wide range of systems. Using a machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate that the algorithmic exploitation of time-reversal symmetry can significantly enhance the performance of numerical optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Following the discovery of moiré-driven superconductivity and density waves in twisted-graphene multilayers, twistronics has spurred a surge of interest in tailored broken symmetries through angular rotations enabling new properties, from electronics to photonics and phononics. Analogously, in monoclinic polar crystals a nontrivial angle between nondegenerate dipolar phonon resonances can naturally emerge due to asymmetries in their crystal lattice, and its variations are associated with intriguing polaritonic phenomena, including axial dispersion, i.e., the rotation of the optical axis with frequency, and microscopic shear effects that result in an asymmetric distribution of material loss. So far, these phenomena have been restricted to specific midinfrared frequencies difficult to access with conventional laser sources and fundamentally limited by the degree of asymmetry and by the strength of light-matter interactions available in natural crystals. Here, we leverage the twistronics concept to demonstrate maximal axial dispersion and loss redistribution of hyperbolic waves in elastic metasurfaces, achieved by tailoring the angle between coupled metasurface pairs featuring tailored anisotropy. We show extreme control over elastic wave dispersion and absorption via the twist angle and leverage the resulting phenomena to demonstrate enhanced propagation distance, in-plane reflection-free negative refraction and diffraction-free defect detection. Our work welds the concepts of twistronics, non-Hermiticity, and extreme anisotropy, demonstrating the powerful opportunities enabled by metasurfaces for tunable, highly directional surface-acoustic-wave propagation of great interest for a wide range of applications spanning from seismic mitigation to on-chip phononics and wireless communication systems, hence paving the way toward their translation into emerging photonic and polaritonic metasurface technologies.},

  abstract     = {Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics. Here, we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz [D. Pfau et al. , Phys. Rev. Res. 2 , 033429 (2020) .] for variational Monte Carlo calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitatively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification based on the idea of an antisymmetric geminal power singlet (AGPs) wave function. The new AGPs FermiNet outperforms the original FermiNet significantly in paired systems, giving results which are more accurate than fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and are consistent with experiment. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz , which differs from the original Ansatz only by the method of antisymmetrization, is a strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantages with the original FermiNet: The use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; sand the flexibility of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluid.},

  abstract     = {Programmable quantum devices are now able to probe wave functions at unprecedented levels. This is based on the ability to project the many-body state of atom and qubit arrays onto a measurement basis which produces snapshots of the system wave function. Extracting and processing information from such observations remains, however, an open quest. One often resorts to analyzing low-order correlation functions—that is, discarding most of the available information content. Here, we introduce wave-function networks—a mathematical framework to describe wave-function snapshots based on network theory. For many-body systems, these networks can become scale-free—a mathematical structure that has found tremendous success and applications in a broad set of fields, ranging from biology to epidemics to Internet science. We demonstrate the potential of applying these techniques to quantum science by introducing protocols to extract the Kolmogorov complexity corresponding to the output of a quantum simulator and implementing tools for fully scalable cross-platform certification based on similarity tests between networks. We demonstrate the emergence of scale-free networks analyzing experimental data obtained with a Rydberg quantum simulator manipulating up to 100 atoms. Our approach illustrates how, upon crossing a phase transition, the simulator complexity decreases while correlation length increases—a direct signature of buildup of universal behavior in data space. Comparing experiments with numerical simulations, we achieve cross-certification at the wave-function level up to timescales of with a confidence level of 90% and determine experimental calibration intervals with unprecedented accuracy. Our framework is generically applicable to the output of quantum computers and simulators with in situ access to the system wave function and requires probing accuracy and repetition rates accessible to most currently available platforms.},

  abstract     = {Systems driven far from equilibrium often retain structural memories of their processing history. This memory has, in some cases, been shown to dramatically alter the material response. For example, work hardening in crystalline metals can alter the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength to prevent catastrophic failure. Whether memory of processing history can be similarly exploited in flowing systems, where significantly larger changes in structure should be possible, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a promising route to embedding such useful memories. We build on work showing that exposing a sheared dense suspension to acoustic perturbations of different power allows for dramatically tuning the sheared suspension viscosity and underlying structure. We find that, for sufficiently dense suspensions, upon removing the acoustic perturbations, the suspension shear jams with shear stress contributions from the maximum compressive and maximum extensive axes that reflect or “remember” the acoustic training. Because the contributions from these two orthogonal axes to the total shear stress are antagonistic, it is possible to tune the resulting suspension response in surprising ways. For example, we show that differently trained sheared suspensions exhibit (1) different susceptibility to the same acoustic perturbation, (2) orders of magnitude changes in their instantaneous viscosities upon shear reversal, and (3) even a shear stress that increases in magnitude upon shear cessation. We work through these examples to explain the underlying mechanisms governing each behavior. Then, to illustrate the power of this approach for controlling suspension properties, we demonstrate that flowing states well below the shear jamming threshold can be shear jammed via acoustic training. Collectively, our work paves the way for using acoustically induced memory in dense suspensions to generate rapidly and widely tunable materials.},

In particular, this task requires dealing with difficulties such as stochastic halting times, unidirectional (possibly deterministic) transitions, and restricted initial conditions, features common in real-world computers. Here, we present a framework which tackles all such difficulties by extending the martingale theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to generic nonstationary Markovian processes, including those with broken detailed balance and/or absolute irreversibility. We derive several universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like inequalities that provide both lower and upper bounds on the intrinsic dissipation (mismatch cost) associated with any periodic process—in particular, the periodic processes underlying all current digital computation. Crucially, these bounds apply even if the process has stochastic stopping times, as it does in many computational machines. We illustrate our results with exhaustive numerical simulations of deterministic finite automata processing bit strings, one of the fundamental models of computation from theoretical computer science. We also provide universal equalities and inequalities for the acceptance probability of words of a given length by a deterministic finite automaton in terms of thermodynamic quantities, and outline connections between computer science and stochastic resetting. Our results, while motivated from the computational context, are applicable far more broadly.},

Here we report evidence for multicharge flux quantization in mesoscopic ring devices fabricated using the transition-metal kagome superconductor CsV 3 Sb 5 . We perform systematic magnetotransport measurements and observe unprecedented quantization of magnetic flux in units of h / 4 e and h / 6 e in magnetoresistance oscillations. Specifically, at low temperatures, magnetoresistance oscillations with period h / 2 e are detected, as expected from the flux quantization for charge- 2 e superconductivity. We find that the h / 2 e oscillations are suppressed and replaced by resistance oscillations with h / 4 e periodicity when the temperature is increased. Increasing the temperature further suppresses the h / 4 e oscillations, and robust resistance oscillations with h / 6 e periodicity emerge as evidence for charge- 6 e flux quantization. Our observations provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of multicharge flux quanta and emergent quantum matter exhibiting higher-charge superconductivity in the strongly fluctuating region above the charge- 2 e Cooper pair condensate, revealing new insights into the intertwined and vestigial electronic order in kagome superconductors.},

We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high- n ( n = 79 ) circular states of Sr 88 . We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular-state tweezer trapping exploiting the Sr + core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.},

However, these techniques use large matrices encoding the interactions on dense momentum grids, which reduces computational efficiency and obscures interpretability. For e − ph interactions, existing interpolation techniques leverage locality in real space, but the high dimensionality of the data remains a bottleneck to balance cost and accuracy. Here we show an efficient way to compress e − ph interactions based on singular value decomposition (SVD), a widely used matrix and image compression technique. Leveraging (un)constrained SVD methods, we accurately predict material properties related to e − ph interactions—including charge mobility, spin relaxation times, band renormalization, and superconducting critical temperature—while using only a small fraction (1%–2%) of the interaction data. These findings unveil the hidden low-dimensional nature of e − ph interactions. Furthermore, they accelerate state-of-the-art first-principles e − ph calculations by about 2 orders of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy. Our Pareto-optimal parametrization of e − ph interactions can be readily generalized to electron-electron and electron-defect interactions, as well as to other couplings, advancing quantitative studies of condensed matter.},

  abstract     = {Given a unitary evolution U on a multipartite quantum system and an ensemble of initial states, how well can U be simulated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on that ensemble? We answer this question by establishing a general, efficiently computable upper bound on the maximal LOCC simulation fidelity—what we call an “LOCC inequality.” We then apply our findings to the fundamental setting where U implements a quantum Newtonian Hamiltonian over a gravitationally interacting system. Violation of our LOCC inequality can rule out the LOCCness of the underlying evolution, thereby establishing the nonclassicality of the gravitational dynamics, which can no longer be explained by a local classical field. As a prominent application of this scheme we study systems of quantum harmonic oscillators initialized in coherent states following a normal distribution and interacting via Newtonian gravity, and discuss a possible physical implementation with torsion pendula. One of our main technical contributions is the analytical calculation of the above LOCC inequality for this family of systems. As opposed to existing tests based on the detection of gravitationally mediated entanglement, our proposal works with coherent states alone, and thus it does not require the generation of largely delocalized states of motion nor the detection of entanglement, which is never created at any point in the process.},

  abstract     = {Nonfullerene acceptors have caused a step change in organic optoelectronics research but little is known about the mechanism and factors limiting charge transport in these molecular materials. Here a joint computational-experimental investigation is presented to understand the impact of various sources of disorder on the electron transport in the nonfullerene acceptor O-IDTBR. We find that in single crystals of this material, electron transport occurs in the transient quantum delocalization regime with the excess charge delocalized over about three molecules on average, according to quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular-dynamics simulations. In this regime, carrier delocalization and charge mobility ( μ a = 7 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ) are limited by dynamical disorder of off-diagonal and diagonal electron-phonon coupling. In molecular assemblies representing disordered thin films, the additional static disorder of off-diagonal electron-phonon coupling is sufficient to fully localize the excess electron on single molecules, concomitant with a transition of transport mechanism from transient quantum delocalization to small polaron hopping and a drop in electron mobility by about 1 order of magnitude. Yet, inclusion of static diagonal disorder resulting from electrostatic interactions arising from the acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structure of O-IDTBR, are found to have the most dramatic impact on carrier mobility, resulting in a further drop of electron mobility by about 4–5 orders of magnitude to 10 − 5 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , in good agreement with thin-film electron mobility estimated from space-charge-limited-current measurements. Limitations due to diagonal disorder caused by electrostatic interactions are likely to apply to most nonfullerene acceptors. They imply that while A-D-A or A-DAD-A motifs are beneficial for photoabsorption and exciton transport, the electrostatic disorder they create can limit carrier transport in thin-film optoelectronic applications. This work shows the value of computational methods, in particular, nonadiabatic molecular-dynamics propagation of charge carriers, to distinguish different regimes of transport for different types of molecular packing.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that light propagating in a nonlinear, highly multimode system can thermalize in a manner totally analogous to that encountered in traditional statistical mechanics. At thermal equilibrium, the system’s entropy is at a maximum, in full accord with the second law of thermodynamics. In such arrangements, the entropy is extremized once the statistical power allocation among modes associated with this photon gas attains a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution that is fully characterized by an optical temperature T and a chemical potential μ . However, it has been theoretically argued that the variables T and μ represent actual thermodynamic forces that control the exchange of the respective conjugate quantities between two subsystems. In this work, we report, for the first time, optical calorimetric measurements in nonlinear multimode fibers, which unambiguously demonstrate that both the temperature T and the chemical potential μ dictate the flow of their associated extensive quantities, i.e., the energy and the optical power. Specifically, we study the process of light thermalization associated with two orthogonally polarized laser beams. Our observations are enabled by recently developed techniques that allow one to judiciously multiplex/demultiplex the optical power within various mode groups. Our results indicate that because of photon-photon collisions, “heat” only flows from a hot to a cold photon gas subsystem—thus providing an unequivocal demonstration of the second law in such all-optical thermodynamic arrangements. In addition to being fundamental, our findings provide a new approach to manipulate laser beams using thermodynamic principles.},

Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number | α | 2 . A large two-photon dissipation rate κ 2 ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error-correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here, we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump, and it reaches a rate κ 2 / 2 π ≈ 2 MHz . With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3 s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. In addition, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between | α ⟩ and | − α ⟩ can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.},

  abstract     = {Quantum networks can enable various applications such as distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum communication, and network-based quantum sensing with unprecedented performances. One of the most important building blocks for a quantum network is a photonic quantum memory which serves as the interface between the communication channel and the local functional unit. A programmable quantum memory which can process a large stream of flying qubits and fulfill the requirements of multiple core functions in a quantum network is still to be realized. Here we report a high-performance quantum memory which can simultaneously store 72 optical qubits carried by 144 spatially separated atomic ensembles and support up to a thousand consecutive write or read operations in a random access way, 2 orders of magnitude larger than the previous record. Because of the built-in programmability, this quantum memory can be adapted on demand for several functions. As example applications, we realize quantum queue, stack, and buffer which closely resemble the counterpart devices for classical information processing. We further demonstrate the storage and reshuffle of four entangled pairs of photonic pulses with probabilistic arrival time and arbitrary release order via the memory, which is an essential requirement for the realization of quantum repeaters and efficient routing in quantum networks. Realization of this multipurpose programmable quantum memory thus constitutes a key enabling building block for future large-scale fully functional quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {A direct current through a metal-insulator-metal tunneling junction emits light when surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited. Two distinct processes are believed to coexist in this light emission mediated by surface plasmons: inelastic tunneling, where electrons excite SPPs in the insulator gap, and hot-electron radiative decay, which occurs in the electrodes after elastic tunneling. Previous theoretical approaches to study light emission by inelastic tunneling have relied on Bardeen’s approximation where the electronic wave functions are considered only in the barrier of the junction. In this work, we introduce an extension to models of inelastic tunneling by incorporating the full quantum device solution of the Schrödinger equation, which can also account for processes in the metallic electrodes. The extension unveils the existence of long-range correlations of the current density across the barrier and enables us to establish the equivalence between two models widely used in the past: (i) a calculation of the inelastic transition rate between two states across the barrier based on Fermi’s golden rule and (ii) a calculation of the power transferred to plasmons by current fluctuations. Importantly, the new model accounts for processes that take place in the metallic electrodes and that could not be described within Bardeen’s approximation. Hence, it is no longer necessary to invoke a hot-electron mechanism to obtain a dependence on the geometry of metallic electrodes. The new framework enables to discuss the role of surface plasmons localized in different metal-insulator interfaces and to include possible nonlocal effects at the interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical perturbations modify the states of classical systems in surprising ways and give rise to important applications in science and technology. For example, Floquet engineering exploits the possibility of band formation in the frequency domain when a strong, periodic variation is imposed on parameters such as spring constants. We describe here Kapitza engineering, where a drive field oscillating at a frequency much higher than the characteristic frequencies for the linear response of a system changes the potential energy surface so much that maxima found at equilibrium become local minima, in precise analogy to the celebrated Kapitza pendulum where the unstable inverted configuration, with the mass above rather than below the fulcrum, actually becomes stable. Our starting point is a quantum field theory of the Ginzburg-Devonshire type, suitable for many condensed matter systems, including particularly ferroelectrics and quantum paralectrics. We show that an off-resonance oscillatory electric field generated by a laser-driven terahertz source can induce ferroelectric order in the quantum-critical limit. Heating effects are estimated to be manageable using pulsed radiation; “hidden” radiation-induced order can persist to low temperatures without further pumping due to stabilization by strain. We estimate the Ginzburg-Devonshire free-energy coefficients in SrTiO 3 using density-functional theory and the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation accelerated by a machine-learned force field. Although we find that SrTiO 3 is not an optimal choice for Kapitza stabilization, we show that scanning for further candidate materials can be performed at the computationally convenient density-functional theory level. We suggest second harmonic generation, soft-mode spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction experiments to characterize the induced order.},

We identify a family of interactions satisfying simple kinetic constraints and consider generic translationally invariant models built up from them. We study dynamics following a local unjamming perturbation in a jammed state. We show that they can be mapped into dynamics of ordinary unconstrained systems, but the nonlocality of the mapping changes the scales at which the phenomena manifest themselves. Scattering of quasiparticles, formation of bound states, and eigenstate localization become all visible at macroscopic scales. Depending on whether a symmetry is present or not, the microscopic details of the jammed state turn out to have either a marginal or a strong effect.

  abstract     = {In recent years, nonreciprocally coupled systems have received growing attention. Previous work has shown that the interplay of nonreciprocal coupling and Goldstone modes can drive the emergence of temporal order such as traveling waves. We show that these phenomena are generically found in a broad class of pattern-forming systems, including mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems and viscoelastic active gels. All these systems share a characteristic dispersion relation that acquires a nonzero imaginary part at the edge of the band of unstable modes and exhibit a regime of propagating structures (traveling wave bands or droplets). We show that models for these systems can be mapped to a common “normal form” that can be seen as a spatially extended generalization of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, providing a unifying dynamical-systems perspective. We show that the minimal nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard equations exhibit a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, including interrupted coarsening of traveling waves without selection of a preferred wavelength and transversal undulations of wave fronts in two dimensions. We show that the emergence of traveling waves and their speed are precisely predicted from the local dispersion relation at interfaces far away from the homogeneous steady state. Our work, thus, generalizes previously studied nonreciprocal phase transitions and shows that interfaces are the relevant collective excitations governing the rich dynamical patterns of conserved fields.},

Identifying the layer degree of freedom as a pseudospin allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry while controlling ring-exchange processes and concurrently quenching the kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of interacting Hubbard-Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably, in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we find chiral pseudospin-liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic field. We find that this topologically ordered state remains exceptionally stable toward relevant perturbations. We discuss how layer pseudospin can be probed in near-term experiments. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moiré systems, our approach provides a promising route toward the experimental realization and control of topologically ordered phases of matter.},

A magnetic instability in NdAlSi modifies the carrier relaxation time on “hot spots” in momentum space, causing a strong band filling dependence of μ . We quantitatively derive electronic band parameters from a novel two-band analysis of the Nernst effect S x y , in good agreement with quantum oscillation measurements and band calculations. While the Nernst response of NdAlSi behaves much like conventional semimetals at high temperatures, an additional contribution Δ S xy from electronic correlations appears just above the magnetic transition.

This evidence includes a large manifold of explicitly constructed monopole and bilinear excitations of QED 3 , which is thus shown to serve as an organizing principle of phases of matter in triangular lattice antiferromagnets and their low-lying excitations. Moreover, we observe signatures of emergent valence-bond solid (VBS) correlations, which can be interpreted either as evidence of critical VBS fluctuations of an emergent Dirac spin liquid or as a transition from the 120° Néel order to a VBS whose quantum critical point is described by QED 3 .

We capture these observations with a phenomenological equilibrium model describing the density field of the elastic component to account for phase separation. We show that local elasticity theories are insufficient, even if they allow large shear deformations. Instead, we can account for key observations using a nonlocal elasticity theory to capture the gel’s structure. Analytical approximations unveil that the pattern period is determined by the geometric mean between the elastocapillary length and a nonlocality scale.

  abstract     = {Given a renormalization scheme, we show how to formulate a tractable convex relaxation of the set of feasible local density matrices of a many-body quantum system. The relaxation is obtained by introducing a hierarchy of constraints between the reduced states of ever-growing sets of lattice sites. The coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can be enforced with reasonable computational means. This process can be used to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the ground-state energy of arbitrary local Hamiltonians by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over locally translation-invariant states of n ≳ 100 spins. Beyond this demonstration, the general method can be applied to a wide range of other problems, such as spin systems in higher spatial dimensions, electronic structure problems, and various other many-body optimization problems, such as entanglement and nonlocality detection.},

A natural framework to capture their multiscale nature is that of multilayer networks, where different layers represent distinct physical processes that often regulate each other indirectly. We model these regulatory mechanisms through triadic higher-order interactions between nodes and edges. In this work, we focus on how the different timescales associated with each layer impact their reciprocal effective couplings. First, we rigorously derive a decomposition of the joint probability distribution of any dynamical process acting on such multilayer networks. By inspecting this probabilistic structure, we unravel the general principles governing how information propagates across timescales, elucidating the interplay between mutual information and causality in multiscale systems. In particular, we show that feedback interactions, i.e., those representing regulatory mechanisms from slow to fast variables, generate mutual information between layers. On the contrary, direct interactions, i.e., from fast to slow layers, can propagate this information only under certain conditions that depend solely on the structure of the underlying higher-order couplings. We introduce the mutual information matrix for multiscale observables to capture these emergent functional couplings. We apply our results to study archetypal examples of biological signaling networks and effective environmental dependencies in stochastic processes. Our framework generalizes to any dynamics on multilayer networks, paving the way for a deeper understanding of how the multiscale nature of real-world systems shapes their information content and complexity.},

  abstract     = {The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parametric models. Such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of “building block” features like power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks. Although this approach has yielded great progress in the initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed often leave it unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown autoregressive process over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by an increase in the merger rate beyond redshift z ≈ 0.5 . Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but nonzero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also moderately unlikely to be truly isotropic.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly is a fundamental concept in biology and of significant interest to nanotechnology. Significant progress has been made in characterizing and controlling the properties of the resulting structures, both experimentally and theoretically. However, much less is known about kinetic constraints and determinants of dynamical properties like time efficiency, although these constraints can become severe limiting factors of self-assembly processes. Here, we investigate how the time efficiency and other dynamical properties of reversible self-assembly depend on the morphology (shape) of the building blocks for systems in which the binding energy between the constituents is large. As paradigmatic examples, we stochastically simulate the self-assembly of constituents with triangular, square, and hexagonal morphology into two-dimensional structures of a specified size. We find that the constituents’ morphology critically determines the assembly time and how it scales with the size of the target structure. Our analysis reveals three key structural parameters defined by the morphology: the nucleation size and attachment order, which describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters nucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how the growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this characterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly kinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us to identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a function of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the kinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that could significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial self-assembly processes.},

  abstract     = {Cooling the motion of trapped ions to near the quantum ground state is crucial for many applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, certain motional modes of trapped-ion crystals can be difficult to cool due to weak or zero interaction between the modes and the cooling radiation, typically laser beams. We overcome this challenge by coupling a mode that interacts weakly with cooling radiation to one that interacts strongly with cooling radiation using parametric modulation of the trapping potential, thereby enabling indirect cooling of the weakly interacting mode. In this way, we demonstrate near-ground-state cooling of motional modes with weak or zero cooling radiation interaction in multi-ion crystals of the same and mixed ion species, specifically Be + 9 − Be + 9 , Be + 9 − Mg + 25 , and Be + 9 − Mg + 25 − Be + 9 crystals. This approach can be generally applied to any Coulomb crystal where certain motional modes cannot be directly cooled efficiently, including crystals containing molecular ions, highly charged ions, charged fundamental particles, or charged macroscopic objects.},

Controllable forms of on-chip nonreciprocity are needed for the robust operation of increasingly sophisticated photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the context of classical and quantum computation, networking, communications, and sensing. However, it has been challenging to achieve wideband, low-loss optical nonreciprocity on-chip. In this paper, we demonstrate strong coupling and Rabi-like energy exchange between photonic bands, possessing a continuum of modes, to unlock nonreciprocity and frequency translation over wide optical bandwidths in silicon. Using a traveling-wave phonon field to drive indirect interband photonic transitions, we demonstrate band hybridization that enables an intriguing form of nonreciprocal dissipation engineering. Using the converted mode to create a nonreciprocal dissipation channel, we demonstrate a frequency-neutral, low-loss (less than 1 dB) isolator with high nonreciprocal contrast (more than 14 dB) and broad operating bandwidth (more than 59 GHz). Additionally, through the implementation of complete interband conversion, we demonstrate a high extinction (more than 55 dB) optical frequency translation operation with near-unity efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In neural circuits, synaptic strengths influence neuronal activity by shaping network dynamics, and neuronal activity influences synaptic strengths through activity-dependent plasticity. Motivated by this fact, we study a recurrent-network model in which neuronal units and synaptic couplings are interacting dynamic variables, with couplings subject to Hebbian modification with decay around quenched random strengths. Rather than assigning a specific role to the plasticity, we use dynamical mean-field theory and other techniques to systematically characterize the neuronal-synaptic dynamics, revealing a rich phase diagram. Adding Hebbian plasticity slows activity in already chaotic networks and can induce chaos in otherwise quiescent networks. Anti-Hebbian plasticity quickens activity and produces an oscillatory component. Analysis of the Jacobian shows that Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity push locally unstable modes toward the real and imaginary axes, respectively, explaining these behaviors. Both random-matrix and Lyapunov analysis show that strong Hebbian plasticity segregates network timescales into two bands, with a slow, synapse-dominated band driving the dynamics, suggesting a flipped view of the network as synapses connected by neurons. For increasing strength, Hebbian plasticity initially raises the complexity of the dynamics, measured by the maximum Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, but then decreases these metrics, likely due to the proliferation of stable fixed points. We compute the marginally stable spectra of such fixed points as well as their number, showing exponential growth with network size. Finally, in chaotic states with strong Hebbian plasticity, a stable fixed point of neuronal dynamics is destabilized by synaptic dynamics, allowing any neuronal state to be stored as a stable fixed point by halting the plasticity. This phase of freezable chaos offers a new mechanism for working memory.},

The finite-size error of the correlation energy in periodic coupled cluster calculations for three-dimensional insulating systems has been observed to satisfy the inverse volume scaling, even in the absence of any correction schemes. This is surprising, as simpler theories that utilize only a subset of the coupled cluster diagrams exhibit much slower decay of the finite-size error, which scales inversely with the length of the system. In this study, we review the current understanding of finite-size error in quantum chemistry methods for periodic systems. We introduce new tools that elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in the context of coupled cluster doubles calculations. This reconciles some seemingly paradoxical statements related to finite-size scaling. Our findings also show that singularity subtraction can be a powerful method to effectively reduce finite-size errors in practical quantum chemistry calculations for periodic systems.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear electromagnetic response functions have reemerged as a crucial tool for studying quantum materials, due to recently appreciated connections between optical response functions, quantum geometry, and band topology. Most attention has been paid to responses to spatially uniform electric fields, relevant to low-energy optical experiments in conventional solid state materials. However, magnetic and magnetoelectric phenomena are naturally connected by responses to spatially varying electric fields due to Maxwell’s equations. Furthermore, in the emerging field of moiré materials, characteristic lattice scales are much longer, allowing spatial variation of optical electric fields to potentially have a measurable effect in experiments. In order to address these issues, we develop a formalism for computing linear and nonlinear responses to spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields. Starting with the continuity equation, we derive an expression for the second-quantized current operator that is manifestly conserved and model independent. Crucially, our formalism makes no assumptions on the form of the microscopic Hamiltonian and so is applicable to model Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding or ab initio calculations. We then develop a diagrammatic Kubo formalism for computing the wave vector dependence of linear and nonlinear conductivities, using Ward identities to fix the value of the diamagnetic current order by order in the vector potential. We apply our formula to compute the magnitude of the Kerr effect at oblique incidence for a model of a moiré-Chern insulator and demonstrate the experimental relevance of spatially inhomogeneous fields in these systems. We further show how our formalism allows us to compute the (orbital) magnetic multipole moments and magnetic susceptibilities in insulators. Turning to nonlinear response, we use our formalism to compute the second-order transverse response to spatially varying transverse electric fields in our moiré-Chern insulator model, with an eye toward the next generation of experiments in these systems.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulators and superconductors support extended surface states protected against the otherwise localizing effects of static disorder. Specifically, in the Wigner-Dyson insulators belonging to the symmetry classes A, AI, and AII, a band of extended surface states is continuously connected to a likewise extended set of bulk states forming a “bridge” between different surfaces via the mechanism of spectral flow. In this work we show that this mechanism is absent in the majority of non-Wigner-Dyson topological superconductors and chiral topological insulators. In these systems, there is precisely one point with granted extended states, the center of the band, E = 0 . Away from it, states are spatially localized, or can be made so by the addition of spatially local potentials. Considering the three-dimensional insulator in class AIII and winding number ν = 1 as a paradigmatic case study, we discuss the physical principles behind this phenomenon, and its methodological and applied consequences. In particular, we show that low-energy Dirac approximations in the description of surface states can be treacherous in that they tend to conceal the localizability phenomenon. We also identify markers defined in terms of Berry curvature as measures for the degree of state localization in lattice models, and back our analytical predictions by extensive numerical simulations. A main conclusion of this work is that the surface phenomenology of non-Wigner-Dyson topological insulators is a lot richer than that of their Wigner-Dyson siblings, extreme limits being spectrumwide quantum critical delocalization of all states versus full localization except at the E = 0 critical point. As part of our study we identify possible experimental signatures distinguishing between these different alternatives in transport or tunnel spectroscopy.},

However, tuning both the pump and scattered waves into resonance usually comes with the cost of photon confinement or modal overlap, leading to limited optomechanical coupling. Here, we introduce Bragg scattering to realize strong bulk optomechanical coupling in the same spatial modes of a micron-sized supermode microresonator. A single-photon optomechanical coupling rate up to 12.5 kHz is demonstrated, showing more than 10 times improvement than other devices. Low-threshold phonon lasing and optomechanical strong coupling are also observed for the 10.2-GHz mechanical mode. Our work establishes a compact and efficient paradigm to optically control bulk acoustic phonons, paving the way toward optomechanical coupling at the single-photon level and providing a powerful engine for large-scale integration of quantum networks in which quantum states are massively transferred and stored.},

  abstract     = {Bosonic encoding is an approach for quantum information processing, promising lower hardware overhead by encoding in the many levels of a harmonic-oscillator mode. Scaling to multiple modes requires weak interaction for independent control, yet strong interaction for fast control. Applying fast and efficient universal control on multiple modes remains an open problem. Surprisingly, we find that displacements conditioned on the state of a single-qubit ancilla coupled to multiple harmonic oscillators are sufficient for universal control. We present the conditional- no operation concept, which can be used to reduce the duration of entangling gates. Within this guiding concept, we develop the conditional- not displacement control method which enables fast generation and control of bosonic states in multimode systems weakly coupled to a single-ancilla qubit. Our method is fast despite the weak ancilla coupling. The weak coupling in turn allows for excellent separability and thus independent control. We demonstrate our control on a superconducting transmon qubit weakly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. We create both entangled and separable cat states in different modes of the multimode cavity, showing entangling operations at low crosstalk while maintaining independent control of the different modes. We show that the operation time is not limited by the inverse of the coupling rate, which is the typical timescale, and we exceed it by almost 2 orders of magnitude. We verify our results with an efficient method for measurement of the multimode characteristic function which employs our conditional- not displacement. Our results inspire a new approach toward general entangling operations and allow for fast and efficient multimode bosonic encoding and measurement.},

Thus, understanding how fracture resistance changes with material and sample geometry is an important challenge. A key observation is that thicker elastomers can be significantly tougher than thinner ones. We show that this surprising toughness enhancement in thick samples emerges from the 3D geometry of the fracture process. In contrast to the classical picture of a 2D crack, failure is driven by the growth of two separate “edge” cracks that nucleate early on at a sample’s sides. As loading is increased, these cracks propagate in towards the sample midplane. When they merge, samples reach their ultimate failure strength. In thicker samples, edge cracks need to propagate farther before meeting, resulting in increased sample toughness. We demonstrate that edge-crack growth is controlled by the elastomer’s strain-stiffening properties. Our results have direct implications for how to effectively toughen elastomers by controlling their geometry and large-strain mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {The asymmetric distribution of chiral objects with opposite chirality is of great fundamental interest ranging from molecular biology to particle physics. In quantum materials, chiral states can build on inversion-symmetry-breaking lattice structures or emerge from spontaneous magnetic ordering induced by competing interactions. Although the handedness of a chiral state can be changed through external fields, a spontaneous chirality flipping has yet to be discovered. We present experimental evidence of chirality flipping via changing temperature in a topological magnet EuAl 4 , which features orthogonal spin density waves (SDW) and charge density waves (CDW). Using circular dichroism of Bragg peaks in the resonant magnetic x-ray scattering, we find that the chirality of the helical SDW flips through a first-order phase transition with modified SDW wavelength. Intriguingly, we observe that the CDW couples strongly with the SDW and displays a rare commensurate-to-incommensurate transition at the chirality flipping temperature. Combining with first-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, our results support a Fermi surface origin of the helical SDW with intertwined spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuAl 4 . Our results reveal an unprecedented spontaneous chirality flipping and lay the groundwork for a new functional manipulation of chirality through momentum-dependent spin-charge-lattice interactions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction with erasure qubits promises significant advantages over standard error correction due to favorable thresholds for erasure errors. To realize this advantage in practice requires a qubit for which nearly all errors are such erasure errors, and the ability to check for erasure errors without dephasing the qubit. We demonstrate that a “dual-rail qubit” consisting of a pair of resonantly coupled transmons can form a highly coherent erasure qubit, where transmon T 1 errors are converted into erasure errors and residual dephasing is strongly suppressed, leading to millisecond-scale coherence within the qubit subspace. We show that single-qubit gates are limited primarily by erasure errors, with erasure probability p erasure = 2.19 ( 2 ) × 10 − 3 per gate while the residual errors are ∼ 40 times lower. We further demonstrate midcircuit detection of erasure errors while introducing &lt; 0.1 % dephasing error per check. Finally, we show that the suppression of transmon noise allows this dual-rail qubit to preserve high coherence over a broad tunable operating range, offering an improved capacity to avoid frequency collisions. This work establishes transmon-based dual-rail qubits as an attractive building block for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.},

These units interact with each other in a possibly nonlinear way, which results in a complex dynamics that is generally dissipative and nonstationary. One of the challenges in the modeling of such systems is the identification of not only pairwise but, more importantly, higher-order interactions, together with their directions and strengths from measured multivariate time series. Here, we propose a novel data-driven approach for characterizing interactions of different orders. Our approach is based on solving a set of linear equations constructed from Kramers-Moyal coefficients derived from statistical moments of N -dimensional multivariate time series. We demonstrate the substantial potential for applications by a data-driven reconstruction of interactions in various multidimensional and networked dynamical systems.},

Here, we show how to enhance the quantum correlations in a one-dimensional multimode bosonic Josephson junction, which is a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. Our approach is based on the ability to track the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum properties. After creating a bosonic Josephson junction at the stable fixed point of the classical phase space, we observe squeezing oscillations in the two conjugate variables. We show that the squeezing oscillation frequency can be tuned by more than one order of magnitude, and we are able to achieve a spin squeezing close to 10 dB by utilizing these oscillatory dynamics. The impact of improved spin squeezing is directly revealed by detecting enhanced spatial phase correlations between decoupled condensates. Our work provides new ways for engineering correlations and entanglement in the external degree of freedom of interacting many-body systems.},

We tune the quantum dot ladder into two capacitively coupled channels and exploit Coulomb drag to probe the binding of electrons and holes. Specifically, we shuttle an electron through one leg of the ladder and observe that a hole is dragged along in the second leg under the right conditions. This corresponds to a transition from single-electron transport in one leg to exciton transport along the ladder.

  abstract     = {The opening of an energy gap in the electronic structure generally indicates the presence of interactions. In materials with low carrier density and short screening length, long-range Coulomb interaction favors the spontaneous formation of electron-hole pairs, so called excitons, opening an excitonic gap at the Fermi level. Excitonic materials host unique phenomena associated with pair excitations. However, there is still no generally recognized single-crystal material with excitonic order, which is, therefore, awaited in condensed matter physics. Here, we show that excitonic states may exist in the quasi-one-dimensional material Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 , which has an almost ideal Dirac-like band structure, with the Dirac point located exactly at the Fermi level. We find that an energy gap appears at 350 K, and it grows with decreasing temperature. The spontaneous gap opening is absent in a similar material Ta 2 Ni 3 Te 5 . Intriguingly, the gap is destroyed by the potassium deposition on the crystal, likely due to extra-doped carriers. Furthermore, we observe a pair of in-gap flat bands, which is an analog of the impurity states in a superconducting gap. All these observations can be properly explained by an excitonic order, providing Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 as a new and promising candidate realizing excitonic states.},

  abstract     = {The excitonic insulator (EI) is an exotic ground state of narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals arising from spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs bound by attractive Coulomb interaction. Despite research on EIs dating back to half a century ago, their existence in real materials remains a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, through systematic experimental and theoretical investigations, we provide evidence for the existence of an EI ground state in a van der Waals compound Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 . Density-functional-theory calculations suggest that it is a semimetal with a small band overlap, whereas various experiments exhibit an insulating ground state with a clear band gap. Upon incorporating electron-hole Coulomb interaction into our calculations, we obtain an EI phase where the electronic symmetry breaking opens a many-body gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements exhibit that the band gap is closed with a significant change in the dispersions as the number of thermally excited charge carriers becomes sufficiently large in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. Structural measurements reveal a slight breaking of crystal symmetry with exceptionally small lattice distortion in the insulating state, which cannot account for the significant gap opening. Therefore, we attribute the insulating ground state with a gap opening in Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 to exciton condensation, where the coupling to the symmetry-breaking electronic state induces a subtle change in the crystal structure.},

In the high-field state of layered honeycomb magnet α − RuCl 3 , experimental results supporting these Majorana features have been reported recently. However, there are challenges due to sample dependence, and the impact of inevitable disorder on the KSL is poorly understood. Here, we study how low-energy excitations are modified by introducing point defects in α − RuCl 3 using electron irradiation, which induces site vacancies and exchange randomness. High-resolution measurements of the temperature dependence of specific heat C ( T ) under in-plane fields H reveal that, while the field-dependent Majorana gap is almost intact, additional low-energy states with C / T = A ( H ) T are induced by introduced defects. At low temperatures, we obtain the data collapse of C / T ∼ H − γ ( T / H ) expected for a disordered quantum spin system but with an anomalously large exponent γ . This leads us to find a power-law relationship between the coefficient A ( H ) and the field-sensitive Majorana gap. These results are consistent with the picture that the disorder induces low-energy linear Majorana excitations, which may be considered as a weak localization effect of Majorana fermions in the KSL.},

  abstract     = {In a crystalline solid under mechanical stress, a Frank-Read source is a pinned dislocation segment that repeatedly bows and detaches, generating concentric dislocation loops. We demonstrate that, in nematic liquid crystals, an analogous Frank-Read mechanism can generate concentric disclination loops. Using experiment, simulation, and theory, we study a disclination segment pinned between surface defects on one substrate in a nematic cell. Under applied twist of the nematic director, the pinned segment bows and emits a new disclination loop which expands, leaving the original segment intact; loop emission repeats for each additional 180° of applied twist. We present experimental micrographs showing loop expansion and snap-off, numerical simulations of loop emission under both quasistatic and dynamic loading, and theoretical analysis considering both free energy minimization and the balance of competing forces. We find that the critical stress for disclination loop emission scales as the inverse of segment length and changes as a function of strain rate and temperature, in close analogy to the Frank-Read source mechanism in crystals. Lastly, we discuss how Frank-Read sources could be used to modify microstructural evolution in both passive and active nematics.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking—the phenomenon in which an infinitesimal perturbation can cause the system to break the underlying symmetry—is a cornerstone concept in the understanding of interacting solid-state systems. In a typical series of temperature-driven phase transitions, higher-temperature phases are more symmetric due to the stabilizing effect of entropy that becomes dominant as the temperature is increased. However, the opposite is rare but possible when there are multiple degrees of freedom in the system. Here, we present such an example of a symmetry-ascending phenomenon upon cooling in a magnetic kagome metal FeGe by utilizing neutron Larmor diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. FeGe has a kagome lattice structure with simple A-type antiferromagnetic order below Néel temperature T N ≈ 400 K and a charge density wave (CDW) transition at T CDW ≈ 110 K , followed by a spin-canting transition at around 60 K. In the paramagnetic state at 460 K, we confirm that the crystal structure is indeed a hexagonal kagome lattice. On cooling to around T N , the crystal structure changes from hexagonal to monoclinic with in-plane lattice distortions on the order of 10 − 4 and the associated splitting of the double-degenerate phonon mode of the pristine kagome lattice. Upon further cooling to T CDW , the kagome lattice shows a small negative thermal expansion, and the crystal structure gradually becomes more symmetric upon further cooling. A tendency of increasing the crystalline symmetry upon cooling is unusual; it originates from an extremely weak structural instability that coexists and competes with the CDW and magnetic orders. These observations are against the expectations for a simple model with a single order parameter and hence can only be explained by a Landau free energy expansion that takes into account multiple lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom. Thus, the determination of the crystalline lattice symmetry as well as the unusual spin-lattice coupling is a first step towards understanding the rich electronic and magnetic properties of the system, and it sheds new light on intertwined orders where the lattice degree of freedom is no longer dominant.},

  abstract     = {One of the tenets of molecular biology is that dynamic transitions between three-dimensional structures determine the function of proteins. Therefore, it seems only natural that evolutionary analysis of proteins, presently based mainly on their primary sequence, needs to shift its focus toward their function as assessed by corresponding structural transitions. This can be facilitated by recent progress in cryogenic electron microscopy that provides atomic structures of multiple conformational states for proteins and protein assemblies isolated from evolutionarily related species. In this work, we study evolutionary conservation of multiprotein assembly function by using mechanical strain as a quantitative footprint of structural transitions. We adopt the formalism of finite strain theory, developed in condensed matter physics, and apply it, as a case study, to a classical multiprotein assembly, the ATP synthase. Protein strain analysis provides a precise characterization of rotation domains that agrees with the present biophysical knowledge. In addition, we obtain a strain distribution on the protein structure associated with functional transitions. By analyzing in detail the strain patterns of the chains responsible for ATP synthesis across distinct species, we show that they are evolutionarily conserved for the same functional transition. Such conservation is not revealed by displacement or rotation patterns. Furthermore, within each functional transition, we can identify conserved strain patterns for ATP synthases isolated from different organisms. The observed strain conservation across evolutionary distant species indicates that strain should be essential in future structure-based evolutionary studies of protein function.},

  abstract     = {In conventional ab initio methodologies, phonons are calculated by solving equations of motion involving static interatomic force constants and atomic masses. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where all electronic degrees of freedom are assumed to adiabatically follow the nuclear dynamics, is also adopted. This approach does not fully account for the effects of broken time-reversal symmetry in systems with magnetic order. Recent attempts to rectify this involve the inclusion of the velocity dependence of the interatomic forces in the equations of motion, which accounts for time-reversal symmetry breaking, and can result in chiral phonon modes with nonzero angular momentum even at the zone center. However, since the energy ranges of phonons and magnons typically overlap, the spins cannot be treated as adiabatically following the lattice degrees of freedom. Instead, phonon and spins must be treated on a similar footing. Focusing on zone-center modes, we propose a method involving Hessian matrices and Berry curvature tensors in terms of both phonon and spin degrees of freedom, and describe a first-principles methodology for calculating these. We then solve Lagrange’s equations of motion to determine the energies and characters of the mixed excitations, allowing us to quantify, for example, the energy splittings between chiral pairs of phonons in some cases, and the degree of magnetically induced mixing between infrared and Raman modes in others. The approach is general and can be applied to determine the adiabatic dynamics of any mixed set of slow variables.},

Zero resistivity is achieved at 9 GPa below T c zero ≈ 6.6 K , which increases quickly with pressure to 41 K at 18 GPa. However, the diamagnetic response was not detected in the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 15 GPa, indicating a filamentary nature of the observed superconductivity in the studied pressure range. The constructed T − P phase diagram reveals an intimate relationship between superconductivity, density-wave-like order, and the strange-metal-like behaviors. The observation of zero-resistance state in the polycrystalline La 3 Ni 2 O 7 − δ samples under high pressures not only corroborates the recent report of superconductivity in the pressurized La 3 Ni 2 O 7 crystals but also facilitates further studies on this emerging family of nickelate high- T c superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Micromechanical and nanomechanical systems with exceptionally low dissipation rates are enabling the next-generation technologies of ultrasensitive detectors and quantum information systems. New techniques and methods for lowering the dissipation rate have in recent years been discovered and allowed for the engineering of mechanical oscillators with phononic modes that are extremely well isolated from the environment and thus possess quality factors close to and beyond 1 × 10 9 . A powerful strategy for isolating and controlling a single phononic mode is based on phononic crystal engineering. Here we propose a new method for phononic crystal engineering of nanomechanical oscillators that is based on a periodic variation of the material density. To circumvent the introduction of additional bending losses resulting from the variation of material density, the added mass constitutes an array of nanopillars in which the losses will be diluted. Using this novel technique for phononic crystal engineering, we design and fabricate corrugated mechanical oscillators with quality factors approaching 1 × 10 9 in a room temperature environment. The flexibility space of these new phononic crystals is large and further advancement can be attained through optimized phononic crystal patterning and strain engineering via topology optimization. This will allow for the engineering of mechanical membranes with quality factors beyond 1 × 10 9 at room temperature. Such extremely low mechanical dissipation rates will enable the development of radically new technologies such as quantum-limited atomic force microscopy at room temperature, ultrasensitive detectors of dark matter, spontaneous waveform collapses, gravity, and high-efficiency quantum information transducers.},

  abstract     = {Polarization resolved second-harmonic generation (pSHG) microscopy is increasingly used for mapping organized arrays of noncentrosymmetric proteins such as collagen, myosin, and tubulin, and holds potential for probing their molecular structure and supramolecular organization in intact tissues. However, the contrast mechanism of pSHG is complex and the development of applications in the life sciences is hampered by the lack of models accurately relating the observed pSHG signals to the underlying molecular and macromolecular organization. In this work, we establish a general multiscale numerical framework relating the micrometer-scale SHG measurements to the atomic-scale and molecular structure of the proteins under study and their supramolecular arrangement. We first develop a new method to automatically analyze pSHG signals independently of the protein type and fiber orientation. We then characterize experimentally pSHG signals in live zebrafish larvae and show that they can be used to distinguish collagen, myosin, and tubulin structures in intact tissues. We then introduce a numerical model that considers the peptide bond (PB) as the elementary SHG source in proteins and takes into account the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of PBs to predict the second-order hyperpolarizability tensor β of proteins, as well as the SHG efficiency and pSHG response of an arbitrary macromolecular assembly. We show that this model accurately reproduces pSHG measurements obtained from collagen, myosin, microtubule, and actin structures, revealing the precise dependence of SHG signals on the 3D distribution of PBs within protein assemblies. We then use our model to analyze pSHG from a 3D distribution of microtubule assemblies as a function of out-of-plane angles, angular disorder, and polarity. Finally, we demonstrate that our model predicts SHG from different molecular conformations of tubulin that are highly relevant from a biomedical point of view as associated with microtubules (de)polymerization. By bridging scales from the molecular bonds to the optical wavelength, our model provides an accurate interpretation of SHG signals in terms of protein structure and supramolecular organization.},

  abstract     = {Highly diverse ecosystems exhibit a broad distribution of population sizes and species turnover, where species at high and low abundances are exchanged over time. We show that these two features generically emerge in the fluctuating phase of many-variable model ecosystems with disordered species interactions, when species are supported by migration from outside the system at a small rate. We show that these and other phenomena can be understood through the existence of a scaling regime in the limit of small migration, in which large fluctuations and long timescales emerge. We construct an exact analytical theory for this asymptotic regime that provides scaling predictions on timescales and abundance distributions that are verified exactly in simulations. In this regime, a clear separation emerges between rare and abundant species at any given time, despite species moving back and forth between the rare and abundant subsets. The number of abundant species is found to lie strictly below a well-known stability bound, maintaining the system away from marginality. At the same time, other measures of diversity, which also include some of the rare species, go above this bound. In the asymptotic limit where the migration rate goes to zero, trajectories of individual species abundances are described by non-Markovian jump-diffusion processes, which proceeds as follows: A rare species remains so for some time, then experiences a jump in population sizes after which it becomes abundant (a species turnover event) and later sees its population size gradually decreasing again until rare, due to the competition with other species. The asymmetry of abundance trajectories under time reversal is maintained at a small but finite migration rate. These features may serve as fingerprints of endogenous fluctuations in highly diverse ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {The ultrafast manipulation of quantum material has led to many novel and significant discoveries. Among them, the light-induced transient superconductivity in cuprates achieved by melting competing stripe orders represents a highly appealing accomplishment. However, recent investigations have shown that the notion of photoinduced superconductivity remains a topic of controversy, and its elucidation solely through c -axis time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy remains an arduous task. Here, we measure the in-plane and out-of-plane transient terahertz responses simultaneously in the stripe-ordered nonsuperconducting La 2 − x Ba x CuO 4 after near-infrared excitations. We find that although a pump-induced reflectivity edge appears in the c -axis reflectance spectrum, the reflectivity along the CuO 2 planes decreases simultaneously, indicating an enhancement in the scattering rate of quasiparticles. This in-plane transient response is clearly distinct from the features associated with superconducting condensation. Therefore, we conclude the out-of-plane transient responses cannot be explained by an equivalent of Josephson tunneling. Notably, those pump-induced terahertz responses remain consistent even when we vary the near-infrared optical pump wavelengths and hole concentrations. Our results provide critical evidence that transient three-dimensional superconductivity cannot be induced by melting the competing stripe orders with pump pulses whose photon energy is much higher than the superconducting gap of cuprates.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal gels, sparse particle networks with large voids, are fundamental model systems of disordered porous materials. Unlike dense amorphous solids, they exhibit significant volumetric deformation while expelling solvents when subjected to external compression. Despite their importance in both natural and industrial settings, the relationship between their network microstructure and compressive yielding behavior has remained elusive. To address this problem, we employ confocal microscopy and a specially designed sample cell to observe the gravity-induced collapsing of colloidal gels at a single-particle level. The experimental insight gained is complemented by simulation results for gravitational collapse and homogeneous uniaxial compression. We find that, during compression, the microstructure of gels is uniquely determined solely by the local volume fraction. This relationship remains independent of the deformation strain history but is subtly influenced by the preparation history of the initial state. In contrast, compressive stress evolves as a unique function of local volume fraction, unaffected by both preparation and strain history, as long as the interparticle interaction remains identical. Moreover, we unveil that local yielding occurs in highly strained, narrow network domains, while highly stressed particles form chainlike structures to support the external stress. These findings suggest that colloidal gels undergoing compressive plastic deformation mechanically self-organize into a unique history-independent state to satisfy mechanical balance in a quasistatic condition, providing crucial microscopic insights into the compressive yielding behavior of particle network materials.},

Two different rotational temperatures (approximately 15 K and approximately 40 K), measured by ( 2 + 1 ) resonance-enhanced multiphoton-ionization spectroscopy, are obtained by using a seeded supersonic expansion in He and a pure ammonia expansion, respectively. The experimental data reveal a strong enhancement of the rate coefficients at the lowest collision energies caused by the charge-dipole interaction. Calculations based on a rotationally adiabatic capture model accurately reproduce the observed kinetic-energy dependence of the rate coefficients. The rate coefficients increase with increasing rotational temperature of the ammonia molecules, which contradicts the expectation that rotational excitation should average the dipoles out. Moreover, these reactions exhibit a pronounced inverse kinetic isotope effect. The difference is caused by nuclear-spin-statistical factors and the smaller rotational constants and tunneling splittings in ND 3 .},

  abstract     = {Ramsey interferometry is a widely used tool for precisely measuring transition frequencies between two energy levels of a quantum system, with applications in time keeping, precision spectroscopy, quantum optics, and quantum information. Often, the coherence time of the quantum system surpasses the one of the oscillator probing the system, thereby limiting the interrogation time and associated spectral resolution. Correlation spectroscopy overcomes this limitation by probing two quantum systems with the same noisy oscillator for a measurement of their transition frequency difference; this technique has enabled very precise comparisons of atomic clocks. Here, we extend correlation spectroscopy to the case of multiple quantum systems undergoing strong correlated dephasing. We model Ramsey correlation spectroscopy with N particles as a multiparameter phase estimation problem and demonstrate that multiparticle correlations can assist in reducing the measurement uncertainties even in the absence of entanglement. We derive precision limits and optimal sensing techniques for this problem and compare the performance of probe states and measurement with and without entanglement. Using one- and two-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals with up to 91 qubits, we experimentally demonstrate the advantage of measuring multiparticle correlations for reducing phase uncertainties and apply correlation spectroscopy to measure ion-ion distances, transition frequency shifts, laser-ion detunings, and path-length fluctuations. Our method can be straightforwardly implemented in experimental setups with globally coherent qubit control and qubit-resolved single-shot readout and is, thus, applicable to other physical systems such as neutral atoms in tweezer arrays.},

While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term—equivalently, the adiabatic gauge potential—is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single- and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.},

We show that net transverse OAM per photon can be spatiotemporally imparted to a light pulse only if (1) a transient phase perturbation is well overlapped with the pulse in spacetime, or (2) the pulse initially has nonzero transverse OAM density, and the perturbation removes energy from it. Physical insight is provided by the mechanical analogy of torquing a wheel or removing mass as it spins. Our OAM theory for spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses [S. W. Hancock et al. , Phys.

  abstract     = {We study two-dimensional (2D) droplets of noninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field, placed in a confining potential with arbitrary shape. Using semiclassical methods adapted to the lowest Landau level, we obtain near-Gaussian energy eigenstates that are localized on level curves of the potential and have a position-dependent height. This one-particle insight allows us to deduce explicit formulas for expectation values of local many-body observables, such as density and current, in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, correlations along the edge are long-ranged and inhomogeneous. As we show, this is consistent with the system’s universal low-energy description as a free 1D chiral conformal field theory of edge modes, known from earlier works in simple geometries. A delicate interplay between radial and angular dependencies of eigenfunctions ultimately ensures that the theory is homogeneous in terms of the canonical angle variable of the potential, despite its apparent inhomogeneity in terms of more naïve angular coordinates. Finally, we propose a scheme to measure the anisotropy by subjecting the droplet to microwave radiation; we compute the corresponding absorption rate and show that it depends on the droplet’s shape and the waves’ polarization. These results, both local and global, are likely to be observable in solid-state systems or quantum simulators of 2D electron gases with a high degree of control on the confining potential.},

  abstract     = {Active systems are composed of constituents with interactions that are generically nonreciprocal in nature. Such nonreciprocity often gives rise to situations where conflicting objectives exist, such as in the case of a predator pursuing its prey, while the prey attempts to evade capture. This situation is somewhat reminiscent of those encountered in geometrically frustrated systems where conflicting objectives also exist, which result in the absence of configurations that simultaneously minimize all interaction energies. In the latter, a rich variety of exotic phenomena are known to arise due to the presence of accidental degeneracy of ground states. Here, we establish a direct analogy between these two classes of systems. The analogy is based on the observation that nonreciprocally interacting systems with antisymmetric coupling and geometrically frustrated systems have in common that they both exhibit marginal orbits, which can be regarded as a dynamical system counterpart of accidentally degenerate ground states. The former is shown by proving a Liouville-type theorem. These “accidental degeneracies” of orbits are shown to often get “lifted” by stochastic noise or weak random disorder due to the emergent “entropic force” to give rise to a noise-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking, in a similar manner to the order-by-disorder phenomena known to occur in geometrically frustrated systems. Furthermore, we report numerical evidence of a nonreciprocity-induced spin-glass-like state that exhibits a short-ranged spatial correlation (with stretched exponential decay) and an algebraic temporal correlation associated with the aging effect. Our work establishes an unexpected connection between the physics of complex magnetic materials and nonreciprocal matter, offering a fresh and valuable perspective for comprehending the latter.},

  abstract     = {The deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions enables the exploration of the fundamental properties of matter under extreme conditions. Noncentral collisions can produce strong magnetic fields on the order of 10 18 G , which offers a probe into the electrical conductivity of the QGP. In particular, quarks and antiquarks carry opposite charges and receive contrary electromagnetic forces that alter their momenta. This phenomenon can be manifested in the collective motion of final-state particles, specifically in the rapidity-odd directed flow, denoted as v 1 ( y ) . Here, we present the charge-dependent measurements of d v 1 / d y near midrapidities for π ± , K ± , and p ( p ¯ ) in Au + Au and isobar ( Ru 44 96 + Ru 44 96 and Zr 40 96 + Zr 40 96 ) collisions at s NN = 200 GeV , and in Au + Au collisions at 27 GeV, recorded by the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The combined dependence of the v 1 signal on collision system, particle species, and collision centrality can be qualitatively and semiquantitatively understood as several effects on constituent quarks. While the results in central events can be explained by the u and d quarks transported from initial-state nuclei, those in peripheral events reveal the impacts of the electromagnetic field on the QGP. Our data put valuable constraints on the electrical conductivity of the QGP in theoretical calculations.},

  abstract     = {During embryonic morphogenesis, tissues undergo dramatic deformations in order to form functional organs. Similarly, in adult animals, living cells and tissues are continually subjected to forces and deformations. Therefore, the success of embryonic development and the proper maintenance of physiological functions rely on the ability of cells to withstand mechanical stresses as well as their ability to flow in a collective manner. During these events, mechanical perturbations can originate from active processes at the single-cell level, competing with external stresses exerted by surrounding tissues and organs. However, the study of tissue mechanics has been somewhat limited to either the response to external forces or to intrinsic ones. In this work, we use an active vertex model of a 2D confluent tissue to study the interplay of external deformations that are applied globally to a tissue with internal active stresses that arise locally at the cellular level due to cell motility. We elucidate, in particular, the way in which this interplay between globally external and locally internal active driving determines the emergent mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. For a tissue in the vicinity of a solid-fluid jamming or unjamming transition, we uncover a host of fascinating rheological phenomena, including yielding, shear thinning, continuous shear thickening, and discontinuous shear thickening. These model predictions provide a framework for understanding the recently observed nonlinear rheological behaviors in vivo .},

A close connection between open quantum dynamics and replica symmetry breaking is established, in which individual quantum trajectories are the replicas. We observe that entanglement plays an important role in the emergence of replica symmetry breaking in a fully connected, frustrated spin network of up to 15 spin- 1 / 2 particles. Quantum trajectories of entangled spins reach steady-state spin configurations of lower energy than that of semiclassical trajectories. Cavity emission allows monitoring of the continuous stochastic evolution of spin configurations, while backaction from this projects entangled states into states of broken Ising and replica symmetry. The emergence of spin glass order manifests itself through the simultaneous absence of magnetization and the presence of nontrivial spin overlap density distributions among replicas. Moreover, these overlaps reveal incipient ultrametric order, in line with the Parisi replica symmetry breaking solution for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. A nonthermal Parisi order parameter distribution, however, highlights the driven-dissipative nature of this quantum optical spin glass. This practicable system could serve as a test bed for exploring how quantum effects enrich the physics of spin glasses.},

Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to experimentally demonstrate strongly correlated spin transport in anisotropic Heisenberg magnets, where the magnon-magnon interaction can be tuned 2 orders of magnitude larger than the magnon hopping strength. In our approach, the motion of magnons is controlled by an induced spin-exchange interaction through far off-resonant driving, which enables coherent transport of a single Rydberg excitation across a chain of ground-state atoms. As the most prominent signature of a giant anisotropy, we show that nearby Rydberg excitations form distinct types of magnon-bound states, where a tightly bound pair exhibits frozen dynamics in a fragmented Hilbert space, while a loosely bound pair propagates and establishes correlations beyond a single lattice site. Our scheme complements studies using resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg states and opens the door to exploring quantum thermodynamics with ultrastrong interactions and kinetic constraints.},

We obtain high-resolution transition spectroscopy in a one-dimensional optical lattice, and the measurement of its absolute frequency achieves kHz-level accuracy. Meanwhile, several essential atomic constants are also determined, including the electric-dipole ( E 1 ) magic wavelengths, as well as the hyperpolarizabilities and tensor polarizabilities around the E 1 magic wavelengths. Additionally, we derive the hyperfine constant for the J = 2 state from the measured absolute frequencies 1123 252.3 ± 2.0 kHz , providing a sixfold enhancement in the uncertainty reduction compared to the recent result. We anticipate that this work will prompt further investigation of the additional clock transition at 1695 nm in Y 171 b atoms.

In topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals, nontrivial conical bands with Fermi-arc surface states give rise to negative longitudinal magnetoresistance due to chiral anomaly effect and unusual thickness dependent quantum oscillation from Weyl-orbit effect, which were demonstrated recently in experiments. In this work, we report the experimental observations of large nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport effects for both longitudinal and transverse channels in an untwinned Weyl metal of SrRuO 3 thin film grown on a SrTiO 3 substrate. From rigorous measurements with bias current applied along various directions with respect to the crystalline principal axes, the magnitude of nonlinear Hall signals from the transverse channel exhibits a simple sin α dependence at low temperatures, where α is the angle between bias current direction and orthorhombic [ 001 ] o , reaching a maximum when current is along orthorhombic [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ] o . On the contrary, the magnitude of nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in the longitudinal channel attains a maximum for bias current along [ 001 ] o , and it vanishes for bias current along [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ] o . The observed α -dependent nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in longitudinal and transverse channels reveal a magnetic Weyl phase with an effective Berry curvature dipole along [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ] o from surface states, accompanied by 1D chiral edge modes along [ 001 ] o .},

  abstract     = {The spiking activity of neocortical neurons exhibits a striking level of variability, even when these networks are driven by identical stimuli. The approximately Poisson firing of neurons has led to the hypothesis that these neural networks operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state, neurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. While the models of asynchronous neurons lead to observed spiking variability, it is not clear whether the asynchronous state can also account for the level of subthreshold membrane potential variability. We propose a new analytical framework to rigorously quantify the subthreshold variability of a single conductance-based neuron in response to synaptic inputs with prescribed degrees of synchrony. Technically, we leverage the theory of exchangeability to model input synchrony via jump-process-based synaptic drives; we then perform a moment analysis of the stationary response of a neuronal model with all-or-none conductances that neglects postspiking reset. As a result, we produce exact, interpretable closed forms for the first two stationary moments of the membrane voltage, with explicit dependence on the input synaptic numbers, strengths, and synchrony. For biophysically relevant parameters, we find that the asynchronous regime yields realistic subthreshold variability (voltage variance ≃ 4 – 9 mV 2 ) only when driven by a restricted number of large synapses, compatible with strong thalamic drive. By contrast, we find that achieving realistic subthreshold variability with dense cortico-cortical inputs requires including weak but nonzero input synchrony, consistent with measured pairwise spiking correlations. We also show that, without synchrony, the neural variability averages out to zero for all scaling limits with vanishing synaptic weights, independent of any balanced state hypothesis. This result challenges the theoretical basis for mean-field theories of the asynchronous state.},

The burst occurs above a threshold number of atoms, and its peak power scales faster with the number of atoms than in the case of free-space Dicke superradiance. We measure the first-order coherence of the burst and experimentally distinguish two regimes, one dominated by the coherence induced during the excitation process and the other governed by vacuum fluctuations. Our results shed light on the collective radiative dynamics of cascaded quantum many-body systems, i.e., systems in which each quantum emitter is only driven by light radiated by emitters that are upstream in the cascade.

  abstract     = {The motion of electrons in the vast majority of conductors is diffusive, obeying Ohm’s law. However, the recent discovery and growth of high-purity materials with extremely long electronic mean free paths has sparked interest in non-Ohmic alternatives, including viscous and ballistic flow. Although non-Ohmic transport regimes have been discovered across a range of materials—including two-dimensional electron gases, graphene, topological semimetals, and the delafossite metals—determining their nature has proved to be challenging. Here, we report on a new approach to the problem, employing broadband microwave spectroscopy of the delafossite metal PdCoO 2 in three distinct sample geometries that would be identical for diffusive transport. The observed differences, which go as far as differing power laws, take advantage of the hexagonal symmetry of the conducting Pd planes of PdCoO 2 . This permits a particularly elegant symmetry-based diagnostic for nonlocal electrodynamics, with the result favoring predominantly ballistic over strictly hydrodynamic flow. Furthermore, it uncovers a new effect for ballistic electron flow, owing to the highly faceted shape of the hexagonal Fermi surface. We combine our extensive data set with an analysis of the Boltzmann equation to characterize the nonlocal regime in PdCoO 2 , and we include out-of-plane impurity scattering as a source of apparent momentum-conserving scattering at low temperatures. More broadly, our results highlight the potential of broadband microwave spectroscopy to play a central role in investigating exotic transport regimes in the new generation of ultrahigh-conductivity materials.},

Recent experimental advances have yielded important insights into transition paths, but nonproductive attempts remain little studied experimentally or theoretically, even though they can reveal information about parts of the reaction energy landscape not visited during transition paths. Observing the diffusive dynamics of a bead hopping between bistable optical traps as a model system, we measured the duration, maximum position along the reaction coordinate, and occupancy statistics of unsuccessful crossing attempts. Experimental results agreed quantitatively with expectations of an analytical framework we derived from committor theory. Applying these analyses to a more complex example, DNA hairpin folding under tension, we found that some properties differed from those of transition paths, such as the asymmetric occupancies for folding and unfolding attempts, whereas others were similar, such as the diffusion coefficient reflecting landscape roughness. These results show how nonproductive crossing attempts can be detected and analyzed rigorously, enabling characterization of the full dynamics within the transition region.},

  abstract     = {Allometric relations between two observables are a widespread phenomenon in biology. The volume of nuclei, for example, has frequently been reported to scale linearly with cell volume, V N ∼ V C , but conflicting, sublinear power-law correlations have also been found. Given that nuclei are vital organelles that harbor and maintain the DNA of cells, an understanding of allometric nuclear volumes that ultimately define the concentration and accessibility of chromatin is of great interest. Using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans , we show here that the allometry of nuclei is a dynamically adapting phenomenon; i.e., we find V N ∼ V C α with a time-dependent scaling exponent α (“dynamic allometry”). This finding is due to relaxation growth of nuclear volumes at a rate that scales with cell size. If cell division stops the relaxation of nuclei in a premature stage, α &lt; 1 is observed, whereas completion of relaxation yields α = 1 (“isometry”). Our experimental data are well captured by a simple and supposedly generic model in which nuclear size is determined by the available membrane area that can be integrated into the nuclear envelope to relax the expansion pressure from decondensed chromatin. Extrapolation of our results to growing and proliferating cells suggests that isometric scaling of cell and nuclear volumes is the generic case.},

The oscillating electric field tears electrons off a molecule, accelerates them, and drives them back toward their parent ion within a few femtoseconds. The electrons are then diffracted by the molecular potential, encoding its structure and dynamics with angstrom and attosecond resolutions. Using elliptically polarized laser pulses, we show that laser-induced electron diffraction is sensitive to the chirality of the target. The field selectively ionizes molecules of a given orientation and drives the electrons along different sets of trajectories, leading them to recollide from different directions. Depending on the handedness of the molecule, the electrons are preferentially diffracted forward or backward along the light propagation axis. This asymmetry, reaching several percent, can be reversed for electrons recolliding from two ends of the molecule. The chiral sensitivity of laser-induced electron diffraction opens a new path to resolve ultrafast chiral dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A candidate application for quantum computers is to simulate the low-temperature properties of quantum systems. For this task, there is a well-studied quantum algorithm that performs quantum phase estimation on an initial trial state that has a non-negligible overlap with a low-energy state. However, it is notoriously hard to give theoretical guarantees that such a trial state can be prepared efficiently. Moreover, the heuristic proposals that are currently available, such as with adiabatic state preparation, appear insufficient in practical cases. This paper shows that, for most random sparse Hamiltonians, the maximally mixed state is a sufficiently good trial state, and phase estimation efficiently prepares states with energy arbitrarily close to the ground energy. Furthermore, any low-energy state must have non-negligible quantum circuit complexity, suggesting that low-energy states are classically nontrivial and phase estimation is the optimal method for preparing such states (up to polynomial factors). These statements hold for two models of random Hamiltonians: (i) a sum of random signed Pauli strings and (ii) a random signed d -sparse Hamiltonian. The main technical argument is based on some new results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory. In particular, a refined concentration bound for the spectral density is required to obtain complexity guarantees for these random Hamiltonians.},

There is a great potential in harnessing the striking phenomenology of active matter to build novel controllable and responsive materials that surpass passive ones. Yet, we currently lack a systematic roadmap to predict the protocols driving active systems between different states in a way that is thermodynamically optimal. Equilibrium thermodynamics is an inadequate foundation to this end, due to the dissipation rate arising from the constant fuel consumption in active matter. Here, we derive and implement a versatile framework for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Combining recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and response theory, our approach shows how to find the optimal control for either continuous- or discrete-state active systems operating out of equilibrium. Our results open the door to designing novel active materials that are not only built to stabilize specific nonequilibrium collective states but are also optimized to switch between different states at minimum dissipation.},

  abstract     = {While several numerical techniques are available for predicting the dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems, most struggle with simulations for very long memory and propagation times, e.g., due to superlinear scaling with the number of time steps n . Here, we introduce a numerically exact algorithm to calculate process tensors—compact representations of environmental influences—which provides a scaling advantage over previous algorithms by leveraging self-similarity of the tensor networks that represent the environment. It is applicable to environments with Gaussian statistics, such as for spin-boson-type open quantum systems. Based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, our approach requires only O ( n log n ) singular value decompositions for environments with infinite memory. Where the memory can be truncated after n c time steps, a nominal scaling O ( n c log n c ) is found, which is independent of n . This improved scaling is enabled by identifying process tensors with repeatable blocks. To demonstrate the power and utility of our approach, we provide three examples. (1) We calculate the fluorescence spectra of a quantum dot under both strong driving and strong dot-phonon couplings, a task requiring simulations over millions of time steps, which we are able to perform in minutes. (2) We efficiently find process tensors describing superradiance of multiple emitters. (3) We explore the limits of our algorithm by considering coherence decay with a very strongly coupled environment. The observed computation time is not necessarily proportional to the number of singular value decompositions because the matrix dimensions also depend on the number of time steps. Nevertheless, quasilinear and sublinear scaling of computation time is found in practice for a wide range of parameters. While there are instances where existing methods can achieve comparable nominal scaling by precalculating effective propagators for time-independent or periodic system Hamiltonians, process tensors contain all the information needed to extract arbitrary multitime correlation functions of the system when driven by arbitrary time-dependent system Hamiltonians. The algorithm we present here not only significantly extends the scope of numerically exact techniques to open quantum systems with long memory times, but it also has fundamental implications for the simulation complexity of tensor network approaches.},

  abstract     = {Many organisms exhibit branching morphologies that twist around each other and become entangled. Entanglement occurs when different objects interlock with each other, creating complex and often irreversible configurations. This physical phenomenon is well studied in nonliving materials, such as granular matter, polymers, and wires, where it has been shown that entanglement is highly sensitive to the geometry of the component parts. However, entanglement is not yet well understood in living systems, despite its presence in many organisms. In fact, recent work has shown that entanglement can evolve rapidly and play a crucial role in the evolution of tough, macroscopic multicellular groups. Here, through a combination of experiments, simulations, and numerical analyses, we show that growth generically facilitates entanglement for a broad range of geometries. We find that experimentally grown entangled branches can be difficult or even impossible to disassemble through translation and rotation of rigid components, suggesting that there are many configurations of branches that growth can access that agitation cannot. We use simulations to show that branching trees readily grow into entangled configurations. In contrast to nongrowing entangled materials, these trees entangle for a broad range of branch geometries. We, thus, propose that entanglement via growth is largely insensitive to the geometry of branched trees but, instead, depends sensitively on timescales, ultimately achieving an entangled state once sufficient growth has occurred. We test this hypothesis in experiments with snowflake yeast, a model system of undifferentiated, branched multicellularity, showing that lengthening the time of growth leads to entanglement and that entanglement via growth can occur for a wide range of geometries. Taken together, our work demonstrates that entanglement is more readily achieved in living systems than in their nonliving counterparts, providing a widely accessible and powerful mechanism for the evolution of novel biological material properties.},

  abstract     = {Owing to their strong dipole moment and long coherence times, superconducting qubits have demonstrated remarkable success in hybrid quantum circuits. However, most qubit architectures are limited to the GHz frequency range, severely constraining the class of systems they can interact with. The fluxonium qubit, on the other hand, can be biased to very low frequency while being manipulated and read out with standard microwave techniques. Here, we design and operate a heavy fluxonium with an unprecedentedly low transition frequency of 1.8 MHz. We demonstrate resolved sideband cooling of the “hot” qubit transition with a final ground state population of 97.7%, corresponding to an effective temperature of 23 μ K . We further demonstrate coherent manipulation with coherence times T 1 = 34 μ s , T 2 * = 39 μ s , and single-shot readout of the qubit state. Importantly, by directly addressing the qubit transition with a capacitively coupled waveguide, we showcase its high sensitivity to a radio-frequency field. Through cyclic qubit preparation and interrogation, we transform this low-frequency fluxonium qubit into a frequency-resolved charge sensor. This method results in a charge sensitivity of 33 μ e / Hz , or an energy sensitivity (in joules per hertz) of 2.8 ℏ . This method rivals state-of-the-art transport-based devices, while maintaining inherent insensitivity to dc-charge noise. The high charge sensitivity combined with large capacitive shunt unlocks new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena in the 1–10 MHz range, such as the strong-coupling regime with a resonant macroscopic mechanical resonator.},

To this end, much optical atomic clock research has focused on reducing clock instability by increasing the atom number, lengthening the coherent interrogation times, and introducing entanglement to push beyond the standard quantum limit. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach to reducing clock instability using a phase estimation approach based on individually controlled atomic ensembles in a strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock. We first demonstrate joint Ramsey interrogation of two spatially resolved atom ensembles that are out of phase with respect to each other, which we call “quadrature Ramsey spectroscopy,” resulting in a factor of 1.36(5) reduction in absolute clock instability as measured with interleaved self-comparisons. We then leverage the rich hyperfine structure of Sr 87 to realize independent coherent control over multiple ensembles with only global laser addressing. Finally, we utilize this independent control over four atom ensembles to implement a form of phase estimation, achieving a factor of greater than 3 enhancement in coherent interrogation time and a factor of 2.08(6) reduction in instability over an otherwise identical single-ensemble clock with the same local oscillator and the same number of atoms. We expect that multiensemble protocols similar to those demonstrated here will result in reduction in the instability of any optical lattice clock with an interrogation time limited by the local oscillator.},

Indeed, our new neutron diffraction measurements on the hydrothermally grown Ce 2 Sn 2 O 7 powders show a broad signal at low scattering wave vectors, reminiscent of a dipolar spin ice, in striking contrast from previous powder neutron diffraction on samples grown from solid-state synthesis, which found diffuse scattering at high scattering wave vectors associated with magnetic octupoles and suggested an octupolar quantum spin ice state. We conclude that new hydrothermally grown Ce 2 Sn 2 O 7 samples host a finite-temperature proximate dipolar spin ice phase, above the expected transition to AIAO Néel order.},

  abstract     = {Moiré materials provide fertile ground for the correlated and topological quantum phenomena. Among them, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, in which the Hall resistance is quantized even under zero magnetic field, is a direct manifestation of the intrinsic topological properties of a material and an appealing attribute for low-power electronics applications. The QAH effect has been observed in both graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré materials. It is thought to arise from the interaction-driven valley polarization of the narrow moiré bands. Here, we show that the newly discovered QAH state in AB-stacked MoTe 2 / W S e 2 moiré bilayers is not valley polarized but valley coherent. The layer- and helicity-resolved optical spectroscopy measurement reveals that the QAH ground state possesses spontaneous spin (valley) polarization aligned (antialigned) in two TMD layers. In addition, saturation of the out-of-plane spin polarization in both layers occurs only under high magnetic fields, supporting a canted spin texture. Our results call for a new mechanism for the QAH effect and highlight the potential of TMD moiré materials with strong electronic correlations and spin-orbit interactions for exotic topological states.},

  abstract     = {Exotic quantum many-body states, such as Haldane and spin liquid phases, can exhibit remarkable features like fractional excitations and non-Abelian statistics and offer new understandings of quantum entanglement in many-body quantum systems. These phases are classified by nonlocal correlators that can be directly measured in atomic analog quantum simulating platforms, such as optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays. However, characterizing these phases in large systems is experimentally challenging because they are sensitive to local errors like atom loss, which suppress its signals exponentially. Additionally, protocols for systematically identifying and mitigating uncorrelated errors in analog quantum simulators are lacking. Here, we address these challenges by developing an error-correction method for large-scale neutral atom quantum simulators using optical lattices. Our error-correction method can distinguish correlated particle-hole pairs from uncorrelated holes in the Mott insulator. After removing the uncorrelated errors, we observe a dramatic improvement in the nonlocal parity correlator and find the perimeter scaling law. Furthermore, the error model provides a statistical estimation of fluctuations in site occupation, from which we measure the generalized brane correlator and confirm that it can be an order parameter for Mott insulators in two dimensions. Our work provides a promising avenue for investigating and characterizing exotic phases of matters in large-scale quantum simulators.},

  abstract     = {Soap bubbles are simple, yet very unique and marvelous objects. They exhibit a number of interesting properties such as beautiful interference colors and the formation of minimal surfaces. Various optical phenomena have been studied in soap films and bubbles, but so far they have not been employed as optical cavities. Here we demonstrate that dye doped soap or smectic liquid crystal bubbles can support whispering gallery mode lasing, which is observed in the spectrum as hundreds of regularly spaced peaks, resembling a frequency comb. The lasing enabled the measurement of size changes as small as 10 nm in a millimeter-sized, ∼ 100 − nm -thick bubble. Bubble lasers were used as extremely sensitive electric field sensors with a smallest measurable electric field of 110 Vm − 1 Hz − 1 / 2 . They also enable the measurement of pressures up to a 100 bar with a resolution of 1.5 Pa, resulting in a dynamic range of almost 10 7 . By connecting the bubble to a reservoir of air, almost arbitrarily low pressure changes can be measured while maintaining an outstanding dynamic range. The demonstrated soap bubble lasers are a very unique type of microcavities which are one of the best electric field and pressure microsensors to date and could in the future also be employed to study thin films and cavity optomechanics.},

  abstract     = {The discrepancies between reality and simulation impede the optimization and scalability of solid-state quantum devices. Disorder induced by the unpredictable distribution of material defects is one of the major contributions to the reality gap. We bridge this gap using physics-aware machine learning, in particular, using an approach combining a physical model, deep learning, Gaussian random field, and Bayesian inference. This approach enables us to infer the disorder potential of a nanoscale electronic device from electron-transport data. This inference is validated by verifying the algorithm’s predictions about the gate-voltage values required for a laterally defined quantum-dot device in AlGaAs/GaAs to produce current features corresponding to a double-quantum-dot regime.},
