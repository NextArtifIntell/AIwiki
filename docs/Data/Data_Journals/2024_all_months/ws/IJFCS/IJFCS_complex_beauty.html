  abstract     = {The fault tolerance of an interconnection network of parallel and distributed systems can be evaluated by various topological parameters of its underlying graph G , with strong Menger edge connectivity being a vital parameter in this regard. A connected graph G is called strongly Menger edge connected ( SM - Œª ) if it connects any pair of vertices u and v with min { d G ( u ) , d G ( v ) } number of edge-disjoint paths. Under the uniform distribution of faults in a large interconnection network, it is improbable that each faulty edge incident to a vertex will occur simultaneously. Thus, m -strongly Menger edge connected of order t was introduced in 2018 by He et¬†al. Here, G is called as m -strongly Menger edge connected of order t , if G ‚àí F remains SM - Œª , where F is an arbitrary edge set in a graph G with | F | ‚â§ m and the minimum degree of the remaining graph Œ¥ ( G ‚àí F ) ‚â• t . The largest m keeping the property of G ‚àí F being SM - Œª is denoted as s m Œª t ( G ) . Among variants of hypercube, the n -dimensional folded-crossed hypercube F C Q n attracts attention in recent years. In this paper, we focus on calculating the exact value of the maximum conditional edge-fault-tolerant number of order t of F C Q n , s m Œª t ( F C Q n ) = 2 t ( n + 1 ‚àí t ) ‚àí ( n + 1 ) for two integers 1 ‚â§ t ‚â§ n ‚àí 2 and n ‚â• 3 .},

We analyze the model of a combinatorial two-sided search by allowing more moves of the searched object after each test. We give strategies and show that they are optimal. We consider adaptive and non-adaptive strategies. We show the surprising result that with the combinatorial two-sided search on a path graph, the optimal non-adaptive search needs the same number of tests as the corresponding adaptive strategy does. The strategy obtained can also be used as an encoding strategy to sent the position of a moving element through a transmission channel.},

  abstract     = {The two currently fastest general-purpose integer factorization algorithms are the Quadratic Sieve and the Number Field Sieve. Both techniques are used to find so-called smooth values of certain polynomials, i.e., values that factor completely over a set of small primes (the factor base). As the names of the methods suggest, a sieving procedure is used for the task of quickly identifying smooth values among the candidates in a certain range. While the Number Field Sieve is asymptotically faster, the Quadratic Sieve is still considered the most efficient factorization technique for numbers up to around 100 digits. In this paper, we challenge the Quadratic Sieve by presenting a novel approach based on representing smoothness candidates as sums that are always divisible by several of the primes in the factor base. The resulting values are generally smaller than those considered in the Quadratic Sieve, increasing the likelihood of them being smooth. Using the fastest implementations of the Self-initializing Quadratic Sieve in Python as benchmarks, a Python implementation of our approach runs consistently 5 to 7 times faster for numbers with 45‚Äì100 digits, and around 10 times faster for numbers with 30‚Äì40 digits. We discuss several avenues for further improvements and applications of the technique.},

The weight of a T2RDF h of G is the value h ( V ) = ‚àë u ‚àà V | h ( u ) | . The total 2-rainbow domination number is the minimum weight of a T2RDF on G and is denoted by Œ≥ t r 2 ( G ) . The minimum total 2-rainbow domination problem (MT2RDP) is to find a T2RDF of minimum weight in the input graph. In this article, we show that the problem of deciding if G has a T2RDF of weight at most l for star convex bipartite graphs, comb convex bipartite graphs, split graphs and planar graphs is NP-complete. On the positive side, we show that MT2RDP is linear time solvable for threshold graphs, chain graphs and bounded tree-width graphs. On the approximation point of view, we show that MT2RDP cannot be approximated within ( 1 ‚àí ùúñ ) ln | V | for any ùúñ &gt; 0 unless P=NP and also propose 2 ( ln ( Œî ‚àí 0 . 5 ) + 1 . 5 ) -approximation algorithm for it. Further, we show that MT2RDP is APX-complete for graphs with maximum degree 4. Next, it is shown that domination problem and the total 2-rainbow domination problems are not equivalent in computational complexity aspects. Finally, an integer linear programming formulation for MT2RDP is presented.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding maximum (or minimum) witnesses of the Boolean product of two Boolean matrices (MW for short) has a number of important applications, in particular the all-pairs lowest common ancestor (LCA) problem in directed acyclic graphs (dags). The best known upper time-bound on the MW problem for n √ó n Boolean matrices of the form O ( n 2 . 5 7 5 ) has not been substantially improved since 2006. In order to obtain faster algorithms for this problem, we study quantum algorithms for MW and approximation algorithms for MW (in the classical computational model). Some of our quantum algorithms are input or output sensitive. Our fastest quantum algorithm for the MW problem, and consequently for the related problems, runs in time √ï ( n 2 + Œª / 2 ) = √ï ( n 2 . 4 3 4 ) , where Œª satisfies the equation œâ ( 1 , Œª , 1 ) = 1 + 1 . 5 Œª and œâ ( 1 , Œª , 1 ) is the exponent of the multiplication of an n √ó n Œª matrix by an n Œª √ó n matrix. Next, we consider a relaxed version of the MW problem (in the classical model) asking for reporting a witness of bounded rank (the maximum witness has rank 1) for each non-zero entry of the matrix product. First, by adapting the fastest known algorithm for maximum witnesses, we obtain an algorithm for the relaxed problem that reports for each non-zero entry of the product matrix a witness of rank at most ‚Ñì in time √ï ( ( n / ‚Ñì ) n œâ ( 1 , log n ‚Ñì , 1 ) ) . Then, by reducing the relaxed problem to the so called k -witness problem, we provide an algorithm that reports for each non-zero entry C [ i , j ] of the product matrix C a witness of rank O ( ‚åà W C ( i , j ) / k ‚åâ ) , where W C ( i , j ) is the number of witnesses for C [ i , j ] , with high probability. The algorithm runs in √ï ( n œâ k 0 . 4 6 5 3 + n 2 + o ( 1 ) k ) time, where œâ = œâ ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) .},

A class of channel assignment problem in cellular network can be formulated as a distance graph coloring problem in regular grid graphs. The cellular network is often modelled as an infinite hexagonal grid H , and hence determining œá ‚Ñì ( H ) has relevance from practical point of view.

  abstract     = {Correlation clustering problem (CorCP) is a classical clustering problem, which clusters data based on the similarity of data set, and has many applications in interaction networks, cross-lingual link detection, and communication networks, etc. In this paper, we study a practical generalization of the CorCP, called the capacitated correlation clustering problem (the capacitated CorCP), by constructing a labeled complete graph. On this labeled complete graph, each vertex represents a piece of data. If two pieces of data are similar, then the edge between the corresponding vertices is marked by a positive label +. Otherwise, this edge is marked by a negative label -. The objective of the capacitated CorCP is to group some similar data sets into one cluster as far as possible, while satisfying the cluster capacity constraint. To achieve this objective, we shall partition the vertex set of the labeled complete graph into several clusters, each cluster‚Äôs size subjecting to an upper bound, so as to minimize the number of disagreements. Here the number of disagreements is defined as the total number of the edges with positive labels between clusters and the edges with negative labels within clusters. Different with the previous algorithm in [18], which subjects to the constraint on the cluster size by a penalty measure, we design an algorithm for the capacitated CorCP to directly output a feasible solution by iteratively constructing clusters based on a preset threshold. Through carefully setting the threshold and sophisticatedly analyzing, our algorithm is proved to have an improved approximation ratio of 5.37. In addition, we also conduct a series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Given a graph G , Minimum Connected Power Domination is to find a connected power dominating set of minimum cardinality of G and Decide Connected Power Domination is the decision version of Minimum Connected Power Domination. Decide Connected Power Domination is known to be N P -complete for general graphs. In this paper, we prove that Decide Connected Power Domination remains N P -complete for star-convex bipartite graphs, perfect elimination bipartite graphs and split graphs. This answers some open problems posed in [B. Brimkov, D. Mikesell and L. Smith, Connected power domination in graphs, J. Comb. Optim. 38 (1) (2019) 292‚Äì315]. On the positive side, we show that Minimum Connected Power Domination is polynomial-time solvable for chain graphs, a proper subclass of perfect elimination bipartite graph, and for threshold graphs, a proper subclass of split graphs. Further, we show that Minimum Connected Power Domination cannot be approximated within ( 1 ‚àí ùúñ ) ln | V | for any ùúñ &gt; 0 unless P = N P , for bipartite graphs as well as for chordal graphs. Finally, we show that Minimum Connected Power Domination is APX -hard for bounded degree graphs.},

Investigating the relationship between Th-hierarchy and W-hierarchy, we discuss the complexity of transforming Threshold circuits into Boolean circuits, and observe that sorting networks are powerful tools to handle such transformations. First, we show that these hierarchies collapse at the last level (W[P] = Th[P]). After that, we present a time complexity analysis of an AKS sorting network construction, which supports some of our results. Finally, we prove that Th[ t ] ‚äÜ W[SAT] for every t ‚àà ‚Ñï .

  abstract     = {The Linear Layout of Graphs problem asks, given a graph G and a positive integer k , whether G admits a layout consisting of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into k sets such that the edges in each set meet some special requirements. Specific linear layouts include k -Stack Layout, k -Queue Layout, k -Arch Layout, Mixed s -Stack q -Queue Layout and others. In this paper, we present a unified approach for kernelization of these linear layout problems parameterized by the vertex cover number œÑ of the input graph. The key point underlying our approach is to partition each set of related vertices into two distinct subsets with respect to the specific layouts, which immediately leads to some efficient reduction rules. We first apply this approach to the Mixed s -Stack q -Queue Layout problem and show that it admits a kernel of size 2 ùí™ ( œÑ ) , which results in an algorithm running in time ùí™ ( 2 2 ùí™ ( œÑ ) + œÑ ‚ãÖ | V | ) , where | V | denotes the size of the input graph. Our work does not only confirm the existence of a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for this problem mentioned by Bhore et¬†al. (J. Graph Algorithms Appl. 2022), but also derives new results for the k -Stack Layout problem and for the k -Queue Layout problem respectively. We also employ this approach to the Upward k -Stack Layout problem and obtain a new result improving that presented by Bhore et¬†al. (GD 2021). Last but not least, we use this approach to the k -Arch Layout problem and obtain a similar result.},

More specifically, we show that this problem parameterized by both the bound number b of crossings per edge and the vertex cover number œÑ of the input graph admits an algorithm with running time in ( b + 2 ) ùí™ ( œÑ 3 ) ‚ãÖ n , and this problem parameterized by both the bound number b of crossings per edge and the pathwidth Œ∫ of the vertex ordering admits an algorithm with running time in ( b + 2 ) ùí™ ( Œ∫ 2 ) ‚ãÖ n . Our results provide a specific answer to Bhore et al. ‚Äôs question.},

  abstract     = {Let ùíØ = { T 1 , T 2 , ‚Ä¶ , T k } be a set of k ‚â• 2 spanning trees in a graph G . The k spanning trees are called completely independent spanning trees (CISTs for short) if the paths joining every pair of vertices x and y in any two trees have neither vertex nor edge in common except for x and y . Particularly, ùíØ is called a dual-CIST provided k = 2 . For data transmission applications in reliable networks, the existence of a dual-CIST can provide a configuration of fault-tolerant routing called protection routing. This paper investigates the problem of constructing a dual-CIST in the n -dimensional hierarchical folded cubic network H F Q n . The network is a two-level network using folded hypercube F Q n as clusters to reduce the diameter, hardware overhead and improve the fault tolerance ability. We propose a recursive algorithm to construct a dual-CIST of H F Q n in ùí™ ( 2 2 n ) time for n ‚â• 2 , where the time required is the same scale as the number of vertices of H F Q n . Also, the diameter of each constructed CIST is 4 n + 1 .},

  abstract     = {Robust subgroup multisignature allows any subgroup of signers from a global set to sign a given message on behalf of the whole group, and the individual signatures should be verified before the combination process, which resists poison signature attacks. An emerging application of robust subgroup multisignatures in blockchain is that a qualified subgroup of a global set of users has reached agreement. In the integrated blockchain and edge computing system, the edge server can naturally act as a combiner in multisignatures and help other end devices produce the final aggregate signature. In this paper, we propose a robust subgroup multisignature with one-time public keys in order that has two advantages for solving the signers ordering problem and one-time public key problem simultaneously. Our scheme is a nontrivial extension of Galindo et¬†al .‚Äôs robust subgroup multisignature scheme and can be proven unforgeable, robust and chronological in random oracles.

It is shown that the new encryption scheme based on McEliece, even if it has longer public keys, is not more secure than the standard one. The security gap between the original scheme and its modification is presented. Moreover, while the proposed parameters for the digital signature scheme lead to a significant performance improvement, however, they introduce a vulnerability in the protocol.

Given a constant t &gt; 1 , a spanning subgraph G ‚Ä≤ of G is said to be a t -spanner, or simply a spanner, if for any pair of nodes p , q in G there exists a t -path in G ‚Ä≤ , i.e., a path between p and q whose length is at most t times their distance in G . Gap-greedy spanner, proposed by Arya and Smid, is a light weight and bounded degree spanner in which a pair of points p , q is guaranteed to have a t -path, if there exists at least one edge with some special criteria in the spanner. Existing algorithms for computing the gap-greedy spanner determine the existence of such an edge for each pair of points by examining the edges of the spanner, which takes O ( n ) time, however in this paper, we have presented a method by which this task can be done in O ( 1 ) time. Using the proposed method and well-separated pair decomposition , we have proposed a linear-space algorithm that can compute the gap-greedy spanner in O ( n 2 ) time. How to use the well-separated pair decomposition to compute this spanner was proposed by Bakhshesh and Farshi, however using an example, we have shown that one of the algorithms they have proposed for this purpose is incorrect. We have performed various experiments to measure the duration and amount of memory used by the algorithms for computing this spanner. The results of these experiments showed that the proposed method, without a significant effect on the amount of memory consumed compared to previous algorithms, leads to a significant acceleration in the construction time of this spanner.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with designing algorithms for and analyzing the computational complexity of the partial vertex cover problem in trees. Graphs (and trees) are frequently used to model risk management in various systems. In particular, Caskurlu et al. in [4] have considered a system which essentially represents a tripartite graph. The goal in this model is to reduce the risk in the system below a predefined risk threshold level. It can be shown that the main goal in this risk management system can be formulated as a Partial Vertex Cover problem on bipartite graphs. In this paper, we focus on a special case of the partial vertex cover problem, when the input graph is a tree. We consider four possible versions of this setting, depending on whether or not, the vertices and edges are weighted. Two of these versions, where edges are assumed to be unweighted, are known to be polynomial-time solvable. However, the computational complexity of this problem with weighted edges, and possibly with weighted vertices, remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to resolve these questions by fully characterizing which variants of partial vertex cover remain NP-hard in trees, and which can be solved in polynomial time. In the paper, we propose two pseudo-polynomial DP-based algorithms for the most general case in which weights are present on both the edges and the vertices of the tree. One of these algorithms leads to a polynomial-time procedure, when weights are confined to the edges of the tree. The insights used in this algorithm are combined with additional scaling ideas to derive an FPTAS for the general case. A secondary contribution of this work is to propose a novel way of using centroid decompositions in trees, which could be useful in other settings as well.},

Node and link residual closeness measure the vulnerability even when the removal of nodes or links does not disconnect the network. Node and link residual closeness are of great theoretical and practical significance to network design and optimization.

Node protection in terms of node importance is an effective way to ensure the reliable communication of networks. Thus, the protection of influential node detected by node importance evaluation is beneficial to strengthen the invulnerability and robustness of networks. In this work, the network agglomeration method based on node contraction is utilized to evaluate the influence of nodes and identify important nodes in five kinds of interconnection networks. We show that the agglomeration method, which takes both the degree and position into account, is valid and feasible for these five interconnection networks.},

  abstract     = {Rotation symmetric Boolean functions are good candidates for stream ciphers because they have such advantages as simple structure, high operational speed and low implement cost. Recently, Mesnager et¬†al . proposed for the first time an efficient method to construct balanced rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and good nonlinearity for an arbitrary even number of variables. However, the algebraic degree of their constructed n -variable ( n &gt; 4 ) function is always less than the maximum value n ‚àí 1 . In this paper, by modifying the support of Boolean functions from Mesnager et¬†al .‚Äôs construction, we present two new constructions of balanced even-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity as well as higher algebraic degree and nonlinearity. The algebraic degree of Boolean functions in the first construction reaches the maximum value n ‚àí 1 if n 2 is odd and n 2 ‚â† ( 2 k + 1 ) 2 or ( 2 k + 1 ) 2 + 2 for integer k , while that of the second construction reaches the maximum value for all n . Moreover, the nonlinearities of Boolean functions in both two constructions are higher than that of Mesnager et¬†al .‚Äôs construction.},

  abstract     = {Order-preserving DAG grammars (OPDGs) is a formalism for representing languages of structurally restricted graphs. As demonstrated in [17], they are sufficiently expressive to model abstract meaning representations in natural language processing, a graph-based form of semantic representation in which nodes encode objects and edges relations. At the same time, they can be parsed in ùí™ ( n 2 + n m ) , where m and n are the sizes of the grammar and the input graph, respectively. In this work, we provide an initial algebra semantic for OPDGs, which allows us to view them as regular tree grammars under an equivalence theory. This makes it possible to transfer results from the field of formal tree languages to the domain of OPDGs, both in the unweighted and the weighted case. In particular, we show that deterministic OPDGs can be minimised efficiently, and that they are learnable under the ‚Äúminimal adequeate teacher‚Äù paradigm, that is, by querying an oracle for equivalence between languages, and membership of individual graphs. To conclude, we demonstrate that the languages generated by OPDGs are definable in monadic second-order logic.},

In this paper, we consider the synthesis of computable functions of infinite words, for a classical Turing computability notion over infinite inputs. We consider specifications which are rational relations of infinite words, i.e., specifications defined by non-deterministic parity transducers. We prove that the synthesis problem of computable functions from rational specifications is undecidable. We provide an incomplete but sound reduction to some parity game, such that if Eve wins the game, then the rational specification is realizable by a computable function. We prove that this function is even computable by a deterministic two-way transducer. We provide a sufficient condition under which the latter game reduction is complete. This entails the decidability of the synthesis problem of computable functions, which we proved to be ExpTime -complete, for a large subclass of rational specifications, namely deterministic rational specifications. This subclass contains the class of automatic relations over infinite words, a yardstick in reactive synthesis.},

This adds a new characterization for recognizable series to the fundamental Sch√ºtzenberger theorem. Surprisingly, the equivalence does not require any restriction to our weighted LDL. Our results hold over arbitrary (resp. totally complete) semirings for finite (resp. infinite) words. As a consequence, the equivalence problem for weighted LDL formulas over fields is decidable in doubly exponential time. In contrast to classical logics, we show that our weighted LDL is expressively incomparable to weighted LTL for finite words. We determine a fragment of the weighted LTL such that series over finite and infinite words definable by LTL formulas in this fragment are definable also by weighted LDL formulas. This is an extended version of [17].},

  abstract     = {Many decision problems concerning cellular automata are known to be decidable in the case of algebraic cellular automata, that is, when the state set has an algebraic structure and the automaton acts as a morphism. The most studied cases include finite fields, finite commutative rings and finite commutative groups. In this paper, we provide methods to generalize these results to the broader case of group cellular automata, that is, the case where the state set is a finite (possibly non-commutative) finite group. The configuration space is not even necessarily the full shift but a subshift ‚Äî called a group shift ‚Äî that is a subgroup of the full shift on ‚Ñ§ d , for any number d of dimensions. We show, in particular, that injectivity, surjectivity, equicontinuity, sensitivity and nilpotency are decidable for group cellular automata, and non-transitivity is semi-decidable. Injectivity always implies surjectivity, and jointly periodic points are dense in the limit set. The Moore direction of the Garden-of-Eden theorem holds for all group cellular automata, while the Myhill direction fails in some cases. The proofs are based on effective projection operations on group shifts that are, in particular, applied on the set of valid space-time diagrams of group cellular automata. This allows one to effectively construct the traces and the limit sets of group cellular automata. A preliminary version of this work was presented at the conference Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 2020.},
