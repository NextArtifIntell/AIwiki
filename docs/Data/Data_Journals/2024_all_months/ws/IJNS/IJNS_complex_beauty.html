  abstract     = {Unsupervised spike sorting, a vital processing step in real-time brain-implantable microsystems, is faced with the prominent challenge of managing nonstationarity in neural signals. In long-term recordings, spike waveforms gradually change and new source neurons are likely to become activated. Adaptive spike sorters combined with on-implant training units effectively process the nonstationary signals at the cost of high hardware resource utilization. On the other hand, static approaches, while being hardware-friendly, are subjected to decreased processing performance in such recordings where the neural signal characteristics gradually change. To strike a balance between the hardware cost and processing performance, this study proposes a hardware-efficient novelty-aware spike sorting approach that is capable of dealing with both variated spike waveforms and spike waveforms generated from new source neurons. Its improved hardware efficiency compared to adaptive ones and capability of dealing with nonstationary signals make it attractive for implantable applications. The proposed novelty-aware spike sorting especially would be a good fit for brain–computer interfaces where long-term, real-time interaction with the brain is required, and the available on-implant hardware resources are limited. Our unsupervised spike sorting benefits from a novelty detection process to deal with neural signal variations. It tracks the spike features so that in case of detecting an unexpected change (novelty detection) both on and off-implant parameters are updated to preserve the performance in new state. To make the proposed approach agile enough to be suitable for brain implants, the on-implant computations are reduced while the computational burden is realized off-implant. The performance of our proposed approach is evaluated using both synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate that, in the mean, it is capable of detecting 94.31% of novel spikes (wave-drifted or emerged spikes) with a classification accuracy (CA) of 96.31%. Moreover, an FPGA prototype of the on-implant circuit is implemented and tested. It is shown that in comparison to the OSORT algorithm, a pivotal spike sorting method, our spike sorting provides a higher CA at significantly lower hardware resources. The proposed circuit is also implemented in a 180-nm standard CMOS process, achieving a power consumption of 1.78 μ W per channel and a chip area of 0.07 mm 2 per channel.},

  abstract     = {A real-time and reliable automatic detection system for epileptic seizures holds significant value in assisting physicians with rapid diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Aiming to address this issue, a novel lightweight model called Convolutional Neural Network-Reformer (CNN-Reformer) is proposed for seizure detection on long-term EEG. The CNN-Reformer consists of two main parts: the Data Reshaping (DR) module and the Efficient Attention and Concentration (EAC) module. This framework reduces network parameters while retaining effective feature extraction of multi-channel EEGs, thereby improving model computational efficiency and real-time performance. Initially, the raw EEG signals undergo Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for signal filtering, and then fed into the DR module for data compression and reshaping while preserving local features. Subsequently, these local features are sent to the EAC module to extract global features and perform categorization. Post-processing involving sliding window averaging, thresholding, and collar techniques is further deployed to reduce the false detection rate (FDR) and improve detection performance. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, our method achieves an average sensitivity of 97.57%, accuracy of 98.09%, and specificity of 98.11% at segment-based level, and a sensitivity of 96.81%, along with FDR of 0.27/h, and latency of 17.81 s at the event-based level. On the SH-SDU dataset we collected, our method yielded segment-based sensitivity of 94.51%, specificity of 92.83%, and accuracy of 92.81%, along with event-based sensitivity of 94.11%. The average testing time for 1 h of multi-channel EEG signals is 1.92 s. The excellent results and fast computational speed of the CNN-Reformer model demonstrate its potential for efficient seizure detection.},

This selective focus enables subsequent stages of the model to achieve improved classification performance. Traditionally, AMs are applied as a preprocessing substructure before a neural network, such as in encoder/decoder architectures. In this paper, we extend the application of AMs to intermediate stages of data propagation within ML models. Specifically, we propose a generalized attention mechanism (GAM), which can be integrated before each layer of a neural network for classification tasks. The proposed GAM allows for at each layer/step of the ML architecture identification of the most relevant sections of the intermediate results. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the proposed GAM into various ML models consistently enhances the accuracy of these models. This improvement is achieved with only a marginal increase in the number of parameters, which does not significantly affect the training time.},

In this paper, we study the LSN P systems in the context of a federated learning client–server architecture over horizontally partitioned data.

We also perform experiments to assess the performance of an LSN P system trained in the federated learning setup.

  abstract     = {In the evaluation of cervical spine disorders, precise positioning of anatomo-physiological hallmarks is fundamental for calculating diverse measurement metrics. Despite the fact that deep learning has achieved impressive results in the field of keypoint localization, there are still many limitations when facing medical image. First, these methods often encounter limitations when faced with the inherent variability in cervical spine datasets, arising from imaging factors. Second, predicting keypoints for only 4% of the entire X-ray image surface area poses a significant challenge. To tackle these issues, we propose a deep neural network architecture, NF-DEKR, specifically tailored for predicting keypoints in cervical spine physiological anatomy. Leveraging neural memory ordinary differential equation with its distinctive memory learning separation and convergence to a singular global attractor characteristic, our design effectively mitigates inherent data variability. Simultaneously, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Focus module to preprocess feature maps before entering the disentangled regression branch and the heatmap branch. Employing a differentiated strategy for feature maps of varying scales, this approach yields more accurate predictions of densely localized keypoints. We construct a medical dataset, SCUSpineXray, comprising X-ray images annotated by orthopedic specialists and conduct similar experiments on the publicly available UWSpineCT dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline DEKR network, our proposed method enhances average precision by 2% to 3%, accompanied by a marginal increase in model parameters and the floating-point operations (FLOPs).

  abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms are commonly used for quickly and efficiently counting people from a crowd. Test-time adaptation methods for crowd counting adjust model parameters and employ additional data augmentation to better adapt the model to the specific conditions encountered during testing. The majority of current studies concentrate on unsupervised domain adaptation. These approaches commonly perform hundreds of epochs of training iterations, requiring a sizable number of unannotated data of every new target domain apart from annotated data of the source domain. Unlike these methods, we propose a meta-test-time adaptive crowd counting approach called CrowdTTA, which integrates the concept of test-time adaptation into the meta-learning framework and makes it easier for the counting model to adapt to the unknown test distributions. To facilitate the reliable supervision signal at the pixel level, we introduce uncertainty by inserting the dropout layer into the counting model. The uncertainty is then used to generate valuable pseudo labels, serving as effective supervisory signals for adapting the model. In the context of meta-learning, one image can be regarded as one task for crowd counting. In each iteration, our approach is a dual-level optimization process. In the inner update, we employ a self-supervised consistency loss function to optimize the model so as to simulate the parameters update process that occurs during the test phase. In the outer update, we authentically update the parameters based on the image with ground truth, improving the model’s performance and making the pseudo labels more accurate in the next iteration. At test time, the input image is used for adapting the model before testing the image. In comparison to various supervised learning and domain adaptation methods, our results via extensive experiments on diverse datasets showcase the general adaptive capability of our approach across datasets with varying crowd densities and scales.},

  abstract     = {Automatic seizure detection has significant value in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Although a variety of deep learning models have been proposed to automatically learn electroencephalography (EEG) features for seizure detection, the generalization performance and computational burden of such deep models remain the bottleneck of practical application. In this study, a novel lightweight model based on random convolutional kernel transform (ROCKET) is developed for EEG feature learning for seizure detection. Specifically, random convolutional kernels are embedded into the structure of a wavelet scattering network instead of original wavelet transform convolutions. Then the significant EEG features are selected from the scattering coefficients and convolutional outputs by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (MRMR) methods. This model not only preserves the merits of the fast-training process from ROCKET, but also provides insight into seizure detection by retaining only the helpful channels. The extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) classifier was combined with this EEG feature learning model to build a comprehensive seizure detection system that achieved promising epoch-based results, with over 90% of both sensitivity and specificity on the scalp and intracranial EEG databases. The experimental comparisons showed that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods for cross-patient and patient-specific seizure detection.},

The SN P system performs computations through the encoding, processing, and transmission of spiking information and can be regarded as a third-generation neural network. As a variant of the SN P system, the global asynchronous numerical spiking neural P system (ANSN P system) is adaptable to a broader range of application scenarios. However, in biological neuroscience, some neurons work synchronously within a community to perform specific functions in the brain. Inspired by this, our work investigates a global asynchronous spiking neural P system (ANSN P system) that incorporates certain local synchronous neuron sets. Within these local synchronous sets, neurons must execute their production functions simultaneously, thereby reducing dependence on thresholds and enhancing control uncertainty in ANSN P systems. By analyzing the ADD, SUB, and FIN modules in the generating mode, as well as the INPUT and ADD modules in the accepting mode, this paper demonstrates the novel system’s computational capacity as both a generator and an acceptor. Additionally, this paper compares each module to those in other SN P systems, considering the maximum number of neurons and rules per neuron. The results show that this new ANSN P system is at least as effective as the existing SN P systems.},

This paper delves into the effect and neural mechanisms of emotional olfactory stimuli (EOS) on regulating anger driving based on EEG. First, this study designed an angry driving regulation experiment based on EOS to record EEG signals. Second, brain activation patterns under various EOS conditions are explored by analyzing functional brain networks (FBNs). Additionally, the paper analyzes dynamic alterations in anger-related characteristics to explore the intensity and persistence of regulating anger driving under different EOS. Finally, the paper studies the frequency energy of EEG changes under EOS through time–frequency analysis. The results indicate that EOS can effectively regulate a driver’s anger emotions, especially with the banana odor showing superior effects. Under banana odor stimulus, synchronization between the parietal and temporal lobes significantly decreased. Notably, the regulatory effect of banana odor is optimal and exhibits sustained efficacy. The regulatory effect of banana odor on anger emotions is persistent. Furthermore, the impact of banana odor significantly reduces the distribution of high-energy activation states in the parietal lobe region. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamic characterization of functional connectivity during anger-driving regulation and demonstrate the potential of using EOS as a reliable tool for regulating angry driving.},

  abstract     = {Typically, deep learning models for image segmentation tasks are trained using large datasets of images annotated at the pixel level, which can be expensive and highly time-consuming. A way to reduce the amount of annotated images required for training is to adopt a semi-supervised approach. In this regard, generative deep learning models, concretely Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been adapted to semi-supervised training of segmentation tasks. This work proposes MaskGDM, a deep learning architecture combining some ideas from EditGAN, a GAN that jointly models images and their segmentations, together with a generative diffusion model. With careful integration, we find that using a generative diffusion model can improve EditGAN performance results in multiple segmentation datasets, both multi-class and with binary labels. According to the quantitative results obtained, the proposed model improves multi-class image segmentation when compared to the EditGAN and DatasetGAN models, respectively, by 4 . 5 % and 5 . 0 % . Moreover, using the ISIC dataset, our proposal improves the results from other models by up to 1 1 % for the binary image segmentation approach.},

  abstract     = {Automatic seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is of great importance in aiding the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy due to the advantages of convenience and economy. Existing seizure detection methods are usually patient-specific, the training and testing are carried out on the same patient, limiting their scalability to other patients. To address this issue, we propose a cross-subject seizure detection method via unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method aims to obtain seizure specific information through shallow and deep feature alignments. For shallow feature alignment, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract seizure-related features. The distribution gap of the shallow features between different patients is minimized by multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancies (MK-MMD). For deep feature alignment, adversarial learning is utilized. The feature extractor tries to learn feature representations that try to confuse the domain classifier, making the extracted deep features more generalizable to new patients. The performance of our method is evaluated on the CHB-MIT and Siena databases in epoch-based experiments. Additionally, event-based experiments are also conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset. The results validate the feasibility of our method in diminishing the domain disparities among different patients.},

This study introduces a novel neural network model designed explicitly for automated image quality assessment that addresses pixel and semantic distortion.

More significantly, the model integrates a structure-aware learning module employing graph neural networks.

  abstract     = {Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained widespread application in automatic brain network classification tasks, owing to their ability to directly capture crucial information in non-Euclidean structures. However, two primary challenges persist in this domain. First, within the realm of clinical neuro-medicine, signals from cerebral regions are inevitably contaminated with noise stemming from physiological or external factors. The construction of brain networks heavily relies on set thresholds and feature information within brain regions, making it susceptible to the incorporation of such noises into the brain topology. Additionally, the static nature of the artificially constructed brain network’s adjacent structure restricts real-time changes in brain topology. Second, mainstream GNN-based approaches tend to focus solely on capturing information interactions of nearest neighbor nodes, overlooking high-order topology features. In response to these challenges, we propose an adaptive unsupervised Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Hypergraph Information Bottleneck (ST-DHIB) framework for dynamically optimizing brain networks. Specifically, adopting an information theory perspective, Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) is employed for purifying graph structure, and dynamically updating the processed input brain signals. From a graph theory standpoint, we utilize the designed Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) and Bi-LSTM to capture higher-order spatial-temporal context associations among brain channels. Comprehensive patient-specific and cross-patient experiments have been conducted on two available datasets. The results demonstrate the advancement and generalization of the proposed framework.},

Quality evaluation is often not standardized and relies on the expertise, and vigilance of the personnel, posing limitations especially with large datasets. Machine learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a promising approach to address these challenges by performing automated inspection of MR images. In this study, a CNN for the detection of random head motion artifacts (RHM) in T1-weighted MRI as one aspect of image quality is proposed. A two-step approach aimed to first identify images exhibiting pronounced motion artifacts, and second to evaluate the feasibility of a more detailed three-class classification. The utilized dataset consisted of 420 T1-weighted whole-brain image volumes with isotropic resolution. Human experts assigned each volume to one of three classes of artifact prominence. Results demonstrate an accuracy of 95% for the identification of images with pronounced artifact load. The addition of an intermediate class retained an accuracy of 76%. The findings highlight the potential of CNN-based approaches to increase the efficiency of post - hoc QAs in large datasets by flagging images with potentially relevant artifact loads for closer inspection.},

In order to improve the efficiency of early detection and diagnosis of seizure, this paper proposes a new seizure detection method, which is based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and multi-channel long- and short-term memory-like spiking neural P (LSTM-SNP) model. First, the signal is decomposed into 5 levels by using DWT transform to obtain the features of the components at different frequencies, and a series of time–frequency features in wavelet coefficients are extracted. Then, these different features are used to train a multi-channel LSTM-SNP model and perform seizure detection. The proposed method achieves a high seizure detection accuracy on the CHB-MIT dataset: 98.25% accuracy, 98.22% specificity and 97.59% sensitivity. This indicates that the proposed epilepsy detection method can show competitive detection performance.},

Within the realm of membrane systems (P systems), spiking neural P systems (SN P systems), inspired by biological nervous systems, are third-generation neural networks that possess intricate structures and offer substantial parallelism advantages. Thus, this study first improved the DPC by introducing the maximum nearest neighbor distance and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Moreover, a method based on delayed spiking neural P systems (DSN P systems) was proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Subsequently, the DSNP-ANDPC algorithm was proposed.

  abstract     = {Abnormal behavior recognition is an important technology used to detect and identify activities or events that deviate from normal behavior patterns. It has wide applications in various fields such as network security, financial fraud detection, and video surveillance. In recent years, Deep Convolution Networks (ConvNets) have been widely applied in abnormal behavior recognition algorithms and have achieved significant results. However, existing abnormal behavior detection algorithms mainly focus on improving the accuracy of the algorithms and have not explored the real-time nature of abnormal behavior recognition. This is crucial to quickly identify abnormal behavior in public places and improve urban public safety. Therefore, this paper proposes an abnormal behavior recognition algorithm based on three-dimensional (3D) dense connections. The proposed algorithm uses a multi-instance learning strategy to classify various types of abnormal behaviors, and employs dense connection modules and soft-threshold attention mechanisms to reduce the model’s parameter count and enhance network computational efficiency. Finally, redundant information in the sequence is reduced by attention allocation to mitigate its negative impact on recognition results. Experimental verification shows that our method achieves a recognition accuracy of 95.61% on the UCF-crime dataset. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our model has strong performance in terms of recognition accuracy and speed.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel method for unsupervised seizure anomaly detection called SAnoDDPM, which uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). We designed a novel pipeline that uses a variable lower bound on Markov chains to identify potential values that are unlikely to occur in anomalous data. The model is first trained on normal data, then anomalous data is input to the trained model. The model resamples the anomalous data and converts it to normal data. Finally, the presence of seizures can be determined by comparing the before and after data. Moreover, the input 2D spectrograms are encoded into vector-quantized representations, which enables powerful and efficient DDPM while maintaining its quality. Experimental comparisons on the publicly available datasets, CHB-MIT and TUH, show that our method delivers better results, significantly reduces inference time, and is suitable for deployment in a clinical environments. As far as we are aware, this is the first DDPM-based method for seizure anomaly detection. This novel approach significantly contributes to the progression of seizure detection algorithms, thereby augmenting their practicality in clinical settings.},

Using the reconstructed phase space (RPS) and the continuous wavelet transform, the researchers maximized the differences between the EEG nonstationary signals of normal and schizophrenia individuals, which cannot be observed in the time, frequency, or time-frequency domains. This reveals significant information, highlighting more distinguishable features. Then, a deep learning network was trained to enhance the accuracy of the resulting image classification. The algorithm’s efficacy was confirmed through three distinct methods: employing 70% of the dataset for training, 15% for validation, and the remaining 15% for testing. This was followed by a 5-fold cross-validation technique and a leave-one-out classification approach. Each method was iterated 100 times to ascertain the algorithm’s robustness. The performance metrics derived from these tests — accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Kappa — indicated remarkable outcomes. The algorithm demonstrated steady performance across all evaluation strategies, underscoring its relevance and reliability. The outcomes validate the system’s accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and robustness by showcasing its capability to autonomously differentiate individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia from those in a state of normal health.},

The discovery that those motor symptoms result from the death of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra led to focus most of parkinsonism research on the basal ganglia (BG). However, recent findings point to an active involvement of the cerebellum in this motor syndrome. Here, we have developed a multiscale computational model of the rodent brain’s BG–cerebellar network. Simulations showed that a direct effect of dopamine depletion on the cerebellum must be taken into account to reproduce the alterations of neural activity in parkinsonism, particularly the increased beta oscillations widely reported in PD patients. Moreover, dopamine depletion indirectly impacted spike-time-dependent plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, degrading associative motor learning as observed in parkinsonism. Overall, these results suggest a relevant involvement of cerebellum in parkinsonism associative motor symptoms.},

In this context, this paper presents an incremental approach to tackle the intricate challenge of unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data within the target domain is unavailable. The proposed approach, OTP-DA, endeavors to learn a sequence of joint subspaces from both the source and target domains using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), such that the projected data into these subspaces are domain-invariant and well-separated. Nonetheless, the necessity of labeled data for LDA to derive the projection matrix presents a substantial impediment, given the absence of labels within the target domain in the setting of unsupervised domain adaptation. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce a selective label propagation technique grounded on optimal transport (OTP), to generate pseudo-labels for target data, which serve as surrogates for the unknown labels. We anticipate that the process of inferring labels for target data will be substantially streamlined within the acquired latent subspaces, thereby facilitating a self-training mechanism. Furthermore, our paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of OTP-DA, underpinned by the concept of weak domain adaptation learners, thereby elucidating the requisite conditions for the proposed approach to solve the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation efficiently. Experimentation across a spectrum of visual domain adaptation problems suggests that OTP-DA exhibits promising efficacy and robustness, positioning it favorably compared to several state-of-the-art methods.},

In this regard, latent generative models can effectively be used in a data-driven modeling of different dimensions of neurodegeneration, framed within the context of the manifold hypothesis. This paper proposes a joint framework for a multi-modal, common latent generative model to address the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the neurodegenerative landscape in the context of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The proposed architecture uses coupled variational autoencoders (VAEs) to joint model a common latent space to both neuroimaging and clinical data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Alternative loss functions, different normalization procedures, and the interpretability and explainability of latent generative models are addressed, leading to a model that was able to predict clinical symptomatology in the test set, as measured by the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS), with R2 up to 0.86 for same-modality and 0.441 cross-modality (using solely neuroimaging). The findings provide a foundation for further advancements in the field of clinical research and practice, with potential applications in decision-making processes for PD.

  abstract     = {Timely and accurately seizure detection is of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy patients. Existing seizure detection models are often complex and time-consuming, highlighting the urgent need for lightweight seizure detection. Additionally, existing methods often neglect the key characteristic channels and spatial regions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To solve these issues, we propose a lightweight EEG-based seizure detection model named lightweight inverted residual attention network (LRAN). Specifically, we employ a four-stage inverted residual mobile block (iRMB) to effectively extract the hierarchical features from EEG. The convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is introduced to make the model focus on important feature channels and spatial information, thereby enhancing the discrimination of the learned features. Finally, convolution operations are used to capture local information and spatial relationships between features. We conduct intra-subject and inter-subject experiments on a publicly available dataset. Intra-subject experiments obtain 99.25% accuracy in segment-based detection and 0.36/h false detection rate (FDR) in event-based detection, respectively. Inter-subject experiments obtain 84.32% accuracy. Both sets of experiments maintain high classification accuracy with a low number of parameters, where the multiply accumulate operations (MACs) are 25.86 M and the number of parameters is 0.57 M.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in epilepsy analysis, and epileptic seizure prediction has significant value for clinical treatment of epilepsy. Currently, prediction methods using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) primarily focus on local features of EEG, making it challenging to simultaneously capture the spatial and temporal features from multi-channel EEGs to identify the preictal state effectively. In order to extract inherent spatial relationships among multi-channel EEGs while obtaining their temporal correlations, this study proposed an end-to-end model for the prediction of epileptic seizures by incorporating Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Low-pass filtered EEG signals were fed into the GAT module for EEG spatial feature extraction, and followed by TCN to capture temporal features, allowing the end-to-end model to acquire the spatiotemporal correlations of multi-channel EEGs. The system was evaluated on the publicly available CHB-MIT database, yielding segment-based accuracy of 98.71%, specificity of 98.35%, sensitivity of 99.07%, and F 1-score of 98.71%, respectively. Event-based sensitivity of 97.03% and False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.03/h was also achieved. Experimental results demonstrated this system can achieve superior performance for seizure prediction by leveraging the fusion of EEG spatiotemporal features without the need of feature engineering.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal epilepsy is a common emergency phenomenon in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), which requires timely attention, early identification, and treatment. Traditional detection methods mostly use supervised learning with enormous labeled data. Hence, this study offers a semi-supervised hybrid architecture for detecting seizures, which combines the extracted electroencephalogram (EEG) feature dataset and convolutional autoencoder, called Fd-CAE. First, various features in the time domain and entropy domain are extracted to characterize the EEG signal, which helps distinguish epileptic seizures subsequently. Then, the unlabeled EEG features are fed into the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for training, which effectively represents EEG features by optimizing the loss between the input and output features. This unsupervised feature learning process can better combine and optimize EEG features from unlabeled data. After that, the pre-trained encoder part of the model is used for further feature learning of labeled data to obtain its low-dimensional feature representation and achieve classification. This model is performed on the neonatal EEG dataset collected at the University of Helsinki Hospital, which has a high discriminative ability to detect seizures, with an accuracy of 92.34%, precision of 93.61%, recall rate of 98.74%, and F1-score of 95.77%, respectively. The results show that unsupervised learning by CAE is beneficial to the characterization of EEG signals, and the proposed Fd-CAE method significantly improves classification performance.},

The HNSNM systems also abstract two biological mechanisms of synapse creation and pruning, and use plasticity rules with repartition protocols to achieve planar, hierarchical and spatial communications among neurons in hypergraph neuron structures. Through imitating register machines, the Turing universality of the HNSNM systems is proved by using them as number generating and accepting devices. A universal HNSNM system consisting of 41 neurons is constructed to compute arbitrary functions. By solving NP-complete problems using the subset sum problem as an example, the computational efficiency and effectiveness of HNSNM systems are verified.},

Therefore, MRI images are widely used to achieve the segmentation of brain tumors. This paper is the first attempt to discuss the use of optimization spiking neural P systems to improve the threshold segmentation of brain tumor images. To be specific, a threshold segmentation approach based on optimization numerical spiking neural P systems with adaptive multi-mutation operators (ONSNPSamos) is proposed to segment brain tumor images. More specifically, an ONSNPSamo with a multi-mutation strategy is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation abilities. At the same time, an approach combining the ONSNPSamo and connectivity algorithms is proposed to address the brain tumor segmentation problem. Our experimental results from CEC 2017 benchmarks (basic, shifted and rotated, hybrid, and composition function optimization problems) demonstrate that the ONSNPSamo is better than or close to 12 optimization algorithms. Furthermore, case studies from BraTS 2019 show that the approach combining the ONSNPSamo and connectivity algorithms can more effectively segment brain tumor images than most algorithms involved.},

The simulation algorithm is based on a matrix-vector multiplication, which is an operation efficiently implemented on parallel devices. However, when the graph of a Spiking Neural P system is not fully connected, the adjacency matrix is sparse and hence, lots of computing resources are wasted in both time and memory domains. For this reason, two compression methods for the matrix representation were proposed in a previous work, but they were not implemented nor parallelized on a simulator. In this paper, they are implemented and parallelized on GPUs as part of a new Spiking Neural P system with delays simulator. Extensive experiments are conducted on high-end GPUs (RTX2080 and A100 80GB), and it is concluded that they outperform other solutions based on state-of-the-art GPU libraries when simulating Spiking Neural P systems.},

However, it is still not clear how and to what extent this mismatch limits motor learning outcomes. To further the understanding of the effect of sensory mismatch on motor learning outcomes, a reinforcement learning algorithm and the simplified biomechanical elbow joint model were employed to mimic the motor learning process in a computational environment. By applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to the motor learning of elbow joint flexion task, simulation results successfully explained how visual-proprioceptive mismatch limits motor learning outcomes in terms of motor control accuracy and task completion speed. The larger the perceived angular offset between the two sensory modalities, the lower the motor control accuracy. Also, the more similar the peak reward amplitude of the two sensory modalities, the lower the motor control accuracy. In addition, simulation results suggest that insufficient exploration rate limits task completion speed, and excessive exploration rate limits motor control accuracy. Such a speed-accuracy trade-off shows that a moderate exploration rate could serve as another important factor in motor learning.},

  abstract     = {Most existing multi-scale object detectors depend on multi-level feature maps. The Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) is a significant architecture for object detection that utilizes these multi-level feature maps. However, the use of FPN also increases the detector’s complexity. For object detection methods that only use a single-level feature map, the detection performance is limited to some extent because the single-level feature map cannot balance deep semantic information and shallow detail information. We introduce a novel detector — the Spiking Neural P Multiple-in-Single-out (SNPMiSo) detector to address these challenges. The SNPMiSo detector is constructed based on SNP-like neurons. In SNPMiSo, we employ two kinds of Transformers to boost the important features across different-level feature maps separately. After enhancing the features, we use an incremental upsampling module to upsample and merge the two feature maps. This combined feature map is input into the NAF dilated residual module and the NAF dual-branch detection head. This process allows us to extract multi-scale features and carry out detection tasks. Our tests show promising results: On the COCO dataset, SNPMiSo attains an Average Precision (AP) of 38.7, an improvement of 1.0 AP over YOLOF. In addition, SNPMiSo demonstrates a quicker detection speed, outperforming some advanced multi-level and single-level object detectors.},

  abstract     = {Surgical reconstruction of mandibular defects is a clinical routine manner for the rehabilitation of patients with deformities. The mandible plays a crucial role in maintaining the facial contour and ensuring the speech and mastication functions. The repairing and reconstruction of mandible defects is a significant yet challenging task in oral–maxillofacial surgery. Currently, the mainly available methods are traditional digitalized design methods that suffer from substantial artificial operations, limited applicability and high reconstruction error rates. An automated, precise, and individualized method is imperative for maxillofacial surgeons. In this paper, we propose a Stage-wise Residual Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SRA-GAN) for mandibular defect reconstruction. Specifically, we design a stage-wise residual attention mechanism for generator to enhance the extraction capability of mandibular remote spatial information, making it adaptable to various defects. For the discriminator, we propose a multi-field perceptual network, consisting of two parallel discriminators with different perceptual fields, to reduce the cumulative reconstruction errors. Furthermore, we design a self-encoder perceptual loss function to ensure the correctness of mandibular anatomical structures. The experimental results on a novel custom-built mandibular defect dataset demonstrate that our method has a promising prospect in clinical application, achieving the best Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 94.238% and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.787.},

  abstract     = {Schizophrenia is accompanied by aberrant interactions of intrinsic brain networks. However, the modulatory effect of electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms on the functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia remains unclear. This study aims to provide new insight into network communication in schizophrenia by integrating FC and EEG rhythm information. After collecting simultaneous resting-state EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging data, the effect of rhythm modulations on FC was explored using what we term “dynamic rhythm information.” We also investigated the synergistic relationships among three networks under rhythm modulation conditions, where this relationship presents the coupling between two brain networks with other networks as the center by the rhythm modulation. This study found FC between the thalamus and cortical network regions was rhythm-specific. Further, the effects of the thalamus on the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) were less similar under alpha rhythm modulation in schizophrenia patients than in controls ( m e a n S c Z : m e a n H C = 0 . 7 1 5 : 0 . 7 7 7 ). However, the similarity between the effects of the central executive network (CEN) on the DMN and SN under gamma modulation was greater ( m e a n S c Z : m e a n H C = 0 . 6 9 5 : 0 . 6 2 9 ), and the degree of coupling was negatively correlated with the duration of disease ( r = − 0 . 3 7 3 , p = 0 . 0 0 3 ). Moreover, schizophrenia patients exhibited less coupling with the thalamus as the center and greater coupling with the CEN as the center. These results indicate that modulations in dynamic rhythms might contribute to the disordered functional interactions seen in schizophrenia.},

Their ability to quickly and accurately learn from complex data is remarkable. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promising results in accurately classifying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its related cognitive states, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), along with the healthy conditions known as Cognitively Normal (CN). This offers valuable insights into disease progression and diagnosis. However, certain traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers perform equally well or even better than DL models, requiring less training data. This is particularly valuable in CAD in situations with limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classifier based on ML models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.52%. This represents a 3–5% improvement over the best individual classifier. We evaluated popular ML classifiers for AD classification under both data-scarce and data-rich conditions using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies datasets. By comparing the results to state-of-the-art CNN-centric DL algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This work will help users to select the most suitable algorithm for AD classification based on data availability.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning technology has been successfully used in Chest X-ray (CXR) images of COVID-19 patients. However, due to the characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and X-ray imaging, the deep learning methods still face many challenges, such as lower imaging quality, fewer training samples, complex radiological features and irregular shapes. To address these challenges, this study first introduces an extensive NSNP-like neuron model, and then proposes a multitask adversarial network architecture based on ENSNP-like neurons for chest X-ray images of COVID-19, called MAE-Net. The MAE-Net serves two tasks: (i) converting low-quality CXR images to high-quality images; (ii) classifying CXR images of COVID-19. The adversarial architecture of MAE-Net uses two generators and two discriminators, and two new loss functions have been introduced to guide the optimization of the network. The MAE-Net is tested on four benchmark COVID-19 CXR image datasets and compared them with eight deep learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed MAE-Net can enhance the conversion quality and the accuracy of image classification results.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of robot controller parameters is a crucial task for enhancing robot performance, yet it often presents challenges due to the complexity of multi-objective, multi-dimensional multi-parameter optimization. This paper introduces a novel approach aimed at efficiently optimizing robot controller parameters to enhance its motion performance. While spiking neural P systems have shown great potential in addressing optimization problems, there has been limited research and validation concerning their application in continuous numerical, multi-objective, and multi-dimensional multi-parameter contexts. To address this research gap, our paper proposes the Entropy-Weighted Numerical Gradient Optimization Spiking Neural P System, which combines the strengths of entropy weighting and spiking neural P systems. First, the introduction of entropy weighting eliminates the subjectivity of weight selection, enhancing the objectivity and reproducibility of the optimization process. Second, our approach employs parallel gradient descent to achieve efficient multi-dimensional multi-parameter optimization searches. In conclusion, validation results on a biped robot simulation model show that our method markedly enhances walking performance compared to traditional approaches and other optimization algorithms. We achieved a velocity mean absolute error at least 35% lower than other methods, with a displacement error two orders of magnitude smaller. This research provides an effective new avenue for performance optimization in the field of robotics.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural membrane systems (or spiking neural P systems, SNP systems) are a new type of computation model which have attracted the attention of plentiful scholars for parallelism, time encoding, interpretability and extensibility. The original SNP systems only consider the time delay caused by the execution of rules within neurons, but not caused by the transmission of spikes via synapses between neurons and its adaptive adjustment. In view of the importance of time delay for SNP systems, which are a time encoding computation model, this study proposes SNP systems with adaptive synaptic time delay (ADSNP systems) based on the dynamic regulation mechanism of synaptic transmission delay in neural systems. In ADSNP systems, besides neurons, astrocytes that can generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are introduced. After receiving spikes, astrocytes convert spikes into ATP and send ATP to the synapses controlled by them to change the synaptic time delays. The Turing universality of ADSNP systems in number generating and accepting modes is proved. In addition, a small universal ADSNP system using 93 neurons and astrocytes is given. The superiority of the ADSNP system is demonstrated by comparison with the six variants. Finally, an ADSNP system is constructed for credit card fraud detection, which verifies the feasibility of the ADSNP system for solving real-world problems. By considering the adaptive synaptic delay, ADSNP systems better restore the process of information transmission in biological neural networks, and enhance the adaptability of SNP systems, making the control of time more accurate.},

Extensive studies have been made on SN P systems with synchronization-based communication, while further efforts are needed for the systems with rhythm-based communication. In this work, we design an asynchronous SN P system with resonant connections where all the enabled neurons in the same group connected by resonant connections should instantly produce spikes with the same rhythm. In the designed system, each of the three modules implements one type of the three operations associated with the edge detection of digital images, and they collaborate each other through the resonant connections. An algorithm called EDSNP for edge detection is proposed to simulate the working of the designed asynchronous SN P system. A quantitative analysis of EDSNP and the related methods for edge detection had been conducted to evaluate the performance of EDSNP. The performance of the EDSNP in processing the testing images is superior to the compared methods, based on the quantitative metrics of accuracy, error rate, mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and true positive rate. The results indicate the potential of the temporal firing and the proper neuronal connections in the SN P system to achieve good performance in edge detection.},

  abstract     = {A variant of membrane computing models called Spiking Neural P systems (SNP systems) closely mimics the structure and behavior of biological neurons. As third-generation neural networks, SNP systems have flexible architectures allowing the design of bio-inspired machine learning algorithms. This paper proposes Modular Spiking Neural P (MSNP) systems to solve image classification problems, a novel SNP system to be applied in scenarios where hundreds or even thousands of different classes are considered. A main issue to face in such situations is related to the structural complexity of the network. MSNP systems devised in this work allow to approach the general classification problem by dividing it in smaller parts, that are then faced by single entities of the network. As a benchmark dataset, the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset is considered, consisting of more than 8000 pictures of flowers belonging to the 102 species commonly found in the UK. These classes sometimes present large variations within them, may be also very similar to one another, and different images of the same subject may differ a lot. The work describes the architecture of the MSNP system, based on modules focusing on a specific class, their training phase, and the evaluation of the model both concerning result accuracy as well as energy consumption. Experimental results on image classification problems show that the model achieves good results, but is strongly connected to image quality, mainly depending on the frequency of images, remarkable changes of pose, images not centered, and subject mostly not shown.},

  abstract     = {In clinical and scientific research on emotion recognition using physiological signals, selecting the appropriate segment is of utmost importance for enhanced results. In our study, we optimized the electrodermal activity (EDA) segment for an emotion recognition system. Initially, we obtained EDA signals from two publicly available datasets: the Continuously annotated signals of emotion (CASE) and Wearable stress and affect detection (WESAD) for 4-class dimensional and three-class categorical emotional classification, respectively. These signals were pre-processed, and decomposed into phasic signals using the ‘convex optimization to EDA’ method. Further, the phasic signals were segmented into two equal parts, each subsequently segmented into five nonoverlapping windows. Spectrograms were then generated using short-time Fourier transform and Mel-frequency cepstrum for each window, from which we extracted 85 features. We built four machine learning models for the first part, second part, and whole phasic signals to investigate their performance in emotion recognition. In the CASE dataset, we achieved the highest multi-class accuracy of 62.54% using the whole phasic and 61.75% with the second part phasic signals. Conversely, the WESAD dataset demonstrated superior performance in three-class emotions classification, attaining an accuracy of 96.44% for both whole phasic and second part phasic segments. As a result, the second part of EDA is strongly recommended for optimal outcomes.},

Existing fall detection systems often have limitations, including delays due to continuous server communication, high false-positive rates, low adoption rates due to wearability and comfort issues, and high costs. In response to these challenges, this work presents a reliable, wearable, and cost-effective fall detection system. The proposed system consists of a fit-for-purpose device, with an embedded algorithm and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), enabling real-time fall detection. The algorithm combines a Threshold-Based Algorithm (TBA) and a neural network with low number of parameters based on a Transformer architecture. This system demonstrates notable performance with 95.29% accuracy, 93.68% specificity, and 96.66% sensitivity, while only using a 0.38% of the trainable parameters used by the other approach.},

Nevertheless, not much attention is given to the privacy concerns associated with sensitive data contained in images. In this study, we propose a solution to this issue by exploring an intersection between Machine Learning and cryptography. In particular, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) emerges as a promising solution, as it enables computations to be performed on encrypted data. We therefore propose a Residual Network implementation based on FHE which allows the classification of encrypted images, ensuring that only the user can see the result. We suggest a circuit which reduces the memory requirements by more than 8 5 % compared to the most recent works, while maintaining a high level of accuracy and a short computational time. We implement the circuit using the well-known Cheon–Kim–Kim–Song (CKKS) scheme, which enables approximate encrypted computations. We evaluate the results from three perspectives: memory requirements, computational time and calculations precision. We demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate an encrypted ResNet20 in less than five minutes on a laptop using approximately 15 GB of memory, achieving an accuracy of 91.67% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is almost equivalent to the accuracy of the plain model (92.60%).},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition plays an essential role in human–human interaction since it is a key to understanding the emotional states and reactions of human beings when they are subject to events and engagements in everyday life. Moving towards human–computer interaction, the study of emotions becomes fundamental because it is at the basis of the design of advanced systems to support a broad spectrum of application areas, including forensic, rehabilitative, educational, and many others. An effective method for discriminating emotions is based on ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) data analysis, which is used as input for classification systems. Collecting brain signals on several channels and for a wide range of emotions produces cumbersome datasets that are hard to manage, transmit, and use in varied applications. In this context, the paper introduces the Empátheia system, which explores a different EEG representation by encoding EEG signals into images prior to their classification. In particular, the proposed system extracts spatio-temporal image encodings, or atlases, from EEG data through the Processing and transfeR of Interaction States and Mappings through Image-based eNcoding (PRISMIN) framework, thus obtaining a compact representation of the input signals. The atlases are then classified through the Empátheia architecture, which comprises branches based on convolutional, recurrent, and transformer models designed and tuned to capture the spatial and temporal aspects of emotions. Extensive experiments were conducted on the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) public dataset, where the proposed system significantly reduced its size while retaining high performance. The results obtained highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach and suggest new avenues for data representation in emotion recognition from EEG signals.},

The dual-convolution concatenate (DCC) and dual-convolution addition (DCA) network blocks are designed, respectively, in the encoder and decoder stages. The two blocks employ parallel convolution with different kernel sizes to improve feature representation ability and make full use of spatial detail information. Meanwhile, different feature fusion strategies are used to fuse their features to achieve feature complementarity and augmentation. Furthermore, a dual-scale pooling (DSP) module in the bottleneck is designed to improve the feature extraction capability, which can extract multi-scale contextual information and reduce information loss while extracting salient features. The SPC-Net is applied in medical image segmentation tasks and is compared with several recent segmentation methods on the GlaS and CRAG datasets. The proposed SPC-Net achieves 90.77% DICE coefficient, 83.76% IoU score and 83.93% F1 score, 86.33% ObjDice coefficient, 135.60 Obj-Hausdorff distance, respectively.

The classification branch within our framework facilitates the concurrent execution of three distinct tasks: identity recognition and classification of soft biometrics, encompassing gender and chirality. On the other hand, the hashing branch enables the generation of palmprint hash codes, optimizing for minimal storage as templates and efficient matching. The hashing branch derives the complementary information from these tasks by amalgamating knowledge acquired from the classification branch. This approach leads to superior overall performance compared to individual tasks in isolation. To enhance the effectiveness of multitask learning, two additional modules, an attention mechanism module and a customized gate control module, are introduced. These modules are vital in allocating higher weights to crucial channels and facilitating task-specific expert knowledge integration. Furthermore, an automatic weight adjustment module is incorporated to optimize the learning process further. This module fine-tunes the weights assigned to different tasks, improving performance. Integrating the three modules above has shown promising accuracies across various classification tasks and has notably improved authentication accuracy.

Due to recent advances in decentralized machine learning in Federated Learning (FL), each hospital has its own private data and learning models to collaborate with other trusted participating hospitals. Heterogeneous data and models among different hospitals raise major challenges in robust FL, such as gradient leakage, where participants can exploit model weights to infer data. Here, we proposed a robust FL method to efficiently tackle data and model heterogeneity, where we train our model using knowledge distillation and a novel weighted client confidence score on hematological cytomorphology data in clinical settings. In the knowledge distillation, each participant learns from other participants by a weighted confidence score so that knowledge from clean models is distributed other than the noisy clients possessing noisy data. Moreover, we use symmetric loss to reduce the negative impact of data heterogeneity and label diversity by reducing overfitting the model to noisy labels.

  abstract     = {Cognitive flexibility refers to the capacity to shift between patterns of mental function and relies on functional activity supported by anatomical structures. However, how the brain’s structural–functional covarying is preconfigured in the resting state to facilitate cognitive flexibility under tasks remains unrevealed. Herein, we investigated the potential relationship between individual cognitive flexibility performance during the trail-making test (TMT) and structural–functional covariation of the large-scale multimodal covariance network (MCN) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalograph (EEG) datasets of 182 healthy participants. Results show that cognitive flexibility correlated significantly with the intra-subnetwork covariation of the visual network (VN) and somatomotor network (SMN) of MCN. Meanwhile, inter-subnetwork interactions across SMN and VN/default mode network/frontoparietal network (FPN), as well as across VN and ventral attention network (VAN)/dorsal attention network (DAN) were also found to be closely related to individual cognitive flexibility. After using resting-state MCN connectivity as representative features to train a multi-layer perceptron prediction model, we achieved a reliable prediction of individual cognitive flexibility performance. Collectively, this work offers new perspectives on the structural–functional coordination of cognitive flexibility and also provides neurobiological markers to predict individual cognitive flexibility.},

We collected simultaneous electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 145 patients with IGE, 34 of whom recorded interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) during scanning. In states without IEDs, hierarchical connectivity was performed to search core cortical regions which might be potentially modulated by striatum and cerebellum. Node–node and edge–edge moderation models were constructed to depict direct and indirect moderation effects in states with and without IEDs. Patients showed increased hierarchical connectivity with sensorimotor cortices (SMC) and decreased connectivity with regions in the default mode network (DMN). In the state without IEDs, striatum, cerebellum, and thalamus were linked to weaken the interactions of regions in the salience network (SN) with DMN and SMC. In periods with IEDs, overall increased moderation effects on the interaction between regions in SN and DMN, and between regions in DMN and SMC were observed. The thalamus and striatum were implicated in weakening interactions between regions in SN and SMC. The striatum and cerebellum moderated the cortical interaction among DMN, SN, and SMC in alliance with the thalamus, contributing to the dysfunction in states with and without IEDs in IGE. The current work revealed state-specific modulation effects of striatum and cerebellum on thalamocortical circuits and uncovered the potential core cortical targets which might contribute to develop new clinical neuromodulation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Constructing computational decoding models to account for the cortical representation of semantic information plays a crucial role in understanding visual perception. The human visual system processes interactive relationships among different objects when perceiving the semantic contents of natural visions. However, the existing semantic decoding models commonly regard categories as completely separate and independent visually and semantically and rarely consider the relationships from prior information. In this work, a novel semantic graph learning model was proposed to decode multiple semantic categories of perceived natural images from brain activity. The proposed model was validated on the functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from five normal subjects while viewing 2750 natural images comprising 52 semantic categories. The results showed that the Graph Neural Network-based decoding model achieved higher accuracies than other deep neural network models. Moreover, the co-occurrence probability among semantic categories showed a significant correlation with the decoding accuracy. Additionally, the results suggested that semantic content organized in a hierarchical way with higher visual areas was more closely related to the internal visual experience. Together, this study provides a superior computational framework for multi-semantic decoding that supports the visual integration mechanism of semantic processing.},

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called bidirectional FNN (BiFNN), which utilizes skip connections to aggregate features between its forward and backward paths. The BiFNN accepts any FNN as a plugin that can incorporate any general FNN model into its forward path, introducing only a few additional parameters in the cross-path connections. The backward path is implemented as a nonparameter layer, utilizing a discretized form of the neural memory Ordinary Differential Equation (nmODE), which is named ϵ -net. We provide a proof of convergence for the ϵ -net and evaluate its initial value problem. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on diverse image recognition datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. The results demonstrate that BiFNNs offer significant improvements compared to embedded models such as ConvMixer, ResNet, ResNeXt, and Vision Transformer. Furthermore, BiFNNs can be fine-tuned to achieve comparable performance with embedded models on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets by loading the same pretrained parameters.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is recognized for its role in enhancing the performance of learning algorithms, especially for high-dimensional datasets. In recent times, FS has been framed as a multi-objective optimization problem, leading to the application of various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to address it. However, the solution space expands exponentially with the dataset’s dimensionality. Simultaneously, the extensive search space often results in numerous local optimal solutions due to a large proportion of unrelated and redundant features [H. Adeli and H. S. Park, Fully automated design of super-high-rise building structures by a hybrid ai model on a massively parallel machine, AI Mag. 17 (1996) 87–93]. Consequently, existing MOEAs struggle with local optima stagnation, particularly in large-scale multi-objective FS problems (LSMOFSPs). Different LSMOFSPs generally exhibit unique characteristics, yet most existing MOEAs rely on a single candidate solution generation strategy (CSGS), which may be less efficient for diverse LSMOFSPs [H. S. Park and H. Adeli, Distributed neural dynamics algorithms for optimization of large steel structures, J. Struct. Eng. ASCE 123 (1997) 880–888; M. Aldwaik and H. Adeli, Advances in optimization of highrise building structures, Struct. Multidiscip. Optim. 50 (2014) 899–919; E. G. González, J. R. Villar, Q. Tan, J. Sedano and C. Chira, An efficient multi-robot path planning solution using a* and coevolutionary algorithms, Integr. Comput. Aided Eng. 30 (2022) 41–52]. Moreover, selecting an appropriate MOEA and determining its corresponding parameter values for a specified LSMOFSP is time-consuming. To address these challenges, a multi-objective self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (MOSaPSO) algorithm is proposed, combined with a rapid nondominated sorting approach. MOSaPSO employs a self-adaptive mechanism, along with five modified efficient CSGSs, to generate new solutions. Experiments were conducted on ten datasets, and the results demonstrate that the number of features is effectively reduced by MOSaPSO while lowering the classification error rate. Furthermore, superior performance is observed in comparison to its counterparts on both the training and test sets, with advantages becoming increasingly evident as the dimensionality increases.},

  abstract     = {Automatic sleep staging offers a quick and objective assessment for quantitatively interpreting sleep stages in neonates. However, most of the existing studies either do not encompass any temporal information, or simply apply neural networks to exploit temporal information at the expense of high computational overhead and modeling ambiguity. This limits the application of these methods to multiple scenarios. In this paper, a sequential end-to-end sleep staging model, SeqEESleepNet, which is competent for parallelly processing sequential epochs and has a fast training rate to adapt to different scenarios, is proposed. SeqEESleepNet consists of a sequence epoch generation (SEG) module, a sequential multi-scale convolution neural network (SMSCNN) and squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks. The SEG module expands independent epochs into sequential signals, enabling the model to learn the temporal information between sleep stages. SMSCNN is a multi-scale convolution neural network that can extract both multi-scale features and temporal information from the signal. Subsequently, the followed SE block can reassign the weights of features through mapping and pooling. Experimental results exhibit that in a clinical dataset, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an overall accuracy, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient of 71.8%, 71.8%, and 0.684 on a three-class classification task with a single channel EEG signal. Based on our overall results, we believe the proposed method could pave the way for convenient multi-scenario neonatal sleep staging methods.},

  abstract     = {Automatic seizure detection plays a key role in assisting clinicians for rapid diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. In view of the parallelism of temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the capability of bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) in mining the long-range dependency of multi-channel time-series, we propose an automatic seizure detection method with a novel end-to-end TCN-BiLSTM model in this work. First, raw EEG is filtered with a 0.5–45 Hz band-pass filter, and the filtered data are input into the proposed TCN-BiLSTM network for feature extraction and classification. Post-processing process including moving average filtering, thresholding and collar technique is then employed to further improve the detection performance. The method was evaluated on two EEG database. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database, our method achieved a segment-based sensitivity of 94.31%, specificity of 97.13%, and accuracy of 97.09%. Meanwhile, an event-based sensitivity of 96.48% and an average false detection rate (FDR) of 0.38/h were obtained. On the SH-SDU database we collected, the segment-based sensitivity of 94.99%, specificity of 93.25%, and accuracy of 93.27% were achieved. In addition, an event-based sensitivity of 99.35% and a false detection rate of 0.54/h were yielded. The total detection time consumed for 1 h EEG data was 5.65 s. These results demonstrate the superiority and promising potential of the proposed method in real-time monitoring of epileptic seizures.},

  abstract     = {Linear assignment problems are well-known combinatorial optimization problems involving domains such as logistics, robotics and telecommunications. In general, obtaining an optimal solution to such problems is computationally infeasible even in small settings, so heuristic algorithms are often used to find near-optimal solutions. In order to attain the right assignment permutation, this study investigates a general-purpose learning strategy that uses a bipartite graph to describe the problem structure and a message passing Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to learn the correct mapping. Comparing the proposed structure with two existing DNN solutions, simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves classification accuracy, proving to be very efficient in terms of processing time and memory requirements, due to its inherent parameter sharing capability. Among the many practical uses that require solving allocation problems in everyday scenarios, we decided to apply the proposed approach to address the scheduling of electric smart meters access within an electricity distribution smart grid infrastructure, since near-real-time energy monitoring is a key element of the green transition that has become increasingly important in recent times. The results obtained show that the proposed graph-based solver, although sub-optimal, exhibits the highest scalability, compared with other state-of-the-art heuristic approaches.

Therefore, developing a robust model to minimize the data distribution difference is crucial to improving the user experience. In this work, based on the inter-session gesture recognition task, we propose a novel algorithm called locality preserving and maximum margin criterion (LPMM). The LPMM algorithm integrates three main modules, including domain alignment, pseudo-label selection, and iteration result selection. Domain alignment is designed to preserve the neighborhood structure of the feature and minimize the overlap of different classes. The pseudo-label selection and iteration result selection can avoid the decrease in accuracy caused by mislabeled samples. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two of the most widely used EMG databases. It achieves a mean accuracy of 98.46% and 71.64%, respectively, which is superior to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.},

They enable the development of more sophisticated AI models and serve as “golden” benchmarks for evaluating their performance. Thus, ensuring the quality of these datasets is of utmost importance for academic research and the progress of AI systems. For the emerging vision-language tasks, some datasets have been created and frequently used, such as Flickr30k, COCO, and NoCaps, which typically contain a large number of images paired with their ground-truth textual descriptions. In this paper, an automatic method is proposed to assess the quality of large-scale benchmark datasets designed for vision-language tasks. In particular, a new cross-modal matching model is developed, which is capable of automatically scoring the textual descriptions of visual images. Subsequently, this model is employed to evaluate the quality of vision-language datasets by automatically assigning a score to each ‘ground-truth’ description for every image picture. With a good agreement between manual and automated scoring results on the datasets, our findings reveal significant disparities in the quality of the ground-truth descriptions included in the benchmark datasets. Even more surprising, it is evident that a small portion of the descriptions are unsuitable for serving as reliable ground-truth references. These discoveries emphasize the need for careful utilization of these publicly accessible benchmark databases.},

  abstract     = {Background and Objective : Alzheimer’s disease is nowadays the most common cause of dementia. It is a degenerative neurological pathology affecting the brain, progressively leading the patient to a state of total dependence, thus creating a very complex and difficult situation for the family that has to assist him/her. Early diagnosis is a primary objective and constitutes the hope of being able to intervene in the development phase of the disease. Methods : In this paper, a method to automatically detect the presence of Alzheimer’s disease, by exploiting deep learning, is proposed. Five different convolutional neural networks are considered: ALEX_NET, VGG16, FAB_CONVNET, STANDARD_CNN and FCNN. The first two networks are state-of-the-art models, while the last three are designed by authors. We classify brain images into one of the following classes: non-demented, very mild demented and mild demented. Moreover, we highlight on the image the areas symptomatic of Alzheimer presence, thus providing a visual explanation behind the model diagnosis. Results : The experimental analysis, conducted on more than 6000 magnetic resonance images, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed neural networks in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and localization. The best results in terms of metrics are the best with STANDARD_CNN and FCNN with accuracy, precision and recall between 98% and 95%. Excellent results also from a qualitative point of view are obtained with the Grad-CAM for localization and visual explainability. Conclusions : The analysis of the heatmaps produced by the Grad-CAM algorithm shows that in almost all cases the heatmaps highlight regions such as ventricles and cerebral cortex. Future work will focus on the realization of a network capable of analyzing the three anatomical views simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder which affects a significant proportion of the population, with estimates suggesting that about 1 in 100 children worldwide are affected by ASD. This study introduces a new Deep Neural Network for identifying ASD in children through gait analysis, using features extracted from frames composing video recordings of their walking patterns. The innovative method presented herein is based on imagery and combines gait analysis and deep learning, offering a noninvasive and objective assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders while delivering high accuracy in ASD detection. Our model proposes a bimodal approach based on the concatenation of two distinct Convolutional Neural Networks processing two feature sets extracted from the same videos. The features obtained from the convolutions of both networks are subsequently flattened and merged into a single vector, serving as input for the fully connected layers in the binary classification process. This approach demonstrates the potential for effective ASD detection in children through the combination of gait analysis and deep learning techniques.},

For this purpose, an original online approach was adopted to provide a dynamic evaluation of handwriting/drawing performance of healthy participants with no history of any psychiatric disorders ( n = 2 8 ), and patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression ( n = 2 7 ). Both groups were asked to complete seven tasks requiring either the writing or drawing on a paper while five handwriting/drawing features’ categories (i.e. pressure on the paper, time, ductus, space among characters, and pen inclination) were recorded by using a digitalized tablet. The collected records were statistically analyzed. Results showed that, except for pressure, all the considered features, successfully discriminate between depressed and nondepressed subjects. In addition, it was observed that depression affects different writing/drawing functionalities. These findings suggest the adoption of writing/drawing tasks in the clinical practice as tools to support the current depression detection methods. This would have important repercussions on reducing the diagnostic times and treatment formulation.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a few-shot transfer learning approach was introduced to decode movement intention from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, allowing to recognize new tasks with minimal adaptation. To this end, a dataset of EEG signals recorded during the preparation of complex sub-movements was created from a publicly available data collection. The dataset was divided into two parts: the source domain dataset (including 5 classes) and the support (target domain) dataset , (including 2 classes) with no overlap between the two datasets in terms of classes. The proposed methodology consists in projecting EEG signals into the space-frequency-time domain, in processing such projections (rearranged in channels × frequency frames) by means of a custom EEG-based deep neural network (denoted as EEGframeNET5), and then adapting the system to recognize new tasks through a few-shot transfer learning approach. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 72.45 ± 4.19% in the 5-way classification of samples from the source domain dataset, outperforming comparable studies in the literature. In the second phase of the study, a few-shot transfer learning approach was proposed to adapt the neural system and make it able to recognize new tasks in the support dataset. The results demonstrated the system’s ability to adapt and recognize new tasks with an average accuracy of 80 ± 0.12% in discriminating hand opening/closing preparation and outperforming reported results in the literature. This study suggests the effectiveness of EEG in capturing information related to the motor preparation of complex movements, potentially paving the way for BCI systems based on motion planning decoding. The proposed methodology could be straightforwardly extended to advanced EEG signal processing in other scenarios, such as motor imagery or neural disorder classification.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of trust-based approaches in social scenarios modeled as multi-agent systems (MAS) has been recognized as a valid solution to improve the effectiveness of these communities. In fact, they make interactions taking place in social scenarios much fruitful as possible, limiting or even avoiding malicious or fraudulent behaviors, including collusion. This is also the case of multi-layered neural networks (NN), which can face limited, incomplete, misleading, controversial or noisy datasets, produced by untrustworthy agents. Many strategies to deal with malicious agents in social networks have been proposed in the literature. One of the most effective is represented by Eigentrust, often adopted as a benchmark. It can be seen as a variation of PageRank, an algorithm for determining result rankings used by search engines like Google. Moreover, Eigentrust can also be viewed as a linear neural network whose architecture is represented by the graph of Web pages. A major drawback of Eigentrust is that it uses some additional information about agents that can be a priori considered particularly trustworthy, rewarding them in terms of reputation, while the non pre-trusted agents are penalized. In this paper, we propose a different strategy to detect malicious agents which does not modify the real reputation values of the honest ones. We introduce a measure of effectiveness when computing reputation in presence of malicious agents. Moreover, we define a metric of error useful to quantitatively determine how much an algorithm for the identification of malicious agents modifies the reputation scores of the honest ones. We have performed an experimental campaign of mathematical simulations on a dynamic multi-agent environment. The obtained results show that our method is more effective than Eigentrust in determining reputation values, presenting an error which is about a thousand times lower than the error produced by Eigentrust on medium-sized social networks.},

  abstract     = {The stable decoding of movement parameters using neural activity is crucial for the success of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). However, neural activity can be unstable over time, leading to changes in the parameters used for decoding movement, which can hinder accurate movement decoding. To tackle this issue, one approach is to transfer neural activity to a stable, low-dimensional manifold using dimensionality reduction techniques and align manifolds across sessions by maximizing correlations of the manifolds. However, the practical use of manifold stabilization techniques requires knowledge of the true subject intentions such as target direction or behavioral state. To overcome this limitation, an automatic unsupervised algorithm is proposed that determines movement target intention before manifold alignment in the presence of manifold rotation and scaling across sessions. This unsupervised algorithm is combined with a dimensionality reduction and alignment method to overcome decoder instabilities. The effectiveness of the BMI stabilizer method is represented by decoding the two-dimensional (2D) hand velocity of two rhesus macaque monkeys during a center-out-reaching movement task. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using correlation coefficient and R -squared measures, demonstrating higher decoding performance compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised BMI stabilizer. The results offer benefits for the automatic determination of movement intents in long-term BMI decoding. Overall, the proposed method offers a promising automatic solution for achieving stable and accurate movement decoding in BMI applications.},

We consider the primal form of the arising optimization task and investigate the use of nonlinear kernels. We show that by choosing the so-called adaptive Hermite function system as the basis of the orthogonal projections in our classification scheme, several real-world signal processing problems can be successfully solved. In particular, we test the effectiveness of our method in two case studies corresponding to anomaly detection. First, we consider the detection of abnormal peaks in accelerometer data caused by sensor malfunction. Then, we show that the proposed classification algorithm can be used to detect abnormalities in ECG data. Our experiments show that the proposed method produces comparable results to the state-of-the-art while retaining desired properties of SVM classification such as light weight architecture and interpretability. We implement the proposed method on a microcontroller and demonstrate its ability to be used for real-time applications.

However, aggregating the personal data of these drivers may lead to insufficient data usage and pose a risk of privacy breaches. To address these issues, a framework called Group Federated Learning (Group-FL) for large-scale driver drowsiness detection is proposed, which can efficiently utilize diverse client data while protecting privacy. First, by arranging the clients into different levels of groups and gradually aggregating their model parameters from low-level groups to high-level groups, communication and time costs are reduced. In addition, to solve the problem of notable variations in EEG signals among different clients, a global-personalized deep neural network is designed. The global model extracts shared features from various clients, while the personalized model extracts fine-grained features from each client and outputs classification results. Finally, to address special issues such as scale/category imbalance and data pollution, three checking modules are designed for adjusting grouping, evaluating client data, and effectively applying personalized models. Through extensive experimentation, the effectiveness of each component within the framework was validated, and a mean accuracy, F 1-score, and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 81.0%, 82.0%, and 87.9% was achieved, respectively, on a publicly available dataset comprising 11 subjects.},

In this paper, we design single-graphic and matched/unmatched double-graphic visual stimulus experiments and collect 12 subjects’ fMRI data to explore the brain’s visual perception processes. In the double-graphic stimulus experiment, we focus on the high-level semantic information as “matching”, and remove tail-to-tail conjunction by designing a model to screen the matching-related voxels. Then, we perform Bayesian causal learning between fMRI voxels based on the transfer entropy, establish a hierarchical Bayesian causal network (HBcausalNet) of the visual cortex, and use the model for visual stimulus image reconstruction. HBcausalNet achieves an average accuracy of 70.57% and 53.70% in single- and double-graphic stimulus image reconstruction tasks, respectively, higher than HcorrNet and HcasaulNet. The results show that the matching-related voxel screening and causality analysis method in this paper can extract the “matching” information in fMRI, obtain a direct causal relationship between matching information and fMRI, and explore the causal inference process in the brain.

  abstract     = {Punctate White Matter Damage (PWMD) is a common neonatal brain disease, which can easily cause neurological disorder and strongly affect life quality in terms of neuromotor and cognitive performance. Especially, at the neonatal stage, the best cure time can be easily missed because PWMD is not conducive to the diagnosis based on current existing methods. The lesion of PWMD is relatively straightforward on T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T1 MRI), showing semi-oval, cluster or linear high signals. Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Image (DT-MRI, referred to as DTI) is a noninvasive technique that can be used to study brain microstructures in vivo , and provide information on movement and cognition-related nerve fiber tracts. Therefore, a new method was proposed to use T1 MRI combined with DTI for better neonatal PWMD analysis based on DTI super-resolution and multi-modality image registration. First, after preprocessing, neonatal DTI super-resolution was performed with the three times B-spline interpolation algorithm based on the Log-Euclidean space to improve DTIs’ resolution to fit the T1 MRIs and facilitate nerve fiber tractography. Second, the symmetric diffeomorphic registration algorithm and inverse b0 image were selected for multi-modality image registration of DTI and T1 MRI. Finally, the 3D lesion models were combined with fiber tractography results to analyze and predict the degree of PWMD lesions affecting fiber tracts. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and super performance of our proposed method. This streamlined technique can play an essential auxiliary role in diagnosing and treating neonatal PWMD.},

  abstract     = {Pain is an experience of unpleasant sensations and emotions associated with actual or potential tissue damage. In the global context, billions of people are affected by pain disorders. There are particular challenges in the measurement and assessment of pain, and the commonly used pain measuring tools include traditional subjective scoring methods and biomarker-based measures. The main tools for biomarker-based analysis are electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography and functional magnetic resonance. The EEG-based quantitative pain measurements are of immense value in clinical pain management and can provide objective assessments of pain intensity. The assessment of pain is now primarily limited to the identification of the presence or absence of pain, with less research on multilevel pain. High power laser stimulation pain experimental paradigm and five pain level classification methods based on EEG data augmentation are presented. First, the EEG features are extracted using modified S-transform, and the time-frequency information of the features is retained. Based on the pain recognition effect, the 20–40 Hz frequency band features are optimized. Afterwards the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty is used for feature data augmentation. It can be inferred from the good classification performance of features in the parietal region of the brain that the sensory function of the parietal lobe region is effectively activated during the occurrence of pain. By comparing the latest data augmentation methods and classification algorithms, the proposed method has significant advantages for the five-level pain dataset. This research provides new ways of thinking and research methods related to pain recognition, which is essential for the study of neural mechanisms and regulatory mechanisms of pain.},
