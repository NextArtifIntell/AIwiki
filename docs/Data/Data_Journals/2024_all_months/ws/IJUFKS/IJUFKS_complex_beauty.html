  abstract     = {This paper examines a multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSPP) under an uncertain environment for a directed graph. The zigzag uncertain variables are used to represent the uncertain parameters. The expected and optimistic value models of uncertain MOSPP (UMOSPP) have been formulated, and their correlated deterministic transformation is also provided. Moreover, using three existing multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) and two proposed aspiration level (AL) based algorithms: AL-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II, and AL-based NSGA-III, the deterministic models are solved. As an application, a mock fire drill problem has been considered in the context of UMOSPP. A comparison is presented between the proposed methods and several MOGAs. A sensitivity analysis of objective functions has also been carried out regarding the shape parameter and aspiration level. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the performance measure coverage is calculated.},

We prove that the procedure is refutation sound and finitely complete. As a consequence, solutions to the deduction, satisfiability, and validity problems will be proposed for the finite case.

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been an increasing need for artificial text summarizing algorithms that attempt to automatically condense a document into a shorter form due to the rapid and exponential growth of textual data. As a result, automated text summarization is utilized by an extensive wide range of companies to help people find the most significant information. But still, there is a challenge in creating a brief and short summary of the original material that contains the key concepts. This paper intends to propose an abstractive text summarization based on LSTM with transfer learning methods. Initially, the long text-based document summarization process includes two phases. In the first phase, the input text is preprocessed for stop word removal and stemming techniques to reduce the document size. Then features like improved bag of words, TF-IDF, aspect term extraction and average word length-based features are extracted from the preprocessed text. In the second phase, the knowledge extraction has been performed. In the knowledge extraction, tokens are generated using BERT tokenization and the co-occurrence is utilized using improved co-occurrence matrix generation. The proposed method achieves the highest recall in 80% of learning which is 1.75% 1.39%, 2.58%, 1.19%, 0.30%, and 2.28% better than the other models such as Bi-GRU, RNN, LSTM, SVM-LR, CNN, LSTM-GRU and GRU respectively. Further, the knowledge extraction and the extracted features are subjected to the improved LSTM network, where the features are trained as the pre-trained model via transfer learning. This is the phase, where the final summary is produced.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an unsupervised feature selection method based on regularized weighted Fuzzy C-Means (WRFCM) clustering. When the target task is clustering, our objective should be to select a subset of features that can generate the same/similar partition matrix to the partition matrix obtained from the original high dimensional data by a clustering algorithm. To achieve this we propose a novel objective function keeping in view the Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. This approach realizes feature selection within the WRFCM framework, emphasizing features to maintain the FCM-based target partition. We evaluate our method using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Kuhn-Munkres index (KM-index). NMI, and ARI measure the agreement between clusters, i.e, the partition in the lower dimension and the partition of the original data. On the other hand, KM-index measures the disagreement between the two partitions. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets showcase our method’s efficacy in selecting informative features. This approach fills a crucial gap in unsupervised feature selection, making it valuable for real-world applications. The approach is very general in the sense that the target partition can be generated by any clustering algorithm or even by the actual class labels of the data, when they are available.},

In our education system, at the school level, teachers focus on something other than the development of the skills mentioned above. Which is passed on to the next cadre and even reflected in the professional lives of students. Most research on spatial thinking ability develops at the undergraduate or primary levels. However, there is a need to work on adolescents in middle school who are at the stage of learning and manipulating abstract concepts. In this study, a spatial thinking learning application based on AR technology is developed and evaluated using Unity 3D with AR foundation libraries. AR technology’s augmented and immersive characteristics helped adolescents (12–13 years) visualize objects in three dimensions and make inferences about them. One group pre and posttest pre-experimental research design was followed. Statistically significant results of pre- and post-surveys and graphs of in-app calculations provide evidence of learning. This experience allowed students to actively practice spatial constructs, enhance their spatial reasoning skills, and boost their self-efficacy while using these skills.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, training has emerged as a crucial element in enhancing learning performance and memory retention. This research aims to elucidate the significant impact of exercise on the learning processes within the manufacturing workforce, facilitated by the potent tool of big data analytics. A pioneering hybrid methodology is introduced, which seamlessly integrates neural network techniques with the intelligent water drops optimization algorithm. To rigorously evaluate this methodology, a performance evaluation dataset comprising 1,250 samples, each characterized by a diverse array of attributes, is utilized. The integrated approach combines two pivotal techniques: feature selection empowered by the intelligent water drops algorithm and classification executed through neural networks. The findings reveal an optimal neural network configuration featuring 11 neurons in the hidden layers, along with the selection of the Pure linear (purelin) transfer function and the Train using Scaled Conjugate Gradient (traincgb) training function. The implications of this methodology are profound, demonstrating a remarkable 22% improvement over the baseline method. This underscores the pivotal role of exercise and physical activity, accounting for approximately 68%, in enhancing the learning and efficiency of the workforce. Notably, this research transcends existing studies by providing a specialized lens through which the relationship between exercise, cognitive function, and learning within the realm of workforce planning is examined. Additionally, dataset performance is bolstered through the inclusion of 875 training samples, highlighting the critical importance of homogeneous parameters in achieving superior classification outcomes. In summary, this innovative artificial neural network methodology not only exhibits unparalleled performance in comparison to existing methods but also offers invaluable insights into enhancing workforce proficiency through the transformative capabilities of big data analytics.},

Previous works show that employing the graph convolutional neural network can help the model capture unstructured dependent information of entities. However, they usually employed the non-adaptive weight edges to build the correlation weight matrix which suffered from the problem of information redundancy and gradient disappearance. To solve this problem, we propose a deep gated graph reasoning model for document-level relation extraction, namely, BERT-GGNNs, which employ an improved gated graph neural network with a learnable correlation weight matrix to establish multiple deep gated graph reason layers. The proposed deep gated graph reasoning layers make the model easier to reasoning the relations between entities hidden in the document. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most of strong baseline models, and our proposed model is 0.3% and 0.3% higher than the famous LSR-BERT model on the F1 and Ing F1, respectively.},

Quantitative results demonstrate a marked improvement in classification accuracy, with our network outperforming existing state-of-the-art models by significant margins in both artist and genre classification tasks.

  abstract     = {Influence maximization plays an important role in social network analysis and has been extensively explored due to its emergence in a great deal of applications. However, a vast majority of researchers have only considered the influence of one factor on the spread of information among individuals. In addition, this factor which is mainly the influence probability, has been considered to be fixed which is estimated based on the number of neighbors of each individual. While, in reality, we do not have complete information about this probability and it is not a fixed value. Moreover, in the spread of information, other factors including trust, are also involved, which cannot be easily combined due to their different nature. In this paper, a dominance approach to influence maximization is studied under the condition, in which, complete information about influence of users on each other is not available and users infect each other based on an unknown influence probability. Furthermore, in order to make the proposed model closer to reality, trust factor is also considered as an independent factor. The proposed method is compared to several state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms and attained results on several synthetic and real social network datasets verify effectiveness of the proposed method compared to previous methods in the context of influence maximization.},

  abstract     = {Social media texts like tweets and blogs are collaboratively created by human interaction. Rapidly changing trends are leading to topic drift in the social media text. This drift is usually associated with words and hashtags. However, geotags play an essential part in determining topic distribution with location context. The rate of change in the distribution of words, hashtags and geotags cannot be considered uniform and must be handled accordingly. This paper builds a topic model that associates the topic with a mixture of distributions of words, hashtags and geotags. Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamic model with varying mini-batch sizes is used to capture the changes due to the asynchronous distribution of words and tags. Topic representations with co-occurrence and location contexts are specified as hashtag context vector and geotag context vector respectively. These two vectors are jointly learned to yield topical word embedding vectors over time conditioned on hashtags and geotags that can predict location-based topical variations effectively. When evaluated with Chennai and UK geolocated Twitter data, the proposed joint topical word embedding model enhanced by the social tags context, outperforms other methods.},

  abstract     = {Interval multi-objective linear programming (IMOLP) ímodels are one of the methods to tackle uncertainties. In this paper, we propose two methods to determine the efficient solutions in the IMOLP models through the expected value, variance and entropy operators which have good properties. One of the most important properties of these methods is to obtain different efficient solutions set according to decision makers’ preferences as available information. We first develop the concept of the expected value, variance and entropy operators on the set of intervals and study some properties of the expected value, variance and entropy operators. Then, we present an IMOLP model with uncertain parameters in the objective functions. In the first method, we use the expected value and variance operators in the IMOLP models and then we apply the weighted sum method to convert an IMOLP model into a multi-objective non-linear programming (MONLP) model. In the second method, the IMOLP model using the expected value, variance and entropy operators can be converted into a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model. The proposed methods are applicable for large scale models. Finally, to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods, numerical examples and two real-world models are solved.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable development is crucial for conserving resources and ensuring smooth supply chain operations. In the context of the complex task of supplier selection, the traditional assumptions of attribute independencies are frequently found to be inadequate. The effective interaction between attributes and their weights plays a crucial role in navigating the decision outcomes. This paper presents a Choquet integral-based hybrid interactive decision-making approach to address the two important issues regarding the weights and interaction of criteria. To achieve this aim, first a hybrid weight determination method is proposed, combining the merits of multi-objective optimization and clustering techniques. To comprehensively assess the interactions among attributes, a non-additive measure determination method is introduced, leveraging concepts such as standard deviation and correlation. This approach effectively captures the interdependencies among attributes, leading to a more accurate decision-making process. Then, the Choquet integral incorporates a logarithmic function, which serves to enhance the modeling of uncertainty and effectively address the complexities present in intricate decision-making situations. Furthermore, a comprehensive interactive MCDM model is constructed, serving as a framework for supplier selection. Finally, experimental and sensitivity analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The deficiency in data collection and reporting has led to the emergence of uncertainty in the data in the pandemic process. These matters cause that traditional statistical and mathematical models have been functionless and unreliable in this issue. In this respect, this study presents an ensemble prediction model with innovative and contemporary properties to model COVID-19 cases in the UK and USA inclusively throughout the whole pandemic process. The proposed ensemble prediction model is composed of an assembly of Type-1 fuzzy regression functions with elastic net regularization (E-T1FRF) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Thus, the proposed ensemble model can successfully model the uncertainty in the data with the fuzzy modelling perspective of T1FRF and also thoroughly adapt to the patterns in the data thanks to the flexible modelling ability of RBFNN based on data. With the proposed ensemble prediction model, the cases in the entire pandemic process from the beginning of March 2020 to the end of June 2022 were modelled and predicted for 23 different periods in one-month prediction steps. The proposed model produced predictions with MAPE values below 3% in all but periods except for three periods. Also, the average MAPE values for all periods were obtained at around 2% for the UK and only 1.5% for the US. These results, at a reasonable level of error, demonstrated the practicality of the usage of the proposed community model for other countries and provided valuable information for future action.},

The system studied in this article is more complex than previous results and more in line with the actual situation. The advantages of this study are as follows: (i) A fuzzy state observer of high gain is established to deal with the states unmeasured problem of the system. (ii) The Nussbaum function is employed to address unknown control direction and actuator failure problems, and the Smooth non-affine function is utilized to dispose of the input saturation. (iii) The dynamic surface technique introduces errors that are eliminated by using the error compensation technology, and fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to appropriate unknown nonlinear functions in the system. The controller developed in this study guarantees that tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood around the origin within FT and overall signals in the stochastic system are semi-global finite-time stable in probability (SGFSP). Finally, three simulation examples are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy.},

As a result, Recommender Systems (RS) make significant use of soft mathematical tools to deal with uncertainty. Among these tools is Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), which has been shown to be effective at dealing with the inherent uncertainty in numerous applications. This article provides a survey of the use of DST in the RS field. Thus, after a brief introduction to recommender systems and the DST, this survey discusses recent DST applications in RS. It introduces a new taxonomy that encompasses the primary application context for DST-based RS solutions, as well as a comprehensive multi-criteria analysis of the peer-reviewed papers. The resulting comparisons are analyzed to draw conclusions, identify current study limitations, and define future research directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for the entire research community that is interested in recommender systems and DST.},

The major technique which is utilized to lower the limit of information quantity is ATS. By this technique, the text documents are precisely summarized within a short time as per user requirements. However, its effectiveness is limited due to various issues like subject identification, elucidation, summary generation and analysis of the generated summary. To tackle these issues and to obtain precise and concise summarized text, this proposed approach results as the efficient multi-document summarization approach by focusing on those issues. This proposed approach is incorporated with preprocessing, feature extraction, knowledge extraction and summarization processes. Initially, preprocessing is done by BERT tokenization and it results in preprocessed tokens from multiple documents. The features extracted from preprocessed tokens are the proposed aspect term feature, TF-IDF feature, Word2Vec feature and average word length feature. After, relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed token to train modified CNN in the feature extraction process. Instantaneously, the preprocessed tokens are employed in the knowledge extraction process for extracting essential knowledge to improve the training ability of modified CNN. This modified CNN is trained with the obtained weight, extracted feature set and knowledge to obtain precise and concise summarized text from multiple documents. Thus, the final summarized outcome has been from modified CNN with transfer learning (MCNN-TL). Finally, a variety of analyses are used to assess the suggested multi-document summary methodology, demonstrating its superiority over current summarization methods.},

  abstract     = {Symbolically representing the knowledge acquired by a neural network is a profound endeavor aimed at illuminating the latent information embedded within the network. The literature offers a multitude of algorithms dedicated to extracting symbolic classification rules from neural networks. While some excel in producing highly accurate rules, others specialize in generating rules that are easily comprehensible. Nevertheless, only a scant few algorithms manage to strike a harmonious balance between comprehensibility and accuracy. One such exemplary technique is the Rule Extraction from Neural Network Using Classified and Misclassified Data (RxNCM) algorithm, which adeptly generates straightforward and precise rules outlining input data ranges with commendable accuracy. This article endeavors to enhance the classification performance of the RxNCM algorithm by leveraging ensemble technique. Ensembles, a burgeoning field, focus on augmenting classifier performance by harnessing the strengths of individual classifiers. Extraction of rules through neural network ensembles is relatively underexplored, this paper bridges the gap by introducing the Rule extraction using Neural Network Ensembles (RENNE) algorithm. RENNE is designed to refine the classification rules derived from the RxNCM algorithm through ensemble strategy. Specifically, RENNE leverages patterns correctly predicted by an ensemble of neural networks during the rule generation process. The efficacy of the algorithm is validated using seven datasets sourced from the UCI repository. The outcomes indicate that the proposed RENNE algorithm outperforms the RxNCM algorithm in terms of performance.},

All kinds of information are digitized, while the loss of information data also directly affects the normal operation of the application system and has become the biggest obstacle to the development of information technology. The existing missing filling methods do not take into account the time-series information of the data set. Based on the neural network method for filling missing data in time series, an end-to-end missing data filling method for time series based on the residual of regression equation is proposed. Under the assumption that the activation function and the noise diffusion coefficient function are satisfied, the exponential stability of the complex-valued stochastic inertial neural network systems with additive time-varying delays is studied. The bipartite graph model of the time series data missing value filling method of the countermeasure network and the filling cyclic neural unit are generated. According to the end-to-end time series data missing value filling method of the self encoder, the corresponding low-dimensional feature vector can be automatically generated for each time series data. It avoids overfitting by using nonlinear methods directly in low-dimensional space. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper uses Monte Carlo to fill data missing at different proportions. In data gap filling process, the coefficient variance is less than 0.05, which enhances the rationality of filling data. It is of great research value and practical significance to reasonably fill in the missing values of time series data. The research can accelerate the improvement of big data system, improve the level and effectiveness of database management, and is an important means of computing capacity of existing data centers.},

It is the most critical technology in the Industrial Internet of Things information-gathering layer and is extensively applied in various industries, such as smart production, asset management, and monitoring. The signal collision caused by the communication between the reader/writer and tags sharing the same wireless channel has caused a series of problems, such as the reduction of the identification efficiency of the reader/writer and the increment of the missed reading rate, thus restricting the further development of RFID. At present, many hybrid anti-collision algorithms integrate the advantages of Aloha and TS algorithms to optimize RFID system performance, but these solutions also suffer from performance bottlenecks. In order to break through such performance bottleneck, based on the ISE-BS algorithm, we combined the sub-frame observation mechanism and the Q value adjustment strategy and proposed two hybrid anti-collision algorithms. The experimental results show that the two algorithms proposed in this paper have obvious advantages in system throughput, time efficiency and other metrics, surpassing existing UHF RFID anti-collision algorithms.},

  abstract     = {At present, as a research hotspot for time series data (TSD), the deep clustering analysis of TSD has huge research value and practical significance. However, there still exist the following three problems: (1) For deep clustering based on joint optimization, the inevitably mutual interference existing between deep feature representation learning progress and clustering progress leads to difficult model training especially in the initial stage, the possible feature space distortion, inaccurate and weak feature representation; (2) Existing deep clustering methods are difficult to intuitively define the similarity of time series and rely heavily on complex feature extraction networks and clustering algorithms. (3) Multidimensional time series have the characteristics of high dimensions, complex relationships between dimensions, and variable data forms, thus generating a huge feature space. It is difficult for existing methods to select discriminative features, resulting in generally low accuracy of methods. Accordingly, to address the above three problems, we proposed a novel general two-stage multi-dimensional spatial features based multi-view deep clustering method 1DCAE-TSSAMC (One-dimensional deep convolutional auto-encoder based two-stage stepwise amplification multi-clustering). We conducted verification and analysis based on real-world important multi-scenario, and compared with many other benchmarks ranging from the most classic approaches such as K-means and Hierarchical to the state-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning such as Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) and Temporal Clustering Network (TCN). Experimental results show that the new method outperforms the other benchmarks, and provides more accurate, richer, and more reliable analysis results, more importantly, with significant improvement in accuracy and spatial linear separability.},

  abstract     = {Highly dynamic Internet of Vehicles spectrum sharing can share spectrum owned by vehicle-to-infrastructure links through multiple workshop links to achieve efficient resource allocation. Aiming at the problem that the rapid variations in channel states in highly dynamic vehicular environments can make it challenging for base stations to gather and manage information about instantaneous channel states, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based V2X spectrum access algorithm. The algorithm is designed to optimize the throughput of V2I user under V2V user delay and reliability constraints, and uses the experience gained from interacting with the communication environment to update the Q network to improve spectrum and power allocation strategies. Implicit collaborative agents are trained through an improved DQN model combined with dueling network architecture and long short-term memory network layers and public rewards. With lagged Q-learning and concurrent experience replay trajectories, the training process was stabilized and the non-stationarity problem caused by concurrent learning of multiple agents was resolved. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented algorithm achieves a mean successful payload delivery rate of 95.89%, which is 16.48% greater than that of the randomized baseline algorithm. Our algorithm obtains approximately the optimal value and shows performance close to the centralized brute force algorithm, which provides a better strategy for further minimizing the signaling overhead of the Internet of Vehicles communication system.},

Deep learning is widely used in industrial defect detection. However, the performance of electronic component defect detection at the pixel segmentation level needs to be improved. For pixel-level defect detection, this paper constructs a defect detection model (ECSDDNet) for electronic component surface defects in computer vision engineering management system. To improve the segmentation accuracy and detection effect, three stages of experiments are conducted to address mis-segmentation problems and the shortcomings of the Unet network structure. Firstly, a classification network that can perform weight transfer is used to replace the encoding structure in the Unet network. Secondly, a simplified version of the feature fusion is proposed and added to the skip connection of the Unet network. Finally, label smoothing is used to optimize the loss and improve the generalization of the network. After the optimization experiment, some noisy contours and small defect contours that are mis-segmented are removed. Experimental results show that ECSDDNet has good segmentation effects on electronic component surface defects and can meet the segmentation and detection needs of electronic component surface defects.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of intelligent vehicle technology, traditional vehicle design and manufacturing methods are facing many challenges. Traditional vehicle design and manufacturing methods have problems such as high cost, long development cycle and lack of personalized design. This paper took advantage of the high degree of flexibility, rapid customization and cost savings of 3D printing technology, which can provide entirely new solutions for intelligent vehicle design. This paper mainly analyzed the application of three-dimensional (3D) printing and manufacturing technology in intelligent vehicle design. In intelligent vehicle design, 3D printing can carry out 3D printed body structure design to make parts lightweight. The displacement sensor in the intelligent sensor can measure the displacement, deformation and vibration of the body components, and detect whether the body structure exceeds the safety range, which can provide safety feedback to the owner. 3D printing technology has been involved in automotive dashboard, interior design and customization. In this paper, the effects of vehicles designed under traditional methods and vehicles designed under 3D printing manufacturing technology were compared. The research and development cycle of class A, Class B, Class C and Class D in brand 1 under traditional manufacturing was 3.85 years, 3.13 years, 4.27 years and 4.32 years respectively. The R&amp;D (research and development) cycle of grade A, B, C and D in brand 1 under 3D printing technology was 2.43 years, 2.05 years, 1.64 years and 1.73 years respectively. Under the traditional method, the average R&amp;D cost of different levels of vehicles in brand 1, brand 2 and brand 3 was 191,000 yuan, 20900 yuan and 227,200 yuan respectively. Under 3D printing technology, the average R&amp;D cost of different levels of vehicles in brand 1, brand 2 and brand 3 was 132,600 yuan, 145,300 yuan and 157,500 yuan respectively. The results of this paper emphasize that the application of 3D printing manufacturing technology shortens the development cycle of intelligent vehicles, reduces the development cost, and can be customized, which can be more in line with the needs of users.},

  abstract     = {The spatial land change of villages and towns can be analyzed through external spatio-temporal characteristics, which can realize the evaluation of historical development and assist the implementation of planning and design norms and the implementation of problem rectification. To explore the specific process and the overall pattern of land use change, it is necessary to analyze and predict all kinds of data in a unified way to grasp the law of development and the direction of future development. This paper takes the spatial development and planning of villages and towns as the research object, selects the remote sensing image data of regional historical development as the driving factor, combines with Gaussian function fitting to calculate the training samples, and constructs the regional spatial environment analysis system. According to the processing model of external characteristics of time series, the spatial distribution and evolution of Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) and its components are analyzed. The multi-dimensional remote sensing data is innovatively fused into the time series processing model. Besides, the curve which can characterize the spatial change law and is not completely symmetrical is obtained through the least square method fitting so that the data with unequal time series intervals can be flexibly processed. Finally, through the experimental analysis, the traditional Asymmetric Gaussian model (A-G) and Savitzky-Golay (S-G) are taken to compare and analyze the effect of various factors on the processing of time series characteristics. Tests show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the comparison method in noise removal of remote sensing data. The data fitting coefficient is 0.02, and the root mean square measurement error is more than 7% higher than the comparison method. It can predict the trend of land use change distribution, play a key role in assisting decision-making for different land use transformations and utilization in villages and towns, and make a scientific evaluation for the impact of social and economic development potential.},

  abstract     = {The time-varying delay is a peculiar phenomenon that occurs in almost all systems. It can cause numerous problems and instability during system operation. In this paper, the time-varying delay is considered in both the states and input vectors, which is a significant distinction between the proposed method here and previous algorithms. Furthermore, the time-varying delay is unknown but bounded. To address this issue, the Razumikhin approach is applied to the proposed method, as it incorporates a Lyapunov function with the original non-augmented state space of the system models, in contrast to the Krasovskii formula. Moreover, the Razumikhin method performs better and avoids the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii method, particularly when dealing with large delays and disturbances. For achieving output stabilization, the model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the system. The considered system in this paper is an interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy T-S model, which provides a more accurate estimation of the dynamic model of the system. The online optimization problems are solved using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which reduces the computational burden and online computational costs compared to offline and non-LMI approaches. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This study systematically investigates how Indian government agencies used social media platform-Twitter to disseminate the relevant information, and to reach out to the citizens during COVID 19 crisis. Spread across various parameters over many days, the twitter data was scrapped from the official Twitter accounts of different government officials. To aggregate and summarize this multi-dimensional data and to process it further, a novel multi-criteria decision making based framework that makes the use of Clustering and Ordered weighted operators is being introduced in this study. Many OWA operators have been introduced in the recent past after their introduction in late 90s, and are used successfully for aggregation purposes in many domains. The summarized values received as an output of the framework are then used to analyze the government response towards COVID 19 situation across various parameters.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, heterogeneous network/graph representation learning/embedding (HNE) has drawn tremendous attentions from research communities in multiple disciplines. HNE has shown its outstanding performances in various networked data analysis and mining tasks. In fact, most of real-world information networks in multiple fields can be modelled as the heterogeneous information networks (HIN). Thus, the HNE-based techniques can sufficiently capture rich-structured and semantic latent features from the given information network in order to facilitate for different task-driven learning tasks. This is considered as fundamental success of HNE-based approach in comparing with previous traditional homogeneous network/graph based embedding techniques. However, there are recent studies have also demonstrated that the heterogeneous network/graph modelling and embedding through graph neural network (GNN) is not usually reliable. This challenge is original come from the fact that most of real-world heterogeneous networks are considered as incomplete and normally contain a large number of feature noises. Therefore, multiple attempts have proposed recently to overcome this limitation. Within this approach, the meta-path-based heterogeneous graph-structured latent features and GNN-based parameters are jointly learnt and optimized during the embedding process. However, this integrated GNN and heterogeneous graph structure (HGS) learning approach still suffered a challenge of effectively parameterizing and fusing different graph-structured latent features from both GNN- and HGS-based sides into better task-driven friendly and noise-reduced embedding spaces. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a novel attention-supplemented heterogeneous graph structure embedding approach, called as: AGSE. Our proposed AGSE model supports to not only achieve the combined rich heterogeneous structural and GNN-based aggregated node representations but also transform achieved node embeddings into noise-reduced and task-driven friendly embedding space. Extensive experiments in benchmark heterogeneous networked datasets for node classification task showed the effectiveness of our proposed AGSE model in comparing with state-of-the-art network embedding baselines.},

  abstract     = {Shortest Path Problem (SPP) is mainly used in network optimization; also, it has a wide range of applications such as routing, scheduling, communication and transportation. The main objective of this work is to find the shortest path between two specified nodes by satisfying certain constraints. This modified version of SP is called Constraint Shortest Path (CSP), which establishes a certain limit on selected constraints for the path. The limit for constraint values is precisely specified in traditional CSP problems. But, the precise data may vary due to environmental conditions, traffic and payload. To resolve this, the proposed CSP uses intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to deal with imprecise data. Also, finding an optimal solution in the complex search space of an undirected network is difficult. Hence, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used in the proposed work to obtain the optimal global solution within feasible regions. A numerical example and the implementation of the proposed work in Matlab 2016a working environment are also illustrated. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed PSO algorithm takes 1.8 s to find the CSP in a specified undirected network graph, which is comparatively lower than the existing Genetic Algorithm (2.4 s) and without optimization (5.6 s).},

  abstract     = {Neuro-fuzzy techniques have been widely used in many applications due to their ability to generate interpretable fuzzy rules. Ensemble learning, on the other hand, is an emerging paradigm in artificial intelligence used to improve performance results by combining multiple single learners. This paper aims to develop and evaluate a set of homogeneous ensembles over four medical datasets using hyperparameter tuning of four neuro-fuzzy systems: adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy system (DENFIS), Hybrid fuzzy inference system (HyFIS), and neuro-fuzzy classifier (NEFCLASS). To address the interpretability challenges and to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data, the information gain filter was used to identify the most relevant features. After that, the performance of the neuro-fuzzy single learners and ensembles was evaluated using four performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score. To decide which single learners/ensembles perform better, the Scott-Knott and Borda count techniques were used. The Scott-Knott first groups the models based on the accuracy to find the classifiers appearing in the best cluster, while the Borda count ranks the models based on all the four performance metrics without favoring any of the metrics. Results showed that: (1) The number of the combined single learners positively impacts the performance of the ensembles, (2) Single neuro-fuzzy classifiers demonstrate better or similar performance to the ensembles, but the ensembles still provide better stability of predictions, and (3) Among the ensembles of different models, ANFIS provided the best ensemble results.},

However, in that existing method, when collecting different types of preferences from a single expert, sometimes some subtle cognitive inconsistency may occur. To eliminate such inconsistency, this work elaborately analyzes the possible reasons and proposes some amendment together with a new distinguishable set of formulations for modeling. In addition, we further consider two situations of the weighting models for the problem, with one only considering the situation of single expert with no risk of cognitive inconsistency and the other considering the case of multiple experts wherein some inconsistency might occur.

This paper investigates the Constrained Multi-Objective Travelling Salesman Problem (CMOTSP) and the Constrained Multi-Objective Solid Travelling Salesman Problem (CMOSTSP) under an uncertain environment with zigzag uncertain variables. To solve CMOTSP and CMOSTSP models under uncertain environment, the expected value and optimistic value models are developed using two different ranking criteria of uncertainty theory. The models are transformed to their deterministic forms using the fundamentals of uncertainty. The Models are solved using two solution methodologies Aspiration level-based Multi-Objective Quasi Oppositional Jaya Algorithm (AL-based MOQO Jaya) and Fuzzy Programming Technique (FPT) with linear membership function. Further, the numerical illustration is solved using both methodologies to demonstrate its application. The sensitivity of the OVM model’s objective functions regarding confidence levels is also investigated to look at the variation in the objective function. The paper concludes that the developed approach has solved CMOTSP and CMOSTSP efficiently with an effective output and provides alternative solutions for decision-making to DM.},

It commonly suffers of false alarms and missed detections. These situations focus on enhancing explainability, mitigating bias and creating better outcomes for all. Most the probabilistic data association (PDA) methods are weakly able, or even unable, to explain data association. To overcome these situations, the XAI components employed of two modules of Fuzzy-joint probability data association (FJDA) and Fuzzy maneuver compensator (FMC) are first established. Next, these two modules are further employed to construct maneuver tracking scheme, FJDA is then utilized to evaluate the association degree of measurements belonging to different targets and FMC plays compensation role in accordance with maneuver need. The performances of the proposed maneuver tracking scheme were compared with the PDA method and the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) method using simulated radar surveillance data under a high cluttered environment. The numerical simulation proposed maneuver tracking scheme embedded XAI components FJDA/FCM having a remarkable improvement, due to fully utilize the useful knowledge information in the data association and reduces the impact of measurement uncertainties of the maneuvering target tracking with changing dynamics.},

Motivated by the nature of the GHM operator, we examine which FRPCA algorithm is suitable for use to achieve optimal performance of the new classifier. The effects of dimensionality reduction and fuzziness variable on classification accuracy are examined. The performance of the new classifier is tested on three real-world datasets: fertility, horse-colic, and Haberman’s survival. Compared with previously studied similarity classifiers, the new method achieved improved classification accuracy for the tested datasets. In fertility dataset, the new classifier achieved improvements in accuracy of 1 4 . 6 0 % , 1 9 . 7 3 % , and 2 3 . 0 0 % compared with the OWA, generalized mean, and arithmetic mean based classifiers respectively.

Indeed, the first one is employed to approximate the nonlinear system model’s and the second one to estimate the unknown states. Special attention is paid for the used approximators robustness under unmodeled dynamics, parameter variations and process noise. It should be noted that the asymptotic stability of both the fuzzy adaptive controls and the observer convergence for each scheme have been proved. In addition, the employed schemes have been simulated on a two-tank coupled nonlinear system. Thus, from simulation results, we can prove that the proposed methods guarantee that all signals for closed loop systems are both regular and bounded.

However, little effort has as yet been made to address the issue of endogeneity in the interrelationships between productive performance and its determinants. We address this issue by proposing a Two-Dimensional Fuzzy-Monte Carlo Analysis (2DFMC) approach. The joint use of stochastic and fuzzy approaches – within the ambit of 2DFMCA – offers methodological tools to mitigate epistemic uncertainty while increasing research validity and reproducibility: (i) preliminary performance assessment by fuzzy ideal solutions; and (ii) robust stochastic regression of the performance scores into the epistemic sources of uncertainty related to the levels of physical and human capitals measured in distinct countries at different epochs. By applying the proposed method to a sample of 23 countries for 1890–2018, our results show that the best and worst-performing countries were Norway and Portugal, respectively. We further found that the intensity of human capital and the age of equipment (capital stock) have different impacts on productive performance – it has been established that capital intensity and total factor productivity are influenced by productivity performance, which, in turn, has a negative impact on labor productivity and GDP per capita. Our analysis provides insights to enable government policies to coordinate productive performance and other macroeconomic indicators.},

Text data pre-processing uses stemming, segmentation, tokenization, case folding, and removal of stop words, nulls, and special characters. After data pre-processing, three word embedding approaches such as Assimilated N-gram Approach (ANA), Boosted Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (BT-IDF) and Enhanced Two-Way Encoder Representation from Transformers (E-BERT) are used to extract relevant features. The extracted features from the three different approaches are concatenated using the Feature Fusion Approach (FFA). The optimal features are selected using the Intensified Hunger Games Search Optimization (I-HGSO) algorithm. Finally, aspect-based sentiment analysis is performed using the Senti-BILSTM (Deep Aspect-EMO SentiNet) autoencoder based on the Hybrid Emotional Aspect Capsule autoencoder. The experiment was built on the yelp reviews dataset, IDMB movie review dataset, Amazon reviews dataset and the Twitter sentiment dataset. A statistical evaluation and comparison of the experimental results are conducted with respect to the accuracy, precision, specificity, the f1-score, recall, and sensitivity. There is a 99.26% accuracy value in the Yelp reviews dataset, a 99.46% accuracy value in the IMDB movie reviews dataset, a 99.26% accuracy value in the Amazon reviews dataset and a 99.93% accuracy value in the Twitter sentiment dataset.},

  abstract     = {Currently, social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter have evolved into valuable platforms for global communication. However, due to their extensive user bases, Twitter is often misused by illegitimate users engaging in illicit activities. While there are numerous research papers available that delve into combating illegitimate users on Twitter, a common shortcoming in most of these works is the failure to address the issue of class imbalance, which significantly impacts the effectiveness of spam detection. Few other research works that have addressed class imbalance have not yet applied bio-inspired algorithms to balance the dataset. Therefore, we introduce PSOB-U, a particle swarm optimization-based undersampling technique designed to balance the Twitter dataset. In PSOB-U, various classifiers and metrics are employed to select majority samples and rank them. Furthermore, an ensemble learning approach is implemented to combine the base classifiers in three stages. During the training phase of the base classifiers, undersampling techniques and a cost-sensitive random forest (CS-RF) are utilized to address the imbalanced data at both the data and algorithmic levels. In the first stage, imbalanced datasets are balanced using random undersampling, particle swarm optimization-based undersampling, and random oversampling. In the second stage, a classifier is constructed for each of the balanced datasets obtained through these sampling techniques. In the third stage, a majority voting method is introduced to aggregate the predicted outputs from the three classifiers. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the detection of illegitimate users in the imbalanced Twitter dataset. Additionally, we compare our proposed work with existing models, and the predicted results highlight the superiority of our spam detection model over state-of-the-art spam detection models that address the class imbalance problem. The combination of particle swarm optimization-based undersampling and the ensemble learning approach using majority voting results in more accurate spam detection.},
