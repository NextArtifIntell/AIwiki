  abstract     = {Forecasts regarding the prices of energy commodities have long been significant to many market players. Our research examines the price of Brent crude oil on a daily basis in order to address the issue. The price series under investigation has significant financial ramifications, and the sample under investigation spans 10 years, from April 7, 2014 to March 28, 2024. In this case, cross-validation procedures and Bayesian optimization approaches are used to construct Gaussian process regression methods, and the resulting strategies are used to generate price estimates. For the out-of-sample evaluation period of March 24, 2022 to March 28, 2024, our empirical prediction technique yields relatively accurate projections of prices, as indicated by the relative root mean square error of 0.2814%. Price prediction models provide governments and investors with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions regarding the crude oil market.},

  abstract     = {Entropy is a statistical measure of unpredictability in a specific distribution that gives information about the complexity and organization of systems. In chemistry, entropy quantifies disorder and randomness among molecules in a system or process. The goal of this research is to determine the entropy-based topological indices. A wide range of alternative configurations indicates how erratic and unpredictable a system is. It quantifies uncertainty and facilitates effective data processing in information theory and computer science. Entropy is used in biology to comprehend complicated biological systems and in chemistry to analyze molecular disorders and reactions. In network analysis, topological indicators provide information on the connectivity and structure of a graph. The degree distribution, centrality metrics, and network modularity are few examples. These indicators aid in the discovery of patterns, the identification of significant nodes, and the characterization of complex system organization in several fields. The novelty of the work lies in the combination of entropy measures and degree-based indices to explore the complexity, organization, and connectivity of these networks. The graph structure is a crucial chemical network modeling, where chemical species are represented by nodes and reactions indicated by edges. In our work, we have calculated the entropy of a chain hex-derived network. We compute precise results for the recently introduced entropies by utilizing their topological indices, which are derived from the degrees of end vertices.},

The objective of this study is to determine whether thyroid hormone levels would be affected by laser radiation. We used 25 female rabbits with a 940-nm CW laser. For 3 days, radiation was delivered once daily to the region surrounding the thyroid gland with a 1 W output power and a 300 J/cm 2 energy density at a beam spot area of 1 cm 2 . Samples of blood were drawn from the ear vein. Samples were taken on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 30 following the treatment. The study’s findings demonstrated a steady decline in the thyroid gland-related hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, calcitonin levels increased in tandem with the research, and 30 days later, hormone levels were back to normal. The results suggest that thyroid hormone levels may be significantly impacted by low-power laser use. To learn more about how different laser wavelengths influence glands and perhaps be used therapeutically, more research is required.},

  abstract     = {The Y chromosome contains short tandem repeats (STRs) that have numerous applications, including forensic investigations, male identification for legal purposes, and population genetics. However, commercially available Y-STR tests have limitations in their ability to differentiate closely linked male individuals in forensic genetics. Recent studies have shown that rapidly mutating (RM) Y-STRs offer significantly greater haplotype diversity across worldwide populations than conventional Y-STRs, although some RM Y-STR loci are not included in current commercial kits. This research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of RM Y-STR haplotype frequencies in distinguishing individuals with genetic variations in the Gilgit population and other Pakistani populations. The study involved analyzing several RM Y-STRs in 56 unrelated Gilgit men and 21 other Pakistani populations. Statistical analysis showed that most of the loci maintained haplotype values, while some varied in certain cases. The results indicated that RM Y-STRs were highly effective in distinguishing genetic differences among the Gilgit population and other Pakistani populations, as evidenced by the gene diversity (GD), average GD and discrimination capacity (DC), match probability (MP), and power discrimination (PD) values calculated for the set of various RM Y-STRs in Table 1 for the Gilgit population and in Table 2 for other Pakistani populations. These findings highlight the potential of RM Y-STRs in forensic genetics and population genetics research and underscore the importance of including a diverse set of loci to maximize the discriminatory power of genetic markers. Further research could explore the utility of RM Y-STRs in other populations and their potential for use in other applications beyond forensic investigations and male identification.},

The objectives were to investigate changes in water and osmotic potential, stomatal resistance, chlorophyll fluorescence (relative fluorescence decreased ratio [Rfd] values), accumulation of Na+ ions, and proline content of leaves under salinity stress. To assess the effects of NaCl, three experiments were conducted. The first experiment involved collecting plant and soil samples from saline fields with varying salinity levels. The second experiment induced salinity in potted plants grown under natural conditions by applying NaCl either at the vegetative phase (three-leaf stage) or at the ear formation phase. The third experiment evaluated the effect of applying NaCl at different concentrations to plants grown under controlled conditions in the growth chamber. Results revealed that increasing concentrations of NaCl had significant detrimental effects on stomatal conductance, fresh and dry weight of shoots, and Rfd in Pasban-90 and Lu-26, which also showed decreased accumulation of Na and Cl at high NaCl concentrations. The tolerant lines exhibited greater Na+ and Cl contents than the sensitive ones, higher osmotic potential, less decrease in water potential, less stomatal resistance, and higher Rfd. In conclusion, a relationship exists between genotype-specific salinity tolerances and the putative role of proline and Cl in osmotic adjustment due to higher uptake of sodium.},

The authors have applied various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Gaussian naive bayes (GNB), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost (XGB) to classify the Statlog and Cleveland HD datasets. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and Cohen’s kappa have been evaluated across these HD records. This study conducted two experiments: one using default ML classifiers and another with a hybrid genetic algorithm ML (GA-ML) model. The GA has been employed as a feature selector (FS), significantly enhancing the performance of each default classifier by selecting 9 out of 13 features. Notably, the GA-XGB model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 94.83%, precision of 93.33%, sensitivity of 96.55%, F1-score of 94.52%, specificity of 93.10%, Cohen’s kappa of 0.90, a positive likelihood ratio (LR + ) of 14, a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.037, and a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 378 on the combined HD dataset. These results have been validated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. A comparative analysis has been conducted with default ML classifiers, hybrid GA-ML classifiers, and state-of-the-art methods. The results of the GA-ML models confirm the superiority of the proposed method, offering valuable insights into advancing early detection strategies and improving heart health care outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Environmentally responsible and minimal natural variation in electric power generation has been a goal of researchers for several decades. With the establishment of the electrical power generation potential from microalgae’s photosynthesis, several researchers revealed interesting microbial fuel cell configurations to improve the output of electrical parameters. However, little work is done to understand the electrical charge collected from photosynthesis. This article proposes a fuel cell-based electrochemical modeling of the micro-photosynthetic power cell. The model is developed, excluding significant analytical assumptions at stationary conditions. Due to the complexity of modeling the electron release from photosynthesis, the electron release reactions are substituted with a simpler redox coupler of similar electric potential to that of photosynthesis. The micro-photosynthetic power cell revealed that the electron collection rate does not directly correlate to the photosynthesis electron chain. It might remain constant for a specific electrical load. The peak power is obtained at a different operating loading than the internal resistance of the device. The experimental open circuit voltage ( ∼ 0.96 V) and the peak power ( ∼ 0.18 mW) are predicted accurately by this modeling approach. The results show that the fill factor remains constant with respect to several effective electrode surface areas. Based on this theoretical modeling, we believe that with optimized algal physiological state and micro-photosynthetic power cell’s effective surface area, this micro-photosynthetic power cell will be useful for application in low-power applications.},

This therapy includes the administration of the liquid surfactant through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. Due to the difficulty of imaging neonate lungs during this therapy, the success of surfactant delivery is often determined by observational techniques and evaluation of blood oxygen levels. The limitation of imaging creates challenges in evaluating the distribution of surfactant in airways. To address this limitation, we designed a computational, eight-generation, asymmetric neonate lung model using morphometric data to mimic the geometric structure of the human airway tree and fabricated it using an additive manufacturing technique. We used our model to study two-aliquot delivery of a clinically rated liquid surfactant under two different orientations to evaluate its distribution in airways. Our study offers a complex lung airway tree design that mimics the native geometry of the human airway tree to enable studies of therapeutics transport in airways.},

Through the rigorous application of in silico methodologies, the interactions between PPARG and six natural compounds, including kanzonol X, glabrol, linolenic acid, glycyrrhizin, carnosic acid, and licoflavone A, were meticulously examined. Molecular docking studies unveiled a notable binding affinity between kanzonol X and glabrol to the PPARG receptor, indicating their potential effectiveness in regulating blood glucose levels through PPARG activation. Molecular dynamics simulations affirmed the stability of the PPARG-ligand complexes, highlighting the significance of hydrogen bonds in maintaining their stability. Furthermore, computational techniques were utilized to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties as well as the compounds’ cardiotoxicity. Encouragingly, these natural substances exhibited efficient cellular uptake, favorable bioavailability, and demonstrated no cardiotoxic effects. Kanzonol X and glabrol, abundant in G. glabra , have emerged as strong candidates for regulating blood glucose levels regulation through PPARG activation. Although computational methodologies have offered vital insights, unlocking the full potential of these compounds necessitates rigorous research and clinical trials to validate the effectiveness and safety of kanzonol X and glabrol in managing diabetes for this patient population.},

Bibliometrics is generated by the open literature index by national or international platforms, which can demonstrate the research features of AI-assisted CT diagnostic. Those obtained results indicate that the development of AI-assisted CT imaging medical research slowed down in the past 2 years. This change is affected by the appearance of some uncertainties. However, the total number of published literatures from all countries basically accelerated in the past decade. Take the year of 2022 as example; in this year, China and the United States were the world’s first and second largest contributors of relevant research literature. Researchers in these two countries have done plenty of works to the development of AI-assisted CT diagnostic. But in terms of literature influence, China still has a certain gap from the United States. Because of this, the number of high citation literature published from China is lower than those published from the United States. To some extent, this work presents the research progress of this field, so it is essential to review and apply experiences from those discussed countries.},

Nonconventional finishing technologies, with or without magnetic field assistance, play a crucial role in attaining micron-level surface finishes. The present research focuses on the fabrication of a magnetic-assisted vacuum abrasive finishing (MAVAF) setup, aimed at improving the surface finish of automobile engine coupler components. A novel magnetic-assisted self-deformable abrasive finishing (MASDAF) media was synthesized, utilizing marble waste as a base material, paraffin oil and grease as additives, and silicon carbide and iron powder as abrasive particles. The MASDAF media was characterized for its viscosity and rheological behavior and the best composition of MASDAF was selected for use in the MAVAF process. The results reveal that the percentage improvement in the change of average surface roughness value ( Δ Ra) decreased with an increase in abrasive mesh size. However, the impact of abrasive concentration on Δ Ra showed mixed effects, with Δ Ra initially increasing with increasing abrasive concentration, before declining with further increases in concentration.},

  abstract     = {The manufacturing of automobile moulds is itself a challenging job and very tedious task requiring high accuracy of component profiles. The required complicated and complex profiles are generated when the mould inserts are relinquished from several numbers of workstations, which run for a longer process time. As the accuracy needed for the component area is very high and it (insert) has to pass through several bottleneck workstations, the production time and increased buffer time are observed. This chapter focuses on providing economical methods for manufacturing hot die steel inserts. These techniques are implemented on a pressure die-casting insert component. The present solution is derived for manufacturing time reduction and minimisation of the die-casting inserts (moving and fixed die) at every stage. Implementing combined electrodes, assembly machining and cluster plate machining/sparking techniques are critical development advancements in the research. In the combined electrode concept, one electrode is designed in the same area to cover multiple areas that were initially covered by separate individual electrodes. Furthermore, this concept is outstretched by the cluster plate concept. Those electrodes that cannot be covered by a single electrode are machined together to act as a single electrode and later separated while individual sparking. Combined electrode design, assembly machining and cluster machining/sparking of the electrodes reduce the total machining time of the die and the machining centre. Reducing the machine run time will reduce the production cost and increase profit. The results achieved show that the combined electrode design setup shows 75% savings in the combined sparking setup, whereas the cluster plate machining setup shows 35% savings in the tool list generation (from software used) of the net savings. The proposed solution opens up new avenues for similar automobile components by setting benchmarks to decrease the rope length associated with manufacturing and increase profit.},

It necessitates separate finishing operations following one or more roughing stages. The precise connection between surface roughness and the influencing factors remains unclear. Existing literature tends to prioritize material removal rates and relative electrode wear over surface roughness. Additionally, previous investigations into evaluating surface roughness performance in die sinking EDM have typically examined only a limited number of variables at a time, despite the involvement of multiple parameters in the process. In the present work, a deeper understanding of how process variables impact surface finish quality were studied. Experiments were conducted on die steel workpieces, varying seven key parameters: pulse current, pulse width, gap voltage, dielectric flow rate, tool material, duty cycle, and servo feed, with the goal of achieving a superior surface finish. To assess the significance of these controlling variables and their interactions, the experimental results were analyzed using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). Subsequently, a generalized equation is developed that elucidates the relationship between surface roughness and process variables. Furthermore, confirmatory tests were conducted to validate our chosen methodology.},

Using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in epoxy matrixes, this study addresses a long-standing issue of poor interfacial adhesion while setting a new benchmark for composite mechanical performance under extreme conditions, focusing on the integration of MWNTs into epoxy resin matrixes. Poor interfacial adhesion between matrix and reinforcing nanomaterials results in up to 50% lower reinforcing efficiency than in composites without these interfacial challenges. Aerospace and cryogenic storage materials will become more durable and efficient by addressing this challenge. New research avenues are opened, particularly in developing advanced composite materials for extreme environments. The results of this study lay the groundwork for further investigation into the optimization of nanomaterial integration and novel material combinations, which could lead to breakthrough material science advancements. An ultrasonic dispersion technique is used to strengthen the interfacial bonding of MWNTs. The results demonstrate that optimal concentrations of MWNTs enhance the tensile strength, elongation at break, and fracture toughness of composites. A cryogenic mechanical property enhancement is achieved with MWNTs by epoxy-based composites.

Bio-filler reinforced polymer composites, particularly our Date seed and Acacia filler reinforced vinyl ester (DSF/AF-VE), provide multifaceted advantages like ecological sustainability, cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, reduced carbon footprint, and enhanced processability for diverse applications, including automotive components, biodegradable packaging, and lightweight construction materials. This study explores using Date seed and Acacia fillers, known for their sustainability, recyclability, and bio-degradability, in polymer composites. By incorporating these fillers with vinyl ester, we aimed to enhance properties like mechanical strength, thermal stability, and wear resistance. A standard compression molding process was chosen for this experiment due to its proven effectiveness in achieving uniform filler distribution, reproducibility of composite properties, and its suitability for large-scale industrial applications. DSF/AF-VE composites were produced with filler loadings ranging from 10% to 40%, maintaining a 50% filler/filler ratio. Our findings indicate that an optimal filler proportion significantly enhances the structural properties of the composite. A filler concentration of 15w% yielded the best tensile and flexural strength, while 20w% was optimal for impact strength. The DSF/AF-VE hybrid filler showed considerable improvements in tensile, flexural, and impact strength compared to the clear matrix, with increases of 1.53 times, 1.48 times, and 1.93 times, respectively. This study underscores the potential of Date seed and Acacia fillers in enhancing the mechanical properties of natural polymer composites, suggesting their suitability for low-load applications, such as switchboards, panels, wheel arches, and air spoilers.},

  abstract     = {In the characterization of natural fiber-reinforced composites, it is crucial to consider the nonuniform cross-section of fibers extracted from plants or leaves, which results from the inherent variation in fiber diameter. This variation is a key aspect of the actual reinforcement behavior, and disregarding it by assuming a uniform cross-section can violate the physical understanding of the composite’s mechanics. This study focuses on characterizing the elastic properties of a natural tapered sisal fiber-reinforced epoxy composite, taking into account the variation in fiber diameter along its length. To achieve this, both experimental, analytical, and micromechanics methods are employed. The experimental approach involves conducting tests to measure the mechanical properties of the composite, while the micromechanics analysis provides a framework to understand the reinforcement behavior and predict the composite’s mechanical response. The study aims to identify and present various elastic properties of the composite, including the longitudinal modulus, transverse modulus, in-plane and out-of-plane shear modulus, and major and minor Poisson’s ratios. The fiber taper angle has a significant effect on longitudinal and transverse modulus and interfacial stresses. The longitudinal modulus experiences a reduction of 25.9% when increasing the taper angle from 2 ∘ to 1 0 ∘ at a higher fiber volume fraction (40%). However, at a lower volume fraction of the same fiber (10%), the reduction in modulus is limited to 5.74%. Similarly, the transverse modulus is also affected by the taper angle.

  abstract     = {The hardness testing is vital for metals for testing and production quality control. Hardness testing is a fine indicator to determine the mechanical characteristics of metals. The various types of hardness testing methods include Rockwell, Vicker, Brinell, and Knoop testing methods. The most prevalent manual method to determine hardness is indentation using dead weight technology. However, the said technology is quite ancient and it has its own limitations, like the kinetic effect applying excessive load at actual, man-to-man variations, variation over the period due to deterioration and friction effects of moving parts like lever, weight block hanger, etc. increases the uncertainty of this method and eventually demands for upgradation of the technology. Further, the methods currently in use are open-loop and manually operated testers. The main drawback of all these testers is that they provide zero feedback, and so the obtained result needs to be compared to the desired result. To overcome the above-stated problem, the paper presents some novel modifications for measuring hardness using existing methods of Rockwell, Vicker, and Brinell testing. Toward this objective, the paper proposes to modify existing testers and develop a semiautomatic hardness testing system. Firstly, for Rockwell testing, the work aims to design a closed-loop system for hardness testing . The proposed system comprises of Arduino as an open microcontroller, a load cell along with servo motor, and its driver to establish the desired closed loop. The need of obtaining a more accurate result, free from human interference gives rise to a closed-loop system for hardness testing. The key aspect of the closed-loop system lies in retaining the basic structure of the metal. Unlike traditional hardness tester, during testing, the weight increases gradually, due to which the basic structure of metal is not deformed. Secondly, the paper proposes a computational methodology that would estimate the Vickers and Brinell hardness value. The proposed system comprises of a camera for gathering hardness indentation images, thereby automating the system. Further, these images are analyzed based on image processing software, and the indentation depth is obtained. The proposed work thus replaces human intervention to calculate the hardness of the material. The results obtained based on the proposed systems provide a proof of concept to address the problems of traditional Rockwell, Vicker, and Brinell testing.},

  abstract     = {The area of metallurgy has witnessed many advancements in the development of novel electrically conductive materials that shows exceptional mechanical as well as thermal properties. Nonetheless, traditional machining techniques encounter difficulties while machining hard materials. In order to address this limitation, electrical discharge machining (EDM) has emerged as a widely utilised method for machining of intricate geometries and the hard materials. EDM is a category of thermo-electric process that employs rapid recurring sparks between the electrode and work material, eroding the material without direct contact. As there is no contact between the electrode and work material, the issues related to machining defects such as mechanical stresses, clattering, and vibration eliminates. However, EDM have some limitations like poor surface finish and low volumetric material removal. To overcome these kind of limitations, the introduction of metallic powder into the dielectric fluid has been explored in powder-mixed electric discharge machining (PMEDM). This introduction of powder during the process leads to enhance the conductive strength of the fluid and increases the spark gap distance between the electrode and counter material. The inclusion of powder has a significant impact on the performance of the EDM process. Hence, this review aims to facilitate researchers in comprehending the concept of PMEDM and to examine the process parameters required to achieve improved levels of quality.},

  abstract     = {Due to its inherent properties, Ti64 has set many challenges in industries during its machining using conventional machining processes. Traditional machining of Ti64 is not a feasible option considering the economic and environmental perspectives. Non-conventional techniques like electrical discharge machining (EDM) are promising methods for machining Ti64 despite challenges like higher tool wear and lower machining rates. The current paper investigated the erosion rates while machining Ti64 using deep cryo-treated electrodes. The peak current (I p ), pulse on time (T on ) and gap voltage (V g ) were used as control parameters while investigating erosion rates, viz., Material Removal Rate (MRR) and Tool Wear Rate (TWR). Experiments were planned according to the RSM-based Central Composite Design (CCD). Considering the multi-objective nature of the current problem, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) has been incorporated to find a single parametric condition that will satisfy both MRR and TWR. Peak current, I p = 2 4 A, Pulse On time, T on = 1 5 0 μ s and Gap voltage, V g = 7 0 V was found to be the optimal setting giving MRR = 1 . 3 6 7 mm 3 /min and TWR = 0 . 1 7 0 mm 3 /min. Furthermore, topographical analysis of the EDMed surfaces has been performed using SEM, XRD and 3D optical profilometry techniques to characterise the surface and to investigate the possibility of other intermetallic compounds formed on the machined surface.},

  abstract     = {Coronary artery disease treatments like coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have several drawbacks, such as their invasive nature. Two main types of stents, bare metal stents (BMSs) and drug-eluting stents (DESs), are implemented to overcome these difficulties. The BMS offers strong mechanical support but can cause in-stent thrombosis and restenosis. Conventional DES, comprising a metal platform coated with drug-conjugated polymers, initially lowers restenosis but can cause early thrombosis and late in-stent restenosis. To overcome these limitations, biodegradable DESs are being explored to provide short-term support without long-term complications. However, biodegradable metal-based DES can trigger immunogenic reactions when degraded. The next generation of stents is shifting toward bioresorbable polymer-based DES because their degradation products are compatible with the metabolic system of the body. This review discusses the in vivo degradation mechanisms of bioresorbable polymers such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, and polycaprolactone (PCL) acid polymers. It was observed that these polymers primarily degrade via ester bond hydrolysis, influenced by polymer properties such as molecular weight, morphology, glass transition temperature, and composition. Additionally, this overview highlights ongoing advancements in bioresorbable polymer-based scaffolds like DESolve ® NX and FANTOM ® . These bioresorbable scaffolds are fabricated from poly-L-lactide acid and desamino tyrosine-based polymers, respectively. Polylactic-co-glycolic acid-coated platinum–chromium stents have also demonstrated effective performance, being fully absorbed within 4–6 months postimplantation. Moreover, PCL acid-based drug-eluting bifurcation stents have shown promise in treating cardiovascular diseases. However, the review emphasizes the necessity for continued research to address the existing challenges and enhance patient outcomes.},
