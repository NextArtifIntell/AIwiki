However, privacy problems are main issues of data providers for sharing data. The outflow of confidential data causes severe problems beyond the loss in finance of providers. A blockchain-based secured data-sharing model is devised for dealing with various kinds of parties. Thus, data-sharing issue is modeled as a machine learning issue by adapting federated learning (FL). Here, data privacy is controlled by sharing data in spite of exposing genuine data. At last, the FL is combined in consensus task of permissioned blockchain for accomplishing federated training. Here, the data model learning is executed using a deep maxout network (DMN), which is trained using jellyfish search African vultures optimization (JSAVO). Moreover, the data-sharing records are generated to share data amid data providers and requestors. The proposed JSAVO-based DMN outperformed with better accuracy of 93.3%, FPR of 0.054, loss function of 0.067, mean square error (MSE) of 0.346, mean average precision of 94.6, RMSE of 0.589, computational time of 17.47 s, and memory usage of 48.62 MB.},

Biometrics is currently becoming more significant specifically for higher security modules. Here, a deep feed-forward neural network-based biometric authentication system (DFFNN_biometric authentication system) is presented for biometric authentication utilizing a biometric fingerprint image. In blockchain network, biometric data are considered and the fingerprint images are fed as input. As an input fingerprint image, minutiae extraction is accomplished. Thereafter, a deep key is generated employing a deep residual network (DRN) for template protection. Thereafter, privacy protection template generation is conducted and the templates thus obtained are stored on a database (DB). On the other hand, a query fingerprint image is given as input in the authentication stage. The processes such as minutiae extraction, deep key generation using DRN and privacy protection template authentication are carried out as like it performed in the blockchain network. Additionally, the matching process is conducted between the output acquired in the authentication phase and image stored in DB. The reputation score is generated from authenticated biometric behavior. The DFFNN is utilized to generate a reputation score. Moreover, the DFFNN_biometric authentication system obtained a maximum accuracy of 90.8%, maximum genuine accept rate (GAR) of 0.936, minimum false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.588, minimum false rejection rate (FRR) of 0.556 and maximum reputation score of 9.346.},

  abstract     = {Corn is a major commodity after rice in supporting food self-sufficiency in Indonesia. However, due to leaf disease, the quality and quantity of corn plants are greatly reduced. The problem with detecting corn leaf diseases is that the detection method is still manual, making it inefficient and ineffective. Therefore, in this study, disease detection on corn leaves was performed using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) methods. First, oversampling was carried out to ensure an equal amount of data in all classes, then the corn leaf images were pre-processed before being input into the LSTM algorithm. After completing clustering process in the FCM + LSTM algorithm, the next step involved extracting texture features using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique, followed by classification using LSTM. To assess their performance, both algorithms underwent evaluation using the k -fold cross-validation method, and their accuracy and speed were compared. The results of the k -fold cross-validation demonstrated that the FCM + LSTM algorithm achieved an accuracy of 63.53%, whereas the LSTM algorithm achieved an accuracy of 80.24%. In terms of the time required for training and prediction, the LSTM algorithm took 13 min and 18 s for training on corn leaf disease images, while the prediction process only took 1.59 s. The training and prediction time required for the FCM + LSTM algorithm were 65 min and 24 s and 5 min and 44 s, respectively. The conclusion of this study is that the LSTM algorithm has better accuracy and time compared to FCM + LSTM on the dataset used in this study in terms of corn leaf disease detection.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms are increasingly used for feature selection (FS) problems due to their robustness and searchability. This study presents a unique optimization technique called fuzzy bluefin trevally optimizer (BTO). BTO draws its inspiration from bluefin’s cooperative nature and sudden ambush behavior. The trevally will jump out of the water and attack its food in the air or even snag it off the water when it is sufficiently close to it. This study uses mathematical modeling to create an optimization algorithm to replicate dynamic patterns and behaviors. Since parameters play a critical role in optimization, we use the fuzzy concept for dynamic parameter adaptation in fuzzy BTO. By introducing the idea of signature and demonstrating that fuzzy BTO converges to the global optimal point, the mathematical basis for the proposed algorithm is provided. The convergence of fuzzy BTO is proved using the Markov chain property. On benchmark functions (BF), the effectiveness of the suggested strategies is evaluated and compared with other metaheuristic algorithms. Then the proposed algorithms are applied to a fuzzy FS problem. Then they are compared with traditional and recent metaheuristic algorithms on the UCI machine learning repository datasets. Finally, the statistical significance is examined using the Kruskal–Wallis test (KWT).},

The study designs a new high-speed road driving scheme based on autonomous driving by analyzing the challenges related to urban traffic that may be brought about by unmanned driving. On the basis of the faster R-CNN algorithm, the context information around the target is introduced to locate and detect small-scale traffic signs. A new pedestrian detection model is designed, which is based on the feature pyramid network and introduces the SE module to highlight the features of the visible part of the pedestrian and reduce the missed detection rate caused by inter-class occlusion. The improved traffic sign detection framework improves the detection accuracy by 18.91% compared to the original faster R-CNN, while the enhanced pedestrian inspection method improves the detection accuracy by 14.00%.

Artificial intelligence technology can improve the scientificity of leadership decision-making, and blockchain technology can guarantee the democracy of leadership decision-making. Society pushes everyone to be gregarious. Group recommendation is thus one of the research focuses in recent years. Prior group recommendation algorithms fail to consider either the influence of group structure on computing scale or the impressions users of higher weights leave on other group members. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a group recommendation model based on members’ influence and leader impact. In this paper, a model has been proposed to compute members’ influence on each other based on interactions and presence. The decisions of leaders identified by the proposed model are the basis for further group recommendation, which yields satisfactory recommendations for most group members as leaders’ judgments are more professional. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate better accuracy of the proposed method compared to those of the mainstream group recommendation algorithms.},

Specifically, the conversion parameter can be configured adaptively by using the individual fitness information in the evolution process to guide the individual search behavior. After that, an inertia weight is embedded in the position updating equation to further improve the search accuracy and accelerate the convergence speed. The performance of MSCA algorithm is investigated on 13 benchmark functions and the chaotic time series prediction problem.

Any metaheuristic algorithm will have exploration and exploitation steps, and the goal of modification is to maintain a balance between them. The improvement relies on movement equations, alterations to the algorithm’s structure by introducing a single loop, and a selection of movement equations at random. Two movement equations are included in the improved method and are randomly selected. This guarantees both regionally and globally focused solution-finding. This prevents the algorithm from getting stuck at a local minimum. Comparing the modified version to the original Firefly method, just one for loop is used, reducing the algorithm’s complexity. The algorithm’s performance is evaluated with 35 traditional benchmark test functions and 10 CEC2019 test functions. According to the findings, the suggested method performed optimally in 24 traditional benchmark test functions and best in the six remaining benchmark test functions. The improved algorithm produced the best outcomes in seven of the 10 CEC2019 test functions. In contrast, the Firefly algorithm produced optimal results in 18 classical benchmark test functions and the best results in 6 CEC2019 test functions.

On the other hand, with prior information, passengers can plan their trip routes accordingly.

Each head information passed through the layers of three-dimensional convolution (Conv3D), two-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D), and two-dimensional convolution (Conv2D). Then the dense layer merges both head outputs. These layers capacitate the model to capture the characteristics of multiple inputs. The proposed model is validated by the ground truth data collected by the video cameras installed on the roadways in Delhi, India. Experimental results confirm that the prediction accuracy of the BiSPNet model surpasses that of several state-of-the-art benchmark models. In particular, the BiSPNet reduces mean absolute error by 53.23%, 40.95%, and 0.38%, respectively, in congestion score prediction for 5, 10, and 15-min time horizons compared to the mixed deep learning network (MDLNet).

  abstract     = {Person pose transfer has shown great application prospects and potential in recent years. However, this research mainly focuses on posture transfer and does not pay much attention to other human body attributes. In addition, there are problems such as blurred facial expressions and inconsistent facial texture. In order to solve these problems and improve user experience, this paper proposes a multi-feature transfer person image generation model, which combines facial expression transfer and pose transfer and completes the lighting reconstruction of person images. Our model can simultaneously migrate and supplement facial expressions while migrating a person’s posture, ensuring the consistency of characters’ overall migration. Our model can freely switch personal body lighting to adapt to different scenes, greatly improving the user experience. The experimental results show that our method’s preservation rate for face identity is improved by nearly 35% compared with the benchmark, and the similarity index for the overall person body is improved by nearly 14%. The evaluation results indicate that our method performs well in person posture transfer. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the existing algorithms in person posture transformation.},

Due to the complexity and special characteristics of remote sensing images, multi-scale object detection and accurate object localization are important challenges in remote sensing image semantic segmentation. Therefore, this paper proposes a context aggregation network (CANet). The design of CANet is influenced by advanced technologies such as attention mechanisms and feature fusion and enhancement. This network first introduces nested dilated residual module (NDRM), which can fully utilize the features extracted by the backbone network. Then, improved integrated successive dilation module (IISD) is proposed to effectively aggregate a series of contextual information scales. Next, Swim Transformer module is embedded to provide global contextual information. Finally, multi-resolution fusion module (MRFM) is proposed, allowing the comprehensive fusion of feature layers from different stages of the encoder, preserving more semantic and detailed information. The experimental results show that CANet outperforms other advanced models on the Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets.},

Lesion segmentation in MRI images to determine the number and size of lesions is one of the diagnostic problems for specialists. Using automated diagnostic tools as an aid can help professionals. Traditional image processing and deep learning methods are used to automate lesion segmentation. The U-Net is one of the most widely used deep learning architectures for MS lesion segmentation. The images are used in the Fourier domain in the U-Net network, which does not include all its features. Our proposed method combines the HAR wavelet transform and the Dense net-based U-Net. This makes local features and lesions of different sizes more prominent and leads to higher quality segmentation.

As image denoising tasks require more local and global information about the image, a novel image denoising model named structural Re-parameterization Uniformer Transformer-UNet (Rep-UUNet) is proposed in this paper. The model is structural and re-parameterized the structure of the Uniformer Transformer network and uses the UNet skip connections to reconstruct the output image. To complete image downstream tasks, the RepVGG model which utilizes the image local information is used.

  abstract     = {Realistic co-speech gestures are important to anthropomorphize ECAs, as nonverbal behavior improves expressiveness of their speech greatly. However, the existing approaches to generating co-speech gestures with sufficient details (including fingers, etc.) in 3D scenarios are indeed rare. Additionally, they hardly address the problem of abnormal gestures, temporal–spatial coherence and diversity of gesture sequences comprehensively. To handle abnormal gesture issues, we put forward an angle conversion method to remove body part length from the original in-the-wild video dataset via transferring coordinates of human upper body key points into relative deflection angles and pitch angles. We also propose a neural network called HARP with encoder–decoder architecture to transfer MFCC featured speech audio into aforementioned angles on the basis of CNN and LSTM. The angles then can be rendered as corresponding co-speech gestures. Compared with the other latest approaches, the co-speech gestures generated by HARP are proved to be almost as good as the real person, i.e., they have strong temporal–spatial coherence, diversity, persuasiveness and credibility. Our approach puts finer control on co-speech gestures than most of the existing works by handling all key points of the human upper body. It is more feasible for industrial application, since HARP can be adaptive to any human upper body model. All related code and evidence videos of HARP can be accessed at https://github.com/drrobincroft/HARP .},

Traditional fraud detection methods, however, often fall short as they primarily focus on analyzing data from the current period, thereby neglecting valuable historical information. In our study, we introduce a novel approach inspired by the financial concept of “credit” to detect fraudulent activities in various domains, such as healthcare insurance, credit card, and online retail transactions. Our approach aims to build a credit evaluation model (CEM) that can distinguish between fraudulent and normal activities by analyzing their historical records. We acknowledge that numerous fraud detection methods have been proposed, but they often struggle to detect edge cases, which limits their practical effectiveness. To address this challenge, our proposed CEM employs a time interval-aware long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to assist fraud detection. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that transforms traditional binary classification into a multi-classification problem, which improves the model’s ability to handle diverse fraudulent activities. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and model, comparing them against baseline algorithms and recently proposed methods. The results indicate that our approach outperforms the others, demonstrating its potential for practical use in detecting fraudulent activities across various domains.},

The method focuses on prediction accuracy and aims to extract the minimum number of essential features from the dataset corresponding to the required sensors. These selected features are then scatter-reduced and homogenized into subsets. Each subset is used to train a cluster-specific deep neural network designed exclusively for that subset. The final prediction is obtained by computing the fuzzy-weighted sum of these cluster-specific network outputs. Numerical results show that the proposed prediction method outperforms conventional methods in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error criteria, despite using fewer sensors. This improvement can be attributed to the reduced dataset scatter, which improves the learning speed and model performance.

  abstract     = {Speckle noise (SN) is one of the major types of noise that frequently occurs in different coherent imaging systems such as medical imaging, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and active Radar images. SAR is a powerful imaging technology that generates fine-resolution images and monitors the earth’s surface in order to identify its physical properties. The satellite images captured by SAR are mainly affected by SN, which reduces the quality of images and complicates the image representation. Therefore, removing SN from SAR images is one of the major challenges and needs significant attention. The proposed study introduces an optimal Machine Learning (ML) classifier named Kernel Support Vector Machine-Improved Aquila Optimization (KSVM-IAO) for reducing SN in SAR images. This study uses a two-step process called filtering and enhanced despeckling to minimize the consequence of speckle suppression. In the first step, different imaging filters, namely Improved Lee Filter (ILF), Improved Frost Filter (IFF), Improved Kuan Filter (IKF) and Improved Boxcar Filter (IBF), are utilized to remove the SN in SAR images. Next, the denoised image is fed to the second stage, which makes use of an optimized KSVM-IAO classifier to obtain an enhanced despeckle image. The hyperparameters of KSVM are tuned using the IAO algorithm, which reduces overfitting issues and increases accuracy. MATLAB is the simulation tool used for the analysis of SAR images. The simulation outcomes reveal that the proposed KSVM-IAO method obtained excellent SN removal while preserving the edges and fine details with low computational complexity.},

To address this challenging task and to contribute towards health safety, this paper introduces MedNetV2 system, which is an efficient deep learning-based facial mask detector with a low computational cost. In comparison with existing systems, the main specificities of the proposed system are: (1) the adoption of an effective deep learning-based framework to deal with both the large scale diversity and position variations of masked faces involved in natural scenes, (2) the interaction between face localization and facial mask detection modules to achieve the overall system goal, (3) the lightweight design and the real-time response well suited for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public dataset and real-world video streaming are carried out to validate quantitatively and visually the effectiveness of the proposed system. Promising results, in terms of detection accuracy as well as time response, are achieved when compared it with other state-of-the-art systems.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and it presents itself as being the leading cause of death among women. If its diagnosis occur soon enough, the probability to achieve the cure of the patient can be increased. Recently, it has been more common the use of deep neural network techniques to aid pathologists in their prognosis, but they still do not fully trust them because they lack interpretability. In light of that, this work investigates if previous training of the models as encoders could enhance their accuracy in both classification and interpretability. There were implemented three models to the BreakHis and BreCaHAD dataset: NASNet Mobile, DenseNET201, and MobileNetV2. The experiments have shown that the three models increased the classification performance and two models improved their interpretability using the proposed strategy. DenseNet201 encoder has performed almost 23% better than its vanilla version in classifying a tumor and the NASNet Mobile encoder has improved 28.5% in its tumor interpretation.},

  abstract     = {In view of the problems of high production cost, scarcity and lack of diversity of 3D face datasets, this paper designs an end-to-end self-supervised learning 3D face reconstruction algorithm with a single 2D face image as input, which only uses 2D face datasets to complete model training. First, the improved ResNet module is introduced to preprocess the input face image. The deep residual neural network has strong feature extraction and characterization ability for the image, which can provide rich high-level semantic feature maps for the subsequent subnetwork. Then, add transformer module completely based on self-attention mechanism to the parameter prediction subnetwork, which can make different parameters of the subnetwork focus on self-related feature map information and avoid interference from invalid feature map information, so as to further improve the parameter prediction accuracy of the subnetwork. Next, training, ablation and comparison experiments were conducted on CelebA, BFM and Photoface datasets, and the combined function of pixel loss function and perceptual loss function was selected as the loss function. The experimental results show that: compared with the historical optimal results of the same network structure, the scale-invariant depth error (SIDE) and mean angle deviation (MAD) are improved by 5.9% and 10.8%, respectively, which strongly proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, in order to verify the actual effect of the 3D face reconstruction algorithm, examples are selected in this paper for reconstruction. The 3D faces generated by the algorithm all have a good sense of reality, which intuitively and effectively proves the advancement of the algorithm.},

This disease includes a combination of disorders in maintaining attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviors. Diagnosis of ADHD is primarily clinical and based on history and examination. This study aims to provide a method for a more accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG signals recorded from 37 ADHD and 42 healthy adults were used as a control group in the age range of 20–68 years. We designed a convolutional neural network with three convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers, and one fully connected layer and trained it using spectrogram images obtained from EEG signals. The Cz channel was used for the diagnosis ADHD in four different states. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision were calculated. The results showed that using only one Cz channel has a good performance in diagnosing of ADHD. The highest accuracy of classification was related to the classification of two groups in the state when their eyes-open and eyes-closed spectrogram images were subtracted from each other. The results showed that proposed method based on deep learning can be a suitable method for diagnosing ADHD.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning technology, object detection algorithms have made significant breakthroughs in the field of computer vision. However, due to the complexity and computational requirements of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), these models face many challenges in practical applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, researchers have proposed many lightweight methods that aim to reduce the model size and computational complexity while maintaining high performance. The popularity of mobile devices and embedded systems has led to an increasing demand for lightweight models. However, existing lightweight methods often lead to accuracy loss, limiting their feasibility in practical applications. Therefore, how to realize the light weight of the model while maintaining high accuracy has become an urgent problem to be solved. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight YOLOv7 method based on PConv, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism and Wise-IoU (WIoU), which we refer to as YOLOv7-PSW. PConv can effectively reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. The SE can help the model focus on important feature information, thereby improving performance. WIoU is introduced to measure the similarity between the detection box and the Ground Truth, so that the model can effectively reduce the False Positive rate. By applying these advanced techniques to the YOLOv7, we achieve a lightweight model while maintaining a high detection accuracy. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC dataset show that YOLOv7-PSW performs better than the original YOLOv7 on object detection tasks. The number of parameters is reduced by 12.3%, FLOPs is reduced by 18.86%, and the accuracy is improved by about 0.5%. While the detection accuracy is not decreased or even slightly improved, the number of FLOPs and parameters is greatly reduced, which realizes lightweight to a certain extent. The proposed method can provide new ideas and directions for the subsequent research on lightweight object detection, and is expected to promote its application on edge devices. Meanwhile, YOLOv7-PSW can also be applied to other computer vision tasks to improve its performance and efficiency. In summary, the proposed YOLOv7-PSW lightweight method realizes the light weight of the model while maintaining high accuracy. This is of great significance for promoting the application of object detection algorithms on edge devices.},

  abstract     = {Software development effort estimation is regarded as a crucial activity for managing project cost, time, and quality, as well as for the software development life cycle. As a result, proper estimating is crucial to the success of projects and to lower risks. Software effort estimation has drawn much research interest recently and has become a problem for the software industry. When results are inaccurate, an effort may be over- or under-estimated, which can disastrously affect project resources. In the sector, machine learning methods are becoming more and more prominent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Modified Jaya algorithm to improve the effectiveness of the estimated model; Modified JOA selects the ideal subset of components from an extensive feature collection. Then, the ensemble machine learning-based Enhanced Extreme gradient boosting algorithm and Ensemble Learning machine approach are employed to estimate the software effort. On the PROMISE SDEE repository, the proposed methodologies are empirically assessed. In this approach, applying machine learning techniques to the effort estimation process increases the likelihood that the time and cost estimates will be accurate. The proposed approach yields a greater performance. The key benefit of this approach is that it lowers the computational cost. This approach can also inspire the development of a tool that could reliably, effectively, and accurately estimate the effort required to complete different software projects.},

  abstract     = {Orchid is a type of plant that grows on land. It is highly valued for its beauty and is cherished by many because of its graceful flower shape, delicate fragrance, vibrant colors, and noble symbolism. Although there are various types of orchids, some of them look similar in appearance and color, making it challenging for people to distinguish them quickly and accurately. The existing methods for classifying orchid species face issues with accuracy due to the similarities between different species and the differences within the same species. This affects their practical use. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient method for classifying orchid species using transfer learning. The main achievement of this study is the successful utilization of transfer learning to achieve accurate orchid species classification. This approach reduces the need for large datasets, minimizes overfitting, cuts down on training time and costs, and enhances classification accuracy. Specifically, the proposed approach involves four phases. First, we gathered a collection of 12 orchid image sets, totaling 12,227 images, through a combination of network sources and field photography. Next, we analyzed the distinctive features present in the collected orchid image sets. We identified certain connections between the acquired orchid datasets and other datasets. Finally, we employed transfer learning technology to create an efficient classification function for orchid species based on these relationships. As a result, our proposed method effectively addresses the challenges highlighted. Experimental results demonstrate that our classification algorithm, which utilizes transfer learning, achieves a classification accuracy rate of 96.16% compared to not using the transfer learning method. This substantial improvement in accuracy greatly enhances the efficiency of orchid classification.},

In view of the above problems, this study proposed a data enhancement method based on generative adversarial network to expand the original soybean leaf disease dataset. This method was based on cyclic confrontation network, and its discriminator uses dense connection strategy to realize feature reuse, so as to reduce the amount of calculation. In the training process, improved transfer learning is used to automatically fine tune the pre-training model. The accuracy of the optimized method in 9 kinds of soybean leaf disease image recognition is 95.84%, which is 0.98% higher than the traditional fine-tuning method. The experimental results show that this method based on generating confrontation network has significant ability in generating soybean leaf disease image, and can expand the existing dataset. In addition, this method also provides an effective data enhancement solution for the expansion of other crop disease image datasets.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of internet technology, various industries have accumulated vast amounts of data, including on user behavior and personal preferences. Traditional museums can leverage this user data to uncover individual preferences and offer personalized services to their visitors. However, the exponential growth of information has also led to the problem of information overload, making it challenging for users to find relevant information within the vast data landscape. Consequently, the utilization rate of available information decreases. By harnessing the power of cloud computing, big data analytics, and recommendation systems, museums can enhance visitors’ touring experiences by helping them discover collections aligned with their interests and connecting with like-minded individuals. To address this objective, the research focuses on optimizing the initial clustering centers of the fuzzy clustering algorithm and parallelizing the optimized algorithm using MapReduce, resulting in the development of a novel MapReduce-based k-prototype fuzzy c-means (MRKPFCM) algorithm. Subsequently, the MRKPFCM algorithm is combined with the classical collaborative filtering algorithm to create a hybrid and parallelized collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, incorporating elements such as MRKPFCM, audience, and collection. This hybrid algorithm is further supplemented by a content-based recommendation approach to generate comprehensive and refined recommendation results. Experimental findings demonstrate that the predictive scoring errors, as measured by RMSE and MAE, exhibited a downward trend when the number of nearest neighbors for target users fell within the range of 10–20. For instance, the studied algorithm’s MAE value decreased from 0.7512 to 0.7179, surpassing the corresponding figures for the two comparison algorithms. Moreover, with an increase in the number of nearest neighbors within the same range, all three algorithms experienced improved accuracy in prediction results. In particular, the accuracy rate rose from 17.84% to 18.82%, outperforming the two comparison algorithms. In summary, the enhanced hybrid recommendation algorithm achieved through this study displays superior recommendation accuracy and holds significant practical value.},

  abstract     = {Effectively reducing the dimensionality of big data and retaining its key information has been a research challenge. As an important step in data pre-processing, feature selection plays a critical role in reducing data size and increasing the overall value of the data. Many previous studies have focused on single-label feature selection, however, with the increasing variety of data types, the need for feature selection on multi-label data types has also arisen. Unlike single-labeled data, multi-labeled data with more combinations of classifications place higher demands on the capabilities of feature selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose a filter-based Multi-Objective Equilibrium Optimizer algorithm (MOEO-Smp) to solve the feature selection problem for both single-label and multi-label data. MOEO-Smp rates the optimization results of solutions and features based on four pairs of optimization principles, and builds three equilibrium pools to guide exploration and exploitation based on the total scores of solutions and features and the ranking of objective fitness values, respectively. Seven UCI single-label datasets and two Mulan multi-label datasets and one COVID-19 multi-label dataset are used to test the feature selection capability of MOEO-Smp, and the feature selection results are compared with 10 other state-of-the-art algorithms and evaluated using three and seven different metrics, respectively. Feature selection experiments and comparisons with the results in other literatures show that MOEO-Smp not only has the highest classification accuracy and excellent dimensionality reduction on single-labeled data, but also performs better on multi-label data in terms of Hamming loss, accuracy, dimensionality reduction, and so on.},
