  abstract     = {In August 2015, the State Council of the People’s Republic of China listed China’s capital market for property-rights exchange as the capital market along with the Chinese stock market. Consequently, China’s capital market for property-rights exchange is an integral part of the country’s multilayered capital market. The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant effects on the capital markets. Since China’s capital market for property-rights exchange mainly serves nonlisted companies, it is complicated to obtain its exchange data to perform COVID-19’s effect analysis. This study investigates COVID-19’s effect on China’s capital market for property-rights exchange. In this paper, we collected the online property rights-exchange data from 2017 to 2020 of an electric trading platform. The functional principal component analysis method is innovatively introduced to explore the online property rights-exchange fluctuation to get an insight into COVID-19’s effect on China’s capital market for property-rights exchange. Based on the principal component scores, COVID-19’s effect on different property rights-exchange institutions are divided into two categories using principal component clustering. A time-series model is used to quantify the effects in the two categories. The research results finally show that online property rights-exchange can reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on China’s capital market for property-rights exchange, which encourages property rights-exchange institutions to accelerate the use of the online platform to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the transportation industry benefits from the consumption of energy, but the excessive dependence on petroleum fuels makes it a major source of air pollution. In order to achieve green and high-quality development of the transportation industry, many countries are committed to scientifically evaluating the utilization efficiency of clean energy, which has attracted wide attention from the whole society. Significantly, without considering the diversity and complexity of pollutants, indicators used in previous studies were unable to cover all pollutants when establishing the evaluation index system. Meanwhile, as an efficient tool, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is extensively used when it comes to efficiency evaluation. However, the absolute preference of existing benevolent and aggressive cross-efficiency models limits its application scenarios. To address the challenges above, an improved flexible cross-efficiency DEA model is proposed considering both same and different benevolence coefficients of decision-making units (DMUs) on the basis of pointing out the inadequacy of the previous model. The concepts of consensus coefficient and group preference are introduced in the aggregation of cross-efficiency. Besides, based on the theory of undesirable output, the consumption of nonclean energy is taken into account as the input indicator to characterize the degree of pollution. The results show that the obtained cross-efficiency value and efficiency ranking of clean transportation energy change sensitively under various benevolent coefficients. There is an important practical significance to consider the independent preference information of DMUs for the evaluation and ranking of cross-efficiency.},

However, there has been insufficient research attention towards optimizing the last-mile vehicle routing from three sustainable dimensions simultaneously based on triple-bottom-line. To narrow this gap, this paper proposes a multi-objective last-mile vehicle routing model for fresh food e-commerce, which takes the three sustainable dimensions as independent objectives. The economic and environment objectives are minimizing the total cost and carbon emission, respectively. For social dimension, a nonlinear function is proposed based on the Prospect theory, which quantifies customers’ satisfaction when they perceive delivery time. Then the social objective is described as maximizing customers’ satisfaction. Subsequently, the model is solved by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and validated by a numerical experiment. Based on the experiment results, this paper recommends that logistics enterprises should prioritize the trade-off among the three sustainable dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The transit-oriented development (TOD) and arts and culture-led urban development (AUD) have been evolved as two of primary strategies for sustainable urban revitalization. Ex-ante sustainability evaluation has emerged as a crucial procedure in the field of urban renewal to prevent non-sustainable redevelopment projects. However, in the ex-ante evaluation of urban renewal projects, TOD and AUD have ambiguous indicators, imprecise weights, and undetermined evaluation methodologies. To fill these gaps, this work combines GIS, fuzzy theory, and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to build an ex-ante evaluation model for evaluating the sustainability potential of urban renewal projects. Three areas in Guangzhou that are undergoing reconstruction and development are used as empirical instances in this study. This study provides a hierarchical structure of the evaluation framework which contains three dimensions, five criteria, and twenty-seven indicators, and also obtains the influential relationships among five criteria. In the empirical scenario, the Guangzhou Steel New Town area (GSNT) is reflected in the large potential benefits in both directions (i.e., TOD and AUD). In contrast, the existing urban renewal development plan does not adequately utilize the potential of the Shiqiao (SQ) area. This study, therefore, proposes that to increase land-use efficiency and subsequently economic development, the SQ area should either start from the current conditions or adapt its current strategy to renewal. With the help of this study, local decision-makers may examine the viability of urban renewal initiatives and gauge the possibility for three crucial Guangzhou urban renewal areas to flourish sustainably. This study also offers a decision-base for prospective future improvement in response to the evaluation outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The exponentially increasing amount of data generated by the public on social media platforms is a precious source of information. It can be used to find the topics and analyze the comments. Some researchers have extended the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method by adding a sentiment layer to simultaneously find the topics and their related sentiments. However, most of these approaches do not achieve admirable accuracy in Topic Sentiment Analysis (TSA), particularly when there is insufficient training data or the texts are complex, ambiguous, and short. In this paper, a self-supervised novel approach called SSTSA is proposed for TSA that extracts the hidden topics and analyzes the total sentiment related to each topic. The SSTSA proposes a new method called Pseudo-label Generator. For this purpose, first, it employs semantic similarity and Word Mover’s Distance (WMD) measures. Then, the document embedding technique is employed to semantically estimate the sentiment orientation of samples and generate the pseudo-labels (positive or negative). Afterward, a hybrid classifier composed of a pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT (RoBERTa) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is trained to predict the sentiment of unseen data. The evaluation results on different datasets of various domains demonstrate that the SSTSA outperforms similar unsupervised/self-supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in Internet technology have shifted the focus of end-users from the usage of traditional mobile applications to the Internet of Things (IoT)-based service-oriented smart applications (SAs). These SAs use edge devices to obtain different types of Fog services and provide their real-time response to the end-users. The Fog computing environment extends its services to the edge network layer and hosts SAs that require low latency. Further, a growing number of latency-aware SAs imposes the issue of effective allocation of resources in the Fog environment. In this paper, we have proposed an effective multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based solution for resource ranking and resource allocation in the Fog environment. The Proposed algorithms implement the modified edition of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and consider Quality of Experience parameters (QoE), i.e., network bandwidth, average latency, and cores for ranking and mapping of resources. The obtained results reveal that the proposed approach utilizes 70% resources, and reduces the response time by an average of 7.5 s as compared to the Cloud model and the Fog model, respectively. Similarly, the completion time of the proposed framework is minimum in comparison with the cloud and Fog models with a difference of 9 s and 16 s.},

These semantic embeddings can be used for various applications in banking. Direct relations between companies and words allow semantic business analytics (e.g., top- n words for a company). Furthermore, industry prediction is presented as a supervised learning application and evaluation method. The vectorized structure of the embeddings allows measuring companies’ similarities with the cosine distance. Company2Vec hence offers a more fine-grained comparison of companies than the standard industry labels ( NACE ). This property is relevant for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering. An alternative industry segmentation is shown with k-means clustering on the company embeddings.

  abstract     = {Predicting software defects is an important task during software testing phase, especially for allocating appropriate resources and prioritizing testing tasks. Typically, classification algorithms are used to accomplish this task by using previously collected datasets. However, these datasets suffer from imbalanced label distribution where clean modules outnumber defective modules. Traditional classification algorithms cannot handle this nature in defect datasets because they assume the datasets are balanced. Failing to address this problem, the classification algorithm will produce a prediction biased towards the majority label. In the literature, there are several techniques designed to address this problem and most of them focus on data re-balancing. Recently, ensemble class imbalance techniques have emerged as an opposing approach to data rebalancing approaches. Regarding the software defect prediction, there are no studies examining the performance of ensemble class imbalance learning against data re-balancing approaches. This paper investigates the efficiency of ensemble class imbalance learning for software defect prediction. We conducted a comprehensive experiment that involved 12 datasets, six classifiers, nine class imbalance techniques, and 10 evaluation metrics. The experiments showed that ensemble approaches, particularly the Under Bagging technique, outperform traditional data re-balancing approaches, particularly when dealing with datasets that have high defect ratios.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is known to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There is a chance of increasing the survival rate of the patients if detected at an early stage. Computed Tomography (CT) scans are prominently used to detect and classify lung cancer nodules/tumors in the thoracic region. There is a need to develop an efficient and reliable computer-aided diagnosis model to detect lung cancer nodules accurately from CT scans. This work proposes a novel kernel-based active-contour (KAC) SegNet deep learning model to perform lung cancer nodule detection from CT scans. The active contour uses a snake method to detect internal and external boundaries of the curves, which is used to extract the Region Of Interest (ROI) from the CT scan. From the extracted ROI, the nodules are further classified into benign and malignant using a Dense AlexNet deep learning model. The key contributions of this work are the fusion of an edge detection method with a deep learning segmentation method which provides enhanced lung nodule segmentation performance, and an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers, which encashes the advantages of both DenseNet and AlexNet to learn better discriminative information from the detected lung nodules. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed segmentation approach achieves a Dice Score Coefficient of 97.8% and an Intersection-over-Union of 92.96%. The classification performance resulted in an accuracy of 95.65%, a False Positive Rate, and False Negative Rate values of 0.0572 and 0.0289. The proposed model is robust compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed technique applies to the case of missing values in any position within a matrix of any order, provided that all the alternatives are connected, or equivalently that there is a preference path between each pair of alternatives. The unknown entries are estimated by finding a matrix that best matches the given entries, assuming that the reconstructed matrix can be well approximated by a lower-rank matrix and that the entries are missing completely at random. A series of applications with simulated data were used to evaluate the validity of the proposed technique, particularly in comparison to another popular technique of missing value estimation based on the minimization of an index measuring matrix inconsistency. The simulation results suggest the effectiveness of nuclear norm minimization as a completion technique in some of the considered setting, in particular if violations of strong transitivity property are considered.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing order-picking systems (OPSs) while considering human factors and integrating key decisions is a major challenge for warehouse managers. This study presents a two-stage framework based on multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) and multi-objective decision-making (MODM) models to integrate decisions on picker selection, order batching, batch assignment, picker routing, and scheduling. In the first stage, the human factors affecting picker selection are considered as the problem’s criteria and the available pickers are treated as alternatives. The fuzzy entropy method and fuzzy COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) are used to weight the factors and rank the pickers, respectively. In the second stage, a three-objective mathematical model is formulated to minimize makespan and the operating costs of picking while maximizing the total scores of the selected pickers. The improved augmented epsilon constraint method (AUGMECON2) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are applied to solve the proposed model. The performance of the two methods is tested on well-known benchmark instances and a real-world case study. The NSGA-II algorithm can generate optimal results using only about 6.58% of the CPU time required by AUGMECON2 to solve the problem. Our computational experiments show that increasing the number of pickers from 2 to 8 and doubling their capacity reduces the makespan by 2.61% and 2.74%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Since 2019, COVID disease threats the world. It originated in China, and due to its easy spread characteristics, it spreads quickly among all the countries. As the world faced a new kind of virus, the government could not control its spread, and the fatality rate had also hugely increased. In 2021, the vaccine for the virus was introduced by various countries, which aids in controlling the spread and mortality rate. The mutant form of this virus exhibits high efficiency. So, this study analyzes the effective of COVID vaccines released after 2020 against all COVID variants through the fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (SIR) decision-making method. The vaccines and variants are analyzed by the m × n matrix pattern under the fuzzy SIR-integrated weight method. The disease variants are taken as criteria and that are assigned integrated weight based on subjective, objective weight approaches. The intuitionistic fuzzy set-double parameter (IFS-DP) handles the vagueness by strictly including only membership and non-membership functions with the condition 0 ≤ μ ∗ ( x ) + ν ∗ ( x ) ≤ 1 . As a result, the vaccines Moderna and Covishield are attained top rank and have a high likelihood to combat all the COVID variants compared to other vaccines. The reached outcomes are corroborated through sensitivity and comparative analysis. The sensitivity and comparative studies are measured by increasing the order of IFS-DP and extant fuzzy MCDM methods, respectively. The comparison of these results with those obtained from the proposed method is similar to the sensitivity study, along with minor variations observed in the comparative study. Therefore, the proposed method generates an efficient outcome. Moreover, the testing hypothesis technique is applied to check the efficiency of proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Design/methodology/approach : Converting data into information and its diffusion along all organization units has become a vital survival skill. At this point, an ERP system provides an invisible network among a company’s internal and external stakeholders and plays a strategic role. Moreover, ERP systems offer some advantages. For example, integrating financial, customer, and order information, speeding up production processes, and reducing stock level and order lead time. Therefore, we propose an integrated spherical fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and spherical fuzzy-combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) framework to prioritize the best ERP software provider for the defense industry. Purpose : Despite having the advantages mentioned above, some crucial aspects must be considered while selecting an ERP package. Factors such as high cost, difficulty in installation, and security threats can be very challenging. The latter issue needs special care in the defense industry. This study aims to design an evaluation framework for the ERP selection problem in the sector. Findings : One of the pivoting defense companies in Turkey is chosen as a case study. Seven ERP systems are evaluated with the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can be successfully implemented in a defense company context. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis proves the robustness of the approach to varying threshold parameters in CODAS and different fuzzy weighting approaches. Originality/value : The defense professionals prioritize a different set of selection criteria than conventional manufacturing firms. The study provides a rare holistic framework for the defense industry using a hybridized SF-AHP-CODAS technique. Thus, the study may serve as reference work for the researchers and decision-makers during the digitalization journey of defense firms.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, video event detection gained high attention in the researcher’s community, because of its widespread applications. In this paper, a new model is proposed for detecting different human actions in the video sequences. First, the videos are acquired from the University of Central Florida (UCF) 101, Human Motion Database (HMDB) 51 and Columbia Consumer Video (CCV) datasets. In addition, the DenseNet201 model is implemented for extracting deep feature values from the acquired datasets. Further, the Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm is developed for selecting active/relevant feature values that effectively improve the computational time and system complexity. In the IGWO, leader enhancement and competitive strategies are employed to improve the convergence rate and to prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optima. Finally, the Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network is used for event classification (101 action types in UCF101, 51 action types in HMDB51, and 20 action types in CCV). In the resulting phase, the IGWO-based BiLSTM network achieved 94.73%, 96.53%, and 93.91% accuracy on the UCF101, HMDB51, and CCV datasets.},

The new projection method DProj is specifically adapted for Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), which allows to determine the relationship between cause and effect factors of the system, while we show that some projection methods from the literature are not suitable for DEMATEL. To validate DProj-DEMATEL, we performed two analyses based on Manhattan and Euclidean distances on three examples from the literature.

More realistic data representations are needed to portray ambiguity under increasingly complex decision-making contexts. Firstly, this study proposes a new approach for ranking independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on the risk attitudes of decision-makers. The proposed ranking approach incorporates the decision-makers’ risk preferences and considers all possible values in the feasible domain. After that, a novel similarity measure between two independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is presented based on the three-segment projection. The constructed similarity measure uses the image structure of the data to reflect the variation of vagueness and then also combines deviation to achieve optimization. Moreover, this study improves the VIKOR method under the independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment (V-ITIFE) to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the V-ITIFE method.},

The results of a systematic review of the last decade of social commerce acceptance studies and the use of fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy DEMATEL methods led to the development of the model. The obtained model was investigated by the partial least squares method in the statistical community of banking customers. Then, by analyzing intermediate variables, the final results were obtained. Based on the obtained model, three types of effects were investigated: direct effects with the presence of the mediating factor or factors, direct effects by removing the mediating factor or factors, and indirect effect by considering the mediating factor or factors. The results show that except for privacy considerations, other factors including trust, attitude, social support, social commerce constructs, word of mouth, social influence, customer social responsibility and perceived usefulness have a direct and indirect effect on social banking intention. The privacy consideration factor has only indirect effect on social banking intention through the full mediation of the trust factor. Except for the effect of factors on the intention of social banking, based on the model obtained from meta-combination, the effect of factors on each other was also investigated and some were confirmed. This research introduces a socio-technical innovation by combining the application of social banking with a social commerce platform and presents a comprehensive model of the willingness to accept this innovation.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices, big data has been generated, and a cloud computing system is required to manipulate it. The main issue in this system is the access delay (AD) when the IoT and mobile devices offload their workload on the servers and the workload balance among them. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which has a sufficient distribution of edge servers (ESs) and resources, has been developed to overcome this problem. The placement of ESs in MEC is an NP-hard problem and a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that aims to reduce the AD between mobile users and ES and balance the workload among these servers. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid natural-inspired algorithm by combining the manta ray foraging algorithm and the uniform crossover operator to find the optimal edge server placement (ESP) in MEC and minimize the AD between mobile users and the ES. Although the standard manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm can balance diversification and intensification, it suffers from premature convergence. We invoke a uniform crossover operator in the standard MRFO algorithm to overcome this problem. In addition, the standard MRFO algorithm is designed to solve continuous optimization problems and is unsuitable for solving discrete problems. However, ESP is a discrete optimization problem. We modified the operators in the standard MRFO algorithm to solve the ESP problem, achieving an optimal solution in terms of minimizing the AD between BSs and ESs and balancing the workload among ESs. The proposed algorithm is then tested on the Shanghai Telecom dataset and compared with five other algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the least AD, and the workload balance reaches about 52% compared with the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities are becoming increasingly popular today due to various digital technologies in their infrastructure. One of the most critical challenges in the proper implementation and establishment of these cities is the violation of the security and privacy of users, which leads to citizens’ distrust and pessimism about smart city services. Many factors can affect the protection of users’ privacy. Identifying these factors helps developers understand what dimensions and aspects affect users’ privacy, through which they can provide appropriate solutions to protect the privacy of the user. Therefore, this study identifies and evaluates these dimensions. The authors proposed a novel methodology for identifying factors influencing user privacy in smart cities using the meta-synthesis method and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). As a result of the meta-synthesis application, the authors identified seven dimensions of interest, specifically, Awareness and understanding, Trust, Self-control and personalization, Transparency, Reference standards frameworks and rules, Data management, and Security requirements. Moreover, using the DEMATEL technique and expert-based reviews, those seven dimensions were classified as cause and effect. As a result, the authors discovered that security requirements (D7) are the only cause dimension. As effect dimensions, “awareness and understanding (D1),” “data management (D6),” “trust (D2),” “frameworks and standards (D5),” “personalization and self-control (D3),” and “transparency (D4)” have been identified. Furthermore, the authors discovered that transparency is the most effective dimension in terms of affecting user privacy in smart cities. These findings may serve as guidelines for implementing the smart cities initiatives and protecting users’ privacy. This study also provides a discussion and insights for smart city developers.},

  abstract     = {Due to the expansion of privacy protection, and data sharing gets complicated and is known to be a hot issue in the research areas. Many business scenarios in the supply chain network have been highly important in research areas. Especially, blockchain technology ensures the essential solution in the supply chain network for securing information sharing. Yet, it is difficult to maintain security at every blockchain level, whereas it is suggested to use “public–private key cryptography.” The fundamental goal of this research work is to present new privacy preservation of data using hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms with blockchain technology. The secured supply chain network is built with blockchain technology. The privacy preservation of data sharing in blockchain technology is handled by the electric fish-Harris hawks optimization (EF-HHO). This new algorithm is utilized for the key generation phase of two processes like “data sanitization and restoration.” The optimal key generation follows a multi-objective problem is solved by the variables like “Hiding Failure (HF) rate, information preservation (IP) rate, and false rule (FR) generation, and degree of modification (DM)”. The result analysis shows the offered model provides effective performance when compared with existing conventional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transfusion has shown promising results in treating COVID-19 cases despite the limited availability of these MSCs. The task of prioritizing COVID-19 patients for MSC transfusion based on multiple criteria is considered a multi-attribute decision-analysis (MADA) problem. Although literature reviews have assessed the prioritization of COVID-19 patients for MSCs, issues arising from imprecise, unclear and ambiguous information remain unresolved. Compared with the existing MADA methods, the robustness of the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) and fuzzy-weighted zero inconsistency (FWZIC) is proven. This study adopts and integrates FDOSM and FWZIC in a homogeneous Fermatean fuzzy environment for criterion weighting followed by the prioritization of the most eligible COVID-19 patients for MSC transfusion. The research methodology had two phases. The decision matrices of three COVID-19 emergency levels (moderate, severe, and critical) were adopted based on an augmented dataset of 60 patients and discussed in the first phase. The second phase was divided into two subsections. The first section developed Fermatean FWZIC (F-FWZIC) to weigh criteria across each emergency level of COVID-19 patients. These weights were fed to the second section on adopting Fermatean FDOSM (F-FDOSM) for the purpose of prioritizing COVID-19 patients who are the most eligible to receive MSCs. Three methods were used in evaluating the proposed works, and the results included systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis, and benchmarking checklist.},

  abstract     = {To address the ambiguity, uncertainty, and imprecision inherent in failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) assessments, we propose a probabilistic interval-value term set (PIVTS) to express decision-makers’ evaluations. This approach allows decision makers to express their quantitative assessments using interval-value terms with probabilities, providing a more comprehensive and expressive representation of people’s preferences than exact numbers. In a probabilistic interval-valued environment, we propose an enhanced failure mode ranking method based on elimination and choice translating reality-III (ELECTRE III). Our ranking method includes a comprehensive computing framework for PIVTS to assess the importance of risk factors. Additionally, we provide rules for addition, subtraction, and division when comparing the disparity between two PIVTSs. Based on these rules, we also introduce the concordance index, discordance index, and outranking degrees. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide an example of its application to the steel production process. The advantages of PIVTS as a judgment technique and ELECTRE III as a decision method make our approach a better alternative for addressing complex uncertainties and determining the risk ranking of failure modes.},

Later, using machine learning algorithms, prediction exercises were performed to determine the most efficient match.

We decompose the programming problem into a master problem and a subproblem using Benders decomposition. The ant colony algorithm generates an initial solution for the master problem. A feasible heuristic is used to obtain feasible solutions as input to the subproblem, whereas the subproblem is solved to optimality by using a linear programming solver that is named Linprog function in MATLAB R2016a. Over successive iterations, the master problem is refined by adding cuts from the subproblem and the master problem is solved by a linear programming solver Cplexmilp function. We compare the performance of the proposed hybrid approach against a general Benders decomposition approach as well as against a mixed-integer programming solver CPLEX (version 12.6) that is invoked by MATLAB on MIPLIB test problem mas76, mas74 and some large-scale numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a buzzword in various technology fields because of its many applications. Healthcare is one of the most important fields in daily life and holds significant interest for IoT and artificial intelligence researchers. In the area of healthcare, the mental healthcare field has attracted many researchers and funding organizations for various reasons. Among those reasons are the adverse impact of mental conditions on both individuals and society, the high costs of mental care, the nature of mental conditions and their hidden and unclear symptoms, and the stigma associated with them. In this work, an approach to building an IoT mental health monitoring and detection system has been proposed. The depression problem is used as a case study for the mental conditions. The proposed approach involves data collection, data pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and model building. Machine learning (ML) and data mining techniques, along with different data types for training and testing the models, have been utilized to accomplish the tasks of the proposed approach. Four ML algorithms have been investigated to detect and predict the diagnosis of the mental state. These algorithms are random forest, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) and k -nearest neighbors (KNN). Our ML detection model has achieved a high detection accuracy of 95% using the random forest algorithm. Comparisons in different aspects with other works are presented. Our work has the advantages of using ML, adopting different data types, and therefore achieving better classification.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, national governments and international organizations are increasingly interested in the sustainable development of the cultural and creative industries through the integration of culture, art, science, and education and their influence on local economic and cultural development and promotion. However, to the best of our knowledge, only few studies have proposed a comprehensive framework based on the multi-criteria decision-making concept for evaluating the sustainable development of such industries. The main purpose of this paper is to determine which criteria are important for sustainable development, how these criteria interact, and how the sustainability performance of the evaluated subjects can be measured. Four sustainability perspectives are incorporated into the framework, economic, social, environmental, and governmental institutional, and 17 evaluation criteria. In the methodology, the neutrosophic decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (N-DEMATEL) method is first used to identify the influential relationships between the sustainability criteria. Then, a modified technique for order priority by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to calculate the performance of the sustainable cultural and creative industries. Neutrosophic fuzzy logic is applied to reflect the ambiguity of the expert evaluations, with the three parameters of truth, falsity, and indeterminacy incorporated to obtain more potential uncertainty information for neutrosophic decision support. The validity and practicality of the proposed model are demonstrated through a real-world example for the National Museum of Natural Science located in Central Taiwan. The results show that local government involvement, policy promotion and marketing, and the promotion of concept of sustainability are the most influential criteria for sustainability in the cultural and creative industries. The research findings can be used to guide the long-term development of the cultural and creative industries for industry and government and the method can be adapted for other performance evaluation issues. Government agencies can use the model to encourage the development of the cultural and creative industries through financial support, promotion, and partnerships with other agencies using its resources and allocation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {In-memory computing is the method of running computer computations completely in memory. Memristive device (e.g., 1 selector-1 resistor (1S1R)) is preferably utilized for in-memory computing with the appearance of hybrid CMOS nano-crossbar arrays. The parallelism of resistive arrays is considered in parallel adder designs to reduce the critical path delay. However, they minimize latency at the cost of hardware resources. In addition, the resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is suffered by sneak–path problem because of the incapability for accessing a specific cell without impeding its neighbors. To tackle this issue, an analytical model of Pt/TaO x /TiO 2 /TaO x /Pt selector device is developed and it is integrated with ReRAM model for reducing the sneak path current. In this paper, a novel mapping scheme is proposed for in-memory variable stage size carry skip adder (VSS-CSKA) to harness the parallelism of 1S1R resistive memory. The VSS-CSKA considers variable block lengths and uses basic Boolean functions as skip logic to improve the speed without requiring huge area. Also, the selector device is modeled by considering the Pt/TaO x /TiO 2 /TaO x /Pt crested barrier for suppressing the sneak current in the resistive memory. The macro-model of the 1S1R resistive memory model is modeled in Verilog-A netlist and the simulations are executed on Spectre circuit simulator from Cadence Virtuoso. The proposed in-memory adder reduced the latency to 6 + 3 log 2 ( k ) for k -bit addition and it consumes less energy because of the minimization of sneak currents in 1S1R.},

  abstract     = {In stock trading, a common phenomenon is that the trends of stocks in the same industry are very similar. In contrast, the movements of stocks in different industries are often different. Therefore, applying the same model to all stock trading is inappropriate without distinguishing the industries in which the stocks belong. However, recommending an optimal industry stock trading model is very challenging based on performance evaluation indicators. First, the indicators of the trading model are diverse. Second, the ranking of multiple indicators is often inconsistent. In the paper, we model the problem to be solved as a multi-criteria decision-making process. Therefore, we first divide stock dataset into nine industries according to their main business. Then, we apply several machine learning algorithms as candidate models to generate trading signals. Second, we conduct daily trading backtesting based on the trading signals to obtain multiple performance evaluation indicators. Third, we propose an optimal recommendation algorithm for the industry stock trading model with TODIM. The experimental results in the US stock market and China’s A-share market show that the proposed algorithm can get a better trading model out-of-sample industry stock. Moreover, we effectively evaluate the generalization ability of the algorithm based on the proposed metrics. Finally, the proposed long–short portfolios based on the algorithm have achieved returns exceeding the benchmark on most out-of-sample datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method for identifying causal relationships between strategic objectives within a strategy map of a Balanced Scorecard. Strategy maps are modeled as a network of strategic objectives (nodes) and causal relationships (directed arcs). The nodes are also grouped into clusters that represent the perspectives of a Balanced Scorecard: (a) Finances, Clients, Internal Processes and Growth and Learning. The method uses the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to establish the importance of every relationship and uses a multi-objective integer linear programming model to select the relationships to be included within a strategy map of a company. The method provides a method that optimizes the selection of the relationships to be included in a strategy map. An illustration of the application of the method in a manufacturing company is presented.},

  abstract     = {Hazardous waste management (HWM) deals with processing waste materials, and improper handling of this procedure might considerably harm human health and environment. It is crucial to employ the most appropriate treatment and disposal techniques while handling with waste materials as part of hazardous waste management so that potential problems can be minimized accordingly. Therefore, the weights of the criteria playing vital roles in solid waste management were determined by using AHP&amp;MARCOS method, which is an integrated MCDM technique, and the most appropriate techniques to be employed in solid waste treatment and disposal were selected. The implementation took place in three phases; the first phase included brainstorming and literature review and the determination of the important criteria in the waste management (4 main and 12 sub-criteria) as well as the treatment (3) and disposal (7) methods to be employed; i.e, the alternatives. In addition, a decision-making group of 15 people was formed so that they could share their opinions based on their knowledge and experiences via the decision matrices while evaluating the alternatives according to the predetermined criteria. In the second phase, the decision matrices constructed based on the expert opinions were taken into consideration while determining weights/priorities of waste management criteria by employing AHP method. In the third phase, treatment and disposal methods were listed by using the decision matrices filled according to expert opinions, the weight values and the criteria. The criteria weights obtained by using AHP method revealed that “operation cost” was the criteria with the highest weight of importance while determining solid waste treatment/disposal methods. Similarly, among the obtained alternatives, the best solid waste treatment technique was found to be “physical treatment” and the best solid disposal technique “plasma arc”. The present study is different from similar studies in the literature since the selection of treatment and disposal method was performed separately for all hazardous solid wastes (healthcare waste, municipality solid waste, etc.) for the first time. Moreover, the obtained results were evaluated by undertaking comprehensive analyses (sensitivity and comparison). The findings obtained in the present study are expected to make valuable contributions to the literature.},

In this work, the DBpedia knowledge base is adopted for entity extraction and categorization. To achieve the entity extraction task precisely, a two-step process is proposed: (a) train the unstructured datasets with Word2Vec and classify the entities into their respective categories.

  abstract     = {E-learning platforms (ELPs) are revolutionizing the higher education system, as they offer tremendous potential to fulfill instructional plans, safeguard students’ learning rights, and improve teaching quality. Higher education institutions (HEIs) have to consider the selection of ELPs from an organizational perspective, which involves multiple stakeholders like university administrators, students, and educators. Therefore, one can take the ELP selection as a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This research proposes a new hybrid MCDM approach on the basis of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the evaluation based on distance from the average solution (EDAS) method to select the best ELPs. First, from the organizational perspective, we extend the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework by adding an auxiliary resource (AR) dimension and define and prioritize 4 criteria and 14 criteria for evaluating and selecting ELPs. Second, the study uses the fuzzy set theory to process the language evaluation of experts, the FAHP method to determine criteria and sub-criteria weights, and EDAS to rank the alternatives. Finally, based on the importance-performance analysis (IPA) method, we identify the most appropriate strategic options for enhancing competitiveness. Three practical cases of China’s ELP evaluation validate the proposed model’s applicability and superiority by comparing to the two other classic evaluation models. In addition, through analysis, we obtain some encouraging results that provide some references for universities to formulate ELP selection policies and offer suggestions for platform producers to further optimize the design.},

IoT is required to obtain data through sensor nodes for finding soil moisture and heat level. Even though different methods are available to monitor the health of plants, observing heat level and soil moisture still results a complex task. Thus, this paper introduces a novel chimp shuffled shepherd optimization (ChSSO) by the integration of chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) and shuffled shepherd optimization (SSOA) to perform the selection of cluster head (CH) and routing process. The proposed ChSSO is trained using the deep LSTM which is developed for predicting soil moisture and heat level conditions in IoT network to monitor the health of plants. The proposed method obtained higher performance by the metrics, like testing accuracy and precision of 0.937, and 0.926 for 100 nodes and the values of 0.940, and 0.940 for 150 nodes using the LDAS dataset.},

  abstract     = {Vietnam, a country in Southeast Asia, is anticipated to experience an increase in energy consumption due to the growth of its manufacturing and industrial sectors, which aims to establish Vietnam as the world’s new production hub. Fossil fuels, which are ecologically unfriendly and quickly running out, are now Vietnam’s primary energy source. Due to the detrimental effects of fossil fuels on the environment, we can apply strategic decision-making in the industrial sector to choose the best alternative for a renewable energy resource (RER). RERs such as solar energy, wind energy, solid waste energy, biomass energy, geothermal energy, biofuel energy, and hydropower energy are important for generating energy and will be crucial for the survival of humanity, the planet, and other living things in the future. The actions of RER-based industrial development must be encouraged since they will make a significant contribution to overcome environmental impact limitations. The 2-tuple linguistic q -rung orthopair fuzzy set (2TL q -ROFS) is a novel development in fuzzy set theory that presents a decision-making method for selecting the most appropriate alternative. In this paper, we develop a family of the 2TL q -ROF Maclaurin symmetric mean aggregation operators such as the 2TL q -ROF Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TL q -ROFMSM) operator, the 2TL q -ROF dual Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TL q -ROFDMSM) operator and its weighted forms. We also look into a few of the proposed operators’ properties and special cases. Then based on 2TL q -ROFS, a new Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model is constructed, which can use the decision makers’ preferences to get the optimum objective weights for attributes. Next, we extend the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to 2TL q -ROF version which not only covers the uncertainty of human cognition but also gives decision makers a larger space to represent their decisions. Utilizing this model the best RER for Vietnam is selected. The outcomes of the hybrid 2TL q -ROF-DEMATEL-TOPSIS method reveal that among the energy resources, hydropower energy ranked highest, followed by biofuel energy.},

In the first phase, two new structural features, along with other key features are extracted from news samples. In the second phase, a hybrid method based on curriculum strategy, consisting of statistical data, and a k -nearest neighbor algorithm is introduced to improve the performance of deep learning models. The obtained results indicated the higher performance of the proposed model in detecting fake news, compared to benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach based on multi-dimensional evaluation and benchmarking for data hiding techniques, i.e., watermarking and steganography. The novelty claim is the use of evaluation matrix (EM) for performance evaluation of data hiding techniques; however, one major problem with performance evaluation of data hiding techniques is to find reasonable thresholds for performance metrics and the trade-off among them in different data hiding applications. Two experiments are conducted. The first experiment included LSB techniques (eight approaches) based on different payload results and the noise gate approach; a total of nine approaches were used. Five audio samples with different audio styles are tested using each of the nine approaches and considering three evaluation criteria, namely, complexity, payload, and quality, to generate watermarked samples. The second experiment involves the use of various decision-making techniques simple additive weighting (SAW), multiplicative exponential weighting (MEW), hierarchical adaptive weighting (HAW), technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), weighted sum model (WSM) and weighted product method (WPM) to benchmark the results of the first experiment. Mean, standard deviation (STD), and paired sample t -test are then performed to compare the correlations among different techniques on the basis of ranking results. The findings are as follows: (1) A statistically significant difference is observed among the ranking results of each multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, (2) TOPSIS-Euclidean is the best technique to solve the benchmarking problem among digital watermarking techniques. (3) Among the decision-making techniques, WSM has the lowest rank in terms of solving the benchmarking problem. (4) Under different circumstances, the noise gate watermarking approach performs better than LSB algorithms.},

To increase the efficiency of spatiotemporal clustering, we have proposed a MapReduce-based framework for clustering. However, as spatiotemporal dataset contains sensitive information, directly outsourcing spatiotemporal data to Cloud servers will raise privacy concerns. To address the problem of privacy, we have proposed a privacy preserving clustering algorithm based on MapReduce for spatiotemporal data that can be efficiently outsourced for data processing on the Cloud servers. The proposed scheme allows the clustering operation to be performed directly on the encrypted spatiotemporal data by Cloud server. Extensive experimental evaluation with trajectory data shows that our scheme efficiently produces higher quality clustering results.},

Machine learning and data mining techniques have been adopted to develop scoring models for enhancing the prediction performance of default customers. However, it is difficult for these machine learning models for explaining the rejection or approval decision-making process to customers and other non-technical personnel. This paper presents an evidence reasoning (ER) rule-based ensemble learning approach for credit risk evaluation considering customer heterogeneity. Firstly, customers are segmented into different groups by k -means clustering algorithms and a two-stage weighting method is proposed to determine the significances of attributes by their discriminating powers between groups and within groups. Then, the attribute-related evidence is obtained by Bayesian statistics to represent the relationships between the attributes and credit risks, and a two-stage weighting evidential reasoning (TER) is developed as a base learner for credit scoring. Lastly, multiple base learners TERs are aggregated for evaluating customers’ credit risks. An empirical study on three credit datasets demonstrated that the proposed approach can achieve high performance with good explainability. The predicted results of the model can be well comprehended by providing the contribution of attributes and the activated rules in evidential reasoning processes.},

  abstract     = {For a company, it is important to know which products to launch to the market that may get the maximal profit. To achieve this goal, companies not only need to consider these products’ features, but also need to analyze how customers make their purchase decisions. For most customers, the price of a product is the most important purchase factor. If the price of a product can be adjusted, the purchase decision of a customer may change. With different price settings, we can speculate on the expected number of customers and the profit of the products. Motivated by this, we want to find the most profitable products among the candidates for the company. A distance-based adoption model can be used to evaluate the expected customers for products at different prices. The computational cost is high in two parts. One is the computational cost of obtaining the most profitable information on each set of candidate products. Another part is that many candidate product combinations need to be calculated. To tackle the computation problem, we propose two strategies. One is to avoid considering all possible price settings. The other is to avoid processing all possible subsets of the candidate products. Experimental results reveal the efficiency of our strategies.},

  abstract     = {Research in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in the healthcare sector is in a developing stage and demands further research to get more in-depth insight. We present a comprehensive model to develop and prioritize CRM readiness factors in hospitals using fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP, which helps top managers allocate their limited resources to enhance the required infrastructure for a CRM system. After extracting proper readiness factors, multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are applied to assess CRM readiness. First, using the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach (DEMATEL), the interdependent relations amongst criteria are designated. Second, the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) is applied to weigh the sub-criteria. Top management support and structure are the most critical factors which play an essential role in the CRM readiness concept. The importance of top management’s factor has been investigated in many previous works. The structure has been neglected in the previous studies; however, our results demonstrate that it should be considered a crucial factor. This study’s findings can facilitate the CRM system’s adoption process to be employed by decision-makers within hospitals to mitigate the failure rate of the CRM system’s implementation, leading to providing plenty of advantages to the patient association and hospitals. The results of this paper can also have a contribution to the implementation of CRM and artificial intelligence (AI) as an innovative strategy in organizations, particularly hospitals.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the computation issue of portfolio optimization with scenario-based mean-average value at Risk (AVaR) in uncertain environment. The portfolio optimization problem is designed in two cases: risk-taker and risk-averse models. The main idea is to replace the portfolio selection models with linear programming (LP) problems. Since the computing time required for solving LP greatly depends on the dimension and the structure of the problem, the conventional numerical methods are usually less effective in real-time applications. One promising approach to handle online applications is to employ recurrent neural networks based on circuit implementation. Hence, according to the convex optimization theory and some concepts of ordinary differential equations, a neural network model for solving the LP problems related to portfolio selection problems is presented. The equilibrium point of the proposed model is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of the original problem. It is also shown that the proposed neural network model is stable in the sense of Lyapunov and it is globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the portfolio selection problem with uncertain returns. Some illustrative examples are provided to show the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed method in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the world of Internet and integrates computing devices. The digital machines provide unique identifiers. The capacity to send data through the network using a better path is one of the capabilities of digital machines. IoT generates huge data based on fast aggregation data and processes these data efficiently. In this paper, a multi-objective hybrid woodpecker and flamingo search optimization algorithm is proposed for finding optimum Cluster Head (CH)-based energy-aware routing protocol in IoTs environment (Hyb-WFSOA-CHS-IoT). Here, the proposed Hyb-WFSOA-CHS-IoT model executes routing method through CH. The woodpecker and flamingo search optimization algorithm is used as the intelligent CH selection that consumes same energy as sensors. Hybrid woodpecker and flamingo search optimization algorithm (Hyb-WFSOA) is examined by using fitness functions, like distance, delay, energy consumption, throughput. The proposed Hyb-WFSOA-CHS-IoT method is activated in MATLAB software. Then, the performance of the proposed system is examined with different metrics, like delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, network lifetime, energy consumption. Therefore, the proposed method attains lower delay 28.38%, 32.34% and 47.45%, higher delivery ratio 19.34%, 23.12% and 18.96% and lower energy consumption 11.25%, 7.90% and 12.88% compared with existing methods, like multi-objective fractional gravitational search algorithm for energy-efficient routing on IoT (FGSA-CHS-IoT), multi-objective sunflower-based gray wolf optimization algorithm for multiple path routing on IoT network (SFG-CHS-IoT) and energy-aware routing in the IoT with improved grasshopper metaheuristic algorithm with chaos theory and fuzzy Logic (FLGOA-CHS-IoT).},

Recommender systems are introduced to deal with information overload. Cold start and data sparsity are the two primary issues in these systems, which lead to a decrease in the efficiency of recommender systems. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a novel method based on social network analysis. Our method leverages a multi-agent system for clustering users and items and predicting relationships between them simultaneously. The information on users and items is extracted from the user-item matrix as distinct graphs. Each of the graphs is then treated as a social network, which is further processed and analyzed by community detection and link prediction procedures. The users are grouped into several clusters by the community detection agent, which results in each cluster as a community. Then link prediction agent identifies the latent relationships between users and items. Simulation results show that the proposed method has significantly improved performance metrics as compared to recent techniques.},

  abstract     = {Rapid motorization and uncertainty in urban growth patterns make parking space management a serious task, especially in middle-income developing countries, and this has severe social, economic, and environmental repercussions including increased congestion, crash frequency, fuel and time consumption, and air pollution. Due to the complexity of the urban transportation issue and the wide variety of variables involved, a multicriteria assessment is essential. This study used fuzzy logic and geographical information systems (GIS) to develop a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model for managing parking in Shiraz’s central business district (CBD). The literature was mined for information on the variables that affect parking site placement, and a poll of experts ( n = 1 1 ) was used to determine their relative importance. The distance to travel attraction centers, distance to roads, land price, population density, and available land for multi-storey parking were among the factors considered. Meanwhile, the parking space shortage for each TAZ is calculated by subtracting the estimated parking space supply from the estimated parking space demand. An overlay of these two layers distinguishes locations that are in parking shortage zones and also meet multiple criteria. The results may aid policymakers in controlling parking demand by pinpointing the most promising places for investment.},

However, whether digitalization is deemed to be a necessity that can boost the performances of small- and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) or it is a frivolous costly investment that hinders corporate activities is still unclear. This paper examines the impact of digitalization on the financial performance of SMEs in the context of an emerging economy. Using a comprehensive firm-level dataset consisting of over 5,000 SMEs in Vietnam during the period from 2005 to 2015, we find that digitalization plays a vital role in facilitating the financial performance of SMEs. Specifically, we find that the investment in computers, an e-mail system, internet connection and e-trading would pay off as it can lead to a significant increase in firm financial performance. We furtherfind that firms can benefit from digitalization because it can significantly improve productivity and sales, and yetdoes not lead to an acceleration in total cost. The positive effect of digitalization on firm performance is even more pronounced during the 2007–2009 global economic crisis, and thus highlights the pivotal role of digitalization in tackling the economic shock.},

  abstract     = {In today’s fiercely competitive business environment, product design and development play critical roles in an enterprise’s success; therefore, consumer demand must be understood. Enterprises used to understand their consumers’ demands through time-consuming questionnaire surveys and statistical analyses. As the Internet and the popularity of virtual communities have grown, more consumers are leaving comments about their perceptions of the appeal of products on online social media platforms, thus enabling enterprises to more objectively understand consumers’ product preferences and demands. Therefore, determining how to effectively assist enterprises in analyzing valuable information beneficial to product design and development that can be gleaned from the large amount of social media data available is critical to promoting an enterprise’s competitive advantage in the product market. However, previous studies have primarily focused on understanding consumer viewpoints of products through review articles or electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM; it is a common channel for spreading product appraisals) from online social media. For these review articles and eWOM that can imply consumer demand for product features, there were no relevant studies focused on analyzing consumer demand by using both online review articles and eWOM for product feature evolution. Therefore, for new product features, this study developed a mechanism for product evolution course mining from product-related review articles (such as product functions or specifications) and eWOM on online social media to realize the prediction of future product features or specifications, and then assist enterprises in rapidly and accurately grasping product development trends to effectively discern key reference information for product design and development. The study was achieved by (1) designing a process for online information-based product evolution course mining and prediction, (ii) developing techniques related to online information-based product evolution course mining and prediction, and (iii) implementing and evaluating an online information-based product evolution course mining and prediction mechanism.

The data used in this research resulted from a questionnaire drawn up by a group of researchers from six European countries with the aim to investigate the youth’s awareness about the Sustainable Development Goals and their engagement as active agents of development and change at regional level. For the purpose of this study, we selected the regional results obtained from administering this questionnaire in Dolj County (Romania) and La Rioja (Spain). We developed a neutrosophic model that determines the Mindchanger profile of the respondents based on a minimal set of questions, which is dependent on the inclusion or exclusion of the nationality-specific traits. The resulting decisions were then compared with the respondents’ self-evaluations, yielding high precisions (more than 0.83) for all the investigated evaluation scenarios. Our results were significantly better than the ones provided by several machine learning models applied on the same set of data. A direct impact of our model is that it can be applied to questionnaires which include linguistic responses that express, among others, unclear or vague thoughts. Additionally, it offers the possibility to identify the minimal set of questions that impact the respondent’s answer choice to a target question.},

Data-driven technologies and applications in supply chain management enable supply chain planning, performance, coordination, and decision-making. Although the literature on procurement, production, logistics, distribution, and other areas within the supply chain is rich in their respective areas, systematic analyses of supply chain analytics are relatively few. Our objective is to examine supply chain analytics research to discover its intellectual core through a detailed bibliometric analysis. Specifically, we adopt citation, cocitation, co-occurrence, and centrality analysis using data obtained from the Web of Science to identify key research themes constituting the intellectual core of supply chain analytics. We find that there has been increasing attention in research circles relating to the relevance of analytics in supply chain management and implementation. We attempt to discover the themes and sub-themes in this research area. We find that the intellectual core of SCA can be classified into three main themes: (i) introduction of big data in the supply chain, (ii) adoption of analytics in different functions of operations management like logistics, pricing and location, and (iii) application of analytics for improving performance and business value.

This paper tackles the gap by presenting a framework for building foreclosure prediction models by integrating publicly-available census-tract demographic data and readily-available technology (geographic IS (GIS) and machine learning (ML)). The framework is tested and validated using over 19,000 foreclosures from Cuyahoga County (OH) using J48 decision tree, artificial neural network, and Naive Bayes algorithms. The framework’s empirical test identifies nine critical demographic attributes to successfully predict foreclosures, confirming the findings of prior studies while offering several new, highly predictive variables that were missed by prior research. This research is a call to broader IS, CS, and data science communities to assist society in understanding critical societal issues that may need deploying and integrating more advanced technologies.},

  abstract     = {Stock market is a significant element of economic market. Accurate forecasting of stock market is very helpful to shareholders because future prediction of a stock value will elevate the profits of investors. The data acquired from the stock market is a time-series data, in which the values of the stock prices are inherently varied with respect to time. Due to its complexity nature and nonlinearity characteristics, the prediction of stock market becomes very difficult and still it remains a challenging task. In order to cope up with such limitation, this research proposes an effective strategy called Deep Recurrent Rider LSTM to provide an accurate detection of stock market values. The accurate forecasting of stock market is carried out with two classifiers, namely Rider Deep Long Short-Term Memory (Rider Deep LSTM) and Deep Recurrent Neural Network (Deep RNN). The Rider Deep LSTM is derived by the integration of Rider concept with Deep LSTM, whereas the Deep RNN is trained using the proposed Shuffled Crow Search Optimization (SCSO). Moreover, the SCSO is derived by the integration of Shuffled Shepherd Optimization (SSO) algorithm and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). Finally, the predicted output is determined based on the error condition. Furthermore, the proposed Deep Recurrent Rider LSTM achieved the MSE and RMSE of 0.018 and 0.132 that shows higher performance with better accuracy. The stock market prediction using the proposed classification model is accurate and improves the effectiveness of the classification.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms are valuable tools for solving a wide variety of complex engineering problems. Usually, those problems have multiple criteria to fulfill, but such machine learning-based solutions are usually optimized using a single criterion. In such instances, a multi-objective optimization-based approach could bring interesting solutions by determining a set of Pareto-optimal solutions with different trade-off. Therefore, a multi-criteria decision-making process must be carried out. To the authors’ present knowledge, multi-criteria decision-making is yet to be fully explored for selecting preferable Pareto-optimal machine learning models after the training step. Therefore, this paper proposes applying and comparing five different multi-criteria decision-making techniques for selecting a preferred machine learning model. Additionally, an ensemble-based framework is proposed to cope with the difficulty of selecting parameters for such techniques. Those tools are tested on a complex real-world drinking-water quality monitoring problem. Results based on the F 1 score indicate that via a multi-criteria decision-making process ( F 1 = 0 . 5 6 ), it is possible to select better solutions than single-criterion approaches ( F 1 = 0 . 5 5 ). Moreover, the proposed ensemble framework is able to mitigate the difficulty in defining preferences and regions of interest, achieving competitive solutions.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing recommendation is necessary to surmount information overload and assist workers to identify tasks of interest efficiently. However, existing studies mainly concentrate on investigating workers’ qualifications or requirements, neglecting their fuzzy expectations and psychological behavior. Besides, workers can only passively accept the results and do not have any right to change them even if they are not satisfactory. As workers will pay different attention to task aspects, we regard the crowdsourcing recommendation as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, we propose an MCDM-based method for automated and interactive crowdsourcing task recommendations while comprehensively considering workers’ fuzzy expectations and psychological behavior. Given a large volume of available tasks on a crowdsourcing platform, the requirement of massive human efforts in traditional MCDM is not applicable in such situation. Therefore, we formulate a set of quantitative task evaluation criteria for automated task assessments based on the attributes that have the most impact on workers’ participation behavior. Further, to capture workers’ fuzziness in expectations, an intuitionistic fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic (IF2L) term is introduced, which are further leveraged as reference points to evaluate their “gains” and “losses” based on the prospect theory. Finally, the D-S evidence theory is adopted to gather workers’ uncertain prospect values. A case of ZBJ.COM, a popular crowdsourcing platform in China, shows that the proposed method is efficient and effective in recommending suitable and personalized tasks to workers.},

  abstract     = {The excellent classification accuracy of remote sensory images has led to a major expansion of their use in agricultural field surveillance in recent years. The accurate classification of crop is very significant for agricultural management and food security. There are diverse varieties of crops are available. Among them, each possesses same spectral curves. Due to increasing number of remote sensing information, a major limitation arises in the domain of crop classification is how to determine significant data from huge volume of information to maintain categorization accuracy and implementation time. Consequently, one of the main obstacles in the agricultural industry is the precise classification of crops. Deep Residual Network (ResNet)-based Social Sea Lion Driver Optimization (SSLnDO)-based Deep Fuzzy Clustering (DFC), where the distance is calculated using RV coefficient, are used to develop an effective method for classifying cotton crops. Finally, classification of the cotton crop is successfully accomplished using Deep ResNet, and the network classifier is trained by inserting produced SSLnDO. The vegetation index is generated for each color band independently. Combining the Social Ski Driver (SSD) optimization and the Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO) method yields the newly developed SSLnDO. A maximum testing accuracy of 0.940, a sensitivity of 0.931, and a specificity of 0.926 have been achieved by the designed model. When comparing the accuracy value produced by the proposed method for image-2 to the existing approaches, namely WLI-Fuzzy + BS-Lion NN, OSVM-OCNN, GAN, Hybrid CNN-RF, Deep learning, and Deep ResNet, they are 15.21%, 11.06%, 15.21%, 9.04%, 4.36%, and 2.3% higher.},

After that, we construct the projection index function based on the main factors of water eutrophication. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to determine the global optimal projection direction by optimizing the projection index function. Therefore, we construct an improved projection pursuit regression (PPR) model. Finally, the water eutrophication evaluation of several lakes in China is used to demonstrate the improved PPR model.

An IZ-method for multidimensional normalization is proposed, which eliminates the domains’ displacement. The IZ-method ensures the preservation of dispositions of natural values of attribute, provides symmetry in an orientation toward optimizing costs and benefits, processes the zero and negative values, and eliminates the priority of the contributions of various criteria to the performance indicator of alternatives. The IZ-method converts multivariate data to a single common scale and represents a class of multivariate normalization methods that convert data to isotropic scales. The IZ-method allows binding to the scale of any feature or to the scale chosen by the decision maker. Efficiency of the IZ-method is postulated by the totality of the fulfillment of the basic principles and required properties for multidimensional normalization.},

  abstract     = {Context: When the epidemic first broke out, no specific treatment was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The urgent need to end this unusual situation has resulted in many attempts to deal with SARS-CoV-2. In addition to several types of vaccinations that have been created, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have added a new dimension to preventative and treatment efforts. This therapy also helps prevent severe symptoms for those at a high risk. Therefore, this is one of the most promising treatments for mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 cases. However, the availability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapy is limited and leads to two main challenges. The first is the privacy challenge of selecting eligible patients from the distribution hospital networking, which requires data sharing, and the second is the prioritization of all eligible patients amongst the distribution hospitals according to dose availability. To our knowledge, no research combined the federated fundamental approach with multicriteria decision-making methods for the treatment of SARS-COV-2, indicating a research gap. Objective: This paper presents a unique sequence processing methodology that distributes anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs to eligible high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 based on medical requirements by using a novel federated decision-making distributor. Method: This paper proposes a novel federated decision-making distributor (FDMD) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs for eligible high-risk patients. FDMD is implemented on augmented data of 49,152 cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 with mild and moderate symptoms. For proof of concept, three hospitals with 16 patients each are enrolled. The proposed FDMD is constructed from the two sides of claim sequencing: central federated server (CFS) and local machine (LM). The CFS includes five sequential phases synchronised with the LMs, namely, the preliminary criteria setting phase that determines the high-risk criteria, calculates their weights using the newly formulated interval-valued spherical fuzzy and hesitant 2-tuple fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (IVSH2-FWZIC), and allocates their values. The subsequent phases are federation, dose availability confirmation, global prioritization of eligible patients and alerting the hospitals with the patients most eligible for receiving the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs according to dose availability. The LM independently performs all local prioritization processes without sharing patients’ data using the provided criteria settings and federated parameters from the CFS via the proposed Federated TOPSIS (F-TOPSIS). The sequential processing steps are coherently performed at both sides. Results and Discussion: (1) The proposed FDMD efficiently and independently identifies the high-risk patients most eligible for receiving anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs at each local distribution hospital. The final decision at the CFS relies on the indexed patients’ score and dose availability without sharing the patients’ data. (2) The IVSH2-FWZIC effectively weighs the high-risk criteria of patients with SARS-CoV-2. (3) The local and global prioritization ranks of the F-TOPSIS for eligible patients are subjected to a systematic ranking validated by high correlation results across nine scenarios by altering the weights of the criteria. (4) A comparative analysis of the experimental results with a prior study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed FDMD. Conclusion: The proposed FDMD has the benefits of centrally distributing anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs to high-risk patients prioritized based on their eligibility and dose availability, and simultaneously protecting their privacy and offering an effective cure to prevent progression to severe SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization or death.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel hybrid fuzzy decision-making model is constructed for the effective omnichannel strategy selection of financial services. The first phase of this model is related to inputting missing expert decisions for the quality function deployment (QFD) stages and omnichannel service strategies. The QFD stages of financial services are then weighted by bipolar q -rung orthopair fuzzy ( q -ROF) multi-stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis ( M -SWARA) based on the golden ratio. The QFD-based omnichannel strategy alternatives for financial services are then ranked using bipolar q -ROF ELECTRE. These calculations are also performed by considering PFSs and IFSs. Finally, the TOPSIS methodology is used to rank the alternatives so that comparative results can be obtained. The main contribution of this study is the creation of effective omnichannel strategies to improve financial services using a novel hybrid fuzzy decision-making methodology based on bipolar q -rung orthopair fuzzy sets ( q -ROFSs), M -SWARA, ELECTRE, and the imputation of expert evaluations with collaborative filtering. The analysis results obtained will facilitate determination of the most appropriate omnichannel strategies for businesses to provide effective financial services. In this manner, companies will be able to determine appropriate marketing strategies without incurring excessive costs. Because the analysis results are the same for all fuzzy sets, the proposed model is coherent and reliable. The findings demonstrate that online financial services are the most critical strategy for improving omnichannel. Thus, companies should prioritize online channels to provide financial services that are more effective.},

  abstract     = {Driven by promises of better and quicker decision-making, research on applications of technologies such as artificial intelligence in automating management decisions is increasing. However, the factors influencing the decision to increase the level of automation of a given management decision have remained a sidenote in the literature. In this systematic literature review, we organize these factors from the fragmented and heterogeneous research landscape concerned with automating management decisions. Using a systematically derived sample of research, we categorize and distill a multitude of factors into four themes: goals, foundations, design considerations, and application. We propose positive influences of six factors and a negative influence of one, namely costs, on the decision to increase the level of automation of a management decision. Finally, based on these propositions, we derive an agenda to guide future research.},

  abstract     = {The world faced a crisis called the coronavirus pandemic, a disease that has been able to disrupt a large proportion of the power and activities of the whole world and has evolved all economic and social decisions. These decisions are primarily related to restrictions such as widespread lockdowns and social distancing. Different countries have taken various approaches and decisions to deal with this situation, each of which has positive and negative sides. Apart from this issue, the rapid spread of this pandemic has affected researchers’ knowledge and viewpoints about this disease. Without any doubt, to expand our scientific knowledge and reduce the side effects of this challenge, it is essential to evaluate the behavior of COVID-19. Moreover, developing an effective vaccine in the short term was challenging. Regarding this issue, systematic thinking not only helps to find various ways to prevent this illness from spreading throughout the world but also reduces the mortality rate of this viral disease. From a systematic thinking perspective, governments and individuals play pivotal roles. They take care of vulnerable groups, support health employees, provide general education, identify new patients, and control specific situations in their countries. In such a situation where experts have not discovered any vaccine, governments and the people of society can be considered essential parameters to intensify or reduce the outbreak of this viral disease throughout the country. This paper’s main objective and motivation are to utilize causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to evaluate and determine various affecting factors created by governments and members of societies that have direct impacts on deteriorating or decreasing the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran from a system dynamics perspective. Hence, the statistics on the incidence and deaths caused by the coronavirus in Iran were extracted during some periods. Using the cause and effect diagrams, the behavior of the people and the government in increasing or decreasing the number of patients is discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the social media response on Reddit to the COVID-19 pandemic during its first year (February 2020–2021). The emergence of region-specific subreddits allows us to compare the reactions of individuals posting their opinions on social media about the global pandemic from two perspectives — the UK and the US. In particular, we look at the volume of posts and comments on these two subreddits, and at the sentiment expressed in these posts and comments over time as a measure of the public level of engagement and response. Whilst an analysis of volume allows us to quantify how interested people are about the pandemic as it unfolds, sentiment analysis goes beyond this and informs us about how people respond towards the pandemic based on the textual content in the posts and comments. The research looks to develop a framework for analyzing the social response on Reddit to a large-scale event in terms of the level of engagement measured through post and comment volumes, and opinion measured through an analysis of sentiment applied to the post content. In order to compare the subreddits, we show the trend in the time series through the application of moving average methods. We also show how to identify the lag between time series and align them using cross-correlation. Moreover, once aligned, we apply moving correlations to the time series to measure their degree of correspondence to see if there is a similar response to the pandemic across the two groups (UK and US). The results indicate that both subreddits were posting in high volumes at specific points during the pandemic, and that, despite the generally negative sentiment in the posts and comments, a gradual decrease in negativity leading up to the start of 2021 is observed as measures are put in place by governments and organizations to contain the virus and provide necessary support the affected populations.},

Although scholars, practitioners, and regulators have begun to focus on the new characteristics of financial fraud, a systematic and effective anti-fraud strategy during the pandemic still needs to be explored. This paper comprehensively analyzes the lessons of anti-fraud that we should learn from the COVID-19 pandemic. By exploring the complex motives and schemes of fraud, we summarize the characteristics of financial fraud activities and further analyze the regulatory challenges posed by financial fraud during the outbreak. To better cope with the fraudulent activities during the pandemic, policy proposals on how to improve the supervision of financial fraud activities are put forward. In particular, the panoramic data and graph-based techniques are powerful tools for future fraud detection.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the whole world is still suffering from the COVID-19 (variants) pandemic that has been lasting for over three years and resulted in countless losses. Since its outbreak at the end of 2019, China has first suffered, but quickly gained the upper hand through strict epidemic control and emergency management. Despite several recurrences of regional epidemics in 2022, both economic growth and people’s livelihoods have been effectively safeguarded in China, with a regular prevention system established and social life recovery accomplished orderly. How does China deal with this pandemic? What practical measures taken and decisions made could be adopted and shared with other countries? In this paper, these issues are summarized and discussed as progressive lessons for the rest of the world. Though there’s a major shift of pandemic policy in late 2022 and early 2023 in China, this study still provides insightful and beneficial implications to support decision- and policy-makings in future fights against any possible COVID-19 variants until the end of the pandemic.},

  abstract     = {The focus of this paper is on COVID-19, the December 2019 dated respiratory epidemic or infection that has ravaged most, if not all, of the world’s 253 “countries” (consisting of 194 independent nation-states, 55 dependent-states, Antarctica, and 3 other territories). Readers of this paper should be aware of at least three facts. First, as of January 2022, the submission date of this paper, COVID-19 continues to impact the world, although to a much lesser extent, given the protection afforded by the mRNA vaccines, the boosters, and the antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir, penciclovir, acyclovir, Paxlovid, etc.). Second, the paper should be regarded as being inconclusive in both its outlook and its list of references; it provides, at best, an intermediary account of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Third, like the Spanish Flu of 1918, it is speculated that the COVID-19 pandemic will not endure beyond three years and will conclude as an endemic problem by, hopefully, early 2023. Therefore, the paper is partitioned into three sections which, respectively, address the infection’s three phases: epidemic (initial infection), pandemic (worldwide infection) and endemic (pervasive but nonlife-threatening infection) phases. The lessons learned from the range of decisions made throughout the COVID-19 phases should help to inform and better prepare the world for future pathogens and deadly diseases.},
