  abstract     = {In the realm of data analysis, traditional statistical methods often struggle when faced with ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in real world data. Uncerainty theory, developed to better model and interpret such data, offers a promising alternative to conventional techniques. In this paper, we establish logistic regression models to initiate music statistics based on uncertainty theory. In particular, we will classify the music into different types named Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Impressionism based on four characteristics: harmonic complexity, rhythmic complexity, texture complexity, and formal structure, with the help of the uncertain logistic models proposed. This theoretical framework for music classification provides a nuanced understanding of how music is interpreted under conditions of ambiguity and variability. Compared with the probabilistic counterpart, our approach highlights the versatility of uncertainty theory and provides researchers one much more feasible method to analyze the often-subjective nature of music reception, as well as broadening the potential applications of uncertainty theory.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty in the environment poses a significant challenge for supply chain management, and uncertainty theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on analyzing uncertain phenomena. In this context, an increasing number of scholars have begun to use the uncertainty theory to study uncertain phenomena in the supply chain management, but there is still a lack of systematic literature reviews and research outlooks in this research field. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the relevant literature in the Web of Science database from 2015 to May 2024 using bibliometric analysis and content analysis. First, bibliometric analysis is conducted to visualize the current state of research, including publication trends, keywords, authors, and geographical distribution. Then, through content analysis, the selected literature is categorized into seven subfields according to the research questions, including supply chain pricing decision, supply chain network disruption, supply chain network design, supply chain management considering sales efforts, sustainable supply chain management, supply chain contract design, and general supply chain management. The results indicate that the literature on the supply chain management based on the uncertainty theory is not yet mature. The research has begun to shift from single uncertainty to multidimensional uncertainty and from single-objective decision-making to multi-objective decision-making. The research direction has also shifted towards sustainability and resilience design in supply chain networks, gradually incorporating environmental and social benefits into supply chain decision-making. Based on the results of the bibliometric analysis and content analysis, future research directions are identified and potential related research opportunities are proposed, including the impact of consumer behavior, channel interaction, corporate social responsibility, and logistics service strategies on the supply chain management based on the uncertainty theory.},

As the primary tradable asset in the carbon market, carbon emission allowances inevitably experience price fluctuations. However, numerous empirical studies show that the frequency of real-world data is highly unstable, which results in the failure of probabilistic modeling. Therefore, this paper aims to model the dynamics of carbon emission allowance prices in China using four mainstream uncertain differential equations. The optimal model is chosen through rolling window cross-validation using the criterion of minimizing average testing errors. Parameters of the optimal model are determined by moment estimation based on residuals, and the model’s effectiveness is also assessed through uncertain two-sided hypothesis testing. Additionally, we forecast carbon emission allowance prices and their 95% confidence intervals for the next 14 business days. To manage trading risks, we propose a customized carbon option contract for pricing European carbon options and conduct sensitivity analysis on key parameters. Finally, we present a paradox of stochastic differential equations for modeling carbon emission allowance prices.},

In order to answer this question, we collect the arriving times of passengers from online car-hailing platform in Beijing, and then analyze the collected data based on stochastic renewal process and uncertain renewal process. Finally, by comparing samples and confidence intervals of the total numbers of passengers arriving on the online car-hailing platform under two mathematical systems, we come to the conclusion that the queueing systems in the real world are uncertain rather than random.},

First, this paper regards the rate of return on security as an uncertain variable which obeys linear uncertainty distribution, and then provides the analytical expressions of the corresponding risk, return and risk index in the uncertain portfolio selection environment. Afterwards, we construct three types uncertain portfolio selection models with uncertain constraint, namely, the minimizing risk, the maximizing return and the maximizing belief degree. Meanwhile, in order to more intuitively reflect the investor’s sense of loss, three types uncertain portfolio selection models considering both uncertain constraint and risk index are also constructed. These models are transformed into corresponding deterministic models.

Market demand is a key factor affecting pricing decision and demand uncertainty complicates the pricing problem. To deal with the challenge that only partial demand distribution information is available, this paper proposes a novel ambiguity distribution set to depict the uncertain demand. Under the proposed ambiguity distribution set, a robust fuzzy bi-level optimization pricing model is developed for the low-carbon DC supply chain. Three CAT regulation mechanisms, no CAT regulation, grandfathering (GF) mechanism and benchmarking (BM) mechanism, are considered to address the manufacturer’s CAT regulation. The analytically tractable counterpart of the proposed model is derived and the corresponding robust equilibrium solutions are obtained under three CAT mechanisms. Numerical analyses are carried out to explore the impact of the demand uncertainty on the manufacturer’s selection of the CAT regulation mechanism. The numerical results indicate that the uncertainty degree can change the manufacturer’s selection of the regulated mechanisms. Specifically, when the uncertainty degree is smaller, the BM mechanism is beneficial for the manufacturer comparing with the GF mechanism; when the uncertainty degree is bigger, the manufacturer prefers to GF mechanism rather than BM mechanism.},

Fuzzy systems achieved limited success in electric load forecasting. On the other hand, support vector regression models have seldom been part of a winning solution of the electric load forecasting competitions during the last decade. In this paper, we propose a methodology to integrate the fuzzy memberships with support vector regression (SVR) and support vector quantile regression (SVQR) models for short-term point and probabilistic load forecasting, respectively. One fuzzy membership function is proposed to efficiently calculate the relative importance of the observations in the load history. Three SVR and one SVQR models, including L1-norm based SVR, L2-norm based SVR, kernel-free quadratic surface SVR and SVQR models, are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. For point load forecasting, we compare the proposed fuzzy SVR models with a multiple linear regression, a feed-forward neural network, a fuzzy interaction regression, and four SVR models. For probabilistic load forecasting, the proposed fuzzy SVQR model is compared with a quantile regression model, a quantile regression neural network, and a SVQR model. The results on the data of global energy forecasting competition 2012, demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy component can improve the underlying SVR and SVQR models to outperform their counterparts and commonly-used models for point and probabilistic load forecasting, respectively.},

For this purpose, carbon finance market plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions by providing financial mechanisms to support and incentivize emission reduction projects. As a type of carbon finance derivative, carbon swap is an agreement between two parties whereby a floating price is exchange for a fixed price for carbon emission right over a specified period. How to price carbon swap before signing, i.e., determine the fixed price in the swap contract, and valuate carbon swap during the life of the swap contract are key issues. Noting the fact that the underlying asset of carbon swap is carbon price, the primary task is to model carbon price reasonably. Due to the inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with pricing carbon, frequency stability is often not guaranteed, resulting in the failure of probability based methods. Thus, this paper characterizes the carbon price using uncertain differential equation under the framework of uncertainty theory, and derives swap pricing and valuation formulas. Estimations for unknown parameters in the proposed model are given. Finally, with carbon spot price in European Energy Exchange, real data analyses are documented to illustrate our proposed methods in details.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an optimization problem with uncertain constraint coefficients is considered. Possibility theory is used to model the uncertainty. Namely, a joint possibility distribution in constraint coefficient realizations, called scenarios, is specified. This possibility distribution induces a necessity measure in a scenario set, which in turn describes an ambiguity set of probability distributions in a scenario set. The distributionally robust approach is then used to convert the imprecise constraints into deterministic equivalents. Namely, the left-hand side of an imprecise constraint is evaluated by using a risk measure with respect to the worst probability distribution that can occur. In this paper, the Conditional Value at Risk is used as the risk measure, which generalizes the strict robust, and expected value approaches commonly used in literature. A general framework for solving such a class of problems is described. Some cases which can be solved in polynomial time are identified.},

Pairwise comparisons can be performed within several frameworks such as multiplicative, additive and fuzzy representations of preferences, which are particular instances of a more general framework based on Abelian linearly ordered groups. Though multiplicative, additive and fuzzy representations of preferences are widely used in practice, it is unknown whether decision makers are equally precise in the three aforementioned representations when they measure objective data. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to design, carry out and analyse an experiment with over 200 respondents (undergraduate university students) from two countries, Czechia and Italy, to compare precision of the respondents in all three representations. In the experiment, respondents pairwise compared (by approximation) the areas of four geometric figures and then, the imprecision of their assessments was measured by computing the distance with the exact pairwise comparisons. We grouped the respondents in such a way that each participant was allowed to deal with a unique type of representation. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the multiplicative approach is the most precise.},

Nonetheless, forecasting and modeling the COVID-19 medical waste with a detoxification center of the COVID-19 medical wastes remains a challenge. This work presents a Fuzzy Inference System to forecast the COVID-19 medical wastes. Then, people are divided into five categories are divided according to the symptoms of the disease into healthy people, suspicious, suspected of mild COVID-19, and suspicious of intense COVID-19. In this regard, a new fuzzy sustainable model for COVID-19 medical waste supply chain network for location and allocation decisions considering waste management is developed for the first time. The main purpose of this paper is to minimize supply chain costs, the environmental impact of medical waste, and to establish detoxification centers and control the social responsibility centers in the COVID-19 outbreak. To show the performance of the suggested model, sensitivity analysis is performed on important parameters. A real case study in Iran/Tehran is suggested to validate the proposed model. Classifying people into different groups, considering sustainability in COVID 19 medical waste supply chain network and examining new artificial intelligence methods based on TS and GOA algorithms are among the contributions of this paper. Results show that the decision-makers should use an FIS to forecast COVID-19 medical waste and employ a detoxification center of the COVID-19 medical wastes to reduce outbreaks of this pandemic.},

For BWM, the best criteria and the worst criteria of alternatives are first determined by the decision-maker (DM). Then, the DM gives his best-to-others vector (BV) and the others-to-worst vector (WV). In this paper, we show that the BV and WV can intrinsically be formulated as an incomplete reciprocal matrix, we call it BWM matrix. Thus, to derive the weights for BWM can be transformed to derive the weights from an incomplete reciprocal preference relation. In this view, we present several models to derive priority weights from a BWM matrix. Especially, we also show that the initial BWM model is a special case of our proposed method, the concept of efficiency is extended to the incomplete reciprocal preference relation. Furthermore, these methods are extended to derive the priority weights for group decision making problems. Additionally, some inconsistency indices are introduced to measure the inconsistency degree of a BWM matrix. Finally, one example is illustrated to derive the optimal weights from a BWM matrix and another example is illustrated to show the efficiency of the weight vectors, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations and comparative analyses are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed priority methods.},

Firstly, we use two kinds of linguistic preference orderings (LPOs) to represent experts’ opinions when evaluating the medical health resources allocation in public health emergencies. Then, a novel ORESTE method with LPOs is developed to solve multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Additionally, we apply the proposed ORESTE method to solve a practical MCDM problem involving the medical health resources allocation in public health emergencies. Finally, some comparative analyses among the proposed ORESTE method and some existing methods under a double hierarchy linguistic environment are set up, and some discussions are summarized to show the validity and applicability of the proposed novel ORESTE method.},
