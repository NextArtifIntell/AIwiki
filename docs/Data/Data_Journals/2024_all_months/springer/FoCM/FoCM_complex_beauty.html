  abstract     = {Transportation of measure provides a versatile approach for modeling complex probability distributions, with applications in density estimation, Bayesian inference, generative modeling, and beyond. Monotone triangular transport maps—approximations of the Knothe–Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement—are a canonical choice for these tasks. Yet the representation and parameterization of such maps have a significant impact on their generality and expressiveness, and on properties of the optimization problem that arises in learning a map from data (e.g., via maximum likelihood estimation). We present a general framework for representing monotone triangular maps via invertible transformations of smooth functions. We establish conditions on the transformation such that the associated infinite-dimensional minimization problem has no spurious local minima, i.e., all local minima are global minima; and we show for target distributions satisfying certain tail conditions that the unique global minimizer corresponds to the KR map. Given a sample from the target, we then propose an adaptive algorithm that estimates a sparse semi-parametric approximation of the underlying KR map. We demonstrate how this framework can be applied to joint and conditional density estimation, likelihood-free inference, and structure learning of directed graphical models, with stable generalization performance across a range of sample sizes.},

We focus our attention on the approximation of such mean field games by analogous problems in discrete time and finite state space which fall in the framework of (Gomes et al. in J Math Pures Appl (9) 93(3):308-328, 2010). For these approximations, we show the existence and, under an additional monotonicity assumption, uniqueness of solutions. In our main result, we establish the convergence of equilibria of the discrete mean field games problems towards equilibria of the continuous one. Finally, we provide some numerical results for two MFG problems. In the first one, the dynamics of a typical player is nonlinear with respect to the state and, in the second one, a typical player controls its acceleration.},

In a Hadamard space, the asymptotic slope function (Kapovich et al. in J Differ Geom 81:297–354, 2009), which is a function on the boundary at infinity, plays a role of the recession function. We extend this notion by means of convex analysis and optimization and develop a convex analysis foundation for the unbounded determination of geodesically convex optimization on Hadamard spaces, particularly on symmetric spaces of nonpositive curvature. We explain how our developed theory is applied to operator scaling and related optimization on group orbits, which are our motivation.},

This quantity plays an important role in physics, in particular in the study of wave turbulence where one needs to adopt a statistical approach in order to obtain deep insight into the generic long-time behaviour of solutions to dispersive equations. Our new class of schemes is based on Wick’s theorem and Feynman diagrams together with a resonance-based discretisation (Bruned and Schratz in Forum Math Pi 10:E2, 2022) set in a more general context: we introduce a novel combinatorial structure called paired decorated forests which are two decorated trees whose decorations on the leaves come in pair. The character of the scheme draws its inspiration from the treatment of singular stochastic partial differential equations via regularity structures. In contrast to classical approaches, we do not discretise the PDE itself, but rather its expectation. This allows us to heavily exploit the optimal resonance structure and underlying gain in regularity on the finite dimensional (discrete) level.},

In this paper, we present a unifying regularization functional that depends on an operator $$\textrm{L}$$ and on a generic Radon-domain norm. We establish the existence of a minimizer and give the parametric form of the solution(s) under very mild assumptions. When the norm is Hilbertian, the proposed formulation yields a solution that involves radial-basis functions and is compatible with the classical methods of machine learning. By contrast, for the total-variation norm, the solution takes the form of a two-layer neural network with an activation function that is determined by the regularization operator. In particular, we retrieve the popular ReLU networks by letting the operator be the Laplacian. We also characterize the solution for the intermediate regularization norms $$\Vert \cdot \Vert =\Vert \cdot \Vert _{L_p}$$ with $$p\in (1,2]$$ . Our framework offers guarantees of universal approximation for a broad family of regularization operators or, equivalently, for a wide variety of shallow neural networks, including the cases (such as ReLU) where the activation function is increasing polynomially. It also explains the favorable role of bias and skip connections in neural architectures.},

Since even the existence of nontrivial stationary points is often difficult to accomplish, extracting their index information is usually out of reach. In this paper, we establish a computer-assisted proof approach to determining relative indices of stationary states. We introduce the general framework and then focus on three example problems described by partial differential equations to show how these ideas work in practice. Based on a rigorous implementation, with accompanying code made available, we determine the relative indices of many stationary points. Moreover, we show how forcing results can be then used to prove theorems about connecting orbits and traveling waves in partial differential equations.},

However, the convergence of Dziuk’s parametric finite element method, as well as many other widely used parametric finite element methods for these geometric flows, remains open. In this article, we introduce a new approach and a corresponding new framework for the analysis of parametric finite element approximations to surface evolution under geometric flows, by estimating the projected distance from the numerically computed surface to the exact surface, rather than estimating the distance between particle trajectories of the two surfaces as in the currently available numerical analyses. The new framework can recover some hidden geometric structures in geometric flows, such as the full $$H^1$$ parabolicity in mean curvature flow, which is used to prove the convergence of Dziuk’s parametric finite element method with finite elements of degree $$k \ge 3$$ for surfaces in the three-dimensional space. The new framework introduced in this article also provides a foundational mathematical tool for analyzing other geometric flows and other parametric finite element methods with artificial tangential motions to improve the mesh quality.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a new technique to obtain improved estimates for the computational resolution limits in two-dimensional super-resolution problems and present a new idea for developing two-dimensional super-resolution algorithms. To be more specific, our main contributions are fourfold: (1) Our work improves the resolution estimates for number detection and location recovery in two-dimensional super-resolution problems; (2) As a consequence, we derive a stability result for a sparsity-promoting algorithm in two-dimensional super-resolution problems [or direction of arrival Problems (DOA)]. The stability result exhibits the optimal performance of sparsity promoting in solving such problems; (3) Inspired by the new techniques, we propose a new coordinate-combination-based model order detection algorithm for two-dimensional DOA estimation and theoretically demonstrate its optimal performance, and (4) we also propose a new coordinate-combination-based MUSIC algorithm for super-resolving sources in two-dimensional DOA estimation. It has excellent performance and enjoys some advantages compared to the conventional DOA algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In 2006, Arnold, Falk, and Winther developed finite element exterior calculus, using the language of differential forms to generalize the Lagrange, Raviart–Thomas, Brezzi–Douglas–Marini, and Nédélec finite element spaces for simplicial triangulations. In a recent paper, Licht asks whether, on a single simplex, one can construct bases for these spaces that are invariant with respect to permuting the vertices of the simplex. For scalar fields, standard bases all have this symmetry property, but for vector fields, this question is more complicated: Such invariant bases may or may not exist, depending on the polynomial degree of the element. In dimensions two and three, Licht constructs such invariant bases for certain values of the polynomial degree r, and he conjectures that his list is complete, that is, that no such basis exists for other values of r. In this paper, we show that Licht’s conjecture is true in dimension two. However, in dimension three, we show that Licht’s ideas can be extended to give invariant bases for many more values of r; we then show that this new larger list is complete. Along the way, we develop a more general framework for the geometric decomposition ideas of Arnold, Falk, and Winther.},

The loss function $$\mathcal {L}_{\sigma }$$ involving a scaling parameter $$\sigma &gt;0$$ can cover a wide range of commonly used robust losses. The proposed algorithm is then a robust alternative for online least squares regression aiming to estimate the conditional mean function. For properly chosen $$\sigma $$ and step size, we show that the last iterate of this online algorithm can achieve optimal capacity independent convergence in the mean square distance. Moreover, if additional information on the underlying function space is known, we also establish optimal capacity-dependent rates for strong convergence in RKHS. To the best of our knowledge, both of the two results are new to the existing literature of online learning.},

We apply the topological techniques to prove various kinds of dynamical behaviour, for example, existence of (apparently) unstable periodic orbits in Mackey–Glass equation (in the regime of parameters where chaos is numerically observed) and persistence of symbolic dynamics in a delay-perturbed chaotic ODE (the Rössler system).},

  abstract     = {We study the representative volume element (RVE) method, which is a method to approximately infer the effective behavior $$a_{\textrm{hom}}$$ of a stationary random medium. The latter is described by a coefficient field a(x) generated from a given ensemble $$\langle \cdot \rangle $$ and the corresponding linear elliptic operator $$-\nabla \cdot a\nabla $$ . In line with the theory of homogenization, the method proceeds by computing $$d=3$$ correctors (d denoting the space dimension). To be numerically tractable, this computation has to be done on a finite domain: the so-called representative volume element, i.e., a large box with, say, periodic boundary conditions. The main message of this article is: Periodize the ensemble instead of its realizations. By this, we mean that it is better to sample from a suitably periodized ensemble than to periodically extend the restriction of a realization a(x) from the whole-space ensemble $$\langle \cdot \rangle $$ . We make this point by investigating the bias (or systematic error), i.e., the difference between $$a_{\textrm{hom}}$$ and the expected value of the RVE method, in terms of its scaling w.r.t. the lateral size L of the box. In case of periodizing a(x), we heuristically argue that this error is generically $$O(L^{-1})$$ . In case of a suitable periodization of $$\langle \cdot \rangle $$ , we rigorously show that it is $$O(L^{-d})$$ . In fact, we give a characterization of the leading-order error term for both strategies and argue that even in the isotropic case it is generically non-degenerate. We carry out the rigorous analysis in the convenient setting of ensembles $$\langle \cdot \rangle $$ of Gaussian type, which allow for a straightforward periodization, passing via the (integrable) covariance function. This setting has also the advantage of making the Price theorem and the Malliavin calculus available for optimal stochastic estimates of correctors. We actually need control of second-order correctors to capture the leading-order error term. This is due to inversion symmetry when applying the two-scale expansion to the Green function. As a bonus, we present a stream-lined strategy to estimate the error in a higher-order two-scale expansion of the Green function.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of estimating expectations with respect to a target distribution with an unknown normalising constant, and where even the un-normalised target needs to be approximated at finite resolution. This setting is ubiquitous across science and engineering applications, for example in the context of Bayesian inference where a physics-based model governed by an intractable partial differential equation (PDE) appears in the likelihood. A multi-index sequential Monte Carlo (MISMC) method is used to construct ratio estimators which provably enjoy the complexity improvements of multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC) as well as the efficiency of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for inference. In particular, the proposed method provably achieves the canonical complexity of $$\hbox {MSE}^{-1}$$ , while single-level methods require $$\hbox {MSE}^{-\xi }$$ for $$\xi &gt;1$$ . This is illustrated on examples of Bayesian inverse problems with an elliptic PDE forward model in 1 and 2 spatial dimensions, where $$\xi =5/4$$ and $$\xi =3/2$$ , respectively. It is also illustrated on more challenging log-Gaussian process models, where single-level complexity is approximately $$\xi =9/4$$ and multilevel Monte Carlo (or MIMC with an inappropriate index set) gives $$\xi = 5/4 + \omega $$ , for any $$\omega &gt; 0$$ , whereas our method is again canonical. We also provide novel theoretical verification of the product-form convergence results which MIMC requires for Gaussian processes built in spaces of mixed regularity defined in the spectral domain, which facilitates acceleration with fast Fourier transform methods via a cumulant embedding strategy, and may be of independent interest in the context of spatial statistics and machine learning.},

  abstract     = {A periodic lattice in Euclidean space is the infinite set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors. Any lattice can be generated by infinitely many different bases. This ambiguity was partially resolved, but standard reductions remain discontinuous under perturbations modelling atomic displacements. This paper completes a continuous classification of 2-dimensional lattices up to Euclidean isometry (or congruence), rigid motion (without reflections), and similarity (with uniform scaling). The new homogeneous invariants allow easily computable metrics on lattices considered up to the equivalences above. The metrics up to rigid motion are especially non-trivial and settle all remaining questions on (dis)continuity of lattice bases. These metrics lead to real-valued chiral distances that continuously measure lattice deviations from higher-symmetry neighbours. The geometric methods extend the past work of Delone, Conway, and Sloane.},

  abstract     = {Computing spectra is a central problem in computational mathematics with an abundance of applications throughout the sciences. However, in many applications gaining an approximation of the spectrum is not enough. Often it is vital to determine geometric features of spectra such as Lebesgue measure, capacity or fractal dimensions, different types of spectral radii and numerical ranges, or to detect gaps in essential spectra and the corresponding failure of the finite section method. Despite new results on computing spectra and the substantial interest in these geometric problems, there remain no general methods able to compute such geometric features of spectra of infinite-dimensional operators. We provide the first algorithms for the computation of many of these long-standing problems (including the above). As demonstrated with computational examples, the new algorithms yield a library of new methods. Recent progress in computational spectral problems in infinite dimensions has led to the solvability complexity index (SCI) hierarchy, which classifies the difficulty of computational problems. These results reveal that infinite-dimensional spectral problems yield an intricate infinite classification theory determining which spectral problems can be solved and with which type of algorithm. This is very much related to S. Smale’s comprehensive program on the foundations of computational mathematics initiated in the 1980s. We classify the computation of geometric features of spectra in the SCI hierarchy, allowing us to precisely determine the boundaries of what computers can achieve (in any model of computation) and prove that our algorithms are optimal. We also provide a new universal technique for establishing lower bounds in the SCI hierarchy, which both greatly simplifies previous SCI arguments and allows new, formerly unattainable, classifications.},

Our construction relies on the Regge finite elements, which are piecewise polynomial symmetric (0, 2)-tensor fields possessing single-valued tangential-tangential components along element interfaces. When used to discretize the Riemannian metric tensor, these piecewise polynomial tensor fields do not possess enough regularity to define connections and curvature in the classical sense, but we show how to make sense of these quantities in a distributional sense. We then show that these distributional quantities converge in certain dual Sobolev norms to their smooth counterparts under refinement of the triangulation. We also discuss projections of the distributional curvature and distributional connection onto piecewise polynomial finite element spaces. We show that the relevant projection operators commute with certain linearized differential operators, yielding a commutative diagram of differential complexes.},

We conduct a systematic study of such transforms and introduce two new ones: the Euler–Fourier and Euler–Laplace transforms. We show that the first has a left inverse and that the second provides a satisfactory generalization of Govc and Hepworth’s persistent magnitude to constructible sheaves, in particular to multi-parameter persistent modules. Finally, we prove index-theoretic formulae expressing a wide class of hybrid transforms as generalized Euler integral transforms.

First, we introduce the notion of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the nonlinear approximation rates, metric entropy, and n-widths of their absolute convex hull. The upper bounds depend upon the order of smoothness of the parameterization. This result is applied to dictionaries of ridge functions corresponding to shallow neural networks, and they improve upon existing results in many cases. Next, we provide a method for lower bounding the metric entropy and n-widths of variation spaces which contain certain classes of ridge functions. This result gives sharp lower bounds on the $$L^2$$ -approximation rates, metric entropy, and n-widths for variation spaces corresponding to neural networks with a range of important activation functions, including ReLU $$^k$$ activation functions and sigmoidal activation functions with bounded variation.},

It also includes the error bounds obtainable under the theory of amenable cones. Our main result is that the convergence rate of several projection algorithms for feasibility problems can be expressed explicitly in terms of the underlying consistent error bound function. Another feature is the usage of Karamata theory and functions of regular variations which allows us to reason about convergence rates while bypassing certain complicated expressions. Finally, applications to conic feasibility problems are given and we show that a number of algorithms have convergence rates depending explicitly on the singularity degree of the problem.},

However, neither is robust to outliers, and both can be insensitive to topological structure of high-density regions of the data. A natural solution is to consider 2-parameter persistence. This paper studies the stability of 2-parameter persistent homology: we show that several related density-sensitive constructions of bifiltrations from data satisfy stability properties accommodating the addition and removal of outliers. Specifically, we consider the multicover bifiltration, Sheehy’s subdivision bifiltrations, and the degree bifiltrations. For the multicover and subdivision bifiltrations, we get 1-Lipschitz stability results closely analogous to the standard stability results for 1-parameter persistent homology. Our results for the degree bifiltrations are weaker, but they are tight, in a sense. As an application of our theory, we prove a law of large numbers for subdivision bifiltrations of random data.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an atlas of algebro-geometric objects associated with image formation in pinhole cameras. The nodes of the atlas are algebraic varieties or their vanishing ideals related to each other by projection or elimination and restriction or specialization, respectively. This atlas offers a unifying framework for the study of problems in 3D computer vision. We initiate the study of the atlas by completely characterizing a part of the atlas stemming from the triangulation problem. We conclude with several open problems and generalizations of the atlas.},

  abstract     = {The protection of private information is of vital importance in data-driven research, business and government. The conflict between privacy and utility has triggered intensive research in the computer science and statistics communities, who have developed a variety of methods for privacy-preserving data release. Among the main concepts that have emerged are anonymity and differential privacy. Today, another solution is gaining traction, synthetic data. However, the road to privacy is paved with NP-hard problems. In this paper, we focus on the NP-hard challenge to develop a synthetic data generation method that is computationally efficient, comes with provable privacy guarantees and rigorously quantifies data utility. We solve a relaxed version of this problem by studying a fundamental, but a first glance completely unrelated, problem in probability concerning the concept of covariance loss. Namely, we find a nearly optimal and constructive answer to the question how much information is lost when we take conditional expectation. Surprisingly, this excursion into theoretical probability produces mathematical techniques that allow us to derive constructive, approximately optimal solutions to difficult applied problems concerning microaggregation, privacy and synthetic data.},

  abstract     = {Preservation of linear and quadratic invariants by numerical integrators has been well studied. However, many systems have linear or quadratic observables that are not invariant, but which satisfy evolution equations expressing important properties of the system. For example, a time-evolution PDE may have an observable that satisfies a local conservation law, such as the multisymplectic conservation law for Hamiltonian PDEs. We introduce the concept of functional equivariance, a natural sense in which a numerical integrator may preserve the dynamics satisfied by certain classes of observables, whether or not they are invariant. After developing the general framework, we use it to obtain results on methods preserving local conservation laws in PDEs. In particular, integrators preserving quadratic invariants also preserve local conservation laws for quadratic observables, and symplectic integrators are multisymplectic.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss a generalization of the bubble transform to differential forms. The bubble transform was discussed in Falk and Winther (Found Comput Math 16(1):297–328, 2016) for scalar valued functions, or zero-forms, and represents a new tool for the understanding of finite element spaces of arbitrary polynomial degree. The present paper contains a similar study for differential forms. From a simplicial mesh $${{\mathscr {T}}}$$ of the domain $$\varOmega $$ , we build a map which decomposes piecewise smooth k-forms into a sum of local bubbles supported on appropriate macroelements. The key properties of the decomposition are that it commutes with the exterior derivative and preserves the piecewise polynomial structure of the standard finite element spaces of k-forms. Furthermore, the transform is bounded in $$L^2$$ and also on the appropriate subspace consisting of k-forms with exterior derivatives in $$L^2$$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the statistical query (SQ) complexity of estimating d-dimensional submanifolds in $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$ . We propose a purely geometric algorithm called manifold propagation, that reduces the problem to three natural geometric routines: projection, tangent space estimation, and point detection. We then provide constructions of these geometric routines in the SQ framework. Given an adversarial $$\mathrm {STAT}(\tau )$$ oracle and a target Hausdorff distance precision $$\varepsilon = \Omega (\tau ^{2 / (d + 1)})$$ , the resulting SQ manifold reconstruction algorithm has query complexity $${\tilde{O}}(n \varepsilon ^{-d / 2})$$ , which is proved to be nearly optimal. In the process, we establish low-rank matrix completion results for SQ’s and lower bounds for randomized SQ estimators in general metric spaces.},
