However, without appropriately chosen the working models, DR estimators may substantially lose efficiency. In this paper, based on the augmented inverse probability weighting procedure, we derive a new estimating equation for the causal effect by the strategy of combining estimating equations. The resulting estimator by solving the new estimating equation retains doubly robust and can improve the efficiency under the misspecification of conditional mean working model. We further show the large sample properties of the proposed estimator under some regularity conditions. Through simulation experiments and a real data analysis, we illustrate that the proposed method is competitive with its competitors, which is in line with those implied by the asymptotic theory.},

However, the parameterization in IGA is non-trivial. Weighted extended B-splines (WEB) method replaces grid generation and parameterization with weight function construction (R-function or distance function). By using implicit spline representation, isogeometric analysis on implicit domains (IGAID) adopts the merits of the “isoparametric” in IGA and “weight function generation” in WEB. But the theoretical properties have not been fully studied yet. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of IGAID using tensor-product B-splines. Both the approximation and stability properties of IGAID are considered. By setting appropriate constraints on the weight function, we can derive the optimal approximation order and stability. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the approach and validate the theoretical results.},

The kth power expectile regression is then utilized to test for homoskedasticity and conditional symmetry of the data. Detailed comparisons of the local power among the kth power expectile regression tests, the quantile regression test, and the expectile regression test have been provided. When the underlying distribution is not standard normal, results show that the optimal k are often larger than 1 and smaller than 2, which suggests the general kth power expectile regression is necessary.

In this paper, we introduce three case-deletion diagnostic measures to identify influential observations in functional linear models when the covariate is functional and observations on the scalar response are subject to nonignorable missingness. The nonignorable missing data mechanism is modeled via an exponential tilting semiparametric functional model. A semiparametric imputation procedure is developed to mitigate the effects of missing data. Valid estimations of the functional coefficients are based on functional principal components analysis using the imputed dataset. A smoothed bootstrap sampling method is introduced to estimate the diagnostic probability for each proposed diagnostic measure, which is helpful to unveil which observations have the larger influence on estimation and prediction. Simulation studies and a real data example are conducted to illustrate the finite performance of the proposed methods.},

An essential step in surface implicitization using the method of moving surfaces is to compute a $$\mu $$ -basis of a parametric surface with respect to one variable. The $$\mu $$ -basis is a minimal basis of the syzygy module of a univariate polynomial matrix with special structure defined by the parametric equation of the rational surface. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $$\mu $$ -basis of a parametric surface with respect to a variable based on the special structure of the corresponding univariate polynomial matrix. Analysis on the computational complexity of the algorithm is also provided. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is much faster than the general method to compute the $$\mu $$ -bases of arbitrary polynomial matrices and outperforms the $$F_5$$ algorithm based on Gröbner basis computation for relatively low degree rational surfaces.},

First the surfaces are mapped to the canonical domain by a curve constrained harmonic map, where the landmark curves are straightened to line segments and their positions and inclining angles are determined intrinsically by the surface geometry and its curve landmarks. Then, the canonical domains are registered by aligning the corresponding point and straight line segments using the dynamic quasiconformal map (DQCM), which introduces the combinatorial diagonal switches to the quasiconformal optimization such that the resultant map is diffeomorphic. The end points of the source curve landmarks are mapped to their corresponding points on the target surface, while the interior points of the source curves can slide on the corresponding target curves, which provides more freedom for the surface registration than the point-based registration methods. Experiments on the real surfaces with point and curve landmarks demonstrate the efficiency, efficacy and robustness of the proposed method.},

Through the combination of a novel explicit-Invariant Energy Quadratization approach and the projection method, we develop the first full decoupling, energy stable, and second-order time-accurate numerical scheme. The introduction of two auxiliary variables and the design of two auxiliary ODEs play a vital role in obtaining the full decoupling structure while maintaining energy stability. The scheme is also linear and unconditional energy stable, and the practical implementation efficiency is also very high because it only needs to solve a few elliptic equations with constant coefficients at each time step. We strictly prove that the scheme satisfies the unconditional energy stability and give a detailed implementation process. Numerical experiments further verify the convergence rate, energy stability, and effectiveness of the developed algorithm.},

Fuzzy counts are of particular interest to many disciplines including social and behavioral sciences and are especially relevant when observed data are classified using fuzzy categories—as for socioeconomic studies, clinical evaluations, content analysis, inter-rater reliability analysis—or when imprecise observations are classified into either precise or imprecise categories—as for the analysis of ratings data or fuzzy-coded variables. In these cases, the space of count matrices is no longer defined over naturals and, consequently, the polychoric estimator cannot be used to accurately estimate latent linear correlations. The aim of this contribution is twofold. First, we illustrate a computational procedure based on generalized natural numbers for computing fuzzy frequencies. Second, we reformulate the problem of estimating latent linear correlations from fuzzy counts in the context of expectation–maximization-based maximum likelihood estimation. A simulation study and two applications are used to investigate the characteristics of the proposed method. Overall, the results show that the fuzzy EM-based polychoric estimator is more efficient to deal with imprecise count data as opposed to standard polychoric estimators that may be used in this context.},

  abstract     = {Although deep learning-based approximation algorithms have been applied very successfully to numerous problems, at the moment the reasons for their performance are not entirely understood from a mathematical point of view. Recently, estimates for the convergence of the overall error have been obtained in the situation of deep supervised learning, but with an extremely slow rate of convergence. In this note, we partially improve on these estimates. More specifically, we show that the depth of the neural network only needs to increase much slower in order to obtain the same rate of approximation. The results hold in the case of an arbitrary stochastic optimization algorithm with i.i.d. random initializations.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies variable selection using the penalized likelihood method for distributed sparse regression with large sample size n under a limited memory constraint. This is a much needed research problem to be solved in the big data era. A naive divide-and-conquer method solving this problem is to split the whole data into N parts and run each part on one of N machines, aggregate the results from all machines via averaging, and finally obtain the selected variables. However, it tends to select more noise variables, and the false discovery rate may not be well controlled. We improve it by a special designed weighted average in aggregation. Although the alternating direction method of multiplier can be used to deal with massive data in the literature, our proposed method reduces the computational burden a lot and performs better by mean square error in most cases. Theoretically, we establish asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators for the likelihood models with a diverging number of parameters. Under some regularity conditions, we establish oracle properties in the sense that our distributed estimator shares the same asymptotic efficiency as the estimator based on the full sample. Computationally, a distributed penalized likelihood algorithm is proposed to refine the results in the context of general likelihoods. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated by simulations and a real example.},

Usefulness and flexibility of the family are illustrated by reanalyzing Efron’s data pertaining to a head-and-neck cancer clinical trial. These data involve censoring and indicate unimodal hazard rate. For this distribution, some recurrence relations are established for the single and product moments of upper record values. Further, using these relations, we have obtained means, variances and covariances of upper record values from samples of sizes up to 10 for various values of the parameters and present them in figures.

In prediction problems, conformal prediction provides a useful framework to construct flexible prediction intervals based on hypothesis testing, which has been actively studied in the past decade. In view of the advantages of the relative error criterion for regression problems with positive responses, in this paper, we combine the relative error criterion (REC) with conformal prediction to develop a novel REC-based predictive inference method to construct prediction intervals for the positive response. The proposed method satisfies the finite sample global coverage guarantee and to some extent achieves the local validity.

We address the problem of identifying and estimating GAPLM when the response variable is nonignorably missing. Three types of monotone missing data mechanism are assumed, including logistic model, probit model and complementary log-log model. In this situation, likelihood based on observed data may not be identifiable. In this article, we show that the parameters of interest are identifiable under very mild conditions, and then construct the estimators of the unknown parameters and unknown functions based on a likelihood-based approach by expanding the unknown functions as a linear combination of polynomial spline functions. We establish asymptotic normality for the estimators of the parametric components. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed inference procedure performs well in many settings.

  abstract     = {In this work, we aim to develop an effective fully discrete Spectral-Galerkin numerical scheme for the multi-vesicular phase-field model of lipid vesicles with adhesion potential. The essence of the scheme is to introduce several additional auxiliary variables and design some corresponding auxiliary ODEs to reformulate the system into an equivalent form so that the explicit discretization for the nonlinear terms can also achieve unconditional energy stability. Moreover, the scheme has a full decoupling structure and can avoid calculating variable-coefficient systems. The advantage of this scheme is its high efficiency and ease of implementation, that is, only by solving two independent linear biharmonic equations with constant coefficients for each phase-field variable, the scheme can achieve the second-order accuracy in time, spectral accuracy in space, and unconditional energy stability. We strictly prove that the fully discrete energy stability that the scheme holds and give a detailed step-by-step implementation process. Further, numerical experiments are carried out in 2D and 3D to verify the convergence rate, energy stability, and effectiveness of the developed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Consider the following McKean–Vlasov SDE: $$\begin{aligned} \textrm{d} X_t=\sqrt{2}\textrm{d} W_t+\int _{{\mathbb {R}}^d}K(t,X_t-y)\mu _{X_t}(\textrm{d} y)\textrm{d} t,\ \ X_0=x, \end{aligned}$$ where $$\mu _{X_t}$$ stands for the distribution of $$X_t$$ and $$K(t,x): {{\mathbb {R}}}_+\times {{\mathbb {R}}}^d\rightarrow {{\mathbb {R}}}^d$$ is a time-dependent divergence free vector field. Under the assumption $$K\in L^q_t({\widetilde{L}}_x^p)$$ with $$\frac{d}{p}+\frac{2}{q}&lt;2$$ , where $${\widetilde{L}}^p_x$$ stands for the localized $$L^p$$ -space, we show the existence of weak solutions to the above SDE. As an application, we provide a new proof for the existence of weak solutions to 2D Navier–Stokes equations with measure as initial vorticity.},
