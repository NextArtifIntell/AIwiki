  abstract     = {This study introduced a perceptive robot system optimization method and framework designed specifically for grassland ecological monitoring, focusing on improving data collection efficiency and prediction accuracy. This study first took the grassland perceptive robot as the object to establish its kinematics and dynamics model. A component-based perceptive robot body mechanism parameter optimization method was proposed on this basis. This method included an anisotropic dynamics optimization algorithm for angles and a global dynamics optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm designs functions that target the maximum torque of the drive joint and torque fluctuations and quantitatively express the kinematic sensitivity. This study took the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the multiple objective PSO (MOPSO) as examples to solve the optimization model. The optimization results show that the optimized mechanism parameters can improve the perceptive robot’s global dynamics and kinematics performance. This study optimized the AGB (above-ground plant biomass) estimation model by optimizing the perception of the robot body. This study implemented a modular AGB estimation framework to select the most appropriate algorithm based on specific data sets and research needs. This study highlights the importance of surface vegetation cover and plant height as key predictor variables for AGB estimation. Combining multi-modal data can significantly improve the model’s prediction accuracy. The AGB estimated R2 for actual grassland trials was 0.78. The system optimization method in this study reduced the time consumption by 70% and 30% respectively compared with the traditional mowing method and the vehicle-mounted sensor method. The above models and algorithms use the componentization and modularization ideas of the robot system. Future research will explore more variables to optimize robot performance and estimation model accuracy further, promoting the development of ecological monitoring technology.},

  abstract     = {In the coal mining industry, the management of mine pressure is paramount for ensuring safety and operational efficiency. Anomalous mine pressure data can be indicative of, for example, roof fall, ground instability and rockburst, pose significant risks to facilities and humans and can lead to costly downtime. Recognizing and responding to these anomalies is crucial, however, collecting labelled data can be challenging and costly in some domains/mines. Thus, a straightforward question is whether it is feasible to utilize labelled data from relevant source domains/mines to identify mine pressure anomalies in the target domain/mine. To address such a problem, this study presents a gamma-mixture Bayesian ( $$\Gamma $$ MB) approach, by integrating the gamma mixture model ( $$\Gamma $$ MM) and Bayesian model in a transfer learning framework. The method has two main processes: domain adaptation and anomaly recognition. The former relies on the $$\Gamma $$ MM learned marginal and conditional distributions, aiming to adapt unlabelled target domain samples to source domains. The latter provides an explainable probability model to distinguish normal and abnormal target pressure data. The $$\Gamma $$ MB method demonstrates superior performance to ten machine learning approaches on synthetic data and achieves an 86.7% accuracy on average on real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of mobile Internet applications, such as social networks, gives rise to the high-speed generated complex data, which reflects people’s daily production and life. These relation/interaction data can be naturally modeled by graph and analyzed with graph computation, where the base elements of graph are vertices and edges. It is of great significance to efficiently retrieve valuable information from these data, such as mining fraudulent users over payment network with transactions, detecting malicious traffic over network flow with communications. Quantification of connection strength between vertices is essential to graph analysis and mining, such as the well-studied graph representation learning, which retrieve information from graph topology and captures the connection strength between vertices for vertex representation, forming dense vectors of vertices. The connection strength between vertices is intuitively the edge weight, which is not sufficient. There are still many indirect paths that reflect the connection between vertices. How to more essentially quantify the connection between two vertices is a significant problem, on which little effort has been made. In this paper, we proposes a novel quantification model for the connection strength between vertices over graph: the multi-order transitive enhancement model. It can integrate the multi-order connection information between vertices into directly connected edge weight, which is more efficient and explicit. The connection strength between vertices obtained by the multi-order transitive enhancement model is highly universal and scalable in graph representation learning tasks, and we achieve remarkable performance enhancement by applying this model on real-world datasets, which confirms the effectiveness of our method.},

First, every individual can be seen as a distributed unit to locate multiple non-dominated solutions. The solutions with the good diversity are generated by adopting virtual population, and the range of virtual population is adjusted by an adaptive adjustment strategy to locate more non-dominated solutions. Second, it is considered that each individual has a limited lifespan inspired by natural phenomenon. As the search area of individuals becoming adaptively smaller, the individuals with good quality are archived and they can reinitialize with a new lifespan for enhancing diversity of the search space. Then the probability selection strategy is applied in the environment selection to balance exploration and exploitation. The test results on 22 multimodal multi-objective benchmark test functions verify the superior performance of the proposed method.},

Numerous computational methods have been developed to predict a wide range of molecular properties. While recent approaches have shown promising results, no single architecture can comprehensively address all tasks, making this area persistently challenging and requiring substantial time and effort. Beyond traditional machine learning and deep learning architectures for regular data, several deep learning architectures have been designed for graph-structured data to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Utilizing graph-structured data in quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling allows models to effectively extract unique features, especially where connectivity information is crucial. In our study, we developed residual graph attention networks (ResGAT), a deep learning architecture for molecular graph-structured data. This architecture is a combination of graph attention networks and shortcut connections to address both regression and classification problems. It is also customizable to adapt to various dataset sizes, enhancing the learning process based on molecular patterns. When tested multiple times with both random and scaffold sampling strategies on nine benchmark molecular datasets, QSAR models developed using ResGAT demonstrated stability and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, the surge in global container port throughput has heightened the demand for terminal efficiency, with the container yard operations being central to the overall port performance. However, the unpredictable arrival of external trucks poses significant challenges for yard cranes which must simultaneously schedule operations for both internal and external tasks. Traditional yard crane scheduling methods often rely on outdated assumptions that fail to account for the dynamic impact of external tasks. In response, container terminals increasingly model the yard crane scheduling as an online problem. A notable advancement in online scheduling is the online rollout method, which evaluates the decisions based on the potential outcomes of their future rollout schedules rather than immediate priorities. Although this method outperforms the previous approach, it faces two main issues: the rollout simulation is time consuming, and decisions based solely on objective value of rollout schedules may not align with long-term scheduling objectives. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a two-stage adaptive rollout decision model. In the first stage, less desirable tasks are dynamically filtered out to reduce the number of rollout simulations required, while the second stage employs a genetic programming evolved evaluation function to infuse more refined forward-looking insights into the scheduling process. This approach has proven to significantly enhance yard scheduling efficiency and performance, as confirmed by experimental validation. Given the dynamic nature of yard crane operations, we believe this method could be beneficially applied to other dynamic scheduling contexts.},

However, they remain eclipsed by cutting-edge DRL algorithms in terms of time efficiency, sample complexity, and learning effectiveness. In this paper, aiming at advancing evolutionary DRL research, we develop an evolutionary policy optimization algorithm with three key technical improvements. First, we design an efficient layer-wise strategy for training DNNs through Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES) in a highly scalable manner. Second, we establish a surrogate model based on proximal performance lower bound for fitness evaluations with low sample complexity. Third, we embed a gradient-based local search technique within the evolutionary policy optimization process to further improve the learning effectiveness. The three technical innovations jointly forge a new EA for DRL method named Proximal Evolutionary Strategies (PES). Our experiments on ten continuous control problems show that PES with layer-wise training can be more computationally efficient than CMA-ES; our surrogate model can remarkably reduce the sample complexity of PES in comparison to latest EAs for DRL including CMA-ES, OpenAI-ES, and Uber-GA; PES with gradient-based local search can significantly outperform several promising DRL algorithms including TRPO, AKCTR, PPO, OpenAI-ES, and Uber-GA.},

Traditional crude oil origin determination methods require complex sample preparation, expensive instrumentation, and stable testing environments, rendering them impractical for real-time analysis at locations such as ports. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with deep learning algorithms to expedite and enhance the precision of crude oil source identification. To effectively eliminate outliers, an improved Mahalanobis distance is introduced, incorporating regularization principles and global-local concepts. This approach addresses the challenges of inverting covariance matrices in high-dimensional spectra and excludes samples with localized aberrations. Furthermore, the integration of multi-receptive fields perception, Transformer-based global information interaction, and the scSE attention mechanism has led to the development of an MG-Unet model, designed to resolve spectral peak overlap issues and capture long-range feature dependencies. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92%, demonstrating significant potential for reliable crude oil source tracing.},

We introduce an asymmetrically structured network, the Bootstrap Contrastive Domain Adaptation (BCDA), that innovatively applies contrastive learning to domain adaptation. BCDA utilizes a bootstrap clustering positive sampling strategy to ensure stable, end-to-end domain adaptation, preventing model collapse often seen in asymmetric networks. This method not only aligns domains internally through mean square loss but also enhances semantic inter-domain alignment, effectively eliminating false negatives. Our approach, BCDA, represents the first foray into non-contrastive domain adaptation and could serve as a foundational model for future studies. It shows potential to supersede contrastive domain adaptation methods in eliminating false negatives, evidenced by high-level results on three well-known domain adaptation benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multi-objective multitasking optimization (MTO) has emerged as a popular research field in evolutionary computation. By simultaneously considering multiple objectives and tasks while identifying valuable knowledge for intertask transfer, MTO aims to discover solutions that deliver optimal performance across all objectives and tasks. Nevertheless, MTO presents a substantial challenge concerning the effective transport of high-quality information between tasks. To handle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach named TL-MOMFEA (multi-objective multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on domain transfer learning) for MTO problems. TL-MOMFEA uses domain-transfer learning to adapt the population from one task to another, resulting in the reproduction of higher-quality solutions. Furthermore, TL-MOMFEA employs a model transfer strategy where population distribution rules learned from one task are succinctly summarized and applied to similar tasks. By capitalizing on the knowledge acquired from solved tasks, TL-MOMFEA effectively circumvents futile searches and accurately identifies global optimum predictions with increased precision. The effectiveness of TL-MOMFEA is evaluated through experimental studies in two widely used test suites, and experimental comparisons have shown that the proposed paradigm achieves excellent results in terms of solution quality and search efficiency, thus demonstrating its clear superiority over other state-of-the-art MTO frameworks.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of maritime emergencies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in enhancing search and rescue (SAR) operations. They help in efficiently rescuing distressed crews, strengthening maritime surveillance, and maintaining national security due to their cost-effectiveness, versatility, and effectiveness. However, the vast expanse of sea territories and the rapid changes in maritime conditions make a single SAR center insufficient for handling complex emergencies. Thus, it is vital to develop strategies for quickly deploying UAV resources from multiple SAR centers for area reconnaissance and supporting maritime rescue operations. This study introduces a graph-structured planning model for the maritime SAR path planning problem, considering multiple rescue centers (MSARPPP-MRC). It incorporates workload distribution among SAR centers and UAV operational constraints. We propose a reinforcement learning-based genetic algorithm (GA-RL) to tackle the MSARPPP-MRC problem. GA-RL uses heuristic rules to initialize the population and employs the Q-learning method to manage the progeny during each generation, including their retention, storage, or disposal. When the elite repository’s capacity is reached, a decision is made on the utilization of these members to refresh the population. Additionally, adaptive crossover and perturbation strategies are applied to develop a more effective SAR scheme. Extensive testing proves that GA-RL surpasses other algorithms in optimization efficacy and efficiency, highlighting the benefits of reinforcement learning in population management.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a new problem in an identical parallel machine environment called parallel machine scheduling with job family, release time, and mold availability constraints (PMS-JRM), which is highly challenging from the computational perspective as it extends the basic NP-hard problem $$P_m||\sum C_j$$ . The mold availability notion, first introduced in this paper, represents the availability relationship between jobs and machines. The PMS-JRM model originates from the imaging data collaborative processing in a low-earth-orbit satellite constellation under a time-varying communication network, and it can represent other multi-resource collaborative scheduling problems with discontinuous communication. An integer programming model was proposed to formulate the PMS-JRM. Due to its NP-hardness, two highly efficient heuristic solution approaches were proposed, namely a greedy algorithm with a hybrid first come first serve (HFCFS) dispatching rule (GA-HFCFS) and a Memetic Algorithm with Heterogeneous swap and Key job insertion operators (MA-HK). Extensive experiments were conducted on a set of test cases with various scales, and the results showed that GA-HFCFS outperforms three classical dispatching rules available in the literature. Taking the results of GA-HFCFS as initial solutions, MA-HK achieves optimal solutions for all small-scale cases while providing superior solutions within the same running time compared to two other competitors for large-scale cases. In particular, MA-HK yields better solutions in less running time than the state-of-the-art CPLEX solver. Additional experiments were conducted to highlight the critical ingredients of MA-HK.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based methods have become increasingly popular for solving vehicle routing problems (VRP) due to their near-optimal performance and fast inference speed. Among them, the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph representation allows for the abstraction of node topology structures and features in an encoder–decoder style. Such an approach makes it possible to solve routing problems end-to-end without needing complicated heuristic operators designed by domain experts. Existing research studies have been focusing on novel encoding and decoding structures via various neural network models to enhance the node embedding representation. Despite the sophisticated approaches being designed for VRP, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for the graph-theoretic properties inherent to routing problems. Moreover, the potential ramifications of inter-nodal interactions on the decision-making efficacy of the models have not been adequately explored. To bridge this gap, we propose an adaptive graph attention sampling with the edges fusion framework, where nodes’ embedding is determined through attention calculation from certain highly correlated neighborhoods and edges, utilizing a filtered adjacency matrix. In detail, the selections of particular neighbors and adjacency edges are led by a multi-head attention mechanism, contributing directly to the message passing and node embedding in graph attention sampling networks. Furthermore, an adaptive actor-critic algorithm with policy improvements is incorporated to expedite the training convergence. We then conduct comprehensive experiments against baseline methods on learning-based VRP tasks from different perspectives. Our proposed model outperforms the existing methods by 2.08–6.23% and shows stronger generalization ability, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on randomly generated instances and standard benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of next-generation wireless communications, especially Beyond 5G and 6G communication systems, will be handled by artificial intelligence-based management paradigms. The joint selection of routes and functional split levels involves critical decisions that network infrastructure providers need to make to support requests from virtual Mobile Network Operators (vMNOs). These decisions comprise the assignment and configuration of physical network resources, which must comply with the specific quality of service restrictions of each vMNO request. Recent work defined a detailed mathematical model for this complex challenge, its formulation as a constrained, discrete optimization problem, and the first algorithmic approaches. It was also found that an evolutionary algorithm delivers higher-quality solutions than an ad-hoc heuristic, and faster running times compared to a well-known commercial solver. This paper introduces a memetic algorithm that exploits the strengths of the former evolutionary method while incorporating several key innovations: a domain-specific recombination operator; a specialized repairing procedure; an enhanced fitness evaluation scheme; and a multiobjective archiving strategy that preserves promising solution trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and behavior of this proposal, as well as the contribution of each specific design component. The results highlight that our memetic algorithm consistently outperforms previous approaches from the literature, providing better trade-offs in terms of solution quality and the rate at which vMNO requests are successfully fulfilled.},

  abstract     = {Semantically segmented aerial laser scanning (ALS) pointcloud is crucial for remote sensing applications, offering advantages over aerial images in describing complex topography of vegetation-covered areas due to its ability to penetrate through vegetation. While many ALS pointcloud segmentation methods emphasize the importance of color information for accurate segmentation and colorize the ALS pointcloud with aerial images, they often overlook the fact that some points in vegetation-covered areas are occluded and cannot be observed in aerial images. Consequently, these methods may assign inaccurate colors to these points, resulting in degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HHGL) algorithm. HHGL tackles the problem by treating the colors of occluded points (referred to as “color-missing points”) as missing values and compensating for them based on the local and global geometric relationships among color-missing points and color-observed points. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first models the local geometric relationships as a heterogeneous graph, which aggregates the features of adjacent color-observed points to make up for the missing colors. Additionally, the global geometric relationships are represented as a hierarchical structure, refining the aggregated features and capturing long-range dependencies among color-missing points to facilitate segmentation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed HHGL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Oriented object detection has garnered significant attention for its broad applications in remote sensing image processing. Most oriented detectors perform dense predictions on a set of predefined anchors to generate oriented bounding boxes, where these anchors require classification (cls) and localization (loc) labels for detector training. Recent advancements in label assignment utilize the overall quality score of cls and loc predictions to determine positive and negative samples for each oriented object. However, these methods typically establish the overall quality score by assigning fixed weights to cls and loc quality scores. This approach may not be optimal, as fixed weights fail to dynamically balance cls and loc performance during model optimization, thereby constraining detection efficacy. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a Dynamic Weighting Label Assignment (DWLA) algorithm. DWLA dynamically adjusts the weights of individual quality scores based on the current model state to continuously balance cls and loc performance. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of unreliable predictions and achieve more stable training, this paper proposes a level-wise positive sample selection scheme and an object-adaptive scheme for constructing initial candidates of positive samples, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on the DOTA and UCAS-AOD datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed DWLA.},

Using a proposed surrogate preference function, F-Chain achieves consistent evaluations across multiple doctors and data sources. We introduce an indicator selection strategy that integrates data information, gradually adding relevant indicators. Additionally, we develop a missingness-incorporated decision tree for predicting outcomes on multi-source datasets with substantial missing values.

  abstract     = {Driver profiling is a widely used tool in fleet management and driver-specific insurance because it differentiates drivers based on their driving behaviors, such as aggressive and non-aggressive, which correspond to different levels of driving risk. However, most existing driver profiling methods require all drivers to drive on the same predefined route or type of roads, simply to make sure their driving behaviors are comparable. This premise makes these methods not be able to profile drivers who drive on arbitrary roads, which constitute the real-world scenarios for most drivers. To enable the profiling of drivers using their naturalistic driving data, i.e., driving trajectories recorded while they were driving on arbitrary roads at their own free will, in this paper, we propose a novel method named cLustering rOads And Drivers Successively (LOADS). Specifically, LOADS first categorizes the roads into different types using the extracted characteristics of all drivers driving on the respective roads. It then groups drivers into different clusters to obtain their profile labels (e.g., aggressive or non-aggressive) using the extracted driving characteristics on each road type. We conduct extensive experiments using two real-world driving trajectory datasets comprising thousands of driving trajectories of hundreds of drivers. Statistical analysis results indicate that the driver groups identified by LOADS have significantly different driving styles. To the best of our knowledge, LOADS is the first method that focuses on profiling drivers who drive on arbitrary roads, showing a great potential to enable real-world driver profiling applications.},

  abstract     = {The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) holds significant importance in operational research as it deals with optimizing the delivery routes of vehicles to efficiently serve a set of customers. One well-known variant of VRP is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where the objective is to determine a set of routes for a fleet of identical vehicles, starting and ending at a central depot, while respecting capacity constraints and minimizing total distance traveled. This paper introduces a novel hybrid metaheuristic, named Dynamic Population Island GA and Hybrid Genetic Search (DPIGA-HGS), to tackle the CVRP. DPIGA-HGS combines the strengths of the proposed Dynamic Population Island GA (DPIGA) and Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) as its local search engine within each island. DPIGA is a specialized variant of Island Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that allows islands to lose their populations over time. In the work herein, DPIGA-HGS is shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. It achieves higher quality solutions, leading to a notable increase in the number of Best-Known Solutions (BKS) found and reduced average and maximum solution gaps compared to BKS. The algorithm&#39;s effectiveness is demonstrated through several experiments on diverse benchmark instances, including classical benchmarks (Uchoa, CMT, and Golden) and real-world application instances (LoggiBUD).},

  abstract     = {To address the issues of slow and premature convergence of artificial bee colony (ABC) for handling complex multimodal optimization problems, this paper proposes a multi-role steered variable dimensionality perturbation ABC called MrABC-vdp. MrABC-vdp assigns the nectar sources four distinct roles based on their quality at each iteration. To strike the global exploration and local exploitation equilibrium of the solution space, the bee colony&#39;s search behavior is tightly controlled and corrected based on the synergistic relationship established between various preference search equations under multi-role nectar source guidance and the employed bee, onlooker bee, and scout bee phases. To achieve the dynamic trade-off of the global exploration speed and local convergence accuracy of the bee colony across the iteration, a variable dimensionality perturbation is imposed on the candidate nectar sources by a simulated binary crossover operator with time-varying crossover probability. Experimental results on the CEC 2017 multimodal benchmarks show that the proposed MrABC-vdp has a significant performance advantage and strong robustness versus nine advanced homogenous and heterogenous swarm-inspired intelligent algorithms.},

The difficulty lies in locating multiple equivalent PSs while ensuring a well-converged and well-distributed PF. To address this, a neighborhood-assisted reproduction strategy is proposed. Through interactions with non-dominated solutions, the generated offspring could spread out along the PF, while ineractions with neighbors could improve the convergence ability. Importantly, individuals can participate in multiple neighborhoods, reducing the computational burden. Additionally, a neighborhood-assisted environmental selection strategy is prposed to encourage exploration of diverse solution regions, ensuring a balanced distribution of the population and preservation of multiple PSs. Comparative experiments are implemented on the CEC 2019 MMOPs test suite, and the superior performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes two cooperative constraint handling techniques that use an external archive. First, two constraint handling techniques, i.e., the penalty function and the constrained dominance principle, are embedded in multi-objective optimization algorithms and work cooperatively on two populations to increase population diversity. Then, an external archive is designed to preserve high-quality solutions that strike a good balance between objectives, values, and constraints throughout the evolution process. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and seven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms are used to compare three test suites and ten real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve competitive performance in solving various constrained multi-objective problems. Additionally, the results show that cooperative constraint handling techniques are more robust than single constraint handling methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) have attracted tremendous interest and have been thoroughly developed because of their excellent performance in multi/many-objective optimization problems. In general, MOEA/D methods use a set of uniformly distributed weight vectors to decompose a multiobjective problem into multiple single-objective subproblems and solve them cooperatively. However, a set of uniformly distributed weight vectors tends to perform well over smooth, continuous, and well-spread Pareto fronts (PFs) but poorly over irregular PFs, such as discontinuous PFs, degenerate PFs and PFs with long peaks and tails. Many weight vector adjustment strategies have been proposed to alleviate this issue. In this article, we propose a novel weight grouping strategy and an adaptive adjustment strategy. Specifically, we dynamically divide the weight vectors into three groups, normal weight vectors, invalid weight vectors and crowded weight vectors; then, the invalid weight vectors and crowded weight vectors are deleted in order, and new weight vectors are added according to the external archived individuals. The proposed method can be combined with a penalty-based boundary intersection approach or the Tchebycheff aggregation function. In the experiments, we compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms in several many-objective problem test instances with PFs of varying degrees of difficulty, and the results show that the proposed algorithm performs best on most test instances, which further demonstrates that it outperforms all the comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks, specifically deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have been highly successful in machine learning and computer vision, but a significant challenge when using these networks is choosing the right hyperparameters. As the number of layers in the network increases, the search space also becomes larger. To overcome this issue, researchers in deep learning have suggested using deep compression techniques to decrease memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we present a new approach for compressing deep CNNs by combining filter and channel pruning methods based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). This method involves eliminating filters and channels in order to decrease the number of parameters and computational complexity of the model. Additionally, we propose a bi-level optimization problem that interacts between the hyperparameters of the convolution layer. Bi-level optimization problems are known to be difficult as they involve two levels of optimization tasks, where only the optimal solutions to the lower-level problem are considered as feasible candidates for the upper-level problem. In this work, the upper-level problem is represented by a set of filters to be pruned in order to minimize the number of selected filters, while the lower-level problem is represented by a set of channels to be pruned in order to minimize the number of selected channels per filter. Our research has focused on developing a new method for solving bi-level problems, which we have named Bi-CNN-Pruning. To achieve this, we have adopted the Co-Evolutionary Migration-Based Algorithm (CEMBA) as our search engine. The Bi-CNN-Pruning method is then evaluated using image classification benchmarks on well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that our bi-level proposal outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, and we provide a detailed analysis of the results using commonly employed performance metrics.},

An effective infill sampling strategy is critical in surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary optimization to assist evolutionary algorithms in identifying the optimal non-dominated solutions. This paper proposes a Kriging-assisted many-objective optimization algorithm guided by two infill sampling criteria to self-adaptively select two new solutions for expensive objective function evaluations to improve history models. The first uncertainty-based criterion selects the solution for expensive function evaluations with the maximum approximation uncertainty to improve the chance of discovering the optimal region. The approximation uncertainty of a solution is the weighted sum of approximation uncertainties on all objectives. The other indicator-based criterion selects the solution with the best indicator value to accelerate exploiting the non-dominated optimal solutions. The indicator of an individual is defined by the convergence-based and crowding-based distances in the objective space. Finally, two multi-objective test suites, DTLZ and MaF, and three real-world applications are applied to test the performance of the proposed method and four compared classical surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more competitive on most optimization problems.},

Currently, most existing parameter pruning methods adopt equal pruning rates across all layers. Different from previous methods, this paper focuses on the optimal combination of each layer’s pruning rates within a given pruning rate of the whole model. Genetic algorithm is used to determine the pruning rate for each layer. It’s worth noting that while the pruning rate for individual layers may vary, the average pruning rate across all layers does not exceed the given pruning rate. Experimental validation is conducted on CIFAR10 and ImageNet ILSVRC2012 datasets using VGGNet and ResNet architectures. The results show that the accuracy loss and the FLOPs of the pruned model using our method are superior to those pruned using previous methods.},

A portfolio means investing in a wide variety of asset types and classes for a risk-mitigation strategy by the investor. In this paper, factor analysis and cluster algorithm are used to screen stocks and an improved differential evolution algorithm for solving portfolio optimization model is proposed. By comprehensively analyzing the stock data with factor analysis and k-means clustering algorithm, it has found that important factors have important effect on stock price movement, and finally 10 stocks are selected with investment value. Besides, a Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) model is constructed, which takes into account both the cost function and the diversification constraint. Finally, a second-order memetic differential evolution (SOMDE) algorithm is presented for solving the proposed model. The experiments show that the proposed SOMDE algorithm is valid for solving the Mean-CVaR model and that factor analysis for stock selection can benefit portfolio with higher return and less risk greatly.},

In TLDEPSO, the population is divided into top-level particles and ordinary particles according to fitness, and each iteration is divided into two stages to be executed. For the first stage, a particle modification method based on gene editing technology is proposed and applied to top-level particles to improve the search direction of the population and explore the problem space better. For other ordinary particles in the population, the learning strategy of the canonical ring neighborhood topology PSO is used to update the velocity and the position to maintain the diversity of the population. For the second stage, a top-level neighborhood exploration mechanism is proposed for top-level particles to accelerate the algorithm’s convergence. In addition, an adaptive dynamic adjustment mechanism for the parameters of acceleration coefficient, inertia coefficient and the number of top-level particles is proposed to balance better the global exploration and local exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. On the latest CEC2022 test benchmark, comparison and statistical analysis with seven advanced PSO variants and three CEC competition top algorithms demonstrate TLDEPSO’s superior performance in solving functional problems with different fitness landscapes.},
