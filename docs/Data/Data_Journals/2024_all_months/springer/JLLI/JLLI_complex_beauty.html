  abstract     = {Lewis (Noûs 13:455–476, 1979) claimed that branching-time(-like) models can be derived from his sphere models. However, he did not present any specific construction of branching-time(-like) models from his sphere models formally. Meanwhile, Hosokawa (in: Modern logic of modality and its philosophical range: counterfactuals, Gettier problem, and information flow, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 2018) presented a logico-mathematically strict manner in which sphere models can be reconstructed from branching-time models. Subsequently, Hosokawa (J Logic Lang Inf 32:677–706, 2023) presented a proof-theoretically refined version of hybrid tense logic for a certain type of conditionals, which is referred to as hybrid tense logic for temporal conditionals ( $$\textbf{HTL}_{TC}$$ ). In this paper, we interpret a hybrid version $${\textbf{V}}_{\mathcal {HC(@, \downarrow )}}$$ of Lewis’s counterfactual logic $${\textbf{V}}$$ into $$\textbf{HTL}_{TC}$$ , and then prove that $$\textbf{HTL}_{TC}$$ is more expressive than $${\textbf{V}}_{\mathcal {HC(@, \downarrow )}}$$ on the class of temporal sphere models, i.e., sphere models derived from a type of branching-time models.},

Our main contribution can be formulated as a combination of the theory of opinion dynamics with the theory of conceptual spaces. This combination, in turn, leads us to propose a new model for the time evolution of conceptual spaces. To achieve this goal, we propose some extension of the multidimensional opinion dynamics model of Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo and Friedkin to opinions with values in Hilbert spaces.},

  abstract     = {Arithmetical texts involving division are governed by conventions that avoid the risk of problems to do with division by zero (DbZ). A model for elementary arithmetic texts is given, and with the help of many examples and counter examples a partial description of what may be called traditional conventions on DbZ is explored. We introduce the informal notions of legal and illegal texts to analyse these conventions. First, we show that the legality of a text is algorithmically undecidable. As a consequence, we know that there is no simple sound and complete set of guidelines to determine unambiguously how DbZ is to be avoided. We argue that these observations call for further explorations of mathematical conventions. We propose a method using logics to progress the analysis of legality versus illegality: arithmetical texts in a model can be transformed into logical formulae over special total algebras that are able to approximate partiality but in a total world. The algebras we use are called common meadows. Our dive into informal mathematical practice using formal methods opens up questions about DbZ which we address in conclusion.},

To explain this puzzling instance of the projection problem, defenders of a Strawson-inspired view have proposed various ad hoc ambiguities. I develop a version of Segmented Discourse Representation Theory that explains the puzzling presupposition-cancelling phenomenon relying only on independently motivated pragmatic processes. Appealing to Kripke’s “test” for the adequacy of ambiguity motivating counterexamples, I argue that my analysis is to be preferred over proposals that posit ad hoc ambiguities. Two key insights of my analysis are, first, that the “cancellation” of presuppositions in presupposition denials depends upon the illocutionary effects of rejection and correction, and, second, that the process of presupposition accommodation often involves the speaker performing an ancillary sort of speech act, viz. the speech act of presupposing.},

Similar to the cut rule in Gentzen’s LK for classical logic, these rules are admissible in cut-free LK. A falsification-aware single-succedent Gentzen-style sequent calculus fsCL for classical logic is formalized based on the proposed framework. The calculus fsCL is obtained from the existing falsification-aware single-succedent Gentzen-style sequent calculus GN4 for Nelson’s paradefinite (or paraconsistent) four-valued logic N4 by adding the rules of explosion and excluded middle. A falsification-aware single-succedent Gentzen-style sequent calculus GN3 for Nelson’s paracomplete three-valued logic N3 is also obtained from GN4 by adding the rule of explosion.

Cresswell argued that a first-order modal language can reach the expressive power of natural-language modal discourse only if we give to the formal language a semantics with indices containing infinite possible worlds and we add to it an infinite collection of operators $${{\varvec{actually}}}_n$$ and $$ Ref _n$$ which store and retrieve worlds. In the fourth chapter of the book, Cresswell gave a proof that the resulting intensional language, which he called $${\mathscr {L}}^*$$ , is as expressive as an extensional variant of it, called $${\mathscr {L}}$$ , which has full quantification over worlds. In both linguistics and philosophy, Cresswell’s book has been viewed as offering a compelling argument for preferring extensional systems in the study of natural language. In this paper, after providing a model-theoretic definition of the relation being as expressive as that can be applied to Cresswell’s languages $${\mathscr {L}}$$ and $${\mathscr {L}}^*$$ , we show that the intensional language $${\mathscr {L}}^*$$ is not as expressive as the extensional language $${\mathscr {L}}$$ . This result, we claim, undermines Cresswell’s argument to the effect that English modal discourse has the power of explicit quantification over worlds. Additionally, we show that $${\mathscr {L}}^*$$ does become as expressive as $${\mathscr {L}}$$ when we add Cresswell’s operator of universal modality $$\square $$ to $${\mathscr {L}}^*$$ , which provides an extra amount of expressive power. Recently, I. Yanovich has advocated a view that is similar to ours in important respects. At the end of the paper we offer a short discussion of his formalism.},

This shows two gaps in the current dataset landscape, which we propose to address with one dataset that has been developed in argumentative writing research as well as a new one building on syllogistic logic. Throughout, we also explore the promises of ChatGPT. Our results show that our new datasets do pose a challenge to existing methods and models, including ChatGPT, and that tackling this challenge via fine-tuning yields only partly satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {The transformers that drive chatbots and other AI systems constitute large language models (LLMs). These are currently the focus of a lively discussion in both the scientific literature and the popular media. This discussion ranges from hyperbolic claims that attribute general intelligence and sentience to LLMs, to the skeptical view that these devices are no more than “stochastic parrots”. I present an overview of some of the weak arguments that have been presented against LLMs, and I consider several of the more compelling criticisms of these devices. The former significantly underestimate the capacity of transformers to achieve subtle inductive inferences required for high levels of performance on complex, cognitively significant tasks. In some instances, these arguments misconstrue the nature of deep learning. The latter criticisms identify significant limitations in the way in which transformers learn and represent patterns in data. They also point out important differences between the procedures through which deep neural networks and humans acquire knowledge of natural language. It is necessary to look carefully at both sets of arguments in order to achieve a balanced assessment of the potential and the limitations of LLMs.},
