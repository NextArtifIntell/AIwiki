In this paper we study its ergodicity in the remaining cases. For $n$ even and $n \neq 8, 134$ , we show that: In the three dimensions $n=7,8,134$ , the respective pinching bounds that we need in order to prove ergodicity are 0.4962..., 0.6212..., and 0.5788.... This is a significant improvement over the previously known results and a step forward towards solving a long-standing conjecture of Brin asserting that 0.25-pinched even-dimensional manifolds have an ergodic frame flow.},

We establish a numerical criterion for $M$ to have a free direct summand over $A$ of positive rank. It is in terms of the lengths of $\Psi _{A}(M)$ and the torsion part of $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^{2}$ . It generalizes results of Wiles, Lenstra, and Diamond, that deal with the case when the codimension of $\mathfrak{p}$ is zero. Number theoretic applications include integral (non-minimal) $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in situations of positive defect conditional on certain standard conjectures. Here $R$ is a deformation ring parametrizing certain Galois representations and $\mathbb{T}$ is a Hecke algebra. An example of a positive defect situation is that of proving modularity lifting for 2-dimensional $\ell $ -adic Galois representations over an imaginary quadratic field. The proofs combine our commutative algebra results with a generalization due to Calegari and Geraghty of the patching method of Wiles and Taylor–Wiles and level raising arguments that go back to Ribet. The results provide new evidence in favor of the intriguing, and as yet fledgling, torsion analog of the classical Langlands correspondence. We also prove unconditional integral $R=\mathbb{T}$ results for Hecke algebras $\mathbb{T}$ acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves over ℚ. This leads to a torsion Jacquet–Langlands correspondence comparing integral Hecke algebras acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves and modular curves. In this case the cohomology has abundant torsion and so our correspondence cannot be deduced by means of the classical Jacquet–Langlands correspondence.},

With this new strategy, we are able to confirm the already-known results of the existence of both hyperbolic and parabolic solutions, and we prove for the first time the existence of hyperbolic-parabolic solutions for any prescribed asymptotic expansion in a suitable class.

Anal. 1(4):321–374, 1991) and state a curvature condition for Hörmander-type oscillatory integral operators, which we call Bourgain’s condition. This condition is notably satisfied by the phase functions for the Fourier restriction problem and the Bochner-Riesz problem. We conjecture that for Hörmander-type oscillatory integral operators satisfying Bourgain’s condition, they satisfy the same $L^{p}$ bounds as in the Fourier Restriction Conjecture. To support our conjecture, we show that whenever Bourgain’s condition fails, then the $L^{\infty } \to L^{q}$ boundedness always fails for some $q= q(n) &gt; \frac{2n}{n-1}$ , extending Bourgain’s three-dimensional result (Geom. Funct. Anal. 1(4):321–374, 1991). On the other hand, if Bourgain’s condition holds, then we prove $L^{p}$ bounds for Hörmander-type oscillatory integral operators for a range of $p$ that extends the currently best-known range for the Fourier restriction conjecture in high dimensions, given by Hickman and Zahl (A note on Fourier restriction and nested polynomial wolff axioms, 2020, arXiv: 2010.02251 ).

  abstract     = {In many applied problems one seeks to identify and count the critical points of a particular eigenvalue of a smooth parametric family of self-adjoint matrices, with the parameter space often being known and simple, such as a torus. Among particular settings where such a question arises are the Floquet–Bloch decomposition of periodic Schrödinger operators, topology of potential energy surfaces in quantum chemistry, spectral optimization problems such as minimal spectral partitions of manifolds, as well as nodal statistics of graph eigenfunctions. In contrast to the classical Morse theory dealing with smooth functions, the eigenvalues of families of self-adjoint matrices are not smooth at the points corresponding to repeated eigenvalues (called, depending on the application and on the dimension of the parameter space, the diabolical/Dirac/Weyl points or the conical intersections). This work develops a procedure for associating a Morse polynomial to a point of eigenvalue multiplicity; it utilizes the assumptions of smoothness and self-adjointness of the family to provide concrete answers. In particular, we define the notions of non-degenerate topologically critical point and generalized Morse family, establish that generalized Morse families are generic in an appropriate sense, establish a differential first-order conditions for criticality, as well as compute the local contribution of a topologically critical point to the Morse polynomial. Remarkably, the non-smooth contribution to the Morse polynomial turns out to depend only on the size of the eigenvalue multiplicity and the relative position of the eigenvalue of interest and not on the particulars of the operator family; it is expressed in terms of the homologies of Grassmannians.},

  abstract     = {For various 2-Calabi–Yau categories $\mathscr{C}$ for which the classical stack of objects $\mathfrak{M}$ has a good moduli space $p\colon \mathfrak{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ , we establish purity of the mixed Hodge module complex $p_{!}\underline{{\mathbb{Q}}}_{{\mathfrak {M}}}$ . We do this by using formality in 2CY categories, along with étale neighbourhood theorems for stacks, to prove that the morphism $p$ is modelled étale-locally by the semisimplification morphism from the stack of modules of a preprojective algebra. Via the integrality theorem in cohomological Donaldson–Thomas theory we then prove purity of $p_{!}\underline{{\mathbb{Q}}}_{{\mathfrak {M}}}$ . It follows that the Beilinson–Bernstein–Deligne–Gabber decomposition theorem for the constant sheaf holds for the morphism $p$ , despite the possibly singular and stacky nature of ${\mathfrak {M}}$ , and the fact that $p$ is not proper. We use this to define cuspidal cohomology for ${\mathfrak {M}}$ , which conjecturally provides a complete space of generators for the BPS algebra associated to $\mathscr{C}$ . We prove purity of the Borel–Moore homology of the moduli stack $\mathfrak{M}$ , provided its good moduli space ℳ is projective, or admits a suitable contracting ${\mathbb{C}}^{*}$ -action. In particular, when $\mathfrak{M}$ is the moduli stack of Gieseker semistable sheaves on a K3 surface, this proves a conjecture of Halpern-Leistner. We use these results to moreover prove purity for several stacks of coherent sheaves that do not admit a good moduli space. Without the usual assumption that $r$ and $d$ are coprime, we prove that the Borel–Moore homology of the stack of semistable degree $d$ rank $r$ Higgs sheaves is pure and carries a perverse filtration with respect to the Hitchin base, generalising the usual perverse filtration for the Hitchin system to the case of singular stacks of Higgs sheaves.},

Our first main result says that a coarse map from a finitely presented one-ended group to $F\wr H$ must land at bounded distance from a left coset of $H$ . Our second main result, building on the later, is a very restrictive description of quasi-isometries between two lamplighter groups on finitely presented one-ended groups. Third, we obtain a complete classification of these groups up to quasi-isometry. More precisely, given two finite groups $F_{1}$ , $F_{2}$ and two finitely presented one-ended groups $H_{1}$ , $H_{2}$ , we show that $F_{1} \wr H_{1}$ and $F_{2} \wr H_{2}$ are quasi-isometric if and only if either (i) $H_{1}$ , $H_{2}$ are non-amenable quasi-isometric groups and $|F_{1}|$ , $|F_{2}|$ have the same prime divisors, or (ii) $H_{1}$ , $H_{2}$ are amenable, $|F_{1}|=k^{n_{1}}$ and $|F_{2}|=k^{n_{2}}$ for some $k,n_{1},n_{2} \geq 1$ , and there exists a quasi- $(n_{2}/n_{1})$ -to-one quasi-isometry $H_{1} \to H_{2}$ . This can be seen as far reaching extension of a celebrated work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte who treated the case of $H=\mathbb{Z}$ . Our approach is however fundamentally different, as it crucially exploits the assumption that $H$ is one-ended. Our central tool is a new geometric interpretation of lamplighter groups involving natural families of quasi-median spaces.},

In particular, it implies that the good moduli space parametrizing $n$ -dimensional K-polystable smooth Fano varieties of volume $v$ has klt type singularities. As a corresponding result regarding global geometry, we show that quotients of Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox rings are Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox ring. This in turn applies to show that projective GIT-quotients of varieties of Fano type are of Fano type; in particular, projective moduli spaces of semistable quiver representations are of Fano type.},

This is carried out for a class of quasi-linear parabolic PDEs driven by noise in the full singular but renormalizable range. We assume a spectral gap inequality on the (not necessarily Gaussian) noise ensemble. The resulting control on the variance of the model naturally complements its vanishing expectation arising from the BPHZ-choice of renormalization. We capture the gain in regularity on the level of the Malliavin derivative of the model by describing it as a modelled distribution. Symmetry is an important guiding principle and built-in on the level of the renormalization Ansatz. Our approach is analytic and top-down rather than combinatorial and bottom-up.},

  abstract     = {A subset $A$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if there is no solution to $a=bc$ with $a,b,c$ all in $A$ . It is easy to see that the largest product-free subset of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ is obtained by taking the set of all odd permutations, i.e. $S_{n} \backslash A_{n}$ , where $A_{n}$ is the alternating group. In 1985 Babai and Sós (Eur. J. Comb. 6(2):101–114, 1985) conjectured that the group $A_{n}$ also contains a product-free set of constant density. This conjecture was refuted by Gowers (whose result was subsequently improved by Eberhard), still leaving the long-standing problem of determining the largest product-free subset of $A_{n}$ wide open. We solve this problem for large $n$ , showing that the maximum size is achieved by the previously conjectured extremal examples, namely families of the form $\left \{ \pi :\,\pi (x)\in I, \pi (I)\cap I=\varnothing \right \} $ and their inverses. Moreover, we show that the maximum size is only achieved by these extremal examples, and we have stability: any product-free subset of $A_{n}$ of nearly maximum size is structurally close to an extremal example. Our proof uses a combination of tools from Combinatorics and Non-abelian Fourier Analysis, including a crucial new ingredient exploiting some recent theory developed by Filmus, Kindler, Lifshitz and Minzer for global hypercontractivity on the symmetric group.},

For an open set of compressive and generic $H^{7}$ initial data, we construct unique $H^{7}$ solutions to the Euler equations in the maximal spacetime region below a given time-slice, beyond the time of the first singularity; at any point in this spacetime, the solution can be smoothly and uniquely computed by tracing both the fast and slow acoustic characteristic surfaces backward-in-time, until reaching the Cauchy data prescribed along the initial time-slice. The future temporal boundary of this spacetime region is a singular hypersurface, containing the union of three sets: first, a co-dimension-2 surface of “first singularities” called the pre-shock; second, a downstream hypersurface called the singular set emanating from the pre-shock, on which the Euler solution experiences a continuum of gradient catastrophes; third, an upstream hypersurface consisting of a Cauchy horizon emanating from the pre-shock, which the Euler solution cannot reach. We develop a new geometric framework for the description of the acoustic characteristic surfaces which is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework, and combine this with a new type of differentiated Riemann variables which are linear combinations of gradients of velocity, sound speed, and the curvature of the fast acoustic characteristic surfaces. With these new variables, we establish uniform $H^{7}$ Sobolev bounds for solutions to the Euler equations without derivative loss and with optimal regularity.},

Using gauge covariance of the deterministic YMH flow, we extend gauge equivalence ∼ to $\mathcal{S}$ and thus define a quotient space of “gauge orbits” $\mathfrak {O}$ . We use the theory of regularity structures to prove local in time solutions to the renormalised stochastic YMH flow. Moreover, by leveraging symmetry arguments in the small noise limit, we show that there is a unique choice of renormalisation counterterms such that these solutions are gauge covariant in law. This allows us to define a canonical Markov process on $\mathfrak {O}$ (up to a potential finite time blow-up) associated to the stochastic YMH flow.},

It arises as the $q\to 0$ limit of the $q$ -state random cluster model with $p=\beta q$ . We prove that in dimensions $d\geqslant 3$ the arboreal gas undergoes a percolation phase transition. This contrasts with the case of $d=2$ where no percolation transition occurs. The starting point for our analysis is an exact relationship between the arboreal gas and a non-linear sigma model with target space the fermionic hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$ . This latter model can be thought of as the 0-state Potts model, with the arboreal gas being its random cluster representation. Unlike the standard Potts models, the $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$ model has continuous symmetries. By combining a renormalisation group analysis with Ward identities we prove that this symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures. In terms of the arboreal gas, this symmetry breaking translates into the existence of infinite trees in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis also establishes massless free field correlations at low temperatures and the existence of a macroscopic tree on finite tori.},

We answer all such questions in terms of the group cohomology of finite groups. We prove non-existence with topological results generalizing the theory of semicharacteristics. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the (profinite completion of) the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold in the Dunfield-Thurston model of random Heegaard splittings as the genus goes to infinity. We believe this is the first construction of a new distribution of random groups from its moments.},

  abstract     = {For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with low viscosity $\nu &gt;0$ , we consider the Cauchy problem with initial vorticity $\omega _{0}$ that represents an infinitely thin vortex filament of arbitrary given strength $\Gamma $ supported on a circle. The vorticity field $\omega (x,t)$ of the solution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of thickness $\sqrt{\nu t}$ that is translated along its symmetry axis due to self-induction, an effect anticipated by Helmholtz in 1858 and quantified by Kelvin in 1867. For small viscosities, we show that $\omega (x,t)$ is well-approximated on a large time interval by $\omega _{\mathrm {lin}}(x-a(t),t)$ , where $\omega _{\mathrm {lin}}(\cdot ,t)=\exp (\nu t\Delta )\omega _{0}$ is the solution of the heat equation with initial data $\omega _{0}$ , and $\dot{a}(t)$ is the instantaneous velocity given by Kelvin’s formula. This gives a rigorous justification of the binormal motion for circular vortex filaments in weakly viscous fluids. The proof relies on the construction of a precise approximate solution, using a perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. To verify the stability of this approximation, one needs to rule out potential instabilities coming from very large advection terms in the linearized operator. This is done by adapting V. I. Arnold’s geometric stability methods developed in the inviscid case $\nu =0$ to the slightly viscous situation. It turns out that although the geometric structures behind Arnold’s approach are no longer preserved by the equation for $\nu &gt; 0$ , the relevant quadratic forms behave well on larger subspaces than those originally used in Arnold’s theory and interact favorably with the viscous terms.},

Many refinements have been obtained, including strong asymptotic freeness of random unitaries and strong asymptotic freeness of random permutations acting on the orthogonal of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector. In this paper, we consider a new matrix unitary model appearing naturally from representation theory of compact groups. We fix a nontrivial signature $\rho $ , i.e. two finite sequences of non-increasing natural numbers, and for $n$ large enough, consider the irreducible representation $V_{n,\rho }$ of $\mathbb{U}_{n}$ associated with the signature $\rho $ . We consider the quotient $\mathbb{U}_{n,\rho }$ of $\mathbb{U}_{n}$ viewed as a matrix subgroup of $\mathbb{U}(V_{n,\rho })$ , and show that strong asymptotic freeness holds in this generalized context when drawing independent copies of the Haar measure. We also obtain the orthogonal variant of this result. Thanks to classical results in representation theory, this result is closely related to strong asymptotic freeness for tensors, which we establish as a preliminary. To achieve this result, we need to develop four new tools, each of independent theoretical interest: (i) a centered Weingarten calculus and uniform estimates thereof, (ii) a systematic and uniform comparison of Gaussian moments and unitary moments of matrices, (iii) a generalized and simplified operator-valued non-backtracking theory in a general $C^{*}$ -algebra, and finally, (iv) combinatorics of tensor moment matrices.},

  abstract     = {The totally nonnegative flag variety was introduced by Lusztig. It has enriched combinatorial, geometric, and Lie-theoretic structures. In this paper, we introduce a (new) $J$ -total positivity on the full flag variety of an arbitrary Kac-Moody group, generalizing the (ordinary) total positivity. We show that the $J$ -totally nonnegative flag variety has a cellular decomposition into totally positive $J$ -Richardson varieties. Moreover, each totally positive $J$ -Richardson variety admits a favorable decomposition, called a product structure. Combined with the generalized Poincare conjecture, we prove that the closure of each totally positive $J$ -Richardson variety is a regular CW complex homeomorphic to a closed ball. Moreover, the $J$ -total positivity on the full flag provides a model for the (ordinary) totally nonnegative partial flag variety. As a consequence, we prove that the closure of each (ordinary) totally positive Richardson variety is a regular CW complex homeomorphic to a closed ball, confirming conjectures of Galashin, Karp and Lam in (Adv. Math. 351:614–620, 2019). We also show that the link of the totally nonnegative part of $U^{-}$ for any Kac-Moody group forms a regular CW complex. This generalizes the result of Hersh (Invent.

  abstract     = {A heterodimensional cycle is an invariant set of a dynamical system consisting of two hyperbolic periodic orbits with different dimensions of their unstable manifolds and a pair of orbits that connect them. For systems which are at least $C^{2}$ , we show that bifurcations of a coindex-1 heterodimensional cycle within a generic 2-parameter family create robust heterodimensional dynamics, i.e., a pair of non-trivial hyperbolic basic sets with different numbers of positive Lyapunov exponents, such that the unstable manifold of each of the sets intersects the stable manifold of the second set and these intersections persist for an open set of parameter values. We also give a solution to the so-called local stabilization problem of coindex-1 heterodimensional cycles in any regularity class $r=2,\ldots ,\infty ,\omega $ . The results are based on the observation that arithmetic properties of moduli of topological conjugacy of systems with heterodimensional cycles determine the emergence of Bonatti-Díaz blenders.},

This result is the hyperbolic counterpart to seminal works on the parabolic $\Phi ^{4}_{3}$ -model by Hairer (Invent. Math. 198(2):269–504, 2014) and Hairer-Matetski (Ann. Probab. 46(3):1651–1709, 2018). The heart of the matter lies in establishing local in time existence and uniqueness of solutions on the statistical ensemble, which is achieved by using a para-controlled ansatz for the solution, the analytical framework of the random tensor theory, and the combinatorial molecule estimates. The singularity of the Gibbs measure with respect to the Gaussian free field brings out a new caloric representation of the Gibbs measure and a synergy between the parabolic and hyperbolic theories embodied in the analysis of heat-wave stochastic objects. Furthermore from a purely hyperbolic standpoint our argument relies on key new ingredients that include a hidden cancellation between sextic stochastic objects and a new bilinear random tensor estimate.},

Using these results, we prove that various module categories over the quantum affine algebras provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras.

We then show that an optimal power of the deficit $\delta (f;\Omega )$ controls both the $L^{2}$ -distance of $f$ to an appropriate class of Gaussians and the distance of $\Omega $ to a ball, through the Fraenkel asymmetry of $\Omega $ . Our proof is completely quantitative and hence all constants are explicit. We also establish suitable generalizations of this result in the higher-dimensional context.},

In this paper, we rephrase the sheaf theoretic Virasoro constraints in terms of primary states coming from a natural conformal vector in Joyce’s vertex algebra. This shows that Virasoro constraints are preserved under wall-crossing. As an application, we prove the conjectural Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of torsion-free sheaves on any curve and on surfaces with only $(p,p)$ cohomology classes by reducing the statements to the rank 1 case.},

This gives a substantial improvement on the best available estimates, which are essentially of size $\log _{2} n$ going back to work of Chowla in 1934. Using the same ideas, we also obtain significant progress on subexpoential bounds for the $ABC$ conjecture, which in a case gives the first improvement on a result by Stewart and Yu dating back over two decades. Central to our approach is the connection between Shimura curves and the $ABC$ conjecture developed by the author.},

Let $\pi $ be an automorphic representation of a quasi-split unitary group of even rank with respect to $E/F$ such that $\pi $ is ordinary above $p$ with respect to the Siegel parabolic subgroup. We construct the cyclotomic $p$ -adic $L$ -function of $\pi $ , and a certain generating series of Selmer classes of special cycles on Shimura varieties. We show, under some conditions, that if the vanishing order of the $p$ -adic $L$ -function is 1, then our generating series is modular and yields explicit nonzero classes (called Selmer theta lifts) in the Selmer group of the Galois representation of $E$ associated with $\pi $ ; in particular, the rank of this Selmer group is at least 1. In fact, we prove a precise formula relating the $p$ -adic heights of Selmer theta lifts to the derivative of the $p$ -adic $L$ -function. In parallel to Perrin-Riou’s $p$ -adic analogue of the Gross–Zagier formula, our formula is the $p$ -adic analogue of the arithmetic inner product formula recently established by Chao Li and the second author.},

  abstract     = {This work justifies the linear response formula for the Hall conductance of a two-dimensional disordered system. The proof rests on controlling the dynamics associated with a random time-dependent Hamiltonian. The principal challenge is related to the fact that spectral and dynamical localization are intrinsically unstable under perturbation, and the exact spectral flow - the tool used previously to control the dynamics in this context - does not exist. We resolve this problem by proving a local adiabatic theorem: With high probability, the physical evolution of a localized eigenstate $\psi $ associated with a random system remains close to the spectral flow for a restriction of the instantaneous Hamiltonian to a region $R$ where the bulk of $\psi $ is supported. Allowing $R$ to grow at most logarithmically in time ensures that the deviation of the physical evolution from this spectral flow is small. To substantiate our claim on the failure of the global spectral flow in disordered systems, we prove eigenvector hybridization in a one-dimensional Anderson model at all scales.},

  abstract     = {Given a polarizable ℤ-variation of Hodge structures $\mathbb{V}$ over a complex smooth quasi-projective base $S$ , a classical result of Cattani, Deligne and Kaplan says that its Hodge locus (i.e. the locus where exceptional Hodge tensors appear) is a countable union of irreducible algebraic subvarieties of $S$ , called the special subvarieties for $\mathbb{V}$ . Our main result in this paper is that, if the level of ${\mathbb{V}}$ is at least 3, this Hodge locus is in fact a finite union of such special subvarieties (hence is algebraic), at least if we restrict ourselves to the Hodge locus factorwise of positive period dimension (Theorem 1.5). For instance the Hodge locus of positive period dimension of the universal family of degree $d$ smooth hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{P}^{n+1}_{\mathbb{C}}$ , $n\geq 3$ , $d\geq 5$ and $(n,d)\neq (4,5)$ , is algebraic. On the other hand we prove that in level 1 or 2, the Hodge locus is analytically dense in $S^{\mbox{an}}$ as soon as it contains one typical special subvariety. These results follow from a complete elucidation of the distribution in $S$ of the special subvarieties in terms of typical/atypical intersections, with the exception of the atypical special subvarieties of zero period dimension.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the behavior of the spectrum of the continuous Anderson Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{L}$ , with white noise potential, on a segment whose size $L$ is sent to infinity. We zoom around energy levels $E$ either of order 1 (Bulk regime) or of order $1\ll E \ll L$ (Crossover regime). We show that the point process of (appropriately rescaled) eigenvalues and centers of mass converge to a Poisson point process. We also prove exponential localization of the eigenfunctions at an explicit rate. In addition, we show that the eigenfunctions converge to well-identified limits: in the Crossover regime, these limits are universal. Combined with the results of our companion paper (Dumaz and Labbé in Ann. Probab. 51(3):805–839, 2023), this identifies completely the transition between the localized and delocalized phases of the spectrum of $\mathcal{H}_{L}$ . The two main technical challenges are the proof of a two-points or Minami estimate, as well as an estimate on the convergence to equilibrium of a hypoelliptic diffusion, the proof of which relies on Malliavin calculus and the theory of hypocoercivity.},

  abstract     = {Kazhdan and Lusztig identified the affine Hecke algebra ℋ with an equivariant $K$ -group of the Steinberg variety, and applied this to prove the Deligne-Langlands conjecture, i.e., the local Langlands parametrization of irreducible representations of reductive groups over nonarchimedean local fields $F$ with an Iwahori-fixed vector. We apply techniques from derived algebraic geometry to pass from $K$ -theory to Hochschild homology and thereby identify ℋ with the endomorphisms of a coherent sheaf on the stack of unipotent Langlands parameters, the coherent Springer sheaf. As a result the derived category of ℋ-modules is realized as a full subcategory of coherent sheaves on this stack, confirming expectations from strong forms of the local Langlands correspondence (including recent conjectures of Fargues-Scholze, Hellmann and Zhu). In the case of the general linear group our result allows us to lift the local Langlands classification of irreducible representations to a categorical statement: we construct a full embedding of the derived category of smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{n}(F)$ into coherent sheaves on the stack of Langlands parameters.},

Given an ample linearisation of the action and an associated Fubini–Study Kähler form which is invariant for a maximal compact subgroup $Q$ of $H$ , we define a notion of moment map for the action of $H$ , and under suitable conditions (that the linearisation is well-adapted and semistability coincides with stability) we describe the (non-reductive) GIT quotient $X/\!/H$ introduced in (Bérczi et al. in J. Topol. 11(3):826–855, 2018) in terms of this moment map. Using this description we derive formulas for the Betti numbers of $X/\!/H$ and express the rational cohomology ring of $X/\!/H$ in terms of the rational cohomology ring of the GIT quotient $X/\!/T^{H}$ , where $T^{H}$ is a maximal torus in $H$ . We relate intersection pairings on $X/\!/H$ to intersection pairings on $X/\!/T^{H}$ , obtaining a residue formula for these pairings on $X/\!/H$ analogous to the residue formula of (Jeffrey and Kirwan in Topology 34(2):291–327, 1995). As an application, we announce a proof of the Green–Griffiths–Lang and Kobayashi conjectures for projective hypersurfaces with polynomial degree.},
