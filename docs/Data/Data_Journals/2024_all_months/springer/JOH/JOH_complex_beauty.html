  abstract     = {Reducing the cost of operating and maintaining wind farms is essential for the economic viability of this renewable energy source. This study applies hyper-heuristics to design a maintenance policy that prescribes the best maintenance action in every possible situation. Genetic programming is used to construct a priority function that determines what maintenance activities to conduct and the sequence of maintenance activities if there are not enough resources to do all of them simultaneously. The priority function may take into account the health condition of the target turbine and its components, the characteristics of the corresponding maintenance work, the workload of the maintenance crew, the working condition of the whole wind farm and the possibilities provided by opportunistic maintenance. Empirical results using a simulation model of the wind farm demonstrate that the proposed model can construct maintenance policies that perform well both in training and test scenarios, which shows the practicability of the approach.},

  abstract     = {This work address a variant of the knapsack problem, known as the knapsack problem with forfeits, which has numerous applications. In this variant, a set of items and a conflict graph are given, and the objective is to identify a collection of items that adhere to the knapsack’s capacity while maximizing the total value of the items minus the penalties for conflicting items. We propose a novel heuristic for this problem based on the concepts of iterated local search, variable neighborhood descent, and tabu search. Our heuristic takes into account four neighborhood structures, and we introduce efficient data structures to explore them. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. In particular, it delivers superior solutions within significantly shorter computation times across all benchmark instances. Additionally, this study includes an analysis of how the proposed data structures have influenced both the quality of the solutions and the execution time of the method.},

  abstract     = {Throughout the response phase of the disaster, the speedy restoration of transportation by reconnecting the nodes where the connection is broken is absolutely critical for evacuating civilians, providing clear access to hospitals, and distributing aid. Following a disaster, some roads in a disaster area might be closed to transportation. In reality, some roads can be blocked due to debris, and some of roads can be blocked by collapsing. In this model, different types of road unblocking methods are included, and each road can only be opened to access by a vehicle suitable for that method. So, different types of vehicles may be needed to repair the roads depending on the type of damage. In addition, fast-built bridges built both on land and over water are also used if necessary following a disaster. In problems of this nature, it is essential to restore the roads to enable the complete connectivity of the network such that all nodes can be reached by one another. In addition, it is also critical for the speedy reach of critical nodes, such as hospitals, and emergency disaster centers. This study aims to reduce the maximum time for connection and minimize the total time in which to reach critical nodes. For this purpose, we developed a bi-objective mathematical model that considers the multiple vehicle types that can repair different types of damages. Since the problem is NP-hard, two heuristic methods were developed, and the numerical results were presented. It has been observed that the local search algorithm gives better results than the hybrid algorithm. Additionally, different scenario data was produced. Numbers of unconnected components from 3 to 10 are solved with heuristic algorithms for test data containing 80 and 250 nodes, and real-life data containing 223 nodes and 391 edges are solved with heuristic algorithms for the number of unconnected components 6, 9, 12, and 15.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, the usefulness of quantum annealing hardware for combinatorial optimization has been the subject of much debate. Thus far, experimental benchmarking studies have indicated that quantum annealing hardware does not provide an irrefutable performance gain over state-of-the-art optimization methods. However, as this hardware continues to evolve, each new iteration brings improved performance and warrants further benchmarking. To that end, this work conducts an optimization performance assessment of D-Wave Systems’ Advantage Performance Update computer, which can natively solve sparse unconstrained quadratic optimization problems with over 5,000 binary decision variables and 40,000 quadratic terms. We demonstrate that classes of contrived problems exist where this quantum annealer can provide run time benefits over a collection of established classical solution methods that represent the current state-of-the-art for benchmarking quantum annealing hardware. Although this work does not present strong evidence of an irrefutable performance benefit for this emerging optimization technology, it does exhibit encouraging progress, signaling the potential impacts on practical optimization tasks in the future.},

Equity, on the other hand, refers to minimizing the difference between the maximum and the minimum distances in the subset of selected elements to balance their diversity. Both problems have been studied in the combinatorial optimization literature, but recently major drawbacks in their classic mathematical formulations have been identified. We propose new mathematical models to overcome these limitations, including multi-objective optimization, and heuristics to solve large-size instances of them. Specifically, we propose a matheuristic based on the CMSA framework for diversity and a GRASP heuristic for equity. Our extensive experimentation compares the original models with the new proposals by analyzing the solutions of our heuristics and those of the previous approaches, both from a single objective and a bi-objective paradigm. We also evaluate their quality with respect to the optimal solutions obtained with CPLEX, size permitting. Statistical analysis allows us to draw significant conclusions.},

  abstract     = {The adjacency graph is a structure used to model genomes in several rearrangement distance problems. In particular, most studies use properties of a maximum cycle packing of this graph to develop bounds and algorithms for rearrangement distance problems, such as the reversal distance, the reversal and transposition distance, and the double cut and join distance. When each genome has no repeated genes, there exists only one cycle packing for the graph. However, when each genome may have repeated genes, the problem of finding a maximum cycle packing for the adjacency graph (adjacency graph packing) is NP-hard. In this work, we develop a randomized greedy heuristic and a genetic algorithm heuristic for the adjacency graph packing problem for genomes with repeated genes and unequal gene content. We also propose new algorithms with simple implementation and good practical performance for reversal distance and reversal and transposition distance in genomes without repeated genes, which we combine with the heuristics to find solutions for the problems with repeated genes. We present experimental results and compare the application of these heuristics with the application of the MSOAR framework in rearrangement distance problems. Lastly, we apply our genetic algorithm heuristic to real genomic data to validate its practical use.},

The goal is to reduce the overall over- and under- coverage. The shifts and breaks defined with variable starting periods and duration make the problem flexible and hard to solve. To address the problem, an integer programming (IP) model is first proposed. Due to the problem’s complexity, it is impossible to solve instances involving numerous employees and activities in a timely manner. So we propose a heuristic method based on a large neighborhood search algorithm. A combination of context-free grammar (CFG) and resource-constrained shortest path problem is used to create weekly schedules. Moreover, we propose a constraint on task repetition that CFG is unable to express, so we incorporate an IP extension into our proposed algorithm. Importantly, our approach does not rely on any commercial solver like CPLEX. Computational experiments are carried out on the industrial and randomly generated instances to evaluate the performance of the exact IP model solved by CPLEX and the proposed heuristic algorithm. Results reveal that our method outperforms CPLEX in both solution time and solution quality in larger instances.},

This integration can occur mainly in two ways: ML-in-MH and MH-in-ML. In the present work, we combine the techniques in both ways—ML-in-MH-in-ML, providing an approach in which ML is considered to improve the performance of an evolutionary algorithm (EA), whose solutions encode parameters of an ML model—artificial neural network (ANN). Our approach called TS $$_{in}$$ EA $$_{in}$$ ANN employs a reinforcement learning neighborhood (RLN) mutation based on Thompson sampling (TS). TS is a parameterless reinforcement learning method, used here to boost the EA performance. In the experiments, every candidate ANN solves a regression problem known as protein structure prediction deviation. We consider two protein datasets, one with 16,382 and the other with 45,730 samples. The results show that TS $$_{in}$$ EA $$_{in}$$ ANN performs significantly better than a canonical genetic algorithm (GA $$_{in}$$ ANN) and the evolutionary algorithm without reinforcement learning (EA $$_{in}$$ ANN). Analyses of the parameter’s frequency are also performed comparing the approaches. Finally, comparisons with the literature show that except for one particular case in the largest dataset, TS $$_{in}$$ EA $$_{in}$$ ANN outperforms other approaches considered the state of the art for the addressed datasets.},

The proposed algorithm starts from the optimal solution of the linear relaxation of the SSCFLP to reduce its size and identify promising potential locations for opening facilities. Computational experiments were performed on two benchmark sets of large instances. For one of them, the developed algorithm obtained optimal solutions for all instances. For the other set, it provided average relative deviations slightly lower than those of three relevant algorithms from the literature. These results allow us to conclude that the proposed algorithm generates good-quality solutions and is competitive in solving large-scale SSCFLP instances.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new methodology to develop heuristic algorithms using tree decompositions. Traditionally, such algorithms construct an optimal solution of the given problem instance through a dynamic programming approach. We modify this procedure by introducing a parameter W that dictates the number of dynamic programming states to consider. We drop the exactness guarantee in favour of a shorter running time. However, if W is large enough such that all valid states are considered, our heuristic algorithm proves optimality of the constructed solution. In particular, we implement a heuristic algorithm for the Maximum Happy Vertices problem using this approach. Our algorithm more efficiently constructs optimal solutions compared to the exact algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. Furthermore, our algorithm constructs higher quality solutions than state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms Greedy-MHV and Growth-MHV for instances of which at least 40% of the vertices are initially coloured, at the cost of a larger running time.},

  abstract     = {The maximum bisection problem (max-bisection) belongs to a family of well-known graph partitioning problems with wide applications. In this study, we develop a simple and efficient local search algorithm called DSLS for max-bisection. The main idea in DSLS is the dynamic step strategy, which automatically adjusts the intensification and diversification to complete the search by changing the length of the step. Moreover, we design an efficient initial constructive method based on the degree information of the vertices, which provides high-quality initial solutions to the DSLS algorithm. In the data preprocessing, a reduction rule is proposed to cut down the size of benchmark graphs and improve the performance of the DSLS algorithm on benchmark graphs. We adopt 71 well-known benchmark graphs to evaluate our algorithm, and the experiments show that the DSLS algorithm is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and discovers improved best-known results (new lower bounds) for 12 benchmark graphs.},

  abstract     = {As an innovative approach to city logistics, the truck and drone delivery systems piqued the interest of academia and various companies in recent years, which takes advantage of both trucks’ large capacity and drones’ high speed. In congested city areas, dense traffic significantly impacts delivery time and all three sustainable dimensions (economic, environmental, and social) of delivery systems. For this reason, we focused on the sustainable time-dependent truck and drone routing problem with rendezvous locations. This work processes with a hybrid variable neighborhood search algorithm. We carried out numerous computational experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the results show its efficiency. Finally, by performing a detailed sensitivity analysis, the result highlights that the proposed model can reduce the completion time, operational costs, truck emissions, and social penalties in comparison to the flying sidekick traveling salesman model.},
