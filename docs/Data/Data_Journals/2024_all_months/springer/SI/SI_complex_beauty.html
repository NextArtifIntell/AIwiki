  abstract     = {Colonies of ants can complete complex tasks without the need for centralised control as a result of interactions between individuals and their environment. Particularly remarkable is the process of path selection between the nest and food sources that is essential for successful foraging. We have designed a stochastic model of ant foraging in the absence of direct communication. The motion of ants is governed by two components - a random change in direction of motion that improves ability to explore the environment, and a non-random global indirect interaction component based on pheromone signalling. Our model couples individual-based off-lattice ant simulations with an on-lattice characterisation of the pheromone diffusion. Using numerical simulations we have tested three pheromone-based model alternatives: (1) a single pheromone laid on the way toward the food source and on the way back to the nest; (2) single pheromone laid on the way toward the food source and an internal imperfect compass to navigate toward the nest; (3) two different pheromones, each used for one direction. We have studied the model behaviour in different parameter regimes and tested the ability of our simulated ants to form trails and adapt to environmental changes. The simulated ants behaviour reproduced the behaviours observed experimentally. Furthermore we tested two biological hypotheses on the impact of the quality of the food source on the dynamics. We found that increasing pheromone deposition for the richer food sources has a larger impact on the dynamics than elevation of the ant recruitment level for the richer food sources.},

  abstract     = {Biologically inspired collective decision-making algorithms show promise for implementing spatially distributed searching tasks with robotic systems. One example is the best-of-N problem in which a collective must search an environment for an unknown number of sites and select the best option. Real-world robotic deployments must achieve acceptable success rates and execution times across a wide variety of environmental conditions, a property known as resilience. Existing experiments for the best-of-N problem have not explicitly examined how the site layout affects a collective’s performance and resilience. Two novel resilience metrics are used to compare algorithmic performance and resilience between evenly distributed, obstructed, or unobstructed uneven site configurations. Obstructing the highest valued site negatively affected selection accuracy for both algorithms, while uneven site distribution had no effect on either algorithm’s resilience. The results also illuminate the distinction between absolute resilience as measured against an objective standard, and relative resilience used to compare an algorithm’s performance across different operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Grammatical evolution can be used to learn bio-inspired solutions to many distributed multiagent tasks, but the programs learned by the agents often need to be resilient to perturbations in the world. Biological inspiration from bacteria suggests that ongoing evolution can enable resilience, but traditional grammatical evolution algorithms learn too slowly to mimic rapid evolution because they utilize only vertical, parent-to-child genetic variation. The BeTr-GEESE grammatical evolution algorithm presented in this paper creates agents that use both vertical and lateral gene transfer to rapidly learn programs that perform one step in a multi-step problem even though the programs cannot perform all required subtasks. This paper shows that BeTr-GEESE can use online evolution to produce resilient collective behaviors on two goal-oriented spatial tasks, foraging and nest maintenance, in the presence of different types of perturbation. The paper then explores when and why BeTr-GEESE succeeds, emphasizing two potentially generalizable properties: modularity and locality. Modular programs enable real-time lateral transfer, leading to resilience. Locality means that the appropriate phenotypic behaviors are local to specific regions of the world (spatial locality) and that recently useful behaviors are likely to be useful again shortly (temporal locality). Finally, the paper modifies BeTr-GEESE to perform behavior fusion across multiple modular behaviors using activator and repressed conditions so that a fixed (non-evolving) population of heterogeneous agents is resilient to perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Collective consensus forming in spatially distributed systems is a challenging task. In previous literature, multi-option consensus-forming scenarios, with the number of options being smaller or equal to the number of agents, have been well studied. However, many well-performing decision-making strategies on a few options suffer from scalability when the number of options increases, especially for many-option scenarios with significantly more options than agents. In this paper, we investigate the viabilities of discrete decision-making strategies with ranked voting (RV) and belief fusion (DBBS) decision mechanisms in many-option scenarios with large decision spaces compared to the number of agents. We test the investigated strategies on an expanded discrete collective estimation scenario where the decision space can be expanded using two factors: a higher number of environmental features and/or finer decision space discretization. We have used a continuous collective consensus forming strategy, linear consensus protocol (LCP), as a baseline. Our experimental results have shown that, although susceptible to environmental influences, discrete decision-making strategies can reliably outperform those of LCP in terms of error and convergence time at the tested sizes of decision space. We have also shown that the two factors that lead to the expansion of the decision space have different impacts on performances for both RV and DBBS strategies, due to differences in the correlations between the discrete options. When facing a higher number of features, both discrete strategies experience a smaller error and a significant increase in decision time, while a finer decision space discretization has a negative influence on all considered metrics.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in swarm robotics is to achieve robust and scalable flocking, such that large numbers of robots can move together in a coordinated and cohesive manner while avoiding obstacles or threats. Flocking models in swarm robotic systems typically use reactive behaviors, such as cohesion, alignment, and avoidance. The use of potential fields has enabled the derivation of reactive control laws using obstacles and neighboring robots as sources of force for flocking. However, reactive behaviors, especially when a multitude of them are simultaneously active, as in the case of flocking, are prone to cause collisions or inefficient motion within the flock due to its short-sighted approach. Approaches that aimed to generate smoother and optimum flocking, such as the use of model predictive control, would either require centralized coordination, or distributed coordination which requires low-latency and high-bandwidth communication requirements within the swarm as well as high computational resources. In this paper, we present a predictive search model that can generate smooth and safe flocking of robotic swarms in the presence of obstacles by taking into account the predicted states of other robots in a computationally efficient way. We tested the proposed model in environments with static and dynamic obstacles and compared its performance with a potential field flocking model in simulation. The results show that the predictive search model can generate smoother and faster flocking in swarm robotic systems in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Furthermore, we tested the predictive search model with different numbers of robots in environments with static obstacles in simulations and demonstrated that it is scalable to large swarm sizes. The performance of the predictive search model is also validated on a swarm of six quadcopters indoors in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) holds significant practical relevance in numerous real-world applications involving fleets of mobile robots. The efficiency of such systems is directly determined by the quality of the paths calculated. Accordingly, extensive effort has been directed toward creating effective algorithms to address the MAPF problem. Yet, many existing MAPF algorithms still depend on offline centralized planning, paired with often unrealistic assumptions—such as robots having complete observability of the environment and moving in a deterministic fashion. The resultant plans are typically unsuitable for direct implementation on real robots where these assumptions do not usually apply. Aiming for more effective robot coordination under realistic conditions, we introduce an enhanced decentralized method. In this method, each robot coordinates solely with neighbors within a limited communication radius. Each robot attempts to follow the shortest path from its starting point to its designated target, addressing conflicts with other robots as they occur. Our method also incorporates path replanning, local motion coordination, and mechanisms to avoid robots becoming trapped in livelocks or deadlocks. Simulation-based results from various benchmark scenarios confirm that our enhanced decentralized method is both effective and scalable, accommodating up to at least 1000 robots.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic commonly used for optimization problems. However, PSO does not scale well to large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). A divide-and-conquer approach to PSO has shown to be effective when scaling up to LSOPs. Two cooperative PSO (CPSO) approaches, decomposition CPSO (DCPSO) and merging CPSO (MCPSO), were previously introduced, but are limited when it comes to exploring variable dependencies. An improvement to DCPSO and MCPSO incorporating a random grouping of decision variables at a fixed rate, referred to as RG-DCPSO and RG-MCPSO, was introduced recently in order to better explore variable dependencies. This work introduces two additional approaches to incorporating the random grouping of decision variables, denoted by $$\hbox {RG-DCPSO}_{\hbox {cv}}$$ , $$\hbox {RG-DCPSO}_{\hbox {sp}}$$ , $$\hbox {RG-MCPSO}_{\hbox {cv}}$$ , and $$\hbox {RG-MCPSO}_{\hbox {sp}}$$ . The various random grouping approaches were compared to five other decomposition-based PSO approaches found in the literature to determine their relative performance. The $$\hbox {RG-DCPSO}_{\hbox {cv}}$$ approach introduced in this paper has competitive performance in the CEC’2010 large-scale global optimization benchmark set on environments with up to 1000 decision variables. Furthermore, $$\hbox {RG-DCPSO}_{\hbox {cv}}$$ had the best performance out of all tested approaches on the CEC’2013 large-scale global optimization benchmark set.},

We tackle this challenge here by: (1) proposing AutoMOPSO, a flexible algorithmic template for designing MOPSOs with a design space that can instantiate thousands of potential MOPSOs; and (2) searching for good-performing MOPSO designs given a family of training problems by means of an automatic configuration tool (irace). We apply this automatic design methodology to generate a MOPSO that significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art MOPSOs on four well-known bi-objective problem families. We also identify the key design choices and parameters of the winning MOPSO by means of ablation. AutoMOPSO is publicly available as part of the jMetal framework.},

This process is characterised by the fact that once the group makes a decision, it can not be attributed to any of its group members. In swarm robotics, the individual mechanisms for collective decision-making are generally hand-designed and limited to a restricted set of solutions based on the voter or the majority model. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to take an alternative approach in which the individual mechanisms are implemented using artificial neural network controllers automatically synthesised using evolutionary computation techniques. We qualitatively describe the group dynamics underlying the decision process on a collective perceptual discrimination task. We carry out extensive comparative tests that quantitatively evaluate the performance of the most commonly used decision-making mechanisms (voter model and majority model) with the proposed dynamic neural network model under various operating conditions and for swarms that differ in size. The results of our study clearly indicate that the performances of a swarm employing dynamical neural networks as the decision-making mechanism are more robust, more adaptable to a dynamic environment, and more scalable to a larger swarm size than the performances of the swarms employing the voter and the majority model. These results, generated in simulation, are ecologically validated on a swarm of physical e-puck2 robots.},

However, manual tuned decision rules may limit the emergent behavior of the swarm. In this work we investigate the emergence of self-coordination and communication in evolved swarms without defining any explicit rule. For this purpose, we evolve a swarm of agents representing an ant colony. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a spiking neural network (SNN) which serves as an artificial brain to control the behavior of each agent. The goal of the evolved colony is to find optimal ways to forage for food and return it to the nest in the shortest amount of time. In the evolutionary phase, the ants are able to learn to collaborate by depositing pheromone near food piles and near the nest to guide other ants. The pheromone usage is not manually encoded into the network; instead, this behavior is established through the optimization procedure. We observe that pheromone-based communication enables the ants to perform better in comparison to colonies where communication via pheromone did not emerge. Furthermore, we assess the foraging performance of the ant colonies by comparing the SNN-based model to a multi-agent rule-based system. Our results show that the SNN-based model can efficiently complete the foraging task in a short amount of time. Our approach illustrates that even in the absence of pre-defined rules, self-coordination via pheromone emerges as a result of the network optimization. This work serves as a proof of concept for the possibility of creating complex applications utilizing SNNs as underlying architectures for multi-agent interactions where communication and self-coordination is desired.},
