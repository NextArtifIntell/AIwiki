In this paper, we improve upon previous work on predictive online primal–dual methods on two fronts. Firstly, we provide a more concise analysis that symmetrises previously unsymmetric regret bounds, and relaxes previous restrictive conditions on the dual predictor. Secondly, based on the latter, we develop several improved dual predictors. We numerically demonstrate their efficacy in image stabilisation and dynamic positron emission tomography.},

  abstract     = {Due to their ability to handle discontinuous images while having a well-understood behavior, regularizations with total variation (TV) and total generalized variation (TGV) are some of the best-known methods in image denoising. However, like other variational models including a fidelity term, they crucially depend on the choice of their tuning parameters. A remedy is to choose these automatically through multilevel approaches, for example by optimizing performance on noisy/clean image pairs. In this work, we consider such methods with space-dependent parameters which are piecewise constant on dyadic grids, with the grid itself being part of the minimization. We prove existence of minimizers for fixed discontinuous parameters under mild assumptions on the data, which lead to existence of finite optimal partitions. We further establish that these assumptions are equivalent to the commonly used box constraints on the parameters. On the numerical side, we consider a simple subdivision scheme for optimal partitions built on top of any other bilevel optimization method for scalar parameters, and demonstrate its improved performance on some representative test images when compared with constant optimized parameters.},

  abstract     = {Spectral unmixing is important in analyzing and processing hyperspectral images (HSIs). With the availability of large spectral signature libraries, the main task of spectral unmixing is to estimate corresponding proportions called abundances of pure spectral signatures called endmembers in mixed pixels. In this vein, only a few endmembers participate in the formation of mixed pixels in the scene and so we call them active endmembers. A plethora of sparse unmixing algorithms exploit spectral and spatial information in HSIs to enhance abundance estimation results. Many algorithms, however, treat the abundances corresponding to active and nonactive endmembers in the scene equivalently. In this article, we propose a framework named mixing support detection (MSD) for the spectral unmixing problem. The main idea is first to detect the active and nonactive endmembers at each iteration and then to treat the corresponding abundances differently. It follows that we only focus on the estimation of active abundances with the assumption of zero abundances corresponding to nonactive endmembers. It can be expected to reduce the computational cost, avoid the perturbations in nonactive abundances, and enhance the sparsity of the abundances. We embed the MSD framework in classic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) updates and obtain an ADMM-MSD algorithm. In particular, five ADMM-MSD-based unmixing algorithms are provided. The residual and objective convergence results of the proposed algorithm are given under certain assumptions. Both simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

We represent the boundary as a radial function and characterize the regularity of this function by means of its fractional differentiability. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian formulation which, simultaneously, estimates the function and its regularity, and in addition we quantify the uncertainties in the estimates. Numerical results suggest that the proposed method is a reliable approach for estimating and characterizing object boundaries in imaging applications, as illustrated with examples from high-intensity X-ray CT and image inpainting with Gaussian and Laplace additive noise models. We also show that our method can quantify uncertainties for these noise types, various noise levels, and incomplete data scenarios.},

We propose a parallel slicing procedure of the sphere which requires again only optimal transforms on the line. We analyze the properties of the corresponding parallelly sliced optimal transport, which provides in particular a rotationally invariant metric on the spherical probability measures. For $$\textrm{SO}(3)$$ , we introduce a new two-dimensional Radon transform and develop its singular value decomposition. Based on this, we propose a sliced optimal transport on $$\textrm{SO}(3)$$ . As Wasserstein distances were extensively used in barycenter computations, we derive algorithms to compute the barycenters with respect to our new sliced Wasserstein distances and provide synthetic numerical examples on the 2-sphere that demonstrate their behavior for both the free- and fixed-support setting of discrete spherical measures. In terms of computational speed, they outperform the existing methods for semicircular slicing as well as the regularized Wasserstein barycenters.},

  abstract     = {Variational level set method has become a powerful tool in image segmentation due to its ability to handle complex topological changes and maintain continuity and smoothness in the process of evolution. However its evolution process can be unstable, which results in over flatted or over sharpened contours and segmentation failure. To improve the accuracy and stability of evolution, we propose a high-order level set variational segmentation method integrated with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) equation regularization. This method uses the crystal growth in the MBE process to limit the evolution of the level set function. Thus can avoid the re-initialization in the evolution process and regulate the smoothness of the segmented curve and keep the segmentation results independent of the initial curve selection. It also works for noisy images with intensity inhomogeneity, which is a challenge in image segmentation. To solve the variational model, we derive the gradient flow and design a scalar auxiliary variable scheme, which can significantly improve the computational efficiency compared with the traditional semi-implicit and semi-explicit scheme. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can generate smooth segmentation curves, preserve segmentation details and obtain robust segmentation results of small objects. Compared to existing level set methods, this model is state-of-the-art in both accuracy and efficiency.},

We enforce intra-channel local smoothness of the intensity (low-frequency components) and inter-channel local similarity of the depth of object borders and textures (high-frequency components). Discontinuities of both the low-frequency and high-frequency components are accounted for implicitly, i.e., through suitable functions of the proper derivatives. For the treatment of even the finest image details, derivatives of first, second, and third orders are considered. The solution to the demosaicing problem is defined as the minimizer of an energy function, accounting for all these constraints plus a data fidelity term. This non-convex energy is minimized via an iterative deterministic algorithm, applied to a family of approximating functions, each implicitly referring to geometrically consistent image edges. Our method is general because it does not refer to any specific color filter array. However, to allow quantitative comparisons with other published results, we tested it in the case of the Bayer CFA and on the Kodak 24-image dataset, the McMaster (IMAX) 18-image dataset, the Microsoft Demosaicing Canon 57-image dataset, and the Microsoft Demosaicing Panasonic 500-image dataset. The comparisons with some of the most recent demosaicing algorithms show the good performance of our method in both the noiseless and noisy cases.},

  abstract     = {To study convexity properties of digital planar objects, the minimum perimeter polygon (MPP) was defined in the 1970 s in articles by Sklansky, Chazin, Hansen, Kibler, and Kim, where pixels were identified with polygonal tiles in mosaics, and two algorithms (1972, 1976) were proposed to determine the MPP vertices. These algorithms are based on constructing and iteratively restricting visibility cones, the MPP vertices result as special vertices of the tiles. The present paper proposes a novel MPP algorithm for objects given as regular complexes in rectangular mosaics, which are edge-adjacency-connected sets of tiles that have neither end tiles nor holes and whose boundaries not necessarily are simple. The new algorithm takes as input the canonical boundary path, we also propose a boundary tracing algorithm to obtain this path. We review the two classic MPP algorithms for rectangular tiles and a simplified adaptation for square tiles that is recommended in widely used modern textbooks on digital image analysis (2018, 2020) to produce approximations of simple digital 4-contours. We show that all these algorithms fail and that their mathematical basis is flawed, we correct the errors to develop the new MPP algorithm. Our MPP algorithm is illustrated using examples and its correctness is proved. Under our assumptions, the MPP coincides with the relative convex hull of a set A with respect to a polygon $$B\supset A$$ , where A is not necessarily a polygon, not even connected.},

This framework utilizes mixture models for feature point densities in object space and for interpreting real measurements. Advantages are the avoidance to resolve individual feature correspondences and to incorporate correct stochastic dependencies in multi-view applications. First, the general modeling framework is presented, second, a general algorithm for pose estimation is derived, and third, two example models (camera and lateration setup) are presented. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of this modeling and general algorithm by presenting four simulation scenarios for three observation systems, including the dependence on measurement resolution, object deformations and measurement noise. Probabilistic modeling utilizing mixture models shows the potential for accurate and robust pose estimations while avoiding the correspondence problem.},

  abstract     = {Speckle removal aims to smooth noise while preserving image boundaries and texture information. In recent years, speckle removal models based on deep learning methods have attracted a lot of attention. However, it was found that these models are less robust to adversarial attacks. The adversarial attack makes the image recovery of deep learning methods significantly less effective when the speckle noise distribution is almost unchanged. In purpose of addressing the above problem, we propose a diffusion equation-based speckle removal model that can improve the robustness of deep learning algorithms in this paper. The model utilizes a deep learning image prior and an image grayscale detection operator together to construct the coefficient function of the diffusion equation. Among them, there is a high possibility that the deep learning image prior is inaccurate or even incorrect, but it will not affect the performance and the properties of the proposed diffusion equation model for noise removal. Moreover, we analyze the robustness of the proposed diffusion equation model in terms of theoretical and numerical properties. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion equation speckle removal model is not affected by adversarial attacks in any way and has stronger robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of approximating the Gaussian smoothing and the Gaussian derivative computations in scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways of discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region, to aim at suppressing some of the severe artefacts of sampled Gaussian kernels and sampled Gaussian derivatives at very fine scales, or (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data. We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and the sampled Gaussian derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and the integrated Gaussian derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in most of the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing. Below a standard deviation of about 0.75, the derivative estimates obtained from convolutions with the sampled Gaussian derivative kernels are, however, not numerically accurate or consistent, while the results obtained from the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, with its associated central difference operators applied to the spatially smoothed image data, are then a much better choice.},

  abstract     = {The empirical two-step data-domain-decomposition (DDD) method has been shown to be effective in yielding accurate image reconstruction from discrete data collected in multispectral computed tomography. The key step in the DDD method is to estimate accurately basis sinograms from discrete data by basing upon the nonlinear discrete-to-discrete (DD)-data model. From the basis sinograms, basis images and subsequently virtual monochromatic images at energies of interest can readily be reconstructed. In this work, we carry out theoretical and numerical analyses of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution to the nonlinear DD-data model for accurately estimating the discrete basis sinograms. More precisely, we derive a sufficient condition on that the mapping in the nonlinear DD-data model is a local homeomorphism and also a necessary condition on that it is a proper mapping and further a homeomorphism, demonstrating the existence of the solution. We also obtain a sufficient condition on the global injectivity of the nonlinear mapping, revealing the uniqueness condition on the solution. Furthermore, we identify some bounded regions for specific stability estimates of the nonlinear DD-data model. Finally, we conduct numerical studies to demonstrate quantitatively the validity extent of conditions derived. Under the solution conditions derived, results of the numerical study confirm that unique truth basis sinograms can numerically accurately be recovered from noise-free data and that the solution stability is demonstrated using noisy data.},

In this paper, we study the statistical properties of those estimators and we developed a refinement with the highest accuracy for each estimator. We also address a practical issue in concentric ellipse fitting, namely, that each observation in the data set should be recognized as belonging to only one of the concentric ellipses. Most well-known clustering methods, such as spectral clustering, fail for this problem. We propose a clustering approach that can effectively be used for the implementation of our model.

Motivated by classic tube methods such as the taut-string algorithm, these regions are obtained from level sets of the minimizer of a total variation functional within a high-dimensional tube. The resulting non-smooth optimization problem is challenging to solve, and we compare various numerical approaches for its solution and relate them to the literature on constrained total variation denoising. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated on numerical experiments for deconvolution and models related to astrophysics, where it is demonstrated that it allows to represent the uncertainty in the detected blobs in a precise and physically interpretable way.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a one-class self-supervised method for anomaly segmentation in images that benefits from both a modern machine learning approach and a more classic statistical detection theory. The method consists of four phases. First, features are extracted using a multi-scale image transformer architecture. Then, these features are fed into a U-shaped normalizing flow (NF) that lays the theoretical foundations for the subsequent phases. The third phase computes a pixel-level anomaly map from the NF embedding, and the last phase performs a segmentation based on the a contrario framework. This multiple hypothesis testing strategy permits the derivation of robust unsupervised detection thresholds, which are crucial in real-world applications where an operational point is needed. The segmentation results are evaluated using the mean intersection over union metric, and for assessing the generated anomaly maps we report the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), as well as the area under the per-region-overlap curve (AUPRO). Extensive experimentation in various datasets shows that the proposed approach produces state-of-the-art results for all metrics and all datasets, ranking first in most MVTec-AD categories, with a mean pixel-level AUROC of 98.74%.

Object-oriented data analysis requires us to process and analyse volumetric data without embedding into a higher-dimensional vector space. Multiway forms of volumetric data require quantitative methods for the discrimination of multiway forms. Tensor principal component analysis is an extension of image singular value decomposition for planar images to higher-dimensional images. It is an efficient discrimination analysis method when used with the multilinear subspace method. The multilinear subspace method enables us to analyse spatial textures of volumetric images and spatiotemporal variations of volumetric video sequences. We define a distance metric for subspaces of multiway data arrays using the transport between two probability measures on the Stiefel manifold. Numerical examples show that the Stiefel distance is superior to the Euclidean distance, Grassmann distance and projection-based similarity for the longitudinal analysis of volumetric sequences.},

Originally motivated by drift-diffusion concepts from physics, they apply image perturbations such as noise and blur in a forward process that results in a tractable probability distribution. A corresponding learned reverse process generates images and can be conditioned on side information, which leads to a wide variety of practical applications. Most of the research focus currently lies on practice-oriented extensions. In contrast, the theoretical background remains largely unexplored, in particular the relations to drift-diffusion. In order to shed light on these connections to classical image filtering, we propose a generalised scale-space theory for diffusion probabilistic models.

  abstract     = {In this work, we present new proofs of convergence for plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms. PnP methods are efficient iterative algorithms for solving image inverse problems where regularization is performed by plugging a pre-trained denoiser in a proximal algorithm, such as Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) or Douglas–Rachford splitting (DRS). Recent research has explored convergence by incorporating a denoiser that writes exactly as a proximal operator. However, in these works, the corresponding PnP algorithm has the drawback to be necessarily run with stepsize equal to 1. The stepsize condition for nonconvex convergence of the proximal algorithm in use then translates to restrictive conditions on the regularization parameter of the inverse problem. This can severely degrade the restoration capacity of the algorithm. In this paper, we present two remedies for this limitation. First, we provide a novel convergence proof for PnP-DRS that does not impose any restriction on the regularization parameter. Second, we examine a relaxed version of the PGD algorithm that converges across a broader range of regularization parameters. Our experimental study, conducted on deblurring and super-resolution experiments, demonstrate that these two solutions both enhance the accuracy of image restoration.},

In particular, we focus on the definition of Laplacian and p-Laplace operators for oriented and unoriented hypergraphs, their basic properties, variational structure, and their scale spaces. We illustrate that diffusion equations on hypergraphs are possible models for different applications such as information flow on social networks or image processing. Moreover, the spectral analysis and scale spaces induced by these operators provide a potential method to further analyze complex data and their multiscale structure. The quest for spectral analysis and suitable scale spaces on hypergraphs motivates in particular a definition of differential operators with trivial first eigenfunction and thus more interpretable second eigenfunctions. This property is not automatically satisfied in existing definitions of hypergraph p-Laplacians, and we hence provide a novel axiomatic approach that extends previous definitions and can be specialized to satisfy such (or other) desired properties.},

We propose a product-of-experts-type model utilizing Gaussian mixture experts and study configurations that admit an analytic expression for $$ f_Y (\,\cdot \, t) $$ . In particular, with a focus on image processing, we derive conditions for models acting on filter, wavelet, and shearlet responses. Our construction naturally allows the model to be trained simultaneously over the entire diffusion horizon using empirical Bayes. We show numerical results for image denoising where our models are competitive while being tractable, interpretable, and having only a small number of learnable parameters. As a by-product, our models can be used for reliable noise level estimation, allowing blind denoising of images corrupted by heteroscedastic noise.},

  abstract     = {Inversion of operators is a fundamental concept in data processing. Inversion of linear operators is well studied, supported by established theory. When an inverse either does not exist or is not unique, generalized inverses are used. Most notable is the Moore–Penrose inverse, widely used in physics, statistics, and various fields of engineering. This work investigates generalized inversion of nonlinear operators. We first address broadly the desired properties of generalized inverses, guided by the Moore–Penrose axioms. We define the notion for general sets and then a refinement, termed pseudo-inverse, for normed spaces. We present conditions for existence and uniqueness of a pseudo-inverse and establish theoretical results investigating its properties, such as continuity, its value for operator compositions and projection operators, and others. Analytic expressions are given for the pseudo-inverse of some well-known, non-invertible, nonlinear operators, such as hard- or soft-thresholding and ReLU. We analyze a neural layer and discuss relations to wavelet thresholding. Next, the Drazin inverse, and a relaxation, are investigated for operators with equal domain and range. We present scenarios where inversion is expressible as a linear combination of forward applications of the operator. Such scenarios arise for classes of nonlinear operators with vanishing polynomials, similar to the minimal or characteristic polynomials for matrices. Inversion using forward applications may facilitate the development of new efficient algorithms for approximating generalized inversion of complex nonlinear operators.},

Denoising with variational methods is very efficient if a regularizer well-adapted to the nature of the data is available. Thanks to the maximum a posteriori Bayesian framework, such regularizer can be systematically linked with the distribution of the data. With deep neural networks (DNN), complex distributions can be recovered from a large training database. To reduce the computational burden of this task, we adapt the compressive learning framework to the learning of regularizers parametrized by DNN. We propose two variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the recovery of deep regularization parameters from a heavily compressed database. These algorithms outperform the initially proposed method that was limited to low-dimensional signals, each iteration using information from the whole database. They also benefit from classical SGD convergence guarantees. Thanks to these improvements we show that this method can be applied for patch-based image denoising.},

RDS inpainting combines two carefully chosen components: homogeneous diffusion and coherence-enhancing shock filtering. It benefits from the complementary synergy of its building blocks: The shock term propagates edge data with perfect sharpness and directional accuracy over large distances due to its high degree of anisotropy. Homogeneous diffusion fills large areas efficiently. The second order equation underlying RDS inpainting inherits a maximum–minimum principle from its components, which is also fulfilled in the discrete case, in contrast to competing anisotropic methods. The regularisation addresses the largest drawback of the original model: It allows a drastic reduction in model parameters without any loss in quality. Furthermore, we extend RDS inpainting to vector-valued data. Our experiments show a performance that is comparable to or better than many inpainting methods based on partial differential equations and related integrodifferential models, including anisotropic processes of second or fourth order.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating prior knowledge into a segmentation task, whether it be under the form of geometrical constraints (area/volume penalisation, convexity enforcement, etc.) or of topological constraints (to preserve the contextual relations between objects, to monitor the number of connected components), proves to increase accuracy in medical image segmentation. In particular, it allows to compensate for the issue of weak boundary definition, of imbalanced classes, and to be more in line with anatomical consistency even though the data do not explicitly exhibit those features. This observation underpins the introduced contribution that aims, in a hybrid setting, to leverage the best of both worlds that variational methods and supervised deep learning approaches embody: (a) versatility and adaptability in the mathematical formulation of the problem to encode geometrical/topological constraints, (b) interpretability of the results for the former formalism, while (c) more efficient and effective processing models, (d) ability to become more proficient at learning intricate features and executing more computationally intensive tasks, for the latter one. To be more precise, a unified variational framework involving topological prescriptions in the training of convolutional neural networks through the design of a suitable penalty in the loss function is provided. These topological constraints are implicitly enforced by viewing the segmentation procedure as a registration task between the processed image and its associated ground truth under incompressibility conditions, thus making them homeomorphic. A very preliminary version (Lambert et al., in Calatroni, Donatelli, Morigi, Prato, Santacesaria (eds) Scale space and variational methods in computer vision, Springer, Berlin, 2023, pp. 363–375) of this work has been published in the proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Scale Space and Variational Methods in Computer Vision, 2023. It contained neither all the theoretical results, nor the detailed related proofs, nor did it include the numerical analysis of the designed algorithm. Besides these more involved developments in the present version, a more complete, systematic and thorough analysis of the numerical experiments is also conducted, addressing several issues: (i) limited amount of labelled data in the training phase, (ii) low contrast or imbalanced classes exhibited by the data, and (iii) explainability of the results.},

  abstract     = {Comparing the deformations of different beating hearts is a challenging operation. As in clinics the impaired condition is often recognized upon (local and global) deformation parameters, the particular nature of heart deformation during one beat can be compared among different individuals in the same ordination space more effectively if initial inter-individual form (shape + size) differences are filtered out. This is even more true if the shape of cardiac trajectory itself is under consideration. This need is satisfied by applying a geometric machinery named “parallel transport” in the field of differential geometry. In recent years several parallel transport methods have been applied to cardiological data acquired via echocardiography, CT scan or magnetic resonance. Concomitantly, some efforts were made for comparing different parallel transport algorithms applied to a variety of toy examples and real deformational data. Here we face the problem of comparing the heavily used LDDMM parallel transport with the recently proposed Riemannian “TPS space” in the context of the deformation of the right ventricle. Using local tensors diagnostics and global energy-based and shape distance-based parameters, we explored the maintenance of original deformations in transported data in four systo-diastolic deformations belonging to one healthy subject and three individuals affected by tetralogy of Fallot, atrial septal defect and pulmonary hypertension. We also do the same in a larger dataset relative to the left ventricle of 82 heathly subjects and 21 patients affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We also do the same in a larger dataset relative to the left ventricle of 82 heathly subjects and 21 patients affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In particular, we contrasted the TPS space with classic LDDMM and a modified LDDMM able to manage spherical differences. Our results point toward a neat superiority of TPS space over classic LDDMM. The modified LDDMM performs similarly as it maintains better the chosen diagnostics.},

Instead, we solve the problem in 4D by exploiting the observation that if objects only merge or only split, they appear as a single component in 4D. This allows us to initiate a topologically simple 3D hypersurface and deform it to fit the surface of all objects at all times. This gives an extremely compact representation of the objects’ evolution. We test our method on artificial 4D images and compare it to other segmentation methods.

In particular, they have been shown to deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions with CNN denoisers. Since the regularization is performed in an ad-hoc manner, understanding the convergence of PnP and RED has been an active research area. It was shown in recent works that iterate convergence can be guaranteed if the denoiser is averaged or nonexpansive. However, integrating nonexpansivity with gradient-based learning is challenging, the core issue being that testing nonexpansivity is intractable. Using numerical examples, we show that existing CNN denoisers tend to violate the nonexpansive property, which can cause PnP or RED to diverge. In fact, algorithms for training nonexpansive denoisers either cannot guarantee nonexpansivity or are computationally intensive. In this work, we construct contractive and averaged image denoisers by unfolding splitting-based optimization algorithms applied to wavelet denoising and demonstrate that their regularization capacity for PnP and RED can be matched with CNN denoisers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a simple framework for training contractive denoisers using network unfolding.},

  abstract     = {Many computer vision applications require robust and efficient estimation of camera geometry from a minimal number of input data measurements. Minimal problems are usually formulated as complex systems of sparse polynomial equations. The systems usually are overdetermined and consist of polynomials with algebraically constrained coefficients. Most state-of-the-art efficient polynomial solvers are based on the action matrix method that has been automated and highly optimized in recent years. On the other hand, the alternative theory of sparse resultants based on the Newton polytopes has not been used so often for generating efficient solvers, primarily because the polytopes do not respect the constraints amongst the coefficients. In an attempt to tackle this challenge, here we propose a simple iterative scheme to test various subsets of the Newton polytopes and search for the most efficient solver. Moreover, we propose to use an extra polynomial with a special form to further improve the solver efficiency via Schur complement computation. We show that for some camera geometry problems our resultant-based method leads to smaller and more stable solvers than the state-of-the-art Gröbner basis-based solvers, while being significantly smaller than the state-of-the-art resultant-based methods. The proposed method can be fully automated and incorporated into existing tools for the automatic generation of efficient polynomial solvers. It provides a competitive alternative to popular Gröbner basis-based methods for minimal problems in computer vision. Additionally, we study the conditions under which the minimal solvers generated by the state-of-the-art action matrix-based methods and the proposed extra polynomial resultant-based method, are equivalent. Specifically, we consider a step-by-step comparison between the approaches based on the action matrix and the sparse resultant, followed by a set of substitutions, which would lead to equivalent minimal solvers.},

Our first contribution is to describe several ways, most of them new, for specifying segmentations using the hierarchy elements. Then, we consider the best hierarchy-induced segmentation specified by a limited number of hierarchy elements. We focus on a common quality measure for binary segmentations, the Jaccard index (also known as IoU). Optimizing the Jaccard index is highly nontrivial, and yet we propose an efficient approach for doing exactly that. This way we get algorithm-independent upper bounds on the quality of any segmentation created from the hierarchy. We found that the obtainable segmentation quality varies significantly depending on the way that the segments are specified by the hierarchy elements, and that representing a segmentation with only a few hierarchy elements is often possible.},

The stochastic primal–dual hybrid gradient (SPDHG) algorithm with constant step sizes has become widely applied in large-scale convex optimization across many scientific fields due to its scalability. While the product of the primal and dual step sizes is subject to an upper-bound in order to ensure convergence, the selection of the ratio of the step sizes is critical in applications. Up-to-now there is no systematic and successful way of selecting the primal and dual step sizes for SPDHG. In this work, we propose a general class of adaptive SPDHG (A-SPDHG) algorithms and prove their convergence under weak assumptions. We also propose concrete parameters-updating strategies which satisfy the assumptions of our theory and thereby lead to convergent algorithms. Numerical examples on computed tomography demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

In this paper, we present sufficient conditions for topology-preserving parallel reductions on the three types of pictures of the unconventional 3D face-centered cubic (FCC) grid. Some conditions provide methods of verifying that a given parallel reduction always preserves the topology, and the remaining ones directly provide deletion rules of topology-preserving parallel reductions, and make us possible to generate topologically correct thinning algorithms. We give local characterizations of P-simple points, whose simultaneous deletion preserves the topology, and the relationships among the existing universal sufficient conditions for arbitrary types of binary pictures and our new FCC-specific results are also established.},

For neural networks, scale invariance is typically achieved by data augmentation. However, when presented with a scale far outside the range covered by the training set, neural networks may fail to generalize. Here, we introduce the Riesz network, a novel scale- invariant neural network. Instead of standard 2d or 3d convolutions for combining spatial information, the Riesz network is based on the Riesz transform which is a scale-equivariant operation. As a consequence, this network naturally generalizes to unseen or even arbitrary scales in a single forward pass. As an application example, we consider detecting and segmenting cracks in tomographic images of concrete. In this context, ‘scale’ refers to the crack thickness which may vary strongly even within the same sample. To prove its scale invariance, the Riesz network is trained on one fixed crack width. We then validate its performance in segmenting simulated and real tomographic images featuring a wide range of crack widths. An additional experiment is carried out on the MNIST Large Scale data set.},

We formulate a theorem that describes all shortest and straight curves (parallel velocity and parallel momentum, respectively) with respect to this new data-driven connection and corresponding Riemannian manifold. Then we use these shortest curves for geodesic tracking of complex vasculature in multi-orientation image representations defined on $${\mathbb {M}}_{2}$$ . The data-driven Cartan connection characterizes the Hamiltonian flow of all geodesics. It also allows for improved adaptation to curvature and misalignment of the (lifted) vessel structure that we track via globally optimal geodesics. We compute these geodesics numerically via steepest descent on distance maps on $${\mathbb {M}}_2$$ that we compute by a new modified anisotropic fast-marching method.Our experiments range from tracking single blood vessels with fixed endpoints to tracking complete vascular trees in retinal images. Single vessel tracking is performed in a single run in the multi-orientation image representation, where we project the resulting geodesics back onto the underlying image. The complete vascular tree tracking requires only two runs and avoids prior segmentation, placement of extra anchor points, and dynamic switching between geodesic models. Altogether we provide a geodesic tracking method using a single, flexible, transparent, data-driven geodesic model providing globally optimal curves which correctly follow highly complex vascular structures in retinal images.

To estimate the geometry parameters, we calculate the maximum cross-correlation between a known-sized calibration object image and its filtered backprojection reconstruction and use differential evolution as an optimiser. The approach allows estimating geometry parameters from full-angle measurements as well as from sparse measurements. We show numerically that different sets of parameters can be used for artefact-free reconstruction. We deploy Bayesian inversion with first-order isotropic Cauchy difference priors for reconstruction of synthetic and real sawmill data with a very low number of measurements.},

By controlling the ratio between upsampling for smoothing and downsampling in the pyramid transform, the rational-order pyramid transform is computed. The tensor expression of the multiway pyramid transform implies that the transform yields orthogonal base systems for any ratio of the rational pyramid transform.

  abstract     = {As one promising solution, zero-watermarking approaches have been proposed to enhance the image visual quality and applied to protect the intellectual property rights of the medical images, remote sensing images and military images. The moments and their invariants have good image descriptive capability and geometrical invariance, which are common tools for image zero-watermarking. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, most of the existing algorithms ignore the problem of balancing robustness and discriminability. Secondly, the direct computation of image moments is time-consuming, numerically inaccurate, and unstable, thus affecting the effectiveness of these moment-based methods. Third, there is less research on zero-watermarking algorithms targeted at color images. To address these problems, this paper presents a zero-watermarking algorithm which is based on accurate quaternion fractional-order pseudo-Jacobi–Fourier moments with time–frequency analysis capability for color images. Firstly, we define a new set of orthogonal moments, named fractional-order pseudo-Jacobi–Fourier moments (FPJFMs), which is characterized by the generic nature and time–frequency analysis capability. And, we propose a scheme for the accurate computation of FPJFMs. Also, we extend accurate FPJFMs to the accurate quaternion FPJFMs (QFPJFMs), which is an efficient color image representation. Next, a new framework is proposed, namely hybrid low-order moment feature (HLMF) based on accurate QFPJFMs, which can simultaneously improve the legibility and robustness of the image representation. Finally, the accurate QFPJFMs-based HLMF is adapted to the zero-watermarking algorithm. Numerous experiment results indicate that this paper&#39;s presented zero-watermarking approach provides a good balance between robustness and discriminability, which is an effective and superior scheme.},

In this survey paper, we consider the use of generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems. The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training dataset. We name this family generative regularisers. The success of generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so we propose a set of desired criteria to assess generative models and guide future research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common generative models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three different generative regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring, deconvolution, and tomography. We show that restricting solutions of the inverse problem to lie exactly in the range of a generative model can give good results but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator produces more consistent results. Finally, we discuss future directions and open problems in the field.},

  abstract     = {In blind image deblurring, feasible solutions have been obtained by exploiting image prior information such as dark channel prior, extreme channel prior, and local minimal intensity prior. The performance highly depends on these priors, which may have poor adaptability to different image contents in real-world applications. For example, these priors only consider the changes in local minimal and maximal intensity pixels in the blurring process and ignore the difference between these changes. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image deblurring approach based on dynamic-clustering extreme intensity prior. Specifically, the patch-wise maximal pixels (PMaxP) prior and patch-wise minimal pixels (PMinP) prior are employed and clustered into two by applying fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. The regularizations impose the sparsity inducing on either PMaxP prior or PMinP prior in each patch. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms on synthetic and real-world images.},

  abstract     = {In discrete topology, discrete surfaces are well-known for their strong topological and regularity properties. Their definition is recursive, and checking if a poset is a discrete surface is tractable. Their applications are numerous: when domain unicoherence is ensured, they lead access to the tree of shapes, and then to filtering in the shape space (shapings); they also lead to Laplacian zero-crossing extraction, to brain tumor segmentation, and many other applications related to mathematical morphology. They have many advantages in digital geometry and digital topology since discrete surfaces do not have any pinches (and then the underlying polyhedron of their geometric realization can be parameterized). However, contrary to topological manifolds known in continuous topology, discrete surfaces do not have any boundary, which is not always realizable in practice (finite hyper-rectangles cannot be discrete surfaces due to their non-empty boundary). For this reason, we propose the three following contributions: (1) we introduce a new definition of boundary, called border, based on the definition of discrete surfaces, and which allows us to delimit any partially ordered set whenever it is not embedded in a greater ambient space, (2) we introduce $$\mathcal {P}$$ -well-composedness similar to well-composedness in the sense of Alexandrov but based on borders, (3) we propose new (possibly geometrical) structures called (smooth) n-PCM’s which represent almost the same regularity as discrete surfaces and that are tractable thanks to their recursive definition, and (4) we prove several fundamental theorems relative to PCM’s and their relations with discrete surfaces. We deeply believe that these new n-dimensional structures are promising for the discrete topology and digital geometry fields.},
