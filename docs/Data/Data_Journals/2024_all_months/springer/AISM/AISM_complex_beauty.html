  abstract     = {Density power divergence (DPD) is designed to robustly estimate the underlying distribution of observations, in the presence of outliers. However, DPD involves an integral of the power of the parametric density models to be estimated; the explicit form of the integral term can be derived only for specific densities, such as normal and exponential densities. While we may perform a numerical integration for each iteration of the optimization algorithms, the computational complexity has hindered the practical application of DPD-based estimation to more general parametric densities. To address the issue, this study introduces a stochastic approach to minimize DPD for general parametric density models. The proposed approach can also be employed to minimize other density power-based $$\gamma$$ -divergences, by leveraging unnormalized models. We provide R package for implementation of the proposed approach in https://github.com/oknakfm/sgdpd .},

Selection consistency of the estimators is also validated. The problem that the true values lie on the boundary is solved by our previous results applicable to singular models, besides, penalized estimation and non-ergodic statistics. To overcome non-identifiability, we consider a suitable penalty such as the non-convex Bridge and the adaptive Lasso that stabilize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator and shrink inactive parameters. Then the estimator converges to one of the most parsimonious values among all the true values. The oracle property can also be obtained even if likelihood ratio tests for model selection are labor intensive due to singularity of models. Examples are: a superposition of parametric proportional hazard models and a counting process having intensity with multicollinear covariates.},

For that, we propose a more general local approximation of the parameter space (at the true value) than previous studies. This estimation theory is comprehensive in that it can handle penalized estimation as well as quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (in the ergodic or non-ergodic statistics) under such non-regular models. In penalized estimation, depending on the boundary constraint, even the concave Bridge estimator does not necessarily give selection consistency. Therefore, we describe some sufficient condition for selection consistency, precisely evaluating the balance between the boundary constraint and the form of the penalty. An example is penalized MLE of variance components of random effects in linear mixed models.},

We show that the distributions of all these classes are supported on nonnegative integers, that they are infinitely divisible, and that they are skewed to the right, leptokurtic, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated (relative to the Poisson class). Accordingly, these new classes significantly enrich the set of probability models for modeling zero-inflated and over-dispersed count data. Furthermore, we elaborate on numerical techniques how to compute the distributions of our classes, and apply these to an actual data experiment.},

An extensive simulation study shows that all the proposed tests are accurate in terms of achieving the nominal size value, even for small samples. The proposed simultaneous confidence intervals are also seen to maintain the preassigned coverage probability. The powers of these tests are compared with a recently proposed test, which is quite conservative. Finally, the proposed tests are illustrated with the help of three data sets related to medical studies.

This article proposes a proportional hazards model for joint modeling right censored survival data and intensive longitudinal data taking into account of within-subject historic change patterns. Without any parametric/semiparametric assumptions or use of kernel method, we derive empirical likelihood-based maximum likelihood estimators and partial likelihood estimators for the regression parameter and the baseline distribution function.

In this paper, we propose a class of multivariate Hawkes processes with spatial covariates to consider the influence structure of spatial features in spatiotemporal events and the spatiotemporal patterns such as clustering. Baseline intensities are assumed to be a spatial Poisson regression model to explain spatial feature influence. The transfer functions are considered unknown but smooth and decreasing to explain the clustering phenomena. A semiparametric estimation method based on time discretization and local constant approximation is introduced. Transfer function estimators are shown to be consistent, and baseline intensity estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. We examine the numerical performance of the proposed estimators with extensive simulation and illustrate the application of the proposed model to crime data obtained from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.},

  abstract     = {It may happen that the behavior of a multivariate time series is such that the underlying joint distribution is gradually moving from one distribution to another between unknown times of change. Under this context of a possible gradual-change, tests of change-point detection in the dependence structure of multivariate series are developed around the associated sequence of Spearman matrices. It is formally established that the proposed test statistics for that purpose are asymptotically marginal-free under a general strong-mixing assumption, and written as functions of integrated Brownian bridges. Consistent estimators of the pair of times of change, as well as of the before-the-change and after-the-change Spearman matrices, are also proposed. A simulation study examines the sampling properties of the introduced tools, and the methodologies are illustrated on a synthetic dataset.},

This extends classical sample mean-based methodology to include robust methods but also different types of changes such as changes in linear regression or changes in count data including Poisson autoregressive time series. In this framework, we derive a general theory proving consistency for the number of change points and rates of convergence for the estimators of the locations of the change points. More precisely, two different types of MOSUM (moving sum) statistics are considered: A MOSUM-Wald statistic based on differences of local estimators and a MOSUM-score statistic based on a global inspection parameter. The latter is usually computationally less involved in particular in nonlinear problems where no closed form of the estimator is known such that numerical methods are required. Finally, we evaluate the methodology by some simulations as well as using geophysical well-log data.},

An estimate is defined which fits a deep neural network consisting of a large number of fully connected neural networks, which are computed in parallel, via gradient descent to the data. The estimate is over-parametrized in the sense that the number of its parameters is much larger than the sample size. It is shown that with a suitable random initialization of the network, a sufficiently small gradient descent step size, and a number of gradient descent steps that slightly exceed the reciprocal of this step size, the estimate is universally consistent.

For single-observation models, we provide a condition ensuring existence of UMPS tests and give their explicit form. When this condition is not met, UMPS tests may fail to exist and we provide a weaker condition under which there exist UMP tests in the class of level- $$\alpha $$ tests whose power function is symmetric and U-shaped.

The frequency polygon can also attain the optimal uniform rate of convergence and the almost sure convergence under general conditions. Finally, a result of $$L^1$$ convergence is given. Frequency polygons thus appear to be very good density estimators with respect to the criteria of IMSE, of uniform convergence, of almost sure convergence and of $$L^1$$ convergence.

We are interested in the estimation of such a model, where the errors follow an autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) process, and the covariates can also be correlated. Instead of estimating the constituent parts of the model in a sequential fashion, we propose a spline-based method to estimate the mean function and the parameters of the ARMA process jointly. We establish the desirable asymptotic properties of the proposed approach under mild regularity conditions. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed method performs well and generates strong evidence supporting the established theoretical results. Our method provides a new addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing serially correlated data.

In particular, we show that the mixed-rates structure of the joint GQLF, which does not emerge in the case of diffusions, gives rise to the non-standard forms of the regularization terms in the selection of the scale coefficient, quantitatively clarifying the relation between estimation precision and sampling frequency. Also shown is that the stepwise strategies are essential for both the tractable forms of the regularization terms and the derivation of the asymptotic properties of the Gaussian quasi-information criteria.

The proposed testing procedure is computationally efficient with the aid of a simple multiplier bootstrap method and does not involve any need to select tuning parameters, apart from the number of bootstrap replications. Other distinguishing features of the new procedure are that it imposes no structural assumptions on the unknown dependence structures of the predictor vector and allows the dimension of the predictor vector to be exponentially larger than sample size. To broaden the applicability, we further extend the preceding analysis to the censored response case.

In this paper, we consider an alternative model averaging approach, where estimates of treatment effects are obtained from not one single model but a weighted ensemble of models. We develop a weight choice method based on a minimisation of the approximate risk under squared error loss of the model average estimator of the conditional treatment effects. We prove that the model average estimator resulting from this criterion has an optimal asymptotic property. The results of a simulation study show that the proposed approach is superior to various existing model selection and averaging methods in a large region of the parameter space in finite samples.

  abstract     = {An old problem in multivariate statistics is that linear Gaussian models are often unidentifiable. In factor analysis, an orthogonal rotation of the factors is unidentifiable, while in linear regression, the direction of effect cannot be identified. For such linear models, non-Gaussianity of the (latent) variables has been shown to provide identifiability. In the case of factor analysis, this leads to independent component analysis, while in the case of the direction of effect, non-Gaussian versions of structural equation modeling solve the problem. More recently, we have shown how even general nonparametric nonlinear versions of such models can be estimated. Non-Gaussianity is not enough in this case, but assuming we have time series, or that the distributions are suitably modulated by observed auxiliary variables, the models are identifiable. This paper reviews the identifiability theory for the linear and nonlinear cases, considering both factor analytic and structural equation models.},
