  abstract     = {There is a parameter ubiquitous throughout the deep learning world: learning rate. There is likewise a ubiquitous question: what should that learning rate be? The true answer to this question is often tedious and time consuming to obtain, and a great deal of arcane knowledge has accumulated in recent years over how to pick and modify learning rates to achieve optimal training performance. Moreover, the long hours spent carefully crafting the perfect learning rate can come to nothing the moment your network architecture, optimizer, dataset, or initial conditions change ever so slightly. But it need not be this way. We propose a new answer to the great learning rate question: the Autonomous Learning Rate Controller. Find it at https://github.com/fastestimator/ARC/tree/v2.0 .},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new decision tree algorithm that accounts for time-varying covariates in the decision-making process. Traditional decision tree algorithms assume that the covariates are static and do not change over time, which can lead to inaccurate predictions in dynamic environments. Other existing methods suggest workaround solutions such as the pseudo-subject approach, discussed in the article. The proposed algorithm utilises a different structure and a time-penalised splitting criterion that allows a recursive partitioning of both the covariates space and time. Relevant historical trends are then inherently involved in the construction of a tree, and are visible and interpretable once it is fit. This approach allows for innovative and highly interpretable analysis in settings where the covariates are subject to change over time. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through a real-world data application in life insurance. The results presented in this article can be seen as an introduction or proof-of-concept of our time-penalised approach, and the algorithm’s theoretical properties and comparison against existing approaches on datasets from various fields, including healthcare, finance, insurance, environmental monitoring, and data mining in general, will be explored in forthcoming work.},

  abstract     = {Recommender Systems have become the backbone of personalized services that provide tailored experiences to individual users, yet designing new recommendation applications with limited or no available training data remains a challenge. To address this issue, we focus on selecting the universe of items for experimentation in recommender systems by leveraging a recently introduced combinatorial problem. On the one hand, selecting a large set of items is desirable to increase the diversity of items. On the other hand, a smaller set of items enables rapid experimentation and minimizes the time and the amount of data required to train machine learning models. We first present how to optimize for such conflicting criteria using a multi-level optimization framework. Then, we shift our focus to the operational setting of a recommender system. In practice, to work effectively in a dynamic environment where new items are introduced to the system, we need to explore users’ behaviors and interests continuously. To that end, we show how to integrate the item selection approach with active learning to guide randomized exploration in an ongoing fashion. Our hybrid approach combines techniques from discrete optimization, unsupervised clustering, and latent text embeddings. Experimental results on well-known movie and book recommendation benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of optimized item selection and efficient exploration.},

We propose an approach to learn a representation of preferences by a non-additive multiattribute utility function, namely a Choquet or bi-Choquet integral. This preference model is parameterized by one-dimensional utility functions measuring the attractiveness of consequences w.r.t. various point of views and one or two set functions (capacities) used to weight the coalitions and control the intensity of interactions among criteria, on the positive and possibly the negative sides of the utility scale. Our aim is to show how we can successively learn marginal utilities from properly chosen preference examples and then learn where the interactions matter in the overall model. We first present a preference elicitation method to learn spline representations of marginal utilities on every component of the model. Then we propose a sparse learning approach based on adaptive $$L_1$$ -regularization for determining a compact Möbius representation fitted to the observed preferences. We present numerical tests to compare different regularization methods. We also show the advantages of our approach compared to basic methods that do not seek sparsity or that force sparsity a priori by requiring k-additivity.},

And while prior studies have investigated how task conditions and group characteristics, such as personality or socio-demographic background, influence human decisions, no prior works have investigated how to use less personal information for choice prediction. We propose a deep learning model based on self-attention and cross-attention to model human decision making which takes into account both subject-specific information and task conditions. We show that our model can consistently predict human decisions more accurately than linear models and other baseline models while remaining interpretable. In addition, although a larger amount of subject specific information will generally lead to more accurate choice prediction, collecting more surveys to gather subject background information is a burden to subjects, as well as costly and time-consuming. To address this, we introduce a training scheme that reduces the number of surveys that must be collected in order to achieve more accurate predictions.},

In order to determine the parameters of these preference models, preference elicitation makes use of preference learning algorithms, usually taking as input holistic judgments, i.e., overall preferences on some of the alternatives, expressed by the decision maker. Tools to achieve this goal in the context of a ranking model based on multiple reference profiles are usually based on mixed-integer linear programming, Boolean satisfiability formulation or metaheuristics. However, they are usually unable to handle realistic problems involving many criteria and a large amount of input information.

A further common point of these settings is that agents generally submit preferences over issues (e.g., projects to be funded), each having a cost, and the goal is to find a feasible solution maximising the agents’ satisfaction under problem-specific constraints. We propose the use of judgment aggregation as a unifying framework to model these situations, which we refer to as collective combinatorial optimisation problems. Despite their shared underlying structure, collective combinatorial optimisation problems have so far been studied independently. Our formulation into judgment aggregation connects them, and we identify their shared structure via five case studies of well-known collective combinatorial optimisation problems, proving how popular rules independently defined for each problem actually coincide. We also chart the computational complexity gap that may arise when using a general judgment aggregation framework instead of a specific problem-dependent model.},

In this paper, we firstly present an exact algorithm for generating a n elements’ general capacity, usable when $$n &lt; 5$$ . Then, we present an improvement of the classical RNG by studying the distribution of the value of each element of a capacity. Furthermore, we divide it into two cases, the first one is the case without any conditions, and the second one is the case when some elements have been generated. Experimental results show that the performance of this improved algorithm is much better than the classical RNG while keeping a very reasonable computation time.},

As the underlying contest mechanism for our model we use the binary contest, where contestants’ strategy is captured by their decision whether or not to participate in the contest in the first place. Here, it is often the case that the contest organizer can proactively obtain and provide contestants information related to their expected performance in the contest. We provide a comprehensive equilibrium analysis of the model, showing that even when such information is costless, it is not necessarily the case that the contest organizer will prefer to obtain and provide it to all agents, let alone when the information is costly.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has shown that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) can serve as generative models of images using the perspective of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs). Such models offer exact likelihood calculation, and invertible generation/density estimation. In this work we introduce a Multi-Resolution variant of such models (MRCNF), by characterizing the conditional distribution over the additional information required to generate a fine image that is consistent with the coarse image. We introduce a transformation between resolutions that allows for no change in the log likelihood. We show that this approach yields comparable likelihood values for various image datasets, with improved performance at higher resolutions, with fewer parameters, using only one GPU. Further, we examine the out-of-distribution properties of MRCNFs, and find that they are similar to those of other likelihood-based generative models.},

In this context, we address the issue of binary classification in Banach spaces in presence of uncertainty. We show that a number of results from classical support vector machines theory can be appropriately generalized to their robust counterpart in Banach spaces. These include the representer theorem, strong duality for the associated optimization problem as well as their geometrical interpretation. Furthermore, we propose a game theoretical interpretation of the class separation problem when the underlying space is reflexive and smooth. The proposed Nash equilibrium formulation draws connections and emphasizes the interplay between class separation in machine learning and game theory in the general setting of Banach spaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes experiments showing that some tasks in natural language processing (NLP) can already be performed using quantum computers, though so far only with small datasets. We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubits, and a phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights onto a scoring qubit, using entangling quantum gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used to compute kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date. We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to understand sequences of words and formal concepts, investigate a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and introduce an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit entangling gates for simple verbs. The smaller systems presented have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained, but the quality of individual results varies much more using real datasets than using artificial language examples from previous quantum NLP research. Related NLP research is compared, partly with respect to contemporary challenges including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness.},

The probabilistic model consists of a stochastic process with an invariant probability measure that matches the density of the sample input data. The link between the two models is a potential function, $$U(\textbf{x})$$ , and its gradient, $$\nabla U(\textbf{x})$$ . We use the gradient to define the dissimilarity metric, which guarantees that our measure of dissimilarity will depend on the probability measure. Finally, we use the dissimilarity metric to define a coordinate system on the embedded Riemannian manifold, which gives us a low-dimensional encoding of our original data.},

  abstract     = {Nondeterministic planning is the process of computing plans or policies of actions achieving given goals, when there is nondeterministic uncertainty about the initial state and/or the outcomes of actions. This process encompasses many precise computational problems, from classical planning, where there is no uncertainty, to contingent planning, where the agent has access to observations about the current state. Fundamental to these problems is belief tracking, that is, obtaining information about the current state after a history of actions and observations. At an abstract level, belief tracking can be seen as maintaining and querying the current belief state, that is, the set of states consistent with the history. We take a knowledge compilation perspective on these processes, by defining the queries and transformations which pertain to belief tracking. We study them for propositional domains, considering a number of representations for belief states, actions, observations, and goals. In particular, for belief states, we consider explicit propositional representations with and without auxiliary variables, as well as implicit representations by the history itself; and for actions, we consider propositional action theories as well as ground PDDL and conditional STRIPS. For all combinations, we investigate the complexity of relevant queries (for instance, whether an action is applicable at a belief state) and transformations (for instance, revising a belief state by an observation); we also discuss the relative succinctness of representations. Though many results show an expected tradeoff between succinctness and tractability, we identify some interesting combinations. We also discuss the choice of representations by existing planners in light of our study.},

A switch is a Boolean vector whose function value differs from the value of the preceding Boolean vector in the truth table. The paper Čepek and Chromý (JAIR 2020) systematically studies the properties of SLRs and among other results gives polynomial-time algorithms for all standard queries investigated in the Knowledge Compilation Map introduced in Darwiche and Marquis (JAIR 2002). These queries include consistency check, validity check, clausal entailment check, implicant check, equivalence check, sentential entailment check, model counting, and model enumeration. The most difficult query supported in polynomial time by the smallest number of representation languages considered in the Knowledge Compilation Map is the sentential entailment check (of which the equivalence check is a special case). This query can be answered in polynomial time for SLRs, as shown in Čepek and Chromý (JAIR 2020). However, the query-answering algorithm is an indirect one: it first compiles both input SLRs into OBDDs (changing the order of variables for one of them if necessary) and then runs the sentential entailment check on the constructed OBDDs (both respecting the same order of variables) using an algorithm from the monograph by Wegener (2000). In this paper we present algorithms that answer both the equivalence and the sentential entailment query directly by manipulating the input SLRs (hence eliminating the compilation step into OBDD), which in both cases improves the time complexity of answering the query by a factor of n for input SLRs on n variables.},

  abstract     = {Given a Boolean relational specification $$F(\textbf{X}, \textbf{Y})$$ , where $$\textbf{X}$$ is a vector of inputs and $$\textbf{Y}$$ is a vector of outputs, Boolean functional synthesis requires us to compute a vector of (Skolem) functions $$\varvec{\Psi }(\textbf{X})$$ , one for each output in $$\textbf{Y}$$ , such that $$F(\textbf{X}, \varvec{\Psi }(\textbf{X})) \leftrightarrow \exists \textbf{Y}\,F(\textbf{X},\textbf{Y})$$ holds. This problem lies at the heart of many applications and has received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the role of representation of $$F(\textbf{X}, \textbf{Y})$$ and of $$\varvec{\Psi }(\textbf{X})$$ in determining the computational hardness of Boolean functional synthesis. We start by showing that an efficient way of existentially quantifying variables from a Boolean formula in a given order yields an efficient solution to Boolean functional synthesis and vice versa. We then propose a semantic normal form, called SynNNF, that guarantees polynomial-time synthesis and characterizes polynomial-time existential quantification for a given order of quantification of variables. We show that several syntactic and other semantic normal forms for Boolean formulas studied in the knowledge compilation literature are subsumed by SynNNF, and that SynNNF is exponentially more succinct than most of them. We also investigate how the representation of the synthesized (Skolem) functions $$\varvec{\Psi }(\textbf{X})$$ affects the complexity of Boolean functional synthesis, and present a map of complexity based on the representations of $$F(\textbf{X},\textbf{Y})$$ and $$\varvec{\Psi }(\textbf{X})$$ . Finally, we propose an algorithm to compile a specification represented as a NNF (including CNF) circuit to SynNNF. We present results of an extensive set of experiments conducted using an implementation of the above algorithm, and two other tools available in the public domain.},

With knowledge compilation, feature models can be compiled in a one-time effort to a target language that enables polynomial-time queries for otherwise more complex problems. In this work, we elaborate on the potential of employing knowledge compilation on feature models. First, we gather various feature-model analyses and study their computational complexity with regard to the underlying computational problem and the number of solver queries required for the respective analysis. Second, we collect knowledge-compilation target languages and map feature-model analyses to the languages that make the analysis tractable. Third, we empirically evaluate publicly available knowledge compilers to further inspect the potential benefits of knowledge-compilation target languages.},

Incorporating both cyber and physical parts to build a digital twin is challenging due to the high complexity of the requirements that should be addressed and satisfied during the design, implementation and operation. In this context, we introduce the MADTwin (Multi-Agent Digital Twin) framework driven by a Multi-agent Systems (MAS) paradigm and supported by flexible architecture and extendible upper ontology for modelling agent-based digital twins. A comprehensive case study of a smart warehouse supported by multi-robots has been presented to show the feasibility and applicability of this framework. The introduced framework powered by intelligent agents integrated with enabler technologies enabled us to cope with parts of the challenges imposed by modelling and integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with digital twins for multi-robots of the smart warehouse. In this framework, different components of CPS (robots) are represented as autonomous physical agents with their digital twin agents in the digital twin environment. Agents act autonomously and cooperatively to achieve their local goals and the objectives of the whole system. Eventually, we discuss the framework’s strengths and identify areas of improvement and plans for future work.},

  abstract     = {This work presents several new and efficient algorithms that can be used by negotiating agents to explore very large outcome spaces. The proposed algorithms can search for bids close to a utility target or above a utility threshold, and for win-win outcomes. While doing so, these algorithms strike a careful balance between being rapid, accurate, diverse, and scalable, allowing agents to explore spaces with as many as $$10^{250}$$ possible outcomes on very run-of-the-mill hardware. We show that our methods can be used to respond to the most common search queries employed by $$87\%$$ of all agents from the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition between 2010 and 2021. Furthermore, we integrate our techniques into negotiation platform GeniusWeb in order to enable existing state-of-the-art agents (and future agents) to handle very large outcome spaces.},

  abstract     = {Negotiation is a key form of interaction in multi-agent systems. Negotiation enables agents to come to a mutual agreement about a goal or plan of action. Current negotiation approaches use traditional interaction protocols which do not capture the normative meaning of interactions and often restrict agent autonomy. These traditional negotiation approaches also have difficulty specifying accountability. This paper seeks to address this gap in maintaining autonomy and capturing accountability during negotiation through the use of normative commitments. We propose Nala, a commitment-based negotiation semantics. Nala uses commitments to provide normative meaning to agent interactions. The nature of commitments support in capturing accountability through the violation of created commitments. We illustrate Nala’s usage via a case study using a game scenario where agents participate in negotiation to bring about their goals in a research constrained environment.},

Following this intensive development phase, the importance of integrating Bdi models with inconsistency handling and revision theory have been emphasized. There is also a demand for a tighter connection between Bdi-based implementations and Bdi logics. In this paper, we address these postulates by introducing a novel, paraconsistent logical Bdi model close to implementation, with building blocks that can be represented as Sql/rule-based databases. Importantly, tractability is achieved by reasoning as querying. This stands in a sharp contrast to the high complexity of known Bdi logics. We also extend belief shadowing, a shallow and lightweight alternative to deep and computationally demanding belief revision, to encompass agents’ motivational attitudes.},

  abstract     = {Agent Programming Languages have been studied for over 20 years for programming complex decision-making for autonomous systems. The GOAL agent programming language is particularly interesting since it depends on automated planning based on beliefs and goals to determine behavior rather than preprogrammed planning by developers. Model checking is a powerful verification technique to guarantee the safety of an autonomous system. Despite studies of model checking in other agent programming languages, GOAL lacks support for model checking of GOAL programs. The fundamental challenge is to make GOAL programs feasible for model checking. In this paper, we tackle this fundamental issue. First, we formalize the syntax and semantics of the logic underpinning stratified single-agent GOAL programs. Second, we devise an algorithm for transforming a stratified single-agent GOAL program to a transition system that is equivalent in terms of operational semantics, enabling model checking. Third, we develop an automated translator for a stratified single-agent GOAL program. The translator consists of (1) the automated transformation of a GOAL program into its operational semantically equivalent transition system, and (2) the interface generation of the generated transition system into a Prism model, an input for two probabilistic symbolic model checkers: Storm and Prism. Moreover, we point out that we will extend the applicability of the transformation algorithm and its implementation to all stratified GOAL programs.},

In this paper, we show how (artificial) agents can discover and exploit affordances in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) environment to achieve their goals. To indicate to agents what affordances are present in their environment and whether it is likely that these may help the agents to achieve their objectives, the environment may expose signifiers while taking into account the current situation of the environment and of the agent. On this basis, we define a Signifier Exposure Mechanism that is used by the environment to compute which signifiers should be exposed to agents in order to permit agents to only perceive information about affordances that are likely to be relevant to them, and thereby increase their interaction efficiency. If this is successful, agents can interact with partially observable environments more efficiently because the signifiers indicate the affordances they can exploit towards given purposes. Signifiers thereby facilitate the exploration and the exploitation of MAS environments. Implementations of signifiers and of the Signifier Exposure Mechanism are presented within the context of a Hypermedia Multi-Agent System, and the utility of this approach is presented through the development of a scenario.},

Finding stable features is important for creating reliable, non-overfitted feature sets, which in turn can be used to generate machine learning models with better accuracy and explanations and are less prone to adversarial attacks. There are currently several definitions of FS stability that are widely used. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing stability metrics fail to quantify certain key elements of many datasets such as resilience to data drift or non-uniformly distributed missing values. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new definition for FS stability inspired by Lyapunov stability in dynamic systems. We show the proposed definition is statistically different from the classical record-stability on ( $$n=90$$ ) datasets. We present the advantages and disadvantages of using Lyapunov and other stability definitions and demonstrate three scenarios in which each one of the three proposed stability metrics is best suited.},

Students forming groups for class projects, and hackathons in which software developers, graphic designers, project managers, and other domain experts collaborate on software projects, are typical scenarios modeled by HEGs. This game form possesses the common ranking property, and additionally, the coalitional utility function is monotone. We present comprehensive results for the existence/nonexistence of stable and efficient partitions of HEGs with respect to the most common stability and optimality concepts used in the literature. Specifically, we show that an HEG instance may not have a strict core stable partition, and yet every HEG instance has a strong Nash stable and Pareto optimal partition. Furthermore, it may be the case that none of the socially-optimal partitions of an HEG instance is Nash stable or core stable. However, it is guaranteed that every socially-optimal partition is contractually Nash stable. We show that all these existence/nonexistence results also hold for the monotone hedonic games with common ranking property (monotone HGCRP). We also present several results for HEGs from the computational complexity perspective, some of which are as follows: A contractually Nash stable partition (and a Nash stable partition in a restricted setting) can be found in polynomial time. A strong Nash stable partition can be approximated within a factor of $$1-1/e$$ , and this bound is tight even for approximating core stable partitions. We present a natural game dynamics for monotone HGCRP that converges to a Nash stable partition in a relatively low number of moves.},

In addition, we also modify their model to a more realistic setting in which the quota is indirectly changed during the addition or deletion of players (in a different sense than that of Zuckerman et al. [7] who manipulate the quota directly without changing the set of players), and we study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Nguyen et al. (2016) introduced altruistic hedonic games in which agents’ utilities depend not only on their own preferences but also on those of their friends in the same coalition. We propose to extend their model to coalition formation games in general, considering also the friends in other coalitions. Comparing our model to altruistic hedonic games, we argue that excluding some friends from the altruistic behavior of an agent is a major disadvantage that comes with the restriction to hedonic games. After introducing our model and showing some desirable properties, we additionally study some common stability notions and provide a computational analysis of the associated verification and existence problems.},

  abstract     = {Hedonic games are a prominent model of coalition formation, in which each agent’s utility only depends on the coalition she resides. The subclass of hedonic games that models the formation of general partnerships (Larson 2018), where all affiliates receive the same utility, is referred to as hedonic games with common ranking property (HGCRP). Aside from their economic motivation, HGCRP came into prominence since they are guaranteed to have core stable solutions that can be found efficiently (Farrell and Scotchmer Q. J. Econ. 103(2), 279–297 1988). We improve upon existing results by proving that every instance of HGCRP has a solution that is Pareto optimal, core stable, and individually stable. The economic significance of this result is that efficiency is not to be totally sacrificed for the sake of stability in HGCRP. We establish that finding such a solution is NP-hard even if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 3; however, it is polynomial time solvable if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 2. We show that the gap between the total utility of a core stable solution and that of the socially-optimal solution (OPT) is bounded above by n, where n is the number of agents, and that this bound is tight. Our investigations reveal that computing OPT is inapproximable within better than $$O(n^{1-\epsilon })$$ for any fixed $$\epsilon &gt; 0$$ , and that this inapproximability lower bound is polynomially tight. However, OPT can be computed in polynomial time if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 2.},

We previously introduced a notion of socially conscious stability for TCFGs, and introduced a game variant with fixed k-length tier lists. In this work we show that in tier lists under match-up oriented preferences, socially conscious stability is equivalent to Nash stability and to core stability, but in k-tier lists, the three stability notions are distinct. We also give a necessary condition for tier list stability in terms of robustness (the minimum in-tier utility of an agent). We introduce a notion of approximate Nash stability and approximately socially conscious stability, and provide experiments on the empirical run time of our k-tier local search algorithm, and the performance of our algorithms for generating approximately socially consciously stable tier lists.},

Different levels of sophistication were implemented to measure the performance of the RAMP approach. In the simpler level, (Dual-) RAMP explores more intensively the dual side of the problem, incorporating a Lagrangean Relaxation and Subgradient Optimization with a simple Improvement Method on the primal side. In the most sophisticated level, RAMP combines a Dual-Ascent procedure on the dual side with a Scatter Search (SS) procedure on primal side, forming the Primal–Dual RAMP (PD-RAMP). The Dual-RAMP algorithm starts with (dual side) the dualization of the initial problem, and then a projection method projects the dual solutions into the primal solutions space. Next, (primal side) the projected solutions are improved through an improvement method. In the PD-RAMP algorithm, the SS procedure is incorporated in the primal side to carry out a more intensive exploration. The algorithm alternates between the dual and the primal side until a fixed number of iterations is achieved. Computational experiments on a standard testbed for the UFLP were conducted to assess the performance of all the RAMP algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We study the stability of accuracy during the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this context, the training of a DNN is performed via the minimization of a cross-entropy loss function, and the performance metric is accuracy (the proportion of objects that are classified correctly). While training results in a decrease of loss, the accuracy does not necessarily increase during the process and may sometimes even decrease. The goal of achieving stability of accuracy is to ensure that if accuracy is high at some initial time, it remains high throughout training. A recent result by Berlyand, Jabin, and Safsten introduces a doubling condition on the training data, which ensures the stability of accuracy during training for DNNs using the absolute value activation function. For training data in $$\mathbb {R}^n$$ , this doubling condition is formulated using slabs in $$\mathbb {R}^n$$ and depends on the choice of the slabs. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, to make the doubling condition uniform, that is, independent of the choice of slabs. This leads to sufficient conditions for stability in terms of training data only. In other words, for a training set T that satisfies the uniform doubling condition, there exists a family of DNNs such that a DNN from this family with high accuracy on the training set at some training time $$t_0$$ will have high accuracy for all time $$t&gt;t_0$$ . Moreover, establishing uniformity is necessary for the numerical implementation of the doubling condition. We demonstrate how to numerically implement a simplified version of this uniform doubling condition on a dataset and apply it to achieve stability of accuracy using a few model examples. The second goal is to extend the original stability results from the absolute value activation function to a broader class of piecewise linear activation functions with finitely many critical points, such as the popular Leaky ReLU.},

Many popular automated reasoning paradigms provide users with languages supporting optimization statements: answer set programming or MaxSAT or min-one, to name a few. These paradigms vary significantly in their languages and in the ways they express quality conditions on computed solutions. Here we propose a unifying framework of so-called weight systems that eliminates syntactic distinctions between paradigms and allows us to see essential similarities and differences between optimization statements provided by paradigms. This unifying outlook has significant simplifying and explanatory potential in the studies of optimization and modularity in automated reasoning and knowledge representation. It also supplies researchers with a convenient tool for proving the formal properties of distinct frameworks; bridging these frameworks; and facilitating the development of translational solvers.},

A player is potentially satisfied with a profile of contributed resources when his bundle could be extracted from the contributed resources. Resource contention occurs when the players who are potentially satisfied, cannot actually all obtain their bundle. The player’s preferences are always single-minded (they consider a profile good or they do not) and parsimonious (between two profiles that are equally good, they prefer the profile where they contribute less). What makes a profile of contributed resources good for a player depends on their attitude towards resource contention. We study the problem of deciding whether an outcome is a pure Nash equilibrium for three kinds of players’ attitudes towards resource contention: public contention-aversity, private contention-aversity, and contention-tolerance. In particular, we demonstrate that in the general case when the players are contention-averse, then the problem is harder than when they are contention-tolerant. We then identify a natural class of games where, in presence of contention-averse preferences, it becomes tractable, and where there is always a Nash equilibrium.},

In this paper, a novel Clustering Obstacles (CO)-based path planning algorithm for mobile robots is presented using a quintic trigonometric Bézier curve and its two shape parameters. The CO-based algorithm forms clusters of geometrically shaped obstacles and finds the cluster centers. Moreover, the proposed waypoint algorithm (WP) finds the waypoints of the predefined skeleton path in addition to the start and destination points in an environment. Based on all these points, the predefined quintic trigonometric Bézier path candidates, taking the skeleton path as their convex hull, are then generated using the shape parameters of this curve. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with K-Means and agglomerative hierarchical algorithms to obtain the quintic trigonometric Bézier paths desired by the user. The experimental results show that the CO-based path planning algorithm achieves better cluster centers and consequently better collision-free predefined paths.},

  abstract     = {Road network studies attracted unprecedented and overwhelming interest in recent years due to the clear relationship between human existence and city evolution. Current studies cover many aspects of a road network, for example, road feature extraction from video/image data, road map generalisation, traffic simulation, optimisation of optimal route finding problems, and traffic state prediction. However, analysing road networks as a complex graph is a field to explore. This study presents comparative studies on the Porto, in Portugal, road network sections, mainly of Matosinhos, Paranhos, and Maia municipalities, regarding degree distributions, clustering coefficients, centrality measures, connected components, k-nearest neighbours, and shortest paths. Further insights into the networks took into account the community structures, page rank, and small-world analysis. The results show that the information exchange efficiency of Matosinhos is 0.8, which is 10 and 12.8% more significant than that of the Maia and Paranhos networks, respectively. Other findings stated are: (1) the studied road networks are very accessible and densely linked; (2) they are small-world in nature, with an average length of the shortest pathways between any two roads of 29.17 units, which as found in the scenario of the Maia road network; and (3) the most critical intersections of the studied network are ’Avenida da Boavista, 4100-119 Porto (latitude: 41.157944, longitude: − 8.629105)’, and ’Autoestrada do Norte, Porto (latitude: 41.1687869, longitude: − 8.6400656)’, based on the analysis of centrality measures.},

  abstract     = {Many recent studies have shown that Fractal Dimension (FD), a ratio for figuring out the complexity of a system given its measurements, can be used as an useful index to provide information about certain brain disease. Our research focuses on the Alzheimer’s disease changes in white and grey brain matters detected through the FD indexes of their contours. Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative database (Normal Condition, N = 57, and Alzheimer’s Disease, N = 60). After standard preprocessing pipeline, the white and grey matter 3D FD indexes are computed for the two groups. A statistical analysis shows that only grey matter 3D FD indexes are able to differentiate healthy and AD subjects. Although white matter 3D FD indexes do not, it is remarkable that their presence enhance the separation capability of previous ones. In order to valuate the classification capability of these indexes on healthy and AD subjects, we define several Neural Networks models. The performances of these models vary according to the statistical analysis and reach their best performances when each 3D FD input index is changed into a sequence of 2D FD indexes of (a subset of) the horizontal slices of the white and grey matter volumes.},

It is extended by using three dimensional objects namely tetrahedral tiles and the patterns generated are used to decorate floors and walls. In the literature k-Tabled Tetrahedral Tile Pasting System (k-TTTPS) and Tetrahedral Tile Pasting P System (TetTPPS) were introduced to generate tetrahedral picture patterns. In this paper, Controlled Tabled Tetrahedral Tile Pasting System (CTTTPS) is proposed to generate tetrahedral picture patterns and CTTTPS is compared with k-TTTPS and TetTPPS in terms of generative powers. It is proved that CTTTPS has more generative power than the generative powers of k-TTTPS and TetTPPS. Extended Tetrahedral Tile Pasting System (ETTPS) and Extended Tetrahedral Tile Pasting P System (ETTPPS) are also proposed in this paper and are compared with CTTTPS in terms of their generative powers. This study has connections with pattern recognition and image analysis with applications in tiling of tetrahedral patterns.},

  abstract     = {Families of new, multi-level integer 2D arrays are introduced here as an extension of the well-known binary Legendre sequences that are derived from quadratic residues. We present a construction, based on Fourier and Finite Radon Transforms, for families of periodic perfect arrays, each of size $$p\times p$$ for many prime values p. Previously delta functions were used as the discrete projections which, when back-projected, build 2D perfect arrays. Here we employ perfect sequences as the discrete projected views. The base family size is $$p+1$$ . All members of these multi-level array families have perfect autocorrelation and constant, minimal cross-correlation. Proofs are given for four useful and general properties of these new arrays. 1) They are comprised of odd integers, with values between at most $$-p$$ and $$+p$$ , with a zero value at just one location. 2) They have the property of ‘conjugate’ spatial symmetry, where the value at location (i, j) is always the negative of the value at location $$(p-i, p-j)$$ . 3) Any change in the value assigned to the array’s origin leaves all of its off-peak autocorrelation values unchanged. 4) A family of $$p+1$$ , $$p\times p$$ arrays can be compressed to size $$(p+1)^2$$ and each family member can be exactly and rapidly unpacked in a single $$p\times p$$ decompression pass.},

  abstract     = {A digitized rigid motion is called digitally continuous if two neighbor pixels still stay neighbors after the motion. This concept plays important role when people or computers (artificial intelligence, machine vision) need to recognize the object shown in the image. In this paper, digital rotations of a pixel with its closest neighbors are of our interest. We compare the neighborhood motion map results among the three regular grids, when the center of rotation is the midpoint of a main pixel, a grid point (corner of a pixel) or an edge midpoint. The first measure about the quality of digital rotations is based on bijectivity, e.g., measuring how many of the cases produce bijective and how many produce not bijective neighborhood motion maps (Avkan et. al, 2022). Now, a second measure is investigated, the quality of bijective digital rotations is measured by the digital continuity of the resulted image: we measure how many of the cases are bijective and also digitally continuous. We show that rotations on the triangular grid prove to be digitally continuous at many more real angles and also as a special case, many more integer angles compared to the square grid or to the hexagonal grid with respect to the three different rotation centers.},

  abstract     = {Topological representations of binary digital images usually take into consideration different adjacency types between colors. Within the cubical-voxel 3D binary image context, we design an algorithm for computing the isotopic model of an image, called (6, 26)-Homological Region Adjacency Tree ((6, 26)-Hom-Tree). This algorithm is based on a flexible graph scaffolding at the inter-voxel level called Homological Spanning Forest model (HSF). Hom-Trees are edge-weighted trees in which each node is a maximally connected set of constant-value voxels, which is interpreted as a subtree of the HSF. This representation integrates and relates the homological information (connected components, tunnels and cavities) of the maximally connected regions of constant color using 6-adjacency and 26-adjacency for black and white voxels, respectively (the criteria most commonly used for 3D images). The Euler-Poincaré numbers (which may as well be computed by counting the number of cells of each dimension on a cubical complex) and the connected component labeling of the foreground and background of a given image can also be straightforwardly computed from its Hom-Trees. Being $$I_D$$ a 3D binary well-composed image (where D is the set of black voxels), an almost fully parallel algorithm for constructing the Hom-Tree via HSF computation is implemented and tested here. If $$I_D$$ has $$m_1{\times } m_2{\times } m_3$$ voxels, the time complexity order of the reproducible algorithm is near $$O(\log (m_1{+}m_2{+}m_3))$$ , under the assumption that a processing element is available for each cubical voxel. Strategies for using the compressed information of the Hom-Tree representation to distinguish two topologically different images having the same homological information (Betti numbers) are discussed here. The topological discriminatory power of the Hom-Tree and the low time complexity order of the proposed implementation guarantee its usability within machine learning methods for the classification and comparison of natural 3D images.},

This inference mechanism was empirically proved to be efficient in several reasoning and classification tasks. In the latter case, it relies on the notion of analogy preservation. In this paper, we explore this relation between formal models of analogy and the corresponding classes of analogy preserving functions, and we establish a Galois theory of analogical classifiers. We illustrate the usefulness of this Galois framework over Boolean domains, and we explicitly determine the closed sets of analogical classifiers, i.e., classifiers that are compatible with the analogical inference, for each pair of Boolean analogies.},
