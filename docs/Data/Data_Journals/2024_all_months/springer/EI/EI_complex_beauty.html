  abstract     = {Skin disorders significantly impact quality of life, necessitating advanced diagnostic tools. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer promising solutions. ML aids in image segmentation and lesion classification, while DL captures intricate features for improved accuracy. Challenges include limited annotated data, the ‘black box’ nature of AI decision-making, and seamless integration into clinical workflows. Recent advancements such as development of ML and DL algorithms and availability of publicly available datasets, hold promise for earlier diagnoses and improved outcomes in dermatology. Building ML and DL models robust to variations in image quality, lighting conditions, and patient demographics is hence, paramount to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of skin image analysis in clinical practice. In conclusion, while ML and DL techniques show promise, exploring hybrid approaches combining the strengths of both could lead to more robust diagnostic tools for dermatology, revolutionizing skin disorder diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract     = {In many industrial real-world environments, scheduling necessitates continual reactive adjustments due to unpredictable perturbations, leading to the dynamic transformation of predefined static schedules. In this paper, we introduce a new framework named a two-level evolutionary algorithm (2LEA) as a comprehensive approach for addressing the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem. The 2LEA is based on a bi-level optimization design, where the upper level is dedicated to solving the general flexible job shop scheduling problem, and the lower level is used as a new evolutionary operator guided by a probability rate in the upper level, focusing on the optimization of operation sequences. This framework is capable of handling four dynamic events job insertion, job cancellation, machine breakdown, and job replacement using a predictive-reactive rescheduling strategy. By addressing the previously unexplored dynamic event of job replacement, this paper fills a significant gap in the literature and opens avenues for further research. Extensive computational experiments conducted on well-known benchmark instances from the Brandimarte and Hurink datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed scheduling algorithm. Our results showcase the superior performance of 2LEA over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality, affirming its potential as a leading solution for both static and dynamic scheduling challenges.},

  abstract     = {Self-awareness is a subject that has intrigued the research community for a long time and is an object of extensive experimental research. Over the years, multiple studies and experiments probed different aspects, functions and manifestations of self-awareness in animals and humans. From these results, several intriguing questions arose: is self-awareness a general phenomenon based on some common laws and principles of organization and processing information about sensory environments? Are different manifestations of self-awareness demonstrated in multiple experiments interrelated on some common basis, or unrelated and disparate? In this work, we set out to approach these questions on the basis of the perspective of organization and processing of the information about the sensory environment of an intelligent system, external and internal. We conjecture that a possible basis for understanding the development and evolution of self-awareness can be the theory of complex coordinated intelligent responses that require a coordination of multiple “atomic” intelligent actions to achieve the best possible outcome for the intelligent system. In this approach, self-awareness can emerge naturally as an information model of the sensory environments that facilitates the production of effective responses via selection by the fitness to the environment, measured by the success of empirical trials. We consider different types and levels of self-awareness examined in studies and experiments and discuss how they can be connected with the organization and functions of the information model of the environment involved in the formation of intelligent responses. The information approach to self-awareness is used then to discuss possible directions of evolution of the information models in the natural and artificial intelligent systems.},

  abstract     = {The traditional target tracking algorithm can only utilize the information of a single sensor and cannot fully utilize the advantages of multiple sensors. To address this issue, this study designs a multi-sensor target tracking algorithm based on node capacity planning and distributed collaboration. First, aiming at the problem of distributed tracking application in multi-sensor networks, a wireless sensor target tracking algorithm based on node energy constraints is constructed. By constructing a node tracking model, the energy consumption is reduced according to the distributed connection network and node planning is introduced. Then, for sensor networks with limited energy, a node planning algorithm using convex relaxation method is developed to solve complex integer programming problems. Finally, in view of the various complex problems existing in the sensor network, a distributed social learning algorithm based on its own data and neighboring decision-making is established. This algorithm ultimately improves the performance of the multi-sensor target tracking algorithm by transmitting decisions about environmental states. The results demonstrated that in the convergence comparison between the TrackingNet dataset and the MOT 15 dataset, the convergence of research algorithm began to stabilize when the system was iterated 106 and 48 times, respectively. In addition, when the system iterated to 200 and 157 times, the error of the algorithm slowly began to level off and was at a smaller value. The above results show that the research algorithm has achieved better performance in multi-sensor target tracking tasks. It can better handle the relationship between targets and improve the effect of target tracking.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness of people. Detecting DR at the earliest stage is essential to prevent irreversible eye damage. Microaneurysm dots are the first signs of DR. As the dots are tiny and of low contrast, detecting mild DR is a very challenging task. Federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy, which is a major concern for medical image processing. FL is a collaborative learning method, which shares only the model parameters with a server, without sharing the patient data to a central server. Inspired by classical FL, we propose a federated learning-based quantum neural network (federated QNN) for this task. We implemented the models with limited samples and few learnable parameters from the E-ophtha and Retina MNIST datasets. The cross-evaluation efficiency of the proposed federated quantum neural network system for privacy-preserving early detection of diabetic retinopathy (FQPDR) in Kaggle dataset images indicates the robustness of the light weight learning models. FQPDR performances are inspiring while considering existing non-FL and FL methods.},

There is a need to optimize the values of necessary street lighting parameters for energy planning. So, an artificial neural network embedded genetic algorithm approach is proposed to obtain energy efficient street lighting. The neural network serves the purpose of the autonomous dimming of streetlights whenever required, while the genetic algorithm is utilized to minimize the error anticipating in the training procedure of the artificial neural network model. In the proposed work, each individual population of the genetic algorithm is comprised of four genes, such as the number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons on the first layer in the artificial neural network, the activation function and the optimizer used for the training of the artificial neural network model. The outcome of the genetic algorithm generates the suitable values of the hyper-parameters in combinations, which in turn determines the minimum training error for the artificial neural network model. The effectiveness of tuning hyper-parameters for selecting the best neural network architecture is comprehensively assessed. The computation time of the proposed work for different variations in terms of optimizers and activation functions is shown. Finally, the proposed embedded framework has shown an improvement of 41.94% more energy efficiency and 94.8% less training error, instead of existing works.},

However, prior datasets and studies have primarily focused on recognizing facial expressions in controlled environments, limiting their generalizability to realistic context.

In this work, we propose an ensemble model based on multi-task meta-learner that utilizes a pool of CNN classifiers while dynamically selecting and fusing the optimal ensemble in order to recognize facial expressions more effectively in the wild. The suggested scheme leverages the output probabilities of base learners as meta-features, and integrates multi-label classification into dynamic ensemble selection. As best as we know, this is the first investigation of multi-task learning at the meta-learning level in the context of facial expression recognition. In particular, we introduce an effective meta-learner that combines the strengths of stacking and dynamic ensemble selection. The proposed approach has been evaluated exhaustively on several challenging datasets; including RAF-DB, FER2013, and FERPlus; and the obtained results demonstrate that the ensemble CNN outperforms individual CNN models consistently, while achieving high performance across all datasets. We further demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach by performing cross-dataset evaluation.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the development of metaheuristic algorithms based on the search process and collection of the oysters (living or non-living) from the sea bed in the day time. In the coastal belt, during tides, oysters are pushed by the water waves and gathered in specific places on the sea bed. For living oysters, they are generally found in the cold-water region, but for non-living shells, they can be found anywhere in the sea bed, depending on the blow of the wind and the path of the water wave. Since oysters have many economic values (because indoor decoration, ornaments and gift packs etc. are made using these sea shells), people from coastal zones usually collect them and plan for one of the best jobs/ trades in their social life. Inspiring from the nature of the collection procedure of the shells, we construct mathematical functions of the search path along which it can be available more. Utilizing this procedure into the field of optimization, we have found some noble results of a benchmark problem. Basically, we fit an appropriate test function for a benchmark problem, then some numeric experimental results are computed via oyster collection algorithms. A comparative study has also been made to validate the proposed approach. Moreover, considering the normality of the data, we have studied confidence intervals and analyzed statistically for the global acceptance of the method. It is also seen that the root mean square error (RMSE) for our proposed algorithms is 0.004007 and that for the other existing algorithms it becomes 0.007015. This gives the excellence success rate in the field of optimization with respect to others all the time. Indeed, the graphical illustrations show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and, finally, a conclusion is made about keeping some scope for future works.},

  abstract     = {The Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem is crucial in the energy industry as it assists in reducing the operating costs of the generators and helps to mitigate the ensuing adverse environmental impact. The optimization of CEED can also lead to the development of new technologies for clean-energy production and utilization. Particle swarm optimization and its derived methodologies are widely used for the solution of such problems and they commonly face issues related to swarm diversity, convergence rate, falling in local optima, etc. We propose a novel Chi-square mutated Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO-Chi2) method for a more competent solution of CEED. For establishing efficacy, an extensive validation was done for the proposed method, using standard benchmark functions and a comparison is made with conventional PSO and other variants of QPSO such as Uniform, Gaussian, Exponential and Cauchy distributions. Further, the comparison has been extended to latest state-of-the-art algorithms for numerical optimization such as EA4eig (IEEE CEC-2022), jDE100, j2020, j21 and jSO. The algorithm is tested with three practical CEED cases (6, 10 and 40 units). Analysis was done for the results obtained with various established methods from the literature as well as with other variants of QPSO. The research asserts that the QPSO-Chi2 method excels in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming numerous established methods. The QPSO-Chi2 method achieved an overall maximum cost reduction and transmission loss of 5.16% and 6.23% respectively relative to other approaches. Two novel performance evaluation strategies viz. performance plots and normalized coefficients of deviation are implemented to inspect the potential of the proposed QPSO-Chi2.},

  abstract     = {The non-waiting constraint is a crucial factor in industries with continuous production flows. Recognizing the significance of this constraint in the manufacturing process, we propose several approaches to minimize the maximum tardiness in the no-wait manufacturing flow shop scheduling problem. This research presents two main approaches: an exact method that utilizes mixed integer linear programming and an approximate method based on constructive heuristics and hybrid meta-heuristics. To tackle the problem, we introduce multiple heuristics and hybrid improved meta-heuristics based Nawaz Enscore Ham, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, we propose three hybrid meta-heuristics based on the simulated annealing approach. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of our methods, we conducted experiments on multiple instances of the flow shop problem proposed by Taillard. The results demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm, which combines a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure with the insertion procedure and simulated annealing, exhibits strong performance. In fact, this algorithm achieved a success rate of $$72\%$$ across 200 test instances. It outperformed the other two meta-heuristics, with a minimum average relative percentage deviation of only $$0.0039\%$$ .},

  abstract     = {In European studies, the most used definition of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) is based on the European Urban Atlas, which includes public green areas primarily used for recreation and green areas adjacent to urban areas that are managed or utilized for recreational purposes. UGS play a vital role in creating sustainable and resilient cities, as they provide essential social benefits for the well-being and health of urban residents. Both planners and scientists acknowledge the importance of involving, actively or passively, citizens in defining criteria for designing and managing inclusive and functional UGS. According to a post-normal science approach, the integration of hard data from scientific sources with soft data gathered from citizens’ engagement holds the potential to shape an innovative support system for public policies addressing significant, urgent, and uncertain challenges pertaining to UGS. Nowadays, the abundance of data generated through online reviews, opinions, and comments allows for collecting valuable information about people’s opinions and sentiments towards UGS. This study proposes a methodological framework that utilizes emotion detection techniques to identify and analyze citizens’ emotions concerning UGS through social reviews. To balance computational costs and classification accuracy, the framework introduces a fuzzy emotion-based classification method called FREDoC (Fuzzy Relevance Emotions Document Classification). This method incorporates a lightweight natural language pro-cessing (NLP) approach to detect and annotate terms associated with specific emotional categories within the text. The framework adopts the psycho-evolutionary classification approach based on R. Plutchik’s observations of general emotional responses. This model is implemented within a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the purpose of categorizing UGS, specifically green parks, according both to WHO report key indicators and to the detected relevant emotions. The outcome is a novel classification model of UGS that can assist decision-makers in identifying the attractiveness of UGS as catalysts for urban transformation processes.},

OJESMA improves the performance of the algorithm by combining strategies based on opposition-based learning, joint opposite selection, and equilibrium optimizer. First, we introduce an adversarial learning-opposition-based learning, in generating the initial population of slime molds. Second, we incorporate a joint inverse selection strategy, including selective leading opposition and dynamic opposite. Finally, we introduce the balanced candidate principle of the equilibrium optimizer algorithm into SMA, which enhances the algorithm&#39;s optimal search capability and anti-stagnation ability. We conducted optimization search experiments on 29 test functions from CEC2017 and 10 benchmark test functions from CEC2020, as well as nonparametric statistical analysis (Friedman and Wilcoxon). The experimental results and non-parametric test results show that OJESMA has better optimization accuracy, convergence performance, and stability. To further validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we also performed optimization tests on six engineering problems and the variable index Muskingum. In summary, OJESMA demonstrates its practical value and advantages in solving various complex optimization problems with its excellent performance, providing new perspectives and methods for the development of optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning systems have been used extensively in several fields in recent years, but deep neural network (DNN) can also make incorrect decisions and lead to significant losses. Testing tasks based on DNN systems often require annotation of test data to obtain oracle information. However, collecting and annotating large amounts of disparate data from application scenarios is very expensive and time consuming. Thus, we propose DeepSense, an effective neural network test prioritization technique, to select more test inputs that reveal neural network faults as early as possible in the unlabeled test dataset. DeepSense considers the full range of model fault detection capabilities, including faults near the boundary and near the centroid of class. To be specific, we first designed multiple mutation features and extracted them from the neural network model and input samples based on different mutation operators. Then, the sample embedding features are extracted to construct an undirected weighted graph, and a random walk is performed to calculate the distance similarity and manifold similarity, and then spatial nearest neighbor features are designed and extracted. Finally, MLP is used to combine multiple mutation features and spatial nearest neighbor features to predict the input sample fault revealing ability and set priorities accordingly. We evaluate DeepSense on four popular image datasets, and results show that DeepSense significantly outperforms existing test input prioritization techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the well-known NP-hard problem, the Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (STSP), which has numerous applications in logistics and graph theory. To solve this complex problem, a discrete version of the Marine Predators Algorithm (D-MPA) is introduced. Although MPA has been extensively studied for various optimization problems and real-world applications, its use in routing problems, particularly TSP, remains relatively unexplored. To adapt MPA for STSP, the positions of individuals are initially updated using the classical MPA algorithm. The continuous values generated by the classical MPA are then converted to discrete values, followed by the application of a permutation operator to maintain diversity in the population. In addition, a local search algorithm, 2-opt, is applied to further improve the results for STSP instances. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on STSP benchmark instances of sizes ranging from 14 to 439. The performance of D-MPA is compared against several existing algorithms, including the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Bat Algorithm (BA), Discrete Firefly Algorithm (DFA), Evolutionary Simulated Annealing (ESA), Island-Based Distributed Genetic Algorithm (IDGA), Discrete Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (DICA), and Discrete Grey Wolf Optimization (DGWO). To ensure an unbiased and rigorous comparison, descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation are used, and a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test is conducted for statistical validation. The results demonstrate that D-MPA not only competes, but also consistently outperforms these algorithms, making it a valuable resource for the research community.},

  abstract     = {Italy offers a cultural heritage of considerable value that needs to be protected. Indeed, natural deterioration linked to the passage of time affects ancient artifacts and buildings. Sometimes, the deterioration compromises the functionality of cultural assets, pushing them toward decay. In this scenario, effective intervention seems impossible on the various critical points because of the wide variability of factors involved and the wide range of possible treatments. However, the spread of low-cost technologies has led to the possibility of having different devices and sensors able to communicate and interact with each other and humans: the Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario, the IoT paradigm makes it possible to map reality by defining a coherent virtual representation (Digital Twin), which could help preserve Cultural Heritage. This work introduces an IoT-based system combining monitoring, predictive maintenance, and decision-making regarding the implementable interventions for protecting cultural heritage buildings. For this purpose, deep and machine learning techniques allow for the detection and classification of damages on specific materials. The experimental phase consists of two phases: the first aims to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed architecture, and the second exploits a prototype capable of interacting with expert users. The results of the experimental campaign are promising.},

Firstly, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the topology structure between the source node and the target node, presenting four different transmission paths. Secondly, in order to characterize the initial resources, the paper defines the effective resource amount after transmission through these four paths as the resource broadcast amount between nodes. Lastly, the similarity between nodes is characterized bidirectionally by considering the resource broadcast amount between nodes. Experiments conducted on 9 real network datasets demonstrate that, when compared with 8 other similarity-based indicators, this method achieves better prediction results according to benchmark evaluation indicators.},

Accurate forecasting of future carbon pricing enables industries to modify their operations, encouraging the adoption of eco-friendly technology and procedures. This coordination of activities, including carbon pricing plans, emission reduction targets, and environmentally friendly behaviors, not only addresses climate change issues but also aligns well with sustainable development goals related to clean energy, climate action, and sustainable economies. To tackle this issue, a hybrid approach is introduced by integrating the Improved Electric Fish Optimization (IEFO) with the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), creating a robust framework for forecasting the carbon price. The proposed IEFO algorithm, representing an enhanced version of the Electric Fish Optimization (EFO), integrates the searching strategy of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to boost exploration capabilities, enabling more effective exploration of new areas and efficient escape from local optima. By strategically combining EFO’s active search with WOA’s localized exploration strategy, the IEFO-ANFIS model excels in capturing intricate carbon price dynamics and enhances forecasting accuracy. The efficacy of the IEFO-ANFIS model is rigorously demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, showing its superior performance across five datasets, namely BeijingETS, CEHD, GuangzhouETS, HubeiETS, and TianjinETS. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed IEFO-ANFIS model in accurately forecasting carbon prices. Additionally, the results show remarkable performance of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the results show that the proposed IEFO-ANFIS model can assist policymakers in developing efficient carbon pricing plans, supporting a more seamless shift to a low-carbon economy without disrupting markets.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications across various research domains. This surge in interest has led to the development of numerous detection techniques, predominantly based on distance or density metrics. A notable limitation of these existing methods is their reliance on parameter adjustments, significantly affecting the outcome. Additionally, these methods exhibit intrinsic flaws: distance-based approaches struggle with clusters with varying local densities, while density-based methods fail to identify patterns within low-density areas. Moreover, most prior techniques are adept at identifying only one kind of outlier—local, global, or group of outliers. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Adaptive Radius Density-Based Outlier Detection (ARDOD) method, which departs from the traditional parameter-dependent approach. ARDOD is a novel parameter-free algorithm that dynamically determines the necessary parameters based on the data distribution within the feature space. This innovative method demonstrates robust performance in detecting all three categories of outliers. The efficacy and superior performance of ARDOD are validated through an extensive experimental analysis involving various synthetic and real-world datasets. This analysis showcases ARDOD&#39;s advantages over seven established methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD), Robust Distance-Based Outlier Score (RDOS), Directed density ratio Changing Rate-based outlier detection (DCROD), Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection(ECOD), mean-shift outlier detector(MOD +),and Local–Global Outlier Detection (LGOD), underscoring its potential as a versatile tool in outlier detection research.},

  abstract     = {Accurate logistics cost enables efficient and cost-effective planning of transportation systems. It facilitates the fast, on-time, and seamless transportation of goods between the cities. Existing cost models are based on the unit transportation cost of goods, which could be more realistic and accurate. In this work, we introduce a new cost function based on the unit transportation cost of a truck to overcome the undercharging or overcharging issues in the existing cost functions. The proposed cost function best suits the government and industry when developing the facilities. This work also presents the logistic transportation problem, formulation of a cost function using integer programming, and methodology to solve the transportation problem using meta-heuristic algorithms. In addition, we construct a new transportation problem for one district-one product (ODOP) using real-world scenarios and data. ODOP is an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Government for the balanced economic development of the state in India. We solve this 18 cities problem using eight meta-heuristic algorithms. Our experimental simulation finds an optimal logistics cost of Rs. 2159140.00/- for four logistics hubs and 14 distribution/collection centres. Our observation also identifies the dependency of network configuration over various factors like establishment/rental and operational cost, the unit cost of transportation, and the capacity of vehicles instead of only on product supply and demand of goods/products. Our evaluation also reports an 80% consistent result by the anti-predatory nature-inspired algorithm compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mental health plays an important role for how a person act, think and feel. Specially in the case of students it’s become very crucial and they suffer from various kind of mental disorders due to educational, emotional and societal pressure. This paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence enabled cognitive computer-centered digital analysis model for the examination of children’s mental health. The objective of children mental health analysis using vocal spectrogram, a pseudo-scientific technology, is to deduce deceit from mental health that is detected in the voice. With excessive stress being viewed as an indication of deceit, the technology seeks to distinguish between good mental health and bad mental health outputs in response to stimuli. In this study, we provide a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) based cognitive computer-based model for detecting children mental health based on speech cues and deep learning. Automatic children mental health detection is developing into an intriguing study topic since communication between intelligent systems and humans is demanded to happen more frequently. Although the level of particular hormones, like as cortisol, can be accurately measured to identify children’s mental health. Proposed CNN model validation is done using five different usability factors (learnability, efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction and understandability) to assess its utility and effectiveness and the results of the initial tests indicate that the proposed model provides a promis- ing tool for the examination of children’s mental health. This paper also discusses how Reinforcement Learning (RL) and CNN algorithms can be used for continuous improvement of the proposed model.},

This paper proposes an operational unit called Map-and-Acquisition (MA) to compute the attention of different feature vectors in convolutional neural networks based on simple mathematical principles. Inspired by the convolution operation, MA extends the convolution operator to integrate spatial or channel features in the local receptive field to the global spatial or channel, and only operates on one dimension of the image feature, avoiding a series of problems caused by the coupling of spatial and channel dimensions. The feature response of the channel or spatial domain is adaptively adjusted through the weighting and summing operator to better extract the high-level features of the image. Our method is verified through image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation on the ImageNet-1K and COCO 2017 datasets, and is also evaluated on the small-sample image classification task on the dataset mini-Imagenet.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel decomposition method named Adjacent Intensity Matrix with Linkage Identification (ALI) which collaborates with the Cooperative Coevolution (CC) framework to solve large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) in noisy environments. Conventional Differential Grouping (DG)-based methods in the CC framework can detect the interactions by the absolute interaction intensity. In noisy environments, the uncertainty of fitness will be amplified and the absolute interaction intensity is easily larger than the threshold, which results in all decision variables being grouped into one component. Although it is difficult to detect interactions through absolute interaction intensity in noisy environments, the relative difference between separable and non-separable decision variables may exist, which can help us determine the separability to form the sub-components. We propose the Adjacent Intensity Matrix (AIM) by an additive identification criterion and determine the significant intensity (SI) to classify the interactions by learning the regularity of intensity. Since the conventional performance indicator of decomposition accuracy (DA) cannot fully reflect the inner structure of a non-separable sub-component, we introduce a more rigorous metric to evaluate the decomposition named the similarity of dependency structure matrix ( $$S_{DSM}$$ ). In the optimization phase after the decomposition, we employ an advanced optimizer named Modified Differential Evolution with Distance-based Selection (MDE-DS) to adapt to noisy environments. Experimental results on the CEC2013 Suite with noise show that our proposal has a broad prospect to solve LSOPs in noisy environments.},

The objective of this paper is to introduce a hybrid model that merges a recurrent adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (RANFIS) and modified differential evolution (MDE) for software reliability prediction. The model employs inner spatial feedback loops and delayed output feedback to improve the conventional neuro-fuzzy system&#39;s prediction abilities while dealing with time series software failure data. The hybrid model is trained by MDE, where a new scheme of crossover and mutation has been proposed. We conduct an extensive simulation on a few publicly available benchmark datasets for computing the predicting ability of our hybrid model.

  abstract     = {In order to successfully address the multiprocessor work scheduling issues, a novel hybrid approach is presented in this paper. Executing a group of tasks on a small number of processors is the main goal of a task scheduling method. The job scheduling issue is viewed as a multi-objective optimisation issue in this study. The goals of this optimisation challenge are to determine the system’s least energy consumption and minimum makespan (the sum of the schedule lengths for each task’s execution). In order to lower the processors’ energy usage, the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) level has the task scheduling issue enabled. To determine the goals, a hybrid algorithm called Hybrid Grey Wolf Crow Search Optimisation (HGWCSO) is suggested. The Grey Wolf Optimisation (GWO) and Crow Search Optimisation (CSO) algorithms are combined to create the HGWCSO algorithm. The social structure and hunting strategy of wolves serve as the inspiration for the GWO metaheuristic algorithm. The CSO, on the other hand, is a metaheuristic algorithm that was motivated by crows’ clever conduct. The proposed hybrid approach is put into practise using tasks that are produced at random, and the results of this comparison are classic methods. The proposed method’s simulation results are contrasted with those from five existing widely used methods. The proposed technique has also been contrasted with some newly created metaheuristic algorithms using various real-world data sets. According to the simulation results, HGWCSO outperforms other algorithms in terms of lowering makespan and energy usage. The proposed algorithm has successfully improved the makespan and energy consumption with a maximum of 31.07% and 58.36%, respectively, compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) is among the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms (MAs), and it got its inspiration from the ocean predators’ foraging behaviour based on Brownian and Levy motions. Good exploration, convergence accuracy, ease of implementation, easy parameter settings, fewer parameters, etc., are some of its strengths. Nevertheless, it experiences premature convergence and local optima trapping sometimes. The Competitive Swarm Optimiser (CSO) is a Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) variant. It got its inspiration from the social groups’ collective decision-making and social behaviour. Good exploitation, a balance between exploitation and exploration, low premature convergence, algorithmic simplicity, etc., are some of its strengths. However, it has a loss of diversity and premature convergence. Aiming at solving the MPA’s weaknesses and utilising the complementary strengths of MPA and CSO, an improved hybrid MPA has been proposed and it’s named ICSOMPA. The MPA was first improved by utilising a chaotic mapping strategy for the MPA initialisation, utilising an adaptive convergence factor (CF) for step size control aiming at striking a balance between local exploitation and global exploration, utilising the Weibull distribution in place of Brownian motion aiming at preventing algorithm local trapping, and utilising chaotic sequences in the MPA’s early stages as opposed to using random numbers to avoid overlap and uneven agent distribution. The improved MPA was then hybridised with the CSO aiming at leveraging the MPA’s and CSO’s strengths to provide higher convergence accuracy, convergence speed, and avoiding local optima trapping. The proposed algorithm’s performance was tested and validated using the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) suites and engineering design problems. The CEC2014, CEC2017, CEC2020, CEC2022, and the 3 most employed engineering design problems have been utilised. Six different sets of experiments have been conducted utilising different dimensions of the CEC suites by carrying out convergence accuracy analysis, convergence rate analysis, the Wilcoxon test, the Friedman test, and the Bonferroni-Holm test. Some of the state-of-the-art and variant MAs have been utilised for comparison purposes. From the experimental results, the ICSOMPA had a superior performance compared to the MAs used for comparison. The experiments on the CEC suites showed that it can strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation. In general, it also has higher convergence accuracy and rate. The statistical analyses conducted showed a significant difference between the results obtained by the ICSOMPA and the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Discrete Hopfield Neural Network has been widely used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. DHNN is a simple structure with no hidden layer and binary input/output which leads to lower complexity compared to other networks. Satisfiability as a neuron representation is considered a suitable logical structure due to its simple construction. DHNN model has the potential for enhancement by incorporating various logical rules. The main problem of existing work is the need for higher-order logical rules combined with systematic, non-systematic logic. This paper proposed a novel satisfiability logical structure named J-Type Random 2,3 Satisfiability by considering both the characteristics of the second and third-order variable per clause. The proposed logical rule randomly assigns values based on the structure of either second-order, third-order, or both orders of the clause. The proposed J Random 2,3 Satisfiability logical rule will store the information externally and only be true if all the clauses are satisfiable. This logic will be implemented into the Discrete Hopfield Neural Network. By utilizing the proposed hybrid logical rule, specifically the J Random 2,3 Satisfiability, the neuron in the Hopfield Neural Network can be effectively modeled. The model will be evaluated using various performance metrics in terms of learning error, retrieval error, energy analysis, and similarity analysis. The proposed logic will undergo a comparison analysis with previously established logical rules. Based on the ratio of global solutions, the proposed model exhibited a slower decline from 1 to 0 as the number of neurons increased which suggests that the proposed model will outperform existing models in retrieving global neuron state.},

  abstract     = {Missing values are a common issue in many high-dimensional datasets, but a majority of classification algorithms require complete data. Therefore, imputation methods are usually used to estimate and fill missing values with plausible values before using the classification algorithms to learn classifiers or using the learnt classifiers to classify unseen incomplete samples. However, good imputation methods are usually computationally intensive on high-dimensional datasets because these datasets not only have a large number of features, but also often suffer from a large number of missing values. Another approach is to use decision tree algorithms which do not need imputation, and can work directly with incomplete data. However, using decision trees to classify high-dimensional data often leads to large classification accuracy because of the curse of dimensionality. Ensemble techniques which build multiple classifiers instead of a single classifier have been widely used to improve accuracy for decision trees. This paper aims to investigate different ensemble methods to find effective and efficient ensembles of decision trees for classification with high-dimensional incomplete data. Experimental results show that the random subspace method is the most accurate ensemble. The random subspace method is also more accurate than other classification algorithms which needs to combine with imputation when working with incomplete data. Moreover, the random subspace method is much faster than the other algorithms because it can directly work on incomplete data, so does not have to spend time estimating missing values.},

  abstract     = {Due to the non-selective behavior of gas sensors in electronic nose (e-nose) systems, the provided signals in exposure to target analytes contain un-needed information. These are considered as noise reducing the detection accuracy. Feature selection, as a pre-processing step in data analysis, removes extra information from the sensors’ signals and provides a more relevant data matrix with lower dimensionality to enhance the system selectivity. In the high-dimensional sensor array response spaces, it is however essential to improve the conventional algorithms to be able to cope with complicated feature selection problem. In this study, in order to acquire optimal responses from the gas sensor array of an e-nose system and increase its selectivity for detection of rice type and its storage duration (freshness), the feature selection problem was formulated in an optimization framework. For this reason, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an automatic stagnation detecting system was enhanced by genetic operators of differential evolution. This helped acquiring more exploration ability through providing oriented jumps. It was revealed that the system’s detection accuracy was improved when smaller subset of features was utilized instead of the whole response, indicating that the sensor array signals included large amount of irrelevant information. The improved PSO could significantly present lower error values than the standard PSO and other examined conventional algorithms. It was concluded the developed algorithm has the potential to be applied as a promising feature selection algorithm in high-dimensional signals of the e-nose systems.},

To address this problem, this paper proposes a dual-population cooperative algorithm (DPDCA), which maintains two populations and an archive, and can change the search strategy depending on the evolutionary stage. At the early stage of evolution, the two populations are responsible for different tasks, promote rapid convergence of the populations by exchanging solutions, and save promising solutions in the archive. In the later stages of evolution, different local search strategies are emphasized according to the diversity of the main populations and their convergence to obtain a feasible solution set with better convergence. In order to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optimality at a later stage, we introduce the archive to enhance the diversity of the populations, and finally the main populations are explored in depth to obtain the set of solutions located in the PF. To test the superiority of the algorithm, we tested it against five state-of-the-art algorithms on 28 benchmark test problems and 3 real-world problems, proving that the altered algorithm has good competitiveness in dealing with constrained multi-objective optimization problems.},

One of its numerous applications is to determine the optimal positioning of mobile towers in a city. This constrained nonlinear optimization problem is solved using four variants of the Real Coded Genetic Algorithm. These four variants are created by the combination of two well-known real-coded crossover operators: Arithmetic Crossover and Hybrid Crossover, and two well-known real-coded mutation operators: Uniform Mutation and Discrete Uniform Mutation. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using the mean, standard deviation, best, worst of the objective function values and Friedman’s mean ranking test is applied when 30 runs of each variants are carried out. On the basis of the computational analysis, the performance of the variant of RCGA having Arithmetic Crossover-Uniform Mutation (AX-UM) outperforms all other RCGAs considered in this study in terms of faster convergence and better accuracy of the solution. In a practical demonstration, this methodology is implemented to a case study in Roorkee City in Uttarakhand of Northen India. Currently, there are 14 existing mobile towers in Roorkee city. However, there are certain regions in which internet connectivity is unsatisfactory. Therefore, based on the recommendation of this study, AX-UM is recommended to install three new mobile towers.},

  abstract     = {An accurate diagnosis of the type of brain tumor is crucial for experts to choose the best course of therapy and increase the patient’s lifetime. The manual categorization of brain tumors in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with similar structures or appearances can be complex and relies on expertise. Also, brain MRI contains a significant number of redundant or irrelevant features, and classification algorithms struggle to detect patterns without feature selection. By selecting prominent features, the machine-learning model can produce a high level of predicted accuracy in medical diagnostic problems. In this paper, an improved ant lion optimization approach (IALO) is developed to select the optimal features for wrapper-mode classification. Initially, pre-processing is carried out to remove bias and noise. Tumor segmentation is performed using active contours driven by Laplacian of Gaussian energy and optimal region scalable fitting energy. From the segmented brain images, hand-crafted features are extracted using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient, Gray level co-occurrence matrix, Gray level run length matrix, and deep features are extracted using the ResNet50. The proposed IALO is employed for the selection of the best features from handcrafted and deep features. The final step was to classify brain tumors using Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The proposed IALO-based RNN exhibited enhanced accuracy of 99.59% for BRATS and 99.18% for J.Cheng brain images respectively. From the experimental results, it is observed that our proposed model outperforms the existing metaheuristic optimization algorithms and effectively removes the least significant features while improving classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Prolonging network lifetime has long been one of the most critical challenges in designing wireless sensor networks in general and mobile wireless sensor networks in particular. Regarding network lifetime, one of the factors affecting it the most is energy efficiency. In a mobile wireless sensor network, compared to stationary ones, energy management has an even greater impact on the network lifetime since the movement of the sensors drains an enormous amount of energy. Moreover, in target-based wireless sensor networks, it is mandatory to ensure target coverage along with lifetime optimization. In this paper, we investigate a mobile sensor network model where stationary targets must be continuously monitored by mobile sensors. In order to maximize network lifetime and guarantee the coverage of all targets in the monitoring region, we take sensor nodes’ movement into account. We propose the Lifetime Effective Movement Algorithm, a novel heuristic approach consisting of determining the optimal regions for sensor deployment and scheduling sensor nodes’ movement, to address this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms two existing approaches in terms of network lifetime with an improvement varying from 125% to 269%. Moreover, the proposed method produces an approximation ratio in the range of 82.14- $$-$$ 88.41% compared to the exact solution.},

  abstract     = {Automated mathematical problem-solving represents a unique intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and mathematical reasoning, posing significant challenges in semantic comprehension and logical deduction. This survey paper explores the domain of mathematical word problems (MWPs), focusing on the nuanced integration of linguistic understanding and mathematical logic required for their resolution. Despite progress, the automated solution of MWPs through NLP techniques remains challenging. We present a comprehensive review of the latest datasets and computational models, focusing on those addressing geometrical, tabular, and multimodal problem types-areas not extensively covered in prior surveys. Our review extends beyond previous surveys by analyzing the solving of MWPs in languages such as Hindi and Arabic, areas less explored in existing research. We critically review the latest datasets and computational models designed for MWPs, highlighting the scarcity of resources that cater to the complexity of problems in Hindi, Arabic, and similar languages. This gap underscores the need for comprehensive datasets that reflect the diversity of MWPs in these languages and for models capable of navigating the linguistic nuances inherent in non-English and non-Chinese contexts. Our analysis points to the limitations of current approaches, including their focus on specific data formats and limited generalizability across different mathematical contexts. Furthermore, our critical analysis identifies prevailing limitations within current methodologies, including over-reliance on specific data formats and a lack of generalizability across diverse mathematical contexts. In response, we propose a research agenda to develop sophisticated models that understand and reason across a broader spectrum of problem types and languages and create datasets that capture the real-world diversity of MWPs in Hindi, Arabic, and beyond. This paper sets a direction for future research to advance NLP-driven mathematical problem-solving toward technically adept and universally applicable models across linguistic boundaries, thereby making strides toward truly global NLP applications in education and beyond.},

  abstract     = {SMT (Surface Mount Technology) has been the backbone of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) production for the last couple of decades. Even though the speed and accuracy of SMT have been drastically improved in the last decade, errors during production are still a very valid problem for the PCB industry. With the exponential rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last decade, the SMT industry was one of the most eager industries to use this new technology to detect possible defects during production. Lately, traditional image processing techniques started to lag behind methods such as machine learning and deep learning when the discussion came to the need of high accuracy. In this paper, we screen academic libraries to understand which of the latest methods and techniques are used in the domain and to deduce a general process for detecting defects in PCBs. During the research we have investigated research questions related to state-of-the-art methods, highly mentioned datasets, and sought after PCB defects. All findings and answers are mapped to be able to understand where this pursuit might point towards. From a total of 270 papers, 90 of them were addressed in detail and 78 papers were chosen for this systematic mapping.},

The 5D-HCS generates chaotic sequences using image data and a cryptographic key, which are then incorporated to produce a highly secure encrypted image. The proposed algorithm is rigorously validated through comprehensive testing like NIST suite evaluations, correlation analysis, key sensitivity assessment, and venerability to various attacks, yielding notable results such as an entropy value of 7.9992, an NPCR of 99.6, and an UACI of 33.463 for the encrypted Lena image.

  abstract     = {It is crucial for users to find lots of information with time and geographical tags on the Internet. Therefore, a nearest neighbor query method called STR-kNN is proposed. Using the method of calculating the spatiotemporal similarity between two objects, the spatiotemporal variables of the data object are normalized and mapped to the three-dimensional space. The distance similarity between two data objects in the three-dimensional space is used to approximate their actual spatiotemporal similarity. In this way, a three-dimensional STR-tree index is built for the data object in the three-dimensional space. This index can effectively combine the spatial–temporal variables of the data object, ensuring that each data object is traversed no more than once during query processing. Finally, an accurate searching algorithm of STR-kNN is designed to find up to the top-k query results through a single calculation. In the experiment, when the data volume is 6 million, the query times of STR-kNN, 3DR-k NN, and RT-k NN algorithms are 12 ms, 43 ms, and 55 ms respectively. When k is taken as 50, the query times of the three algorithms are 12 ms, 43 ms, and 55 ms, respectively, indicating that the new algorithm can greatly improve the query efficiency.},

Firstly, we assessed its performance on a diverse range of 24 benchmarks encompassing unimodal, multimodal, composite, and special discrete functions. Secondly, we applied the D-CLGSA to a practical optimization problem involving water distribution network planning and management. The D-CLGSA model was coupled with the hydraulic simulation solver EPANET to identify the optimal design for the water distribution network, aiming for cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the model&#39;s performance on six distribution networks, namely Two-loop network, Hanoi network, New-York City network, GoYang network, BakRyun network, and Balerma network. The results of our study were promising, surpassing previous studies in the field.

The second-stage recognition is based on the zonal information and script-specific orthographic rules. The work is carried out on the finding that low recognition accuracy of Meitei Mayek handwritten characters is due to the presence of highly shape-similar confusing character pairs. First, the confusing character pairs are identified from the confusion matrix obtained while training and testing the CNN. For these confusing characters pairs, the zone information and certain script-specific orthographic rules are incorporated in the second recognition stage to distinguish between them. The second-stage recognition is carried out only on those characters which belong to one of the confusing character pairs. This makes the technique computationally more efficient than those where it is carried out for every output of the recognition stage. For zone identification, a novel method based on the row co-ordinates of characters present in the word is proposed. An improvement in the recognition accuracy is achieved with the two-stage approach compared to the single-stage recognition using the CNN. An improve ment in recognition accuracy of 3.36% is shown by our approach with a recognition accuracy of 91.86%.},

  abstract     = {The Runge-Kutta Optimization (RUNGE) algorithm is a recently proposed metaphor-free metaheuristic optimizer borrowing practical mathematical foundations of the famous Runge-Kutta differential equation solver. Despite its relatively new emergence, this algorithm has several applications in various branches of scientific fields. However, there is still much room for improvement as it suffers from premature convergence resulting from inefficient search space exploration. To overcome this algorithmic drawback, this research study proposes a brand-new quasi-dynamic opposition-based learning (QDOPP) mechanism to be implemented in a standard Runge-Kutta optimizer to eliminate the local minimum points over the search space. Enhancing the asymmetric search hyperspace by taking advantage of various positions of the current solution within the domain is the critical novelty to enrich general diversity in the population, significantly improving the algorithm’s overall exploration capability. To validate the effectivity of the proposed RUNGE-QDOPP method, thirty-four multidimensional optimization benchmark problems comprised of unimodal and multimodal test functions with various dimensionalities have been solved, and the corresponding results are compared against the predictions obtained from the other opposition-based learning variants as well as some state-of-art literature optimizers. Furthermore, six constrained engineering design problems with different functional characteristics have been solved, and the respective results are benchmarked against those obtained for the well-known optimizers. Comparison of the solution outcomes with literature optimizers for constrained and unconstrained test problems reveals that the proposed QDOPP has significant advantages over its counterparts regarding solution accuracy and efficiency.},

To address this challenge, stochastic optimization algorithms have emerged as valuable tools. One such algorithm, moth-flame optimization (MFO), leverages its capacity to navigate complex and unknown search spaces. When combined with the tournament selection (TS) method, which is designed to maintain diversity and control the convergence rate by providing equal opportunities for all individuals to be selected, it demonstrates remarkable potential and competitiveness in solving challenging problems with constraints. This research introduces an enhanced version of the MFO model, called TMFO, as an innovative approach to address time–cost trade-off (TCTO) problems in construction project management. To assess its performance, three benchmark test problems are employed, including two case studies involving 7 activities and one case study with 18 activities. The results reveal that TMFO outperforms other optimization algorithms when applied to TCTOs in small-scale projects. These findings underscore the effectiveness and relevance of the TMFO algorithm within the domain of construction project management.},

  abstract     = {A significant cause of death and long-term disability globally is brain stroke. Stroke falls into one of two categories: (1) ischemic, which accounts for roughly 85% of cases when it is caused by abrupt cessation of blood supply to a particular area of the brain, and (2) hemorrhagic, which refers to bleeding or blood leakage. To provide stroke patients with individualized therapeutic care, meta-heuristic algorithms make accurate and timely predictions. The use of meta-heuristic algorithms and machine learning in the healthcare sector is growing. A new meta-heuristic algorithm called the Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO) was developed in part as a result of wild mountain gazelles’ social structure but suffered from slow convergence speed. Consequently, a modified MGO (mMGO) approach uses the joint opposite selection operator, which combines the selective leading opposition and the dynamic opposite learning approaches, to improve MGO. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of mMGO based on the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier in predicting brain stroke in data sets taken from Kaggle. Performance was assessed on the challenging CEC 2020 benchmark test functions. Compared to seven well-known optimization algorithms, the statistical results demonstrated the superiority of mMGO. Furthermore, the experimental results of mMGO-kNN for categorizing brain stroke data sets revealed that it outperformed competitors in all data sets with an overall accuracy of 95.5%, a sensitivity of 99.34%, a specificity of 98.99%, and a precision of 99.21%.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have demonstrated that evolution can be observed in a few dozen generations, especially when species occupy a new ecological opportunity due to environmental changes. There are several factors that induce this rapid evolution and are related to the phenotype and its response to the environment. This response is then determined by phenotypic variation, because if patterns of diversity in a population produce a rapid response to an environmental change, then rapid adaptation to the new environment can occur. This paper aims to investigate patterns of evolution of species in an artificial ecosystem, and to highlight some patterns that promote rapid evolution. Understanding how rapid evolution occurs is not only of fundamental importance in understanding evolutionary processes and species conservation, but also to provide support for improving the resolution of certain types of problems, especially those in which the solution is time-variant. To achieve the objectives of this paper, a computational model of Adaptive Radiation was designed using the concepts of Biogeographic Computing, an area of knowledge that studies ecosystems as information processors, a fundamental principle of Natural Computing. Habitats are represented by adaptive surfaces, which in turn are composed of different ecological opportunities. The results show, for example, that dramatic changes in ecosystems can lead to a rapid response and a rapid adaptation to new ecological opportunities, mainly because of the emergent and self-sustaining behaviour promoted by the continuous speciation, extinction and adaptation of species. This emergent dynamic supports the thesis that rapid environmental changes can lead to rapid evolution. This behaviour, in turn, is highly desired when considering time-varying problem solving. If solutions to a problem are changing over time, sometimes it is necessary to rapidly find new solutions.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy promises to be a good substitute for traditional sources for a constant supply of power. Large-scale electrical grids may experience major synchronization imbalances between various components as a result of system or communication delays. Engineers experience several challenges while attempting to replace conventional energy with sustainable power since the characteristics of renewable power plant generation are continually changing with climatic conditions. To manage a time-delayed automated generation control (AGC) system, one can use intelligent control such as the FUZZY-assisted three degrees of freedom PID controller. This study presents a new control strategy called the FUZZY-3DOF-PID controller for a First-Order Plus Time-Delay (FOPTD)-based three-area interconnected hybrid power system. The controller parameters are trained by different algorithms, such as FireBug Swarm Optimization (FSO), Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm (LMA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Big Bang Big Crunch (BB-BC) Algorithm, to prove their efficacy. The designed controller is robust to load variation (RLP) and the comparison of the various performance indices demonstrates the superiority of the proposed controller over other controllers available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Balancing between the convergence, feasibility, and diversity of the population is the key to solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). However, the existing constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (CMOEAs) face challenges in converging to the constrained pareto front (CPF) with well-distributed feasible solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic tri-population multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, called TDPSCMO. In the initial phase, the first and second populations evolve dynamically to solve the original CMOP and the unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOP). This dynamic offspring generation emphasizes convergence and feasibility. In the later stages, the allocation of computing resources to the first population is adjusted based on the variation in offspring numbers. Simultaneously, a third population is introduced to enhance population diversity by treating Constraint Violation degrees as an additional objective function, thus capturing more valuable information. The performance of TDPSCMO is further tested through 57 benchmark test problems and 21 real-world applications using several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm when addressing CMOPs.},

The paper first presents the framework of the proposed method that consists of within-subsystem migration, cross-subsystem migration, and mutation operators. Then a theoretical model of the proposed method is derived using Markov chain and the probability transition matrix of each operator, along with the generalized multinomial theorem. The model provides exact mathematical formulas that predict the limiting probabilities of optimization performance for each possible population in the proposed method. Additionally, simulation results of two sample problems, which include multiple subsystems and multiple objectives, confirm the Markov model derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is investigated on an application of a battery charging system, and numerical simulation shows that the proposed method is a promising optimization method for the studied complex system.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach called hybrid evolutionary GWO (HE-GWO) is proposed to enhance the effectiveness of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) for handling dynamic landscapes. This approach combines the strengths of the canonical GWO with Differential Evolution (DE) to achieve a high-level hybridization. HE-GWO enhances the leadership-based guidance system and incorporates an evolutionary dimensional hunting system with population subgrouping to increase the diversity of the wolfpack. Dynamic tuning settings are specifically devised to regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation, and to facilitate the evolution of the wolfpack by increasing its diversity. The proposed method is verified through rigorous benchmarking tests using three recent benchmarking suites, including CEC2020, CEC2019, and the 100-digit competition, as well as the CEC2021 benchmarking suites. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is performed on five standard engineering problems. The proposed HE-GWO is evaluated against a total of 23 meta-heuristics, which include the standard GWO, eight advanced and recent variants GWO, ten recent meta-heuristics, and four state-of-the-art advanced meta-heuristics. Additionally, the winners of relevant contests are also included in the comparison. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the suggested approach is verified through eight instances of a multi-unit production planning problem. This problem consists of 270 decision variables, including 162 integer variables and 108 continuous variables. The experiments involve applying a combination of penalty and constraint correction techniques to handle the constraints. HE-GWO has consistently outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms and competition winners in benchmarking, achieving the highest profitability in seven out of eight situations for the multi-unit production planning problem.},

The paper presents a new activation function, which is referred to as modSwish. It is continuously differentiable, unbounded above, bounded below, and non-monotonic. Our results demonstrate that modSwish outperforms ReLU on a number of challenging datasets and neural network models. In the beginning of the experiment, Neural Networks are trained and classified using benchmark data like Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Iris and modSwish achieved 93.57% and 95.56% accuracy, respectively. Secondly, experiments were conducted on five distinct neural network depths that ranged from five to eight layers over MNIST datasets. The modSwish activation function obtained 95.57%, 95.29%, 94.93%, 94.69%, and 95.03% accuracy on 8 layers, 7 layers, 6 layers, 5 thinner layers, and wider 5 layers neural networks respectively. Finally, experiments were conducted on two distinct Convolution Neural Network with two convolution layer and four convolution layers over CIFAR-10 datasets. The modSwish activation function obtained 60.04% and 69.22% accuracy on two convolution layer and four convolution layer model respectively. Statistical feature measurements demonstrate that modSwish has the best mean accuracy, lowest Root Mean squared Error, lowest standard deviation, lowest variance, and lowest Mean squared Error. The study indicated that modSwish has faster convergence compared to ReLU, making it a valuable factor in deep learning. The results of the experiments suggest that modSwish can be a promising substitute for ReLU, leading to better performance in neural network models.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, preventing data transmission via networks from unauthorized access has become crucial. In this work, we introduce a new enhanced Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), named NECSA, for solving the search problem. Then, we propose a steganographic approach called Steganographic NECSA (SNECSA). It is based on NECSA for obtaining optimal positions and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method for concealing secret data in these positions. For gray-scale images, SNECSA is applied with 4-LSB. For colored images, SNECSA is applied in two versions. The first one uses 3–3–2 LSB, while the other uses 3–3–2 LSB and permutations on each secret byte, obtaining six patterns and choosing the fittest pattern to embed. The practical results show that the proposed approach outperforms other previous approaches with respect to peak signal to noise ratio, bit error rate, and number of pixel change, where the average peak signal to noise ratios achieved by the proposed approach are approximately 76.25 dB, 73.47 dB, and 71 dB in gray-scale images, and 83.76 dB, 80.9 dB, and 78.7 dB in color images on the tested data set. Additionally, the suggested approach shows outstanding resistance to stego-attacks such as salt and paper noise and regular and singular analysis.},

Considering appropriate routes and vehicles to reduce carbon emissions is important for eco-friendly transportation. In the present study, the green multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) is solved by the proposed reference point aspiration level-based multi-objective quasi oppositional Jaya (RPAL-based MOQO Jaya) algorithm. In green mTSP with risk and carbon constraints, multiple salesman are used to travel, and all have to return to the depot( starting city). Two models are solved, i.e., expected value (EV) and optimistic value (OV) models; since the nature of the travel cost, time risk, and carbon emission are uncertain, the problem is solved under an uncertain environment. Green mTSP is considered by taking risk and carbon emission as constraints in this model. A real-life example of Surat city is considered for 10 and 50 city nodes, so the effects of selecting a single salesman versus multiple salesmen is observed. The data collected for Surat city from Google Maps and Google Earth is evaluated considering road, traffic conditions and speed of vehicle. The problem is solved by RPAL-based MOQO Jaya algorithm. The supremacy of the proposed method is established through its comparison with other methods for TSPLIB as well as for the real example solved by the proposed method and compared with AL-based MOQO Jaya, fuzzy programming technique (FPT, Hybrid GA, Rao algorithms. Further sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to confidence levels. The performance of RPAL-based MOQO Jaya is checked by calculating GD, IGD, HV, and coverage. The proposed algorithm can be easily adapted to solve supply chain problems, ship routing problems, VRP, etc.},

  abstract     = {As the nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are powered by batteries, energy efficiency is a major concern. Since communication consumes the most energy, efficient routing becomes an effective solution. A typical routing strategy is to use hierarchical clustering algorithms. In hierarchical routing schemes, a clustered arrangement of sensor nodes (SNs) is used to facilitate data merging and aggregation. The Cluster heads are in charge of obtaining data from the cluster’s SNs and gathering and delivering the data they receive at BS. These data are combined and pooled at the Cluster head (CH) level, resulting in considerable energy savings. However, there are certain reliability issues in cluster head selection (CHS) and optimal routing. To model a CHS and optimal routing in WSN, this work carries out the CHS using improved kernel Fuzzy C means clustering for selecting the CH by considering energy and distance. Then, optimal routing is done by deploying a novel optimization scheme named Customized Pelican with Blue Monkey Optimization (CP-BMO), which offers the optimal routes by considering trust and risk constraints. Also, the CP-BMO model holds better energy consumption which is 35.65%, 29.42%, 38.79%, 25.31%, 39.85%, 39.16%, 9.55%, 29.39%, 39.32% and 39.32% superior to ABO, RHSO, PELICAN, BMO, F-FLY, AEFA, ML-AEFA, ETERS, GA and QOBOA respectively.

The goal is to minimize costs for the routes of a fleet of vehicles that start moving from depots and fulfill customers’ demands. To improve the exploration of the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, the exploration method of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is more robust, is used in this paper. Experimental results proved that the proposed hybrid algorithm works better than the original PSO and HHO in discrete space in terms of balance, exploitation, and exploration to solve the MDOVRP. Moreover, the suggested algorithm is compared to five cutting-edge approaches on 24 MDOVRP instances with a broad number of customers. The computational findings reveal that the suggested approach outperformed the other comparable metaheuristic techniques in solving the MDOVRP.},

  abstract     = {For deep model training, an optimization technique is required that minimizes loss and maximizes accuracy. The development of an effective optimization method is one of the most important study areas. The diffGrad optimization method uses gradient changes during optimization phases but does not update 2nd order moments based on 1st order moments, and the AngularGrad optimization method uses the angular value of the gradient, which necessitates additional calculation. Due to these factors, both of those approaches result in zigzag trajectories that take a long time and require additional calculations to attain a global minimum. To overcome those limitations, a novel adaptive deep learning optimization method based on square of first momentum (sqFm) has been proposed. By adjusting 2nd order moments depending on 1st order moments and changing step size according to the present gradient on the non-negative function, the suggested sqFm delivers a smoother trajectory and better image classification accuracy. The empirical research comparing the performance of the proposed sqFm with Adam, diffGrad, and AngularGrad applying non-convex functions demonstrates that the suggested method delivers the best convergence and parameter values. In comparison to SGD, Adam, diffGrad, RAdam, and AngularGrad(tan) using the Rosenbrock function, the proposed sqFm method can attain the global minima gradually with less overshoot. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the proposed sqFm gives consistently good classification accuracy when training CNN networks (ResNet16, ResNet50, VGG34, ResNet18, and DenseNet121) on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST datasets, in contrast to SGDM, diffGrad, Adam, AngularGrad(Cos), and AngularGrad(Tan). The proposed method also gives the best classification accuracy than SGD, Adam, AdaBelief, Yogi, RAdam, and AngularGrad using the ImageNet dataset on the ResNet18 network.

This paper discusses a new concept of mutation size tuning in Evolutionary Strategies. The proposed algorithm uses data on evolutionary history in earlier generations to tune the mutation size. A Fuzzy Logic Part examines this historical data and tunes the mutation size of individuals to improve the algorithm’s convergence and its resistance to getting stuck in a local optimum. The Fuzzy Logic Part tunes the mutation size and keeps an appropriate relation of algorithm’s exploration and exploitation. The proposed concept is discussed, and several tests on Function Optimization Problems are performed. In tests, we use a set of data and functions with different difficulties recommended in the commonly used benchmarks. The results of experiments suggest that the proposed method is more efficient and resistant to getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. The proposed algorithm has been used in recognizing the type of ultra-high energy cosmic ray particle that initiates the Extensive Air Showers when hit the Earth atmosphere.

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce a new approach for computing Delaunay triangulations. Delaunay triangulations have numerous applications in geolocation, communications and other ICT systems or practical applications. Having available various types of approaches for computing such structures is rather desired from an implementation and computational point of view. We adopt Genetic Algorithms for computing Delaunay triangulations and present the design and evaluation of our novel approach. We consider a set of points in the plane as vertices and connect them with edges, creating the point graph. We have developed in C++ an application framework based on genetic algorithms, called Delaunay_Genetic, which produces the Delaunay triangulation structure of a given set of points in the plane. Delaunay_Genetic considers a novel graph-based chromosome representation of desired solutions, creates an initial population of individuals (chromosomes), an initial generation, and produces from the original population (generation) new generations of individuals in each repetition of the genetic process of Reproduction. Each new generation emerges more robust than the previous one. Our evaluations have revealed that the Delaunay triangulation yielded by Delaunay_Genetic, achieves an accuracy of 98–100% of the optimal Delaunay triangulation, while maintaining good convergence speed. Despite its limitations in computational time and space, the proposed novel approach exhibits several complementary benefits to computational geometry based approaches, such as allowing the insertion of new points in the triangulation dynamically, leading to seamless adaptation to new conditions, parallelization of the computational process and tolerance to noise regarding the coordinates of the points. Therefore, this work provides a useful alternative approach for computing Delaunay triangulations.},

While the original VEGE exhibits robust exploitation capabilities, it falls short in terms of exploration and overcoming local optima. Thus, we introduce the chaotic local search operators, multiple seed dispersion strategies, and a unique mutation module to address these mentioned limitations. Furthermore, we incorporate a simplified sigmoid transfer function into CVEGE and propose a binary variant known as binary chaotic vegetation evolution (BCVEGE). In numerical experiments, we evaluate CVEGE on 10-D, 30-D, 50-D, and 100-D CEC2020 benchmark functions, as well as four engineering optimization problems. Additionally, BCVEGE is subjected to testing on two combinatorial optimization problems: wrapper-based feature selection tasks and classic 0/1 knapsack problems. Here, we employ two classic algorithms (i.e. differential evolution and particle swarm optimization) and seven state-of-the-art competitor algorithms including the original VEGE as the competitor algorithms. The sufficient numerical experiments and statistical analysis practically show that our proposal: CVEGE and BCVEGE, are competitive with compared algorithms. Furthermore, the demonstrated performance and scalability of CVEGE and BCVEGE suggest their potential utility across a wide range of optimization tasks.},

These algorithms have demonstrated their excellence in resolving challenging problems across a variety of fields. However, many optimization algorithms fail while solving a complex real-world problem efficiently in an independent way because these problems have a distinct search behavior as they contain numerous equality and inequality constraints of the linear, nonlinear, and non-convex types. In this study, two optimization algorithms: the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and the Social Group Optimization (SGO) algorithm are hybridized in order to increase their efficiency and problem-solving capability to solve this type of problem. This proposed hybrid optimization algorithm is named as Marine Predators Social Group Optimization (MPSGO) algorithm. This hybrid algorithm combines the strengths of both techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the optimization process. It is validated through thirty benchmark functions of CEC2014 and after that 26 real-world optimization problems test suites of CEC 2020 from the chemical and mechanical engineering domain have been solved. The validation results are compared with ten state-of-art optimization algorithm and real-world optimization problem result is compared with BiPop matrix adaptation evolution strategy (BP-ϵMAg-ES), enhanced Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (EnMODE), LSHADE for Constrained Optimization (COLSHADE), Cohort Intelligence self-adaptive penalty function (CI-SAPF), and Cohort Intelligence self-adaptive penalty function Colliding Bodies Optimization (CI-SAPF-CBO). As MPSGO is a hybrid algorithm, again we have compared its performance with the seven best modified and improved optimization algorithms.

Dynamic detection of road traffic measures comes at an upper level, and optimal path estimation comes at the lower level of the bilevel model. Aggregation of multiple objectives—traffic, distance, and quality of the path, is done to formulate the objective function at a lower level. The intelligent foraging behaviour of different ant species inspires a bilevel optimization model for the specific problem. The upper-level task of detecting the dynamic traffic measure is based on a foraging strategy of harvester ants, which use antennal contacts to exchange information with inmates regarding food availability. The lower-level objective of determining the optimal route is based on the pheromone trail-based communication strategy used by other species of ants.

The QOHBO method leverages a heap data structure to emulate the concept of corporate ranking hierarchy. The mathematical model of HBO is based on the three strategies; first, the interaction between subordinates and their direct superior; second, interactions between contemporaries; third, the employees&#39; self-contribution is adopted to perform both the exploration and exploitation in the search space. To enhance the solution quality and computational efficiency in solving ELDP, we integrate the concept of quasi-oppositional learning into HBO. The proposed QOHBO technique effectively addresses various constraints, including transmission line losses, valve-point loading effects, generator generation limits, prohibited operating zones, power demand compliance, and ramp rate limits. The feasibility of the QOHBO to solve ELDP is evaluated by conducting ten distinct case studies across nine diverse test systems, featuring generating units ranging from three to 140. Comparative analysis with existing techniques from the literature highlights the superior performance of our proposed method in solving large-scale ELD problems. Subsequently, non-parametric alternative tests specifically the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Friedman test has been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed QOHBO. Moreover, extensive statistical analysis reveals that the QOHBO technique has the ability to consistently provide quality solutions and its robustness when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem and a huge of existing texts, the traditional feature selection techniques, such as statistical techniques, generate sub-optimal solutions. Swarm intelligence algorithms are extensively devoted to optimization problems. These algorithms produce features by increasing the classification performance and decreasing the computational complexity and feature set size. In this study, the authors proposed a framework using the modified multi-objective Firefly algorithm, namely FANS (Firefly Algorithm Naïve Bayes Sentiment). The two targets are decreasing the naïve Bayes error classifier and the k-nearest neighbor. A neural network is used as the final classifier. The three datasets on Movie review and Twitter domains are applied to evaluate the FANS. The FANS outperform its counterparts regarding precision, accuracy, and recall.

With each particle moving with a predefined location in search space, the potential function is defined based on particle’s fitness values. The particles are then ranked according to their finesses. Through clustering of particles, the contour line will be constructed which then leads to determining their center of gravity. This process will iteratively continue by updating the particles in each iteration and ultimately achieving the global CoG. The proposed CoG algorithm is shown to be useful for different types of uni-modal to multi-modal benchmark functions. Also, optimizing some important engineering problems has been considered. The performance of this new optimization algorithm has been compared with some of the optimization algorithms.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Optimisation algorithms are a specialized brand of optimisers developed to undertake problems with computationally expensive fitness functions. These algorithms work by building a cheap approximation or model of the exact function and using it in the evaluation of solutions within the optimisation process. This use of modelling techniques within optimisation, while offers a practical reduction in function calls, brings along with it some additional questions. This paper starts with a description of the key elements of surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimisation algorithms as they are outlined throughout the literature, and then, proceeds to rearrange these elements using a novel blueprint of the field. The proposed blueprint can be used to represent any surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm in a way that illustrates its principles and components in a non-vague manner. In addition, a survey of the most prominent works in the field is conducted using this novel blueprint. Finally, a number of challenges and perspectives are listed before the paper is concluded.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the topics associated with robotics are becoming an interesting research area. Meanwhile, intelligent mobile robots or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has great acceptance; however, the navigation and control of the devices are more complex. The shortage of dealing with static obstacles and evading them due to secure and safe routing is a fundamental need of the system. Therefore, an effectual robotic obstacle avoidance mechanism using deep learning (DL) model optimized with a swarm intelligence procedure is proposed. The main aim of this method is to avoid collision with static obstacles and attain the target in an optimal path. At first, the proposed method initializes the obstacles and target places for mobile robot navigation, and their positions are collected. An innovative path planning approach is presented using adaptive beetle swarm levy flight optimization (BSLFO) for optimal path calculation. Here, distance and path smoothness parameters are considered for optimal planning by the proposed BSLFO approach. The mobile robots are moved to the best positions obtained by the BSLFO approach. Additionally, optimal robots’ movement with collision avoidance has been performed by employing a fuzzy rule based optimal deep neural network (FRDNN). The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB platform and evaluates the performance in terms of performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and planning time. The maximum accuracy reached by the proposed method for static and dynamic obstacles is 98.62, which offers better obstacle avoidance and effective path planning. Consequently, the overall experimental outcomes proved that the proposed model outperforms the existing models.},

  abstract     = {Classification of imbalanced unlabelled data streams with concept drift in evolving streams has posed many challenges recently. Learner performance from the minority class is poor at high imbalance degrees. This causes drift detection to fail. Therefore, the existing model cannot be updated, resulting in poor classifier performance. Detecting drifts is typically done through supervised learning. They are impractical despite their effectiveness in detecting drifts. In real-world applications, only a portion of the data stream can be labelled as oracle assistance is pricey and laborious. To alleviate these problems, a novel technique which is a cluster based active learning for class imbalance and concept drift (CBAL) is presented in the paper. Adaptive sampling strategies are used for solving high imbalance degrees. A two-layer drift detection strategy is used for detecting drifts where the first layer is unsupervised and the second layer is supervised. To reduce the labelling cost this framework uses a clustering technique for querying the labels. Extensive experiments over synthetic and real-world data streams exhibit better classification performance. CBAL detects the drifts with fewer false alarms and with lesser oracle intervention. For high imbalanced case (i.e., 10%), the performance of CBAL is 53% and higher, whereas the performance of the other algorithms is zero or nil. The number of drifts detected by CBAL is much more accurate and it also reduces the labelling cost by 90%.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) has gained considerable attention in both research and industry. In particular, the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge in the use of AI applications, as the maturity of these methods increased. However, as the use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare continues to grow, we believe it will become increasingly important to examine public perceptions of this trend to identify potential impediments and future directions. Current work focuses mainly on academic data sources and industrial applications of AI. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the increased societal interest in AI, digital media such as podcasts should be consulted, as they are accessible to a broader audience. In order to examine this hypothesis, we investigate the AI trend development in healthcare from 2015 until 2021. In this study, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of 29 healthcare podcasts with 3449 episodes. We identify 102 AI-related buzzwords that were extracted from various glossaries and hype cycles. These buzzwords were used to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. We successfully detect an AI trend and follow its evolution in healthcare podcasts over several years. Besides the focus area of AI, we are able to detect 14 topic clusters and visualize the trending or decreasing dominant topics over the whole period under consideration. In addition, we analyze the sentiments in podcasts towards the identified topics and deliver further insights for trend detection in healthcare. Finally, the collected data set can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering.},

  abstract     = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is characterized by the separation of the packet forwarding plane from the network control plane. This separation offers an extensive view of the network’s state, enhancing network resilience and management. Network traffic classification can improve SDN control and resource provisioning, particularly for elephant flows (EFs) detection. Existing techniques for detecting EFs utilize preset thresholds and bandwidth that are inadequate for changing traffic concepts. Moreover, these techniques consume high data plane-controller bandwidth and have a high detection time. This research first describes the related management techniques in SDN. Then according to the detecting location, elephant flow detection approaches are classified into four kinds: host-based, switch-based, controller-based, and hybrid controller-switch-based detection. This research examined four types of detection approaches and concluded that host-based detection primarily relies on the flow statistics threshold. Such approaches frequently gather flow statistics by monitoring the socket buffer or via the hypervisor. In contrast, switch-based detection can leverage both the flow statistics threshold and flow characteristics. Controller-based detection techniques in SDN focus on extracting flow feature statistics at the controller level, aiming to reduce switch overhead while potentially increasing controller loads. Finally, hybrid controller-switch-based detection combines both routing aspects, offering fine-grained flow control. However it faces challenges in maintaining a balance in timeliness, accuracy, and cost. Furthermore, the survey incorporates recent SDN advancements such as machine learning-based methods, programmable switches, and real-world SDN applications in data centers, global content delivery networks, healthcare, and IoT. Finally, the article makes a comprehensive comparison and puts forward several points of future prediction in terms of elephant flow detection, taking into account recent advances in SDN research.},

As a result, problems arise in keeping up with changes and handling the significant diversity in features across these approaches. Which results in disorientation in the finding, evaluation, and choice of an ETL for industries and academia facing their approaches needs. These problems inspire us to provide a contribution that uses the systematic-literature-review (SLR) method to collect 207 papers from three databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Springer, and IEEE, dated from 2010 to 2022, grouped based on both ETL approaches and their commonly used criteria, afterwards using an existing method that automatically identifies the adequate multicriteria method for this study, which gives us the analytical-hierarchy-process method to provide the best research paper according to the requirements of scientific literature. The result implies the great significance of this study in multiple ways, providing a global idea of research papers about ETL approaches, allowing customers to eliminate uncertainty from selecting an ETL according to their specific approach needs, preferences, and interests, and also enabling future researchers and developers of ETL to decide when to focus and how to make innovative contributions to fill gaps in the literature.},

It eliminates the stagnation towards the local sub-optimal solutions over the search domain, significantly alleviating the inherent drawbacks of Equilibrium Optimizer. To assess the efficiency of the proposed diversity-enhanced Equilibrium Optimization algorithm (DEQUIL) on unconstrained problems, thirty-four multidimensional optimization test instances comprised of unimodal and multimodal benchmark problems have been solved, and respective performances are verified against those obtained from well-reputed new emerged metaheuristic algorithms. A comprehensive comparison based on the decisive metrics, including statistical analysis, performance index analysis, scalability tests, diversity analysis, and convergence rates demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid search methodology. Later, fourteen real-world constrained engineering problems with varying complexities were solved by the proposed DEQUIL method. The prediction performance of DEQUIL is compared with a wide range of available literature optimizers to scrutinize the improvements in problem-solving capabilities and seen that it can successfully cope with the complex constrained design problems outperforming the majority of the compared algorithm in most design cases.},

In his study, twenty-one different chaotic maps have been incorporated into the standard GRAD algorithm to maintain a reliable balance between exploration and exploitation mechanisms, which is not robustly constructed within the original algorithm. First ninety-nine thirty dimensional artificially generated optimization benchmark problems comprised of sixty-eight multimodal and thirty-one unimodal functions have been solved by these chaotic variants of the GRAD algorithm to determine the five best performing methods between them. Clear dominancy of the chaotic algorithms is clearly observed over the entire range of benchmark cases in terms of solution accuracy and robustness. Then, to validate the optimization capability of the chaos integrated GRAD algorithms, the best method among them is tested on fourteen constrained real world engineering problems, and its respective feasible results are benchmarked against those obtained from cutting edge metaheuristic optimizer. It is seen that the chaotic GRAD algorithm is able to effectively compete with other state-of-art algorithms on both solving unconstrained and constrained engineering problems.

Despite the practical application of this $${\mathcal {N}}{\mathcal {P}}$$ -hard problem in selecting investments for a portfolio, it remains an under-studied problem as only a few exact and heuristic approaches exist in the literature. This has motivated us to develop a metaheuristic approach based on steady-state genetic algorithm (SSGA) for the QBKP. Our SSGA approach uses worst among most similar replacement strategy to preserve useful population diversity which has a significant impact on the performance of our algorithm. Further, our crossover and mutation operators are designed as per the characteristics of the QBKP.

  abstract     = {Because of the number of different architectures, numerous settings of their hyper-parameters and disparity among their sizes, it is difficult to equitably compare various deep neural network (DNN) architectures for sentence classification. Evolutionary algorithms are emerging as a popular method for the automatic selection of architectures and hyperparameters for DNNs whose generalisation performance is heavily impacted by such settings. Most of the work in this area is done in the image domain, leaving text analysis, another prominent application domain of deep learning, largely absent. Besides, literature presents conflicting claims regarding the superiority of one DNN architecture over others in the context of sentence classification. To address this issue, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimising the architectural and hyperparameter settings in different DNN types for sentence classification. To enable the representation of the wide variety of architectures and hyperparameters utilised in DNNs, we employed a generalised and flexible encoding scheme in our GA. Our study involves optimising two convolutional and three recurrent architectures to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation of their performance. Furthermore, we explore the effects of using F1 score versus accuracy as a performance metric during evolutionary optimisation of those architectures. Our results, using ten datasets, show that, in general, the architectures and hyperparameters evolved using the F1 score tended to outperform those evolved using accuracy and in the case of CNN and BiLSTM the results were significant in statistical measures. Of the five architectures considered, the GA-evolved gated recurrent unit (GRU) performed the strongest overall, achieving good generalisation performance while using relatively few trainable parameters, establishing GRU as the preferred architecture for the sentence classification task. The optimised architectures exhibited comparable performance with the state-of-the-art, given the large difference in trainable parameters.},

The algorithm is based on the forces that affect a snowflake during the snowfall and the collisions between them. We tested the algorithm on three benchmark sets, CEC 2017, CEC 2020 and CEC 2011 and compared its performance with PSO, WOA, BBO, GWO, BAT and MFO in solving these three benchmark sets. We evaluated the results both statistically and with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The evaluations shown that the proposed algorithm has well-balanced exploration and exploitation abilities and outperformed the other algorithms for all the comparison criteria except the execution time. Also, the pairwise comparisons indicated that it is more stable than the other algorithms in solving CEC 2017 and CEC 2020 benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristics have emerged as one of the prominent problem-solving methodologies to handle optimization problems as they can provide good quality solutions within acceptable time limits. Numerous studies have been conducted in the field of metaheuristics proposing novel algorithms, modifications in the existing ones, etc to improve the performance of the metaheuristic framework. The multi-population or island approach is one such modification where solutions are divided into smaller subpopulations and migrate from one subpopulation to another to share information. Though useful, this approach is often ignored due to additional parameters, the burden of tuning them, increased time complexity, additional task of deciding migration policy, migration ratio, etc. In the present work, we have proposed a novel framework to enhance the performance of existing population-based metaheuristic algorithms and named it Batch Metaheuristic. The present framework is easy to implement and understand, has no migration of solutions among batches, and is general in nature i.e can easily be incorporated with any population-based algorithm, such as a Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and others. It divides the set of solutions in each iteration into several batches that are individually exposed to the algorithm chosen with different parameter values. We included the batch approach in two well-established population-based metaheuristics, Genetic Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The approach is tested over fifteen benchmark functions, five shifted benchmark functions, and three classical engineering problems. The results obtained confirm the better performance of the batch approach over its non-batch counterparts. This approach incurs numerous associated benefits when put to use.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few years, quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, as the forerunner of quantum evolutionary algorithms has made significant achievements in solving optimization problems in various fields. The ability of this algorithm to comprehensively search the problem space and discover global extrema is due to the power of the exploration process in this algorithm, which in turn is attributed to the mutations resulting from quantum rotation gates. But the best results in evolutionary algorithms are obtained when there is a reasonable balance between the exploration process (general search) and the exploitation process (local search). Under such conditions, the convergence speed of the algorithm in finding the global optima is no longer suppressed. In this research, a memetic quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which is a combination of a quantum genetic algorithm and a local search-based meta-heuristic called tabu search. In the proposed method, mutations of the rotation gate cover the entire problem space and access distant solutions. Consequently, the impulses generated by the tabu search in each iteration limit the range of motion and access to nearby solutions. Consecutive execution of these two processes turns the classical mutation operator into a directional mutation and accelerates the convergence of evolution. The evaluation results of this algorithm on unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions reflect the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rate and running time.},

  abstract     = {Data clustering is a method of dividing data points into similar groups. In the last few decades, there have been numerous advancements in algorithms and methodologies for the analysis of clustered data. Although some algorithms like K-means, due to their easy implementation and interpretability, are widely used for clustering, their capability of providing good solutions might be sensitive to the number of dimensions and clusters. Due to the advantages of metaheuristic-based clustering approaches like strong searchability, they have been widely used to tackle the clustering problem. Based on this premise, we propose a new bio-inspired red deer clustering algorithm (RDCA). Red deer algorithm (RDA) is a new metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of the Scottish red deer during a breeding season. First, the data space is partitioned into several divisions, each of which is represented by a disjunctive normal form expression using CLIQUE algorithm. Then a search strategy employing a modified version of RDA is pursued. Experiments are carried out to assess the performance of RDCA in comparison to eight traditional methods using six real-world and three generated datasets in terms of cluster validity measures, namely compactness, separation, combined, Turi, Davies Bouldin, and normalized mutual information score. The proposed method can handle multiple objective functions simultaneously and shows good performance when the data dimension is large. The results indicate that in most scenarios, the proposed method outperforms its counterparts. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to increasing the number of clusters and dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are strategies widely applied to deal with computationally expensive optimization problems (CEOPs). These methods employ metamodels to drive an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to promising design regions where new evaluations on the true-objective function must be performed. To do this, SAEAs are required to handle the challenge of training a metamodel to improve its predictions. The reliability of a metamodel is strongly related to the samples used for its training. Despite this, several SAEAs are proposed without concern about the sampling strategy employed. The ideal situation is to obtain a sample not far away from the solutions predicted on the metamodel. In this sense, the contribution/novelty of this paper regards an investigative study to compare five strategies for defining the metamodel sample in a proposed SAEA Framework (SAEA/F). The SAEA/F uses a one-dimensional Ordinary Kriging (OK) metamodel, and an expected improvement (EI) merit function is applied to define on which solutions to spend the budget of true-function evaluation. In this investigation, each strategy is incorporated into SAEA/F and then used to solve a set of analytical functions of single-objective optimization problems. The computational results suggest that two of the five sampling strategies stand out the best. The first strategy chooses those solutions with the lowest distance to the centroid of the population of solutions, and the second selects the newest solutions evaluated on true-objective function. The results highlight the potential of these approaches for solving expensive optimization problems since they speed up the algorithm convergence to improved solutions.},

One principal problem is the lack of methods or tools to investigate and compare representations. In this paper we introduce and evaluate such a tool based on the biological notion of heritability. Heritability captures the proportion of phenotypic variation caused by genotypic variation and is often used to better understand the transmissibility of traits in real biological systems. As a proof of concept, we compare the heritability of various robot traits in two systems, one using a direct (tree based) representation and one using an indirect (grammar based) representation. We measure changes in heritability during the course of evolution and investigate how direct and indirect representation can be biased towards more exploration or exploitation throughout the course of evolution. The empirical study shows that heritability can be a useful tool to analyze different representations without running complete evolutionary processes using them.},

Also, tremor and gait data were collected by recording the movements of PD patients from sensing units such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and inertial measurement unit sensors.

The original MBO algorithm might suffer from early convergence. Here we introduce several different ways of handling this problem.

This alternative can reduce consumer energy costs and enable the maturation and boosting of distributed generation technologies. Using reliable cost models with smart-grid technologies enables more economically efficient energy systems. Previously disregarded energy solutions can become viable solutions, such as electric energy generation using biogas. In this context, the contribution of this study is threefold. First, we develop a cost model of electrical and mechanical energy generation for local consumers in microgrid-producing biogas. Second, we integrate into the model a dual-fuel motor to generate electrical energy using a variable mixture of biogas and other fuel and the biomethane upgrading system to supply the mechanical demands. Third, based on this model, an optimal energy management tool is proposed. The performance of this tool is analyzed through scenario simulations of an existing microgrid composed of a motor engine fueled by biogas produced internally, a photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery bank, and connected to the utility. The results indicate the economic advantages of adopting the tool and the usefulness of the proposed model. Besides the reduced electricity cost, it also allows analysis of how each piece of equipment contributes to the electricity cost, which can be helpful in future decisions about equipment sizing.},

  abstract     = {A multi-objective social group optimization (MOSGO) is proposed in this study as a method for resolving problems with multiple objectives. The initial step is to use an external chronicle with a predetermined size to store the existing non-dominated Pareto optimum solutions. Following that, solutions are chosen from this repository using a roulette wheel mechanism based on the coverage of solutions to guide individuals in the direction of promising regions of multi-objective search spaces. The proposed method is tested on ten CEC2009 multi-objective benchmark problems and it has been compared to two well-known meta-heuristics: the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) algorithm and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. It is essential to the machining processes to choose the optimum machining parameters in order to guarantee product quality, lower machining costs, boost productivity, and preserve resources for sustainability. Hence, MOSGO, a posterior multi-objective optimization method, is used in this study to tackle the multi-objective optimization problems of three machining processes, including turning, wire-electric-discharge machining, and laser cutting. The results of the MOSGO algorithm are compared with the results obtained using GA, NSGA-II, PSO, and iterative search methods and are found to be comparable. Here it has been observed that the MOSGO algorithm achieved the Pareto-optimal set of solutions in a very less number of function evaluations as compared to other algorithms showing a higher convergence speed. The Pareto-optimal set of solutions for each optimization problem is obtained and reported. These Pareto-optimal sets of solutions are helpful for real production systems and will aid the decision-maker in tumultuous situations.},

  abstract     = {A multi-objective optimum design of propellers is presented. Traditionally, the definition of propellers is done by choosing models that already exist on the market. However, with the advancement of technologies such as 3D printing and computer numerical control, the possibility for the designer to seek an optimized propeller for his design is increasingly feasible. In this scenario, this paper aims to propose a methodology that allows the designer to find alternative propeller designs. The methodology comprises the creation, refinement, and extension of an airfoil database available from the literature. The aerodynamic analysis uses the blade element theory and the optimization with evolutionary algorithms. Seven multi-objective constrained optimization problems were formulated, with two, three, and four conflicting objective functions concerning the propeller aerodynamic and geometric information, such as the thrust coefficient, the bending coefficient, the efficiency, and the volume of the propeller. Among them, for instance, two proposed formulations are: (i) maximizing the thrust and minimizing the bending coefficients simultaneously, (ii) maximizing the thrust coefficient, minimizing the bending coefficient, minimizing the volume of the propeller, and minimizing the efficiency simultaneously. The experiments analyzed the optimization of small propellers for two different engines, combustion and electric brushless. Five evolutionary algorithms were used to solve these problems, and solutions were extracted from the Pareto fronts using multi-criteria decision-making according to the decision-maker preferences. Finally, the complete data of the extracted solutions are provided, such as dimensions, angles, shapes, and performance characteristics.},

Then, NSGA-III algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal allocation scheme of water resources. Based on the original NSGA-III algorithm, multi-point crossover operator and multi-point mutation operator, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with Random multipoint crossover mutation(RNSGA-III), are used. In the selection of the next generation, SAW and MCDM schemes were used to evaluate the chromosomes and set the weights to achieve better and more ideal results. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with the existing configuration scheme based on NSGA-III and NSGA-II algorithms. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme is better than the allocation scheme based on NSGA-III algorithm and NSGA-II algorithm in the comprehensive cost of economic benefits, water shortage and ecological benefits, which can provide a basis for the rational allocation of water resources in Guyuan City, achieve unified management and sustainable utilization of water resources and support the sustainable development of economy and society.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to optimize the deployment of wireless sensor networks for Smart Car Parks surveillance applications. Our proposed approach involves simultaneously deploying Sensor Nodes (SNs) and Relay Nodes, which we argue is more efficient than existing sequential placement methods. Our approach identifies optimal positions for both types of nodes to minimize their numbers and the network diameter while ensuring the coverage of each target point by at least K SNs and network connectivity constraints. To accomplish this, we have developed a Multi-Objective Linear Programming model (MOLP) to solve small instances of the deployment problem. Still, for large instances, we have introduced a novel algorithm called the Greedy Chaos Whale Optimization meta-heuristic (GCWOA) which is mainly based on: a Greedy algorithm to generate initial random nodes positions while satisfying the problem’s constraints and a chaos local search (CLS) technique using chaos maps to decide whether to include a given node in the final solution. The solution population was divided into two sub-populations, with the first undergoing CLS and the second undergoing the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to optimize the solution further. We have compared the performance of our proposed GCWOA with that of MOLP, and well-known existing meta-heuristics, including WOA, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Our results reveal that the average fitness of the GCWOA is close to optimal and lower by 23.45%, 28.75%, and 26.32% than basic WOA, GA, and PSO, respectively. The GCWOA exhibits faster convergence and a lower running time than the basic WOA, GA, and PSO.},

  abstract     = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a machine learning algorithm based on single hidden layer feedforward neural network. Compared with traditional neural network algorithms, ELM has the advantages of fast training speed and good generalization ability with guaranteed learning accuracy, which has been widely used in practical problems. However, due to the randomness of hidden layer parameters, the original ELM requires more hidden neurons in applications, making the network more complex. For this reason, we propose an improved extreme learning machine based on the adaptive multi-fusion chaotic sparrow search algorithm (AMFCSSA), called AMFCSSA-ELM. In our work, AMFCSSA is specially designed which combines the techniques of chaotic mapping, adaptive weighting coefficients, variable spiral factors and t-distribution mutation, to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of ELM. Firstly, unimodal and multimodal test functions are used to verify the performance of AMFCSSA, the results show that AMFCSSA can search for the global optimal value better than PSO, SSA, and so on. Secondly, various nonlinear functions and classification datasets are taken to test the capability of AMFCSSA-ELM, the simulation results show that our method has better generalization performance compared with other similar algorithms such as PSO-ELM, SSA-ELM.},

Thus, there has been a rise in network design problems with additional constraints regarding the clustering of vertices, one of them being Clustered Steiner Tree Problem—a variant of the Steiner Tree Problem. Recently, a heuristic-based algorithm was proposed to solve the problem. However, its obtained result is limited in terms of solution quality when applied to the problem in the Euclidean case. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm called Shortest-Path Genetic Algorithm for solving the CluSteiner. In the proposal, a permutation-based individual representation that reduces the dimensionality of chromosomes to the number of clusters is devised. The proposed algorithm can solve the problem in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean cases.

  abstract     = {A wireless sensor network is a wireless communication network, and each sensor node has several sensors to collect environmental information. Wireless sensor network nodes have limited energy resources and need optimal routing protocols to reduce energy consumption. Failure to reduce energy consumption by sensor nodes reduces network life and efficiency. The main problem in routing is finding optimal paths for sending packets by reducing energy consumption in sensor nodes. This paper proposes an optimal routing method to reduce energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. In the first step, wireless sensor nodes are clustered with the Water strider algorithms (WSA), and cluster heads are selected for routing. In the second step, a mobile sink collects the packets from the cluster heads and sends them to the base station. The mobile sink uses the Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms to travel a shorter path between the cluster heads. The authors contribute to presenting a discrete version of the WSA algorithm for cluster head selection to reduce energy consumption. The authors contribute by providing a more comprehensive objective function for clustering network nodes considering error rate, energy consumption, PDR rate, and Euclidean distance. Cluster head traversal with a version of the ACO algorithm to reduce energy consumption and cluster head traversal coding like the TSP problem is the contribution of other authors. The paper aims to reduce energy consumption, reduce the error rate of sending packets and increase the lifetime of the wireless sensor network. Experiments are simulated on several simulated scenarios in Matlab. Criteria such as energy consumption, Packet delivery ratio (PDR), package loss rates, and the number of alive nodes to evaluate the proposed method are used. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption and loss rates of packages of the wireless sensor network by optimally selecting cluster heads and increasing the PDR and number of alive nodes. Comparisons show In terms of energy consumption, Packet delivery ratio (PDR), Loss rates of packages, and the number of alive nodes, the proposed method is more efficient than Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Information-centric wireless sensor networks, and Cluster based routing (CBR) routing methods. The PDR index in the proposed method is equal to 97.3% and is higher than PSO, GWO, and CS algorithms. The delay of the proposed method in routing is 25.97%, 5.78%, and 17.98% less than HHO, WOA, and GWO algorithms, respectively.},

However, it has several shortcomings such as premature convergence and stagnation at local optima. In this paper, the strengthened teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm (STLBO) is proposed to enhance the basic TLBO’s exploration and exploitation properties by introducing three strengthening mechanisms: the linear increasing teaching factor, the elite system composed of new teacher and class leader, and the Cauchy mutation. Subsequently, seven variants of STLBO are designed based on the combined deployment of the three improved mechanisms. Performance of the novel STLBOs is evaluated by implementing them on thirteen numerical optimization tasks, including the seven unimodal tasks (f1–f7) and six multimodal tasks (f8–f13). The results show that STLBO7 is at the top of the list, significantly better than the original TLBO. Moreover, the remaining six variants of STLBO also outperform TLBO. Finally, a set of comparisons are implemented between STLBO7 and other advanced optimization techniques, such as HS, PSO, MFO, GA and HHO. The numerical results and convergence curves prove that STLBO7 clearly outperforms other competitors, has stronger local optimal avoidance, faster convergence speed and higher solution accuracy. All the above manifests that STLBOs has improved the search performance of TLBO.

  abstract     = {As Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) offer essential support for several location-aware applications and protocols, localization is one of the principal methodologies in WSN. In the literature, the mobile anchor node is preferred over the static anchor node to handle the high overhead issue caused by the larger number of anchor nodes. In recent years, the Mobile Anchor Node Assisted Localization (MANAL) problem has received significant attention in various research works, and path-planning techniques for localization using fewer anchor nodes have been implemented. However, recent MANAL breakthroughs in WSNs have provided ample research opportunities. The mobile anchor node is used in this paper to solve the node localization problem in WSN. The locations of the target nodes are determined using a Hybrid Electric-Coyote Optimization Algorithm (HE-COA), the mobile anchor node, and the virtual anchor nodes. The objective of the proposed localization is to minimize the distance error between actual node coordinates and estimated node coordinates. Various path trajectories are investigated in simulation to demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested work. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the localization error compared to the conventional models.},

This serves as the motivation for the differentiation of speech and music signals in an audio segment. The patterns have been further emphasized using Sobel edge kernels, Mel-spectrograms. For the inception of this paper, we have made a dataset from “All India Radio” news archives which is having separate and overlapped speech and music data in different languages. The different input features are extracted from these audio segments and further emphasized before feeding them to the different classifiers for distinguishing speech and music frames. We also compared the different classification algorithms for their varied performance in terms of accuracy. We have found that the convolutional neural network based approach on Mel-spectrograms and MFCC-delta-RNN methods have given a significantly better result compared to other approaches. Further, we wanted to see how these approaches work in the audio data of different languages, hence, we have applied the proposed method in three different languages such as Bengali, Punjabi, and Tamil. We have seen that the performance of the proposed method in all languages is consistent. The paper has also attempted to solve the problem of classifying audio segments with overlapped speech and music regions and achieved a good level of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an optimal active power dispatch (OAPD) problem that, unlike common economic dispatch problems, precludes unwanted mismatches on realistic power systems. The OAPD is formulated by considering the unified power flow controller (UPFC), a versatile device from the flexible AC transmission systems. However, the resultant turns into a highly nonlinear and complex optimization problem, which requires a powerful evolutionary algorithm to determine the optimal solutions. Toward this end, this paper explores the use of comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization and differential evolution as a hybrid configuration in a fuzzy framework, called hybrid fuzzy-based improved comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization-differential evolution, to address the proposed problem. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a set of benchmark problems, including real-world constrained optimization problems as well as a profound analysis of Schwefel problem 2.26 are provided. Moreover, to authenticate its effectiveness in solving power and energy-related problems with quite a few decision variables, four different power systems, 3-unit, 6-unit IEEE 30-bus, 10-unit, and 40-unit systems, are implemented. The IEEE 30-bus system is opted for profoundly analyzing the performance of the proposed algorithm in handling the optimal power dispatch problem considering security constraints and UPFC device, where an enhancement, at least $74,000 saving in a 365-day horizon, in total generation cost is obtained. Simulation results also validate that evolutionary algorithms need to be improved/hybridized to achieve better equilibrium between exploration and exploitation processes in a timely manner while solving power and energy-related problems.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, breast cancer is the most prevalent and jeopardous disease in women after lung cancer. During the past few decades, a substantial amount of cancer cases have been reported throughout the world. Breast cancer has been a widely acknowledged category of cancer disease in women due to the lack of awareness. According to the world cancer survey report 2020, about 2.3 million cases and 685,000 deaths have been reported worldwide. As, the patient-doctor ratio (PDR) is very high; consequently, there is an utmost need for a machine-based intelligent breast cancer diagnosis system that can detect cancer at its early stage and cure it more efficiently. The plan is to assemble scientists in both the restorative and the machine learning fields to progress toward this clinical application. This paper presents SELF, a stacked-based ensemble learning framework, to classify breast cancer at an early stage from the histopathological images of tumor cells with computer-aided diagnosis tools. In this work, we use the BreakHis dataset with 7909 histopathological images and Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) with 569 instances for the performance evaluation of our proposed framework. We have trained several distinct classifiers on both datasets and selected the best five classifiers on the basis of their accuracy measure to create our ensemble model. We use the stacking ensemble technique and consider the Extra tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and KNN9 classifiers as the base learners, and the logistic regression model as a final estimator. We have evaluated the performance of SELF on the BreakHis dataset and WBCD datasets and achieved testing accuracy of approximately 95% and 99% respectively. The result of the other performance parameters on the BreakHis and the WBCD datasets also showed that our proposed framework outperforms with F1-Score, ROC, and MCC scores.},

In the first phase, DA’s parameters are measured on the basis of percentage of area covered, entropy and number of pop-up threats detected. In the second phase, Chaotic distribution is applied in swarm algorithms (i.e. DA along with Bat Algorithm and Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization) to implement hybridized models. Chaotic Dragonfly Algorithm along with Chaotic Bat Algorithm and Chaotic Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization) is implemented. To evaluate the performance of hybridized models, a comprehensive comparison is drawn among the Levy and Chaotic versions of all three swarm algorithms. It is concluded that the proposed DA outperforms the rest. DA not only showed better results for the mentioned metrics, but also displayed uniform behavior over multiple runs.},

In local optimal searching, gradient distribution is used to initialize the pheromone concentration to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. The self-adaptive impact factor is used to enhance better fitness of the algorithm in different environments. In global optimal searching, a reward and punishment mechanism has been established to improve the pheromone update strategy. Furthermore, a node rearrangement strategy is adopted to increase the diversity of solutions. According to the improved colony algorithm, the problem of path planning of a single robot and multi-Robots with multi-objective can be solved. In two different scenarios, compared experiments show that the improved colony algorithm can obtain better path length, convergence speed and running time than traditional ant colony algorithm (ACO) and the improved ant colony algorithm (IACO-SFLA) in path planning of a single robot. Simulation results also show that the improved ant colony algorithm has good ability in multi-objective path planning. Especially, all robots can safely reach the targets by moving simultaneously and obstacles can be effectively avoided too.},

Because of this the researchers are more focussed towards motion planning analysis of mobile robots, bipeds and humanoids. During the investigation, it was discovered that the robots are more likely to become trapped in local minima and dead ends. So, this paper aims to provide a novel hybridized artificial intelligence technique by combining the Self organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimal path planning and control of single and multiple mobile robots in a static and dynamic environment. Different parameters of SOMA and PSO algorithm guides the robots to reach global optimized path in obstacle prone environment. The developed hybrid SOMA–PSO technique is tested in V-REP simulation environment with single and multiple robots, and the simulation outcomes have been authenticated in an experimental setup under laboratory conditions. Whenever sensors detects obstacle then the SOMA–PSO activates and negotiate with obstacles to move up to specified target. After simulation and real-time experiments the proposed novel hybrid technique is successfully achieved their target in an optimized manner. Further, a comparison analysis with its standalone techniques reveals that there is a significant improvement in navigational parameters. Again, the technique is tested against existing paper and an average improvement of 17.76% is observed by using the proposed hybrid technique.},

We propose a novel LSTM cell called TF-LSTM, which makes the proposed methodology very accurate in tracking the object in 3D space. TF-LSTMs or target follower LSTMs are inspired by the traditional LSTMs and give a meagre error in linear and angular velocity prediction. The PI controller, which was used to control the linear and angular velocities, which in turn controls the position of the robot, gave us impressive results, and this methodology outperforms all other methodologies for precise target tracking in performance comparision. The proposed TF-LSTM gave us an accuracy of 96.1%, average linear jerk of 0.4 m/s3, average angular jerk of 30 degrees/s3, average clearance of 0.514 m, maintaining no collosions with the obstacles.},

  abstract     = {The performance of models based on a Feedforward Neural Network depends strongly on the initial estimate of weights and the number of units in the hidden layers. This work presents a new method for the initialization of weights and definition of the number of hidden units in the identification of Multiple Input Single Output models associated with regression problems. The initialization strategy consists of a complete linearization of the network with only one neuron unit around an equilibrium point and the determination of the initial weights through the maximum approximation of the linearized model to the Optimal Linear Regressor whose solution can be obtained analytically. The constructive algorithm performs a gradual increase in the number of hidden units in such a way that at each training only weights associated with new hidden units are randomly initialized, while weights obtained from previous training are used as initial guess for the subsequent ones. The proposed method was compared to the classical random initialization method and to the Extreme Learning Machine (a typical gradient-free learning algorithm), both of which also involve a constructive approach to define the final network. The methods were applied to 11 real datasets widely used as benchmarks for regression problems. The proposed method performed better than the other approaches in 8–9 case studies and was able to ensure a monotonic decrease in the loss function with an increasing number of hidden units.},

This paper proposes a predictive approach based on our proposed algorithm Enhanced Adaptive Guided Differential Evolution (EAGDE) is used to optimize the parameter selection of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to give high RUL prediction accuracy. The advantages of the proposed approach (EAGDE–SVM) are verified using the popular benchmark C-MAPSS which describes the degradation of the aircraft turbofan engine datasets. The experimental study compares EAGDE–SVM with the basic SVM with randomized parameter selection and with an optimized SVM using three different optimization algorithms. Also, the EAGDE–SVM is evaluated against three popular classifier models that have been used in the comparisons of recent research. Different evaluation criteria of classification, prediction, and optimization aspects have been used, the obtained results show that the EAGDE is capable to achieve the lowest classification error rates and RUL high prediction accuracy through finding the optimum values of the SVM parameters with high stability and fast convergence rate.},

A powerful method for detecting these signals can greatly contribute to areas such as making robotic arms for disabled people, mind reading and lie detection tools. To this end, this study makes two interesting contributions. As a major contribution, a new classifier based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is presented. As the center determination method of a RBFNN classifier has a high impact on the final classification results, we have adopted Jellyfish search (JS) algorithm for choosing the centers of the Gaussian functions in the hidden layer of the RBFNN classifier. Additionally, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) technique is investigated for reducing the dimensionality of EEG signals. Two series of various experiments are designed to validate our proposals. In the first set of the experiments, the proposed RBFNN classifier is compared with other state-of-the-art RBFNN classifiers. In the second set of the experiments, the performances of the proposed EEG signals classifications are evaluated on a challenging dataset for EEG signals classification. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method even compared to the methods based on the convolutional neural networks.},

The analysis of the performance and of the behavioral strategies displayed by the agents trained with the two methods on benchmark problems enable us to demonstrate qualitative differences which were not identified in previous studies, to identify the relative weakness of the two methods, and to propose ways to ameliorate some of those weaknesses. We show that the characteristics of the reward function has a strong impact which vary qualitatively not only for the OpenAI-ES evolutionary algorithm and the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm but also for other reinforcement learning algorithms, thus demonstrating the importance of optimizing the characteristic of the reward function to the algorithm used.},

  abstract     = {The crop protection techniques using efficient plant disease identification are highly beneficial for Smart Agriculture Management which further decreases the gap between the demand/supply of consumers &amp; farmers. However, an efficient feature extraction technique is desirable to achieve high accuracy, least graphical processing, and low processing time for coloured images. Therefore, this work proposes a hybrid novel feature extraction technique for coloured plant leaf images to overcome these challenges. This work is divided into two parts: 1). Plant disease identification and 2). Plant disease severity estimation. In this technique, multiresolution analysis using large-scale coefficients of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is performed using orthogonal wavelets. The orthogonal wavelets such as Daubechies, Biorthogonal, Symlets and Coiflets with appropriate vanishing moments are utilized to select significant features. Then, the Eigen decomposition of large-scale DWT-based coloured image features is utilized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where only the Eigenvalues with large variance are considered for further feature selection. Several experiments are carried out for the selection of felicitous sub-bands &amp; decomposition levels. The Deep Neural network (DNNs) architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet 101 and Inception V3 are incorporated to classify the obtained features. The DNNs operate on Convolutional Neural Networks, which utilize the weights from pre-learned ImageNet Database classes to classify various classes. The combination of DNNs with Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning is made to tune the parameters for better efficacy. Experiments were performed on the PlantVillage Database, which contains healthy/diseased images of plants such as Apple, Corn, Grapes and tomato leaves. A new database is created by capturing the images of Rice Crop Leaves, including healthy and diseased leaves. A total of 8000 images are processed for disease identification. The proposed technique provided 99% accuracy for disease identification task and 90% for disease severity estimation in the real-life Rice Dataset and outperformed the existing techniques in this field of research.},

Hence, it is necessary to generate electricity with the least cost and emission. The studies in the past reveal that the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem has been solved by evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms. However, the methodology to identify the best compromising solution for the CEED problem has not been studied much in the literature. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which reduces fuel cost of power generation as well as emission simultaneously, is presented. The algorithm is a combination of an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with a new constraint handling feature. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is applied to three benchmark systems, commonly used to study the effectiveness of optimization algorithms. Moreover, the best compromising solution, obtained by the proposed algorithm, is identified by using sixteen multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods. The non-dominated solutions reported in the past literature, for different test systems, are also analysed using MADM methods. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm gives better results without violating the constraints and with the minimum number of iterations.},

Additionally, with the adoption of smart and intelligent control schemes, the latest communication technologies with the extensive placement of smart devices, there will be significant growth in real-time system measurements. Under this trend, an adaptive fuzzy PID (A-FLC-PID) system will play a vital role in reducing transient time. In this article, a novel adaptive fuzzy control architecture intended for load frequency control with a supplementary hybrid moth flame optimization pattern search (h-MFO-PS) algorithm is presented. The proposed approach is designed to optimize the controller gains for the eventual fitness of the objective function. The hybrid algorithm smartly updates the scaling factors of the adaptive fuzzy controller by considering various proportional and integral thresholds. Simulations are performed on two areas hydrothermal system with the gas unit. To validate the research outcomes and measure the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, the outcomes are compared with recent research approaches and practicability is tested using an OPAL-RT setup. The sturdiness of the concerned approach is studied with a wide range of parameterization and loading conditions. It is observed that the h-MFO-PS scaled A-FLC-PID controller establishes superior improvement in frequency regulation.},

By using Multiple Dimensional Scaling, subtasks in different dimensions can be optimized simultaneously with a single set of reference points. The efficiency of the method is substantiated by multiobjective benchmark problems and practical instances. In most of the test probability, MFEA-RP converges faster to the true Pareto front.

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is one of the most well-known approaches for solving the multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). When the number of objectives is greater than three, the MOPs are considered as many-objective optimization problem (MaOPs), and many-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) are proposed to solve MaOPs. However, MaOPs often contain redundant objectives which do not conflict to any other objectives or even correlate positively to some other. These redundant objectives seriously degrade the efficiency of MOEAs/MaOEAs, so they should be removed to help MaOEAs work better. Therefore, this paper proposes new objective reduction algorithms which uses a Pareto corner search algorithm (PCSEA) to generate non-dominated solutions at corners of Pareto front (PF), and then applies machine learning techniques to remove redundant objectives. The proposed methods not only promote the strengths of PCSEA in finding non-dominated solutions but also promote the strengths of machine learning algorithms in automatically finding the optimal set of objectives. The experiments on 36 instances of DTLZ5(I,M) and 10 instances of WFG3(M) show that the proposed methods can more often find the right set of objectives than six other benchmark methods, respectively about 80% success compared to about 62% success of the other methods.},

Practical scenarios related to WSN deployment are often considered as optimization models with multiple conflicting objectives that are simultaneously enhanced. In the related literature, it had been shown that moving from mono-objective to multi-objective resolution of WSN deployment is beneficial. However, since the deployment of real-world WSNs encompasses more than three objectives, a multi-objective optimization may harm other deployment criteria that are conflicting with the already considered ones. Thus, our aim is to go further, explore the modeling and the resolution of WSN deployment in a many-objective (i.e., optimization with more than three objectives) fashion and especially, exhibit its added value. In this context, we first propose a many-objective deployment model involving seven conflicting objectives, and then we solve it using an adaptation of the Decomposition-based Evolutionary Algorithm “ $$\theta$$ -DEA”. The developed adaptation is named “WSN- $$\theta$$ -DEA” and is validated through a detailed experimental study.},

Since this pandemic requires pervasive diagnosis, developing smart, fast, and efficient detection techniques is significant. To this end, we have developed an Artificial Intelligence engine to classify the lung inflammation level (mild, progressive, severe stage) of the COVID-19 confirmed patient. In particular, the developed model consists of two phases; in the first phase, we calculate the volume and density of lesions and opacities of the CT scan images of the confirmed COVID-19 patient using Morphological approaches. The second phase classifies the pneumonia level of the confirmed COVID-19 patient. We use a modified Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbor; we also compared the results of both models to the other classification algorithms to precisely classify lung inflammation. The experiments show that the CNN model can provide testing accuracy up to 95.65% compared with exiting classification techniques. The proposed system in this work can be applied efficiently to CT scan and X-ray image datasets. Also, in this work, the Transfer Learning technique has been used to train the pre-trained modified CNN model on a smaller dataset than the original dataset; the modified CNN achieved 92.80% of testing accuracy for detecting pneumonia on chest X-ray images for the relatively extensive dataset.},

  abstract     = {Comparison is a powerful tool for decision support. Many measures have been proposed for comparing two metric spaces, but they do not consider the data dispersion in each metric space. Furthermore, no dedicated measure has yet been proposed for comparing two metric spaces containing elements belonging to various subtypes of a global datatype. In order to attenuate the aforementioned limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for comparing two metric spaces. More formally, given a metric space X, histograms are used for performing a gradual analysis of the data dispersion inside the neighborhood of each element of X. This is a refinement of the neighborhoods’ analysis realized in an existing work. Then, another existing technique is used for associating one hidden Markov model $${\lambda }_X$$ with X such that $${\lambda }_X$$ learns the bin values and the visual shapes of the histograms derived from the instances in X. Meta-data derived from $${\lambda }_X$$ are then saved as the components of a descriptor vector $$\overrightarrow{X}$$ associated with X. Finally, the comparison between two metric spaces is performed through the comparison of their respective associated descriptor vectors using existing distance or similarity measures between two vectors. The proposed approach inherits the accuracy and the efficiency of the existing techniques on which it relies. Therefore, the experiments realized in this paper are only intended to show how it can be used for comparing particular metric spaces containing geolocations or stars in the celestial sphere.},

The framework of the proposed method are inspired by the main war phases and contains seven components: initialization, intelligence, conception, suppression, advance, assault and exploitation. The basic fire and manoeuvre tactic is adopted in the suppression and advance phases. The proposed fire and manoeuvre algorithm (FMA) is a hybridization of a greedy algorithm with a multi-neighbouring search procedure. The developed algorithm has been employed to minimize makespan of the classical flow shop scheduling problem. A mathematical model is presented to describe the studied optimisation problem. Comparative experiments on Taillard’s data set confirmed that the (FMA) results are more accurate than already published data. A comparison between the FMA and other popular nature-inspired algorithms has been conducted.

Thus, trustees must be able to adapt how they interact with trustors to ensure that the trustees are trusted in the environment. To accomplish this, various trust establishment models have been proposed to allow trustees to adjust their behaviours to become more trustworthy towards the trustors in an environment. By using a generalized trust establishment model architecture, models can be designed for various domains and assumptions along with the inclusion of a new preprocessing module that allows for both transaction-level preprocessing and trustor-level postprocessing. The proposed architecture is designed to be compatible with both existing and new models. A simple, yet robust, trust establishment model using this architecture, called the Generalized Trust Establishment Model (GTEM), is defined to exhibit the benefits from using a generalized architecture with preprocessing. Through simulations with and without the preprocessing module in GTEM, along with using two additional trust establishment models, the architecture is shown to provide more fine-tuned results when using the preprocessing module. GTEM using the preprocessing module achieved a higher good transaction rate and higher average direct trust faster than other models within the environment.},

The goal of this work is to introduce a new type of particle represented by a $$d-$$ dimensional hypercube. Our new representation offers a field of view to swarm particles, making them aware of their surroundings . This gives each particle its own coverage of the search space. We evaluated the effect of our approach in the performance of seven swarm-based algorithms, including artificial bee colony, cuckoo search optimization and particle swarm optimization. We used 30 well-known benchmark functions and six different numbers of dimensions. We compared the performances of the algorithms with blind and sighted particles using Mann-Whitney tests. The results of our extensive experiments show that sighted particles perform at least as well as blind ones in 93% of all scenarios, across different algorithms, benchmark functions and numbers of dimensions, showing significantly better results 51% of the time. We also proposed a new scale which measures an algorithm’s exploration and exploitation capabilities and we used it to explain our results. Finally, we followed a sighted swarm throughout the convergence process, showing its ability to cover large portions of the search space. Our take-home message is that any swarm algorithm can adopt our particle representation in order to improve its performance, because any method can benefit from improving its exploitation and exploration capabilities.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, detecting fraud transactions has become a popular research topic because credit card fraud transactions result in the loss of billions of dollars every year. Therefore, the need for financial institutions and banks to improve their fraud detection systems is increasing. Financial institutions are increasingly using data mining to develop fraud detection systems that can detect and stop fraudulent transactions automatically. From the standpoint of machine learning, detecting fraud transactions is a binary classification problem. However, interpretability is essential for management to have faith in the used model and to develop fraud prevention strategies. Designing an algorithm that can detect fraud transactions is difficult and needs a higher understanding of each part of the process and a lot of time. However, hyperparameters optimization using metaheuristics techniques reduces the understanding and time needed to handle this issue. Hyperparameters optimization is a technique that is used to select the best hyperparameters that yield the highest performance. Using a metaheuristic approach has many advantages, such as improving the performance of the machine learning model,Tayebi e facilitating the usage of the machine learning model, etc. Our proposed solution in this work is to use metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), grey wolf optimizer algorithm (GWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), to optimize hyperparameters and compare these algorithms with grid search method (GS). The used machine learning models in this study are AdaBoost (AD), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine classifier (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), mlpclassier (MLP), and decision tree (DT). To compare these optimizers, we use the following evaluation metrics; accuracy, recall, f1-score, precision, and the area under the roc curve (AUC).},

In this paper, a novel two-phase hybrid feeder (TPHF) is proposed to provide elite solutions for selection mechanism of many-objective optimization algorithms (MaOAs) to improve their performance. The proposed TPHF framework generates solutions using a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) operator along with a genetic algorithm operator during a two-phase calculated search based on the average velocity of the PSO particles. TPHF focuses on the worst solutions of the population to find a better place for them. Therefore, it frequently resets the PSO particles to the worst solutions. The new PSO operator uses the novel idea of dynamic inertia and learning factors and a novel velocity update equation. The classic global bests set of the classic PSO operator is replaced by a PSO feeder which uses the novel idea of using groups of the best/worst solutions to feed the new PSO operator based on the phase of the search. The proposed TPHF is applied to some of the most famous and state-of-the-art MaOAs with their corresponding default parameters. The result of the comparison between these MaOAs with their corresponding TPHF versions on MaF test suite shows a significant improvement in the performance of the TPHF versions in 62.2% of the cases.},

This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, called Single Candidate Optimizer (SCO), that relies only on a single candidate solution throughout the whole optimization process. The proposed algorithm implements a unique set of equations to effectively update the position of the candidate solution. To balance exploration and exploitation, SCO is integrated with the two-phase strategy where the candidate solution updates its position differently in each phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by testing it on thirty three classical benchmarking functions and four real-world engineering problems. SCO is compared with three well-known optimization algorithms, i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer, and Gravitational Search Algorithm and with four recent high-performance algorithms: Equilibrium Optimizer, Archimedes Optimization Algorithm, Mayfly Algorithm, and Salp Swarm Algorithm. According to Friedman and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, SCO can significantly outperform all other algorithms for the majority of the investigated problems. The results achieved by SCO motivates the design and development of new single-solution-based optimization algorithms to further improve the performance.

  abstract     = {The current abundance of the collected biomedical data provides an important tool for the development of medical data classification systems. However, processing big data requires powerful algorithms. In this perspective, we propose a hybrid classifier that combines radial basis function (RBF) and extreme learning machine (ELM) neural networks. This combination is motivated by the high performances and the complementary of these two types of neural networks. The basic idea relies on complementing a compact RBF network by an ELM network that contains a diversity of hidden neurons. The optimization of the number, forms, and types of the ELM hidden neurons is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA). The objectives of the proposed classifier can be summarized as follows. First, it benefits from the complementary properties of RBF and ELM, like local response of RBFs and global response of ELM. Second, it makes use of the advantages of ELM, like fast training and the possibility of using a variety of activation functions. Third, it alleviates the ill conditioning problem of ELM by joining the systematic initialization of RBF to the random initialization of ELM. Fourth, the optimization process, performed using GA, is simplified because it concerns only the added neurons, which their role is complementing the RBF network. To assess the performance of the proposed classifier, we carry out tests on six medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and compare the obtained results with those of other state-of-the-art works. The obtained average performance measurement, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for Wisconsin breast cancer are 97.38%, 98.38%, 96.85%, for Pima Indians diabetes are 77.61%, 57.35%, 88.22%, for heart Statlog are 83.71%, 77.92%, 88.34%, for hepatitis are 87.10%, 95.89%, 40.10%, for Parkinson are 92.62%, 96.50%, 80.76%, and for liver-disorders are 72.48%, 82.68%, 58.39% respectively},

Hence our research is focused to examine the execution speed and accuracy of quantum support vector machines classification compared to classical SVM classification by proper quantum feature mapping selection. As the size of the dataset becomes complex, a proper feature map has to be selected to outperform or equally perform the classification. Hence the paper focuses on the selection of the best feature map for some benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {Task scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems is an NP-complete problem, which using exact algorithms, it is not possible to achieve the optimal solution at the right time to solve it. In such cases, meta-heuristic algorithms can be effective. On the other hand, in the matter of scheduling, creating a balance between maximizing parallelism and minimizing communication cost is one of the main goals. In this paper, an improved COA algorithm has been used to schedule tasks in heterogeneous distributed systems and to increase parallelism and reduce communication cost. The improved COA algorithm considers a larger number of eggs for the sample that has the highest fit, after the cuckoo laying stage and the samples are identified. Three standard graphs, FFT, Gaussian and molecular, were used to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results indicate that SLR, speedup, and performance have improved with mapping in these three standard graphs. The results totally show 5.91% improvement comparing the MOSCOA, 4.4% comparing EGA-TS and also 3.86% comparing E-COA so they show that improving the above criteria leads to reducing the total execution time and improving the performance of the COA algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The solution to numerous real-world problems is challenging using the in-hand deterministic approaches in the modern age. The researchers are continuously looking for new methods to deal with such tasks. The timE−bound dependency on the solutions motivates the researchers to develop approximate approaches. If the answer is not with us, nature may provide a direction for approximate solutions for various problems. A few applications have been significantly solved by algorithms inspired by the different species’ natural behavior. These naturE−inspired algorithms are developed based on the survival strategies of the species. This study attempts to simulate the shelter searching strategy of the tropical cancer hermit crabs mathematically. The presented algorithm is called hermit crab shell exchange (HCSE). The competitiveness of the HCSE algorithm is established on three different sets of optimization functions, including various unconstrained, constrained, and engineering design optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the design optimization of cam–follower mechanisms (CFM) with eccentric roller type follower using recently developed advanced optimization algorithms, namely Rao, SAMP-Rao, and QO-Rao algorithms. Four types of follower motion law i.e., cycloidal, modified harmonic, 3–4–5 degree polynomial, and 4–5–6–7 degree polynomial motion, are considered. The CFM is optimized to minimize three objectives such as the input torque needed to rotate the cam, the radius of the pitch circle of the cam, and the maximum contact stress. The problem has five continuous design variables, namely the roller radius (Rg), the radius of cam base circle (Rb), the distance between the follower bearing and the center of the cam (q), the eccentricity of the follower (e), and the length of follower bearing (b). Eight design constraints related to the geometry of the cam mechanism, the pressure angle, the efficiency of the mechanism, the curvature radius of the pitch curve, and the maximum contact stress, are considered. The computational results obtained using Rao algorithms and their variants are compared with other advanced optimization algorithms such as the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), ant lion optimizer (ALO), moth–flame optimization (MFO), multi verse optimizer (MVO), evaporation rate water cycle algorithm (ER-WCA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and mine blast algorithm (MBA). The comparison of optimization results reveals that the optimum value of a fitness function obtained using Rao algorithms and their variants is superior to GWO, ALO, MFO, SSA, ER-WCA, MBA, and MVO for all four cases considered. The optimum fitness function value of the CFM with case III is reduced by 3.14%, 4.13%, and 7.61% compared to the CFM’s fitness function value with the case I, case II, and case IV, respectively. Hence, the 3–4–5 degree polynomial motion of the follower is effective for better performance of the CFM. Also, the average time required for Rao algorithms and their variants is comparatively significantly less than the other algorithms considered. The effectiveness of Rao algorithms and their variants will help the community to improve the optimum solutions to their problems in their respective research field. Also, Rao algorithms will decrease the researchers’ efforts required to tune the algorithm-specific control parameters as these algorithms do not have algorithm-specific control parameters. Furthermore, the Friedman rank test proves the significance of the statistical results acquired using Rao algorithms and their variants.},

  abstract     = {Standard method of assessing breast cancer is a triple test assessment. In this method, initially a thorough medical examination and patient history is evaluated, secondly imaging of the breast using x-rays and/or ultrasound is done and finally a preoperative cytodiagnosis is done that is either Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) or Core Needle Biopsy (CNB) or both. FNAC being a minimally invasive and rapidly performed test is preferred in many cases over CNB that is more invasive. If a triple test gives positive result in any one of the three steps then the result is taken positive. FNAC involves determining the cell size and shape parameters and based on their values a case is classified as benign or malignant. To automate the process of decision making a novel technique has been proposed. In this technique a digital logic circuit was evolved using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). A CGP network was trained and then tested with FNAC feature data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The dataset consists of 669 samples, of which 350 samples were used for training purposes and then the trained system was evaluated with 349 test samples. A number of experiments were performed, each with a different set of network parameters. The best evolved network classified the samples with an accuracy of 99.42%, which is higher than that produced with most of the contemporary techniques. The network so produced can be implemented on re-configurable hardware.},

There is always a need for an energy-conscious model for WSN that will prolong the network lifetime during system execution. Commonly the WSN is distributed in nature as it is used for several applications like localization, surveillance, and object tracking. In such a scenario, energy management is even more critical. In this regard, we propose an energy-efficient topological localization technique called CLOCK- Localization Approach (CLA) that ensures a long lifetime of WSN by eliminating recurrent reclustering and iterative cluster head (CH) selection. CLA follows a CLOCK pattern-based sensor deployment strategy where the selected CHs play a dual role of CH and Vice-CH. It helps to reduce energy consumption and overhead issue. The simulation result shows that the outperformance of the CLA algorithm in comparison to low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized (LEACH-C) and base station controlled dynamic clustering protocol (BCDCP).},

However, COA showed its effectiveness in solving the global optimization problem, it suffers from premature convergence and stagnation in local optima, espicially in a complex space. In this paper, the multi-swarm topology is employed, where the population is divided into several sub-swarms. The performance of multi-swarm coyote optimization algorithm (MCOA) is evaluated on a set of benchmark functions provided in the IEEE CEC 2005 and IEEE CEC 2017 special sessions. Also, it is evaluated for solving multi-level thresholding problem, where 44 skin dermoscopic images obatined from PH2 benchmark dataset are used. The experimental results showed that employing mutli-swarm topology can significantly improve the population diversity and thus the exploration ability. Also, the results reveal that proposed MCOA has the advantages of remarkable stability and high accuracy compared with its classical version and other state-of-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Additionally, a new skin lesion segmentation model based on MCOA is proposed as well. The results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and it can be further used for skin disease diagnosis and treatment planning.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing the mass of a structure and maximizing its first natural frequency of vibration are conflicting objectives of real interest in structural design. To avoid problems with resonance, which can lead to their collapse, structures can be designed by making the first natural frequency of vibration high. Furthermore, it is crucial to stay away from excitation frequencies. Here we formulate and solve multi-objective structural optimization problems of trusses with these conflicting objectives. This type of problem is uncommon in the literature, since the natural frequencies of vibration are generally set as constraints rather than as objective functions. The generalized differential evolution 3 (GDE3), the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), decision space-based niching (DN-NSGA-II), the competitive mechanism-based multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (CMOPSO), and the MOPSO with multiple search strategies (MMOPSO) are the algorithms used in this paper. Additionally, cardinality constraints are used to manage the difficulty of discovering the best member grouping, which is very effective in addressing the problems analyzed in this paper. The experiments refer to the 10-, 25-, 72-, and 200-bar trusses. Each involves two analyses, taking into account the performance indicators and the use of a multi tournament decision (MTD) method to extract the desired solutions. Furthermore, the design variables of each extracted solution, including its optimized topology, are provided.},

Best-effort strategy allows operators that perform well enough to execute again, which improves the utilization of computing resources. Weighted maximum approach is an environmental selection strategy based on decomposition, which selects by comparing the maximum of weighted objective values of the subproblem. Each new individual will be compared with the best individual of all subproblems, not only in the sub domain, which helps the PSO operator to maintain the diversity in search process.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used in defect detection in transmission line inspection images, but the local nature of the convolution operation limits the detector&#39;s performance. Transformers have become more and more prominent in the field of computer vision because of their global computing function. This paper proposes a transmission line image defect detection method that combines CNN and Transformer comprehensively. In particular, an enhanced local perception unit is designed to reduce false and missed detections of small and occluded objects. The problem of the high computation and complexity of the Multi-Head Self-Attention module is solved via a lightweight self-attention method. In addition, an adaptive multi-scale fusion module is designed to extract more effective fusion features and improve the model’s robustness. The numerical realization of the proposed method versus Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Cascade R-CNN, DEtection TRansformer (DETR)-R50, You Only Look One-level Feature (YOLOF), You Only Look One X-Large (YOLOX-L) and Swin Transformer (Swin-T) proved its superiority in the average accuracy of transmission line image defect detection.},

HAL involves performing regularized regression of the outcome on a tensor product of indicator basis functions. In this paper we show that this basis can be represented as a non-recursive partitioning of the feature space and propose a method for mapping this partitioning implied by HAL to a recursive partitioning. Such a mapping then allows for the representation of HAL as a decision tree, thereby providing interpretability of predictions made by the algorithm. We refer to this post-hoc method for interpretability as Highly Adaptive Regression Trees (HART). We provide a set of algorithms to construct this mapping and conveniently visualize the resulting tree. Using real data, we show that HAL’s predictive performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods, and we demonstrate the construction and interpretation of HARTs.},

A two-stage framework is pursued, where three of the most popular local and global agnostic eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools (permutation feature importance, Kernel SHAP, and LIME) are applied to explain the decisions of different machine learning black box models, such as Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and MLP. A preliminary study analysis is carried out to investigate the various outcomes proposed by each method on a multiple myeloma chemotherapy treatment collected dataset. Experiments show that the RF algorithm reached the best recognition with 98.63% classification accuracy, followed by XGBoost, MLP, and SVM with 95.89%, 92.23%, and 87.21%, respectively. However, among the three applied XAI models, Kernel SHAP provides more transparency by emphasizing the features involved in the classification results. The study highlights the importance of transparency and the precautions needed when interpreting existing XAI tools. We also raise important questions about the future improvements of explainable machine learning techniques for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.},

  abstract     = {Butterfly optimization algorithm is a population intelligent optimization algorithm, which is easy to fall into local optimal and has low searching accuracy. In this paper, a chaotic adaptive butterfly optimization algorithm (CABOA) is proposed. Firstly, the Kent mapping is used to initialize the location of individual butterfly and increase the diversity of initial population. Secondly, adaptive switch probability is introduced in search phases to balance local search and global search phase. Then, the adaptive weight coefficient is introduced to adjust the search direction and the moving step of the individual butterfly to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, Cauchy variation is carried out to guide the advance direction of the population and avoid falling into local optimum. In this paper, the algorithm is used to obtain the optimal value of 12 benchmark test functions, and is applied to the design of welded beams. Experimental results show that the performance of the improved algorithm has significant advantages over other comparison algorithms: in the function optimization experiment, the average optimal value is improved by 99% compared with the original algorithm, and about 90% compared with other improved algorithms. Meanwhile, the algorithm proposed in this paper obtains the optimal value of all functions and has high efficiency. Compared with other existing optimization algorithms, CABOA has better convergence performance and certain competitiveness, and has certain advantages in the application field.},

  abstract     = {Due to the unreasonable connectivity of wireless sensor networks, there are errors in calculating the distance between the location-unaware nodes and the location-aware nodes. Therefore, a novel method combining improved particle swarm optimization and improved differential evolution (IPSO-IDE) is proposed. Firstly, the learning factor of the particle swarm optimization method is modified, and the disturbance term is added to prevent premature, thus strengthening its exploration ability. Then, the adaptive mutation and crossover mechanism are applied to the differential evolution method so that each chromosome can mutate and cross adaptively with individual fitness and average fitness, to improve its exploitation ability. Finally, the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and differential evolution method (IDE) are run in parallel in the node positioning model. After fixed number of iterations, the optimal individual information of the two methods is shared to obtain the IPSO-IDE method. Therefore, IPSO-IDE has the advantages of both. The results show that the IPSO-IDE algorithm not only has some advantages in time complexity, but also improves the positioning accuracy by 27.2%, 8.7%, 4.5% and 5.7% respectively, compared with particle swarm optimization with a variable neighborhood algorithm, modified particle swarm optimization algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm and artificial bee colony algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce a template-based computational method to recognize chords through an audio recording of a musical instrument. The algorithm is based on a temporal frequency analysis using Gabor’s filter banks. These filters are centered over adjusted frequencies of musical notes in different octaves and the adjustment is accomplished in terms of the detunings on the recording. Using the results in the filtering stage, a geometric mean of each chord is calculated. It is important to mention that these statistics are calculated from the combination of notes that form each chord and are automatically grouped as templates. The presence of chords is determined from these metrics. Several experiments are carried out for major, minor, augmented, diminished and suspended chords played on acoustic guitar, classic guitar, electric guitar, piano and ukulele. A comparative study against machine-learning classifiers is presented. The results show a superior performance of the present approach. In addition, the proposed method presents the advantage that it does not require a training stage, in contrast with the methods based on machine-learning algorithms. This reduces significatively the storage and time requiered for processing.},

To address the above problems, this article combined discourse topic and attention mechanism and proposed the Attention-based SoftLexicon with TF-IDF (ASLT) for agricultural diseases and pests entity recognition. By dividing the words sets based on the positions of characters in the words, merging the discourse topic features into the calculation of lexical information, and introducing the attention mechanism, the recognition accuracy of Chinese agricultural diseases and pests entities can be enhanced. In order to improve the interpretability of the model, we designed a flow chart to explain the major principles and steps, and explained the model through visual methods. This article selected 1061 Chinese agricultural news texts and constructed the Corpus of Chinese Named Entities of Diseases and Pests (CCNEDP), in which 7806 agricultural diseases and pests named entities in total were labeled. According to the present experimental results, the proposed ASLT method can effectively recognize the entities in Chinese agricultural texts and achieve favorable recognition on CCNEDP, with the recognition accuracy, the recall rate and the value of F1 of 93.57, 92.79 and 93.18%, respectively. By contrast with the other entity recognition methods, ASLT shows enhanced recognition performance in terms of accuracy and operating efficiency.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to shed light on some of the conceptual interpretations that might be extracted from either the information conveyed by fuzzy differential equations (FDEs) or a fusion of such information with other data sources. Although no explicit effort has been conducted on the topic, there are two significant imperatives for such interpretations. First, conceptual interpretations are necessary when FDEs are employed in modelling, prediction, control theory, and suchlike subjects. Simply put, FDEs fail to be applicable if their corresponding interpretations have not been recognized conceptually. Second, when FDEs are supposed to be analyzed. In other words, in the lack of such interpretations of FDEs, any analysis on this type of differential equations is conceptually devoid of meaning. The interpretations are associated with the concept of possibility distribution and differential equations which might be called imprecise differential equations (IDEs) that are in effect the mother of differential equations. The concept of IDE makes a convenient point of departure for the development of the interpretations in question in terms of the concepts such as machine-oriented meaning precisiation, modal solutions, precisiations compatibility, and some new facets of sureness. Specifically, interpretations associated with the compatibility of precisiations and the notion of human-machine-based sureness demonstrate the role played by information resident in an FDE fused with perception-based meaning precisiation, that stems from the knowledge of an expert. Some illustrations and examples are presented to clarify the basic concepts and the applications of interpretations.},

Recently, the fuzzy extension of RDF data has received widespread attention because of their ability to represent and process fuzzy information. An important issue for the success of fuzzy RDF applications is how to achieve persistent data storage and query capabilities. In this article, we investigate the storage and query of fuzzy RDF data. To accomplish this, we study how to formally map fuzzy RDF graph represented by the labeled directed graph structure to Property Graphs (PGs) database storage model. We implement the process that the mapping relationship between fuzzy RDF graph and property graph. Moreover, we manage these data by a chosen Neo4j Graph DBMS in order to support expressive querying services over the stored data. Finally, we have compared our method based on Neo4j graph database with the method based on relational database, and the experimental results prove that using the graph database model to store fuzzy RDF graph data sets is effective and feasibility.},

Yet a critical limiting factor of ensembles is that they are difficult to interpret due to their complex inner workings. In medicine the ability to explain and interpret a model can be vital for clinical acceptance and trust. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the main causes of death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. Utilizing the NHANES diabetes mortality data set, it is shown that the Random Forests ensemble with optimized hyperparameters yields a strong prognosis model. Importantly, conjoining Random Forests with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) yields reliable interpretability of the contributions and interactions among the features.

Finally, in order to improve the performance of supply chain, a combined contract of revenue sharing and responsibility sharing is designed to coordinate the green supply chain under different preferences of the manufacturer. The results show that the retailer undertaking CSR is conducive to the green development of the supply chain, but the loss aversion preference of the manufacturer will have a negative impact on the supply chain members. In addition, when the manufacturer has rational preference, with the improvement of the retailer’s CSR level, the effective coordination interval length of coordination factors under combined contracts increases, and the coordination flexibility of supply chain increases. When the manufacturer loss aversion preference, the upper and lower limits of the coordination factor of the combined contract will increase with the increase of loss aversion preference, and the length of the coordination interval will decrease, which will lead to the difficulty of cooperation among supply chain members.},

This study aims to demonstrate the application of a novel strategy based on MCDM techniques as the core element of a consumer Decision Support System by suggesting the most appropriate items from a given set of alternatives. Ranking products based on online product ratings and consumer preferences is an important area of study, but there are currently few studies on this topic. This paper proposes a method for ranking products using multi-attribute online ratings. We propose a novel mobile recommendation-ranking system-based (MCDM) method to recommend the best alternative. Our proposed model differs from previous works in the following ways: (a) Rating information of each feature is used to identify user preferences and complementary criteria; (b) Criteria weights are determined by Shannon entropy (c) The complex proportional assessment method is employed to rank the alternatives and solve the best mobile recommendation problem. (d) The sensitivity study results showed that the rankings produced by the various MCDM approaches were highly consistent with the rankings of the evaluated compromise candidates. Demonstration of the proposed approach through a mobile phone selection case study. In our experiments, we have found that our approach provides a reliable ranking while reducing time and space complexity, indicating that our optimization model is accurate and efficient. With its superior product comparison skills and ability to offer a recommendation to the user as a final ranking of alternatives, a decision-making system like this may prove to be the optimal long-term answer for e-commerce sites and websites.},

The deep convolutional neural network is used to construct action network and target network, and the state features are used as inputs to output the Q value of each action. Then, the action is selected by using the action validity exploration and exploitation strategy. Finally, the immediate reward is calculated and the scheduling environment is updated.

Contingencies occur randomly and the amount of realization cannot be known until it breaks out. Therefore, it is important to stockpile some necessary supplies in advance. However, a large advance stockpile on the demand side would incur low-carbon disposal costs, which are not economical. Also, the supplier will have no incentive to stockpile for the demander due to low carbon disposal costs and production costs. Therefore, we propose a contractual approach with option to stimulate supplier to stockpile for his client. Three models are discussed based on the consideration of low-carbon disposal costs: a centralized decision case, a non-option decentralized case, and a decentralized case with option. The outcomes demonstrate that the number of first orders under the decentralized case without option is less than the order quantity under the centralized case. Moreover, the size of the first purchase volume in all three cases depends on the both parties’ practical factors. Meanwhile, the reasonable interval of option fee is obtained by analysis.},

  abstract     = {Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) defines a framework for learning from previously collected static buffer. However, offline RL is prone to approximation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) data and particularly inefficient for pixel-based learning tasks compared with state-based input control methods. Several pioneer efforts have been made to solve this problem; some use pessimistic Q-values approximation for unseen observation while others train a model to simulate the environment to train a model on previously collected data to learn policies. However, these methods require accurate and time-consuming estimation of the Q-values or the environment models. Based on this observation, we present offline RL methods with augmented data (ORAD), a handy but non-trivial extension to offline RL algorithms. We show that simple data augmentations, e.g. random translation and random crop, significantly elevate the performance of the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. Besides, we find that regularization of the Q-values can also enhance performance. Extensive experiments on the pixel-based input control-Atari demonstrate the superiority of ORAD over SOTA offline RL methods considering both performance and data efficiency, and reveal that ORAD is more effective for the pixel-based control.},

The lack of studies on the form of landscape elements and combination of natural attributes in landscape beauty is a main shortcoming in this field. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop an artificial neural network model and tool to predict the aesthetic quality of the landscape containing water and plants in different forms and volume. Therefore, we recorded 6 landscape characteristics in 100 landscapes in 10 urban parks. Multi-layer perceptron model (MLP) represented the highest value of R2 in training (0.98) and test (0.94) data set. According to the sensitivity analysis, the values of trees planting form, water, hedge, grass, water body form and trees were determined respectively as the inputs influencing the MLP model outputs. The urban park landscapes with more trees in the form of strip or group and water bodies and less hedge and grass would likely attract park visitors’ attraction. The designed graphical user interface in MATLAB software, makes MLP an environmental decision support system tool for landscape designers and it is a platform to predict the quality of environment and the future researches should be on discussing or the relationship between spatial for of landscape attributes. In practice, the designed environmental decision support system tool is applied by landscape managers to predict the aesthetic quality of landscape in designing new parks.},

The proposed work contained three major stages: the data preparation, the feature selection stage, and finally, the classification stage. The dataset has been collected by the questionnaire, the number of samples was 1450 samples of teachers from different cities in Iraq which were selected randomly, while the number of features was twenty-six. Two types of feature selection techniques utilized were Chi-square and classification and regression Tree (CART) methods. Three techniques had been used in the classification stage Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The results showed the features had values differently in importance. The features selection technique had a positive effect on the performance, where the accuracy was 91.7%, 99.31%, and 99.68% when used NB, SVM, and DNN consecutively when using the CART selection method and 75.3%, 75.4%, and 98.7% consecutively for all features.},

Traditional methods, such as centrality based methods, only consider either network structures or node features to evaluate the importance of nodes. However, these methods ignore the rich semantic information between nodes formed by complex physical and logical relations. To solve this problem, we propose a novel node capability dependency importance evaluation method considering meta-path and capability dependency, called NCDI. Meta-path is an effective method of semantic capture, different meta-paths express different semantic informations. Some nodes could support or control other nodes, inter-node dependency can also be used as an indicator of importance evaluation. Compared to the degree centrality and other typical evaluation methods, the results show that our method can sort the node importance more effectively in HTON.},

Usually, the available network bandwidth is limited and divided into several channels, and there exists a need for efficient reuse and adaptive allocation of such channels. During the communication process, U users compete with each other for C shared channels even without knowing accurate, complete channel state information. In order to avoid collision, traditional methods usually depend on centralized scheduling or message exchange, which are cumbersome and computationally expensive. To deal with this issue, we propose a deep Q-network, based on LSTM and fair channel allocation policy, to learn the dynamic spectrum access rules for network utility maximization. Extensive validation of the proposed approach shows that our scheme yields quite promising results.},

Parameter sharing of attention mechanism enables the size of neural network linearly with local observation’s length of single agent regardless of the agents’ number.

Secondly, in order to overcome the disconnection between the objective functions caused by the traditional method to deal with uncertain factors, this paper proposes a so-called uncertain method to solve UBMUA problem by defining the relationship of order between uncertain variables. According the real decision-making process, the UBUMA is transformed into a single-objective programming problem by using $$C_E$$ principle relation. Finally, the ant algorithm is employed to solve the single-objective programming problem and then the $$C_E$$ efficient mission routes are obtained.

  abstract     = {Online branding plays an increasingly vital role for agricultural products in agriculture and e-commerce industries alike. To improve the cooperation between farmers and e-retailers, and to increase awareness of agricultural products through online branding, many governments implement series of subsidy policies. We investigate the impact of government subsidies by proposing a three-player game model (consisting of a government, a farmer, and an e-retailer) in supply chains. More specifically, we develop four Stackelberg game scenarios, including a benchmark scenario in which government provides no subsidies, two scenarios in which government subsidizes either farmer or e-retailer without subsidizing the other, and one in which both are subsidized. We find awareness of online branding for agricultural products is positively related to farmers? market sensitivity while e-retailers? cost factor shows a negative relation; optimal awareness emerges when both farmers and retailers are subsidized. In turn, farmers and retailers achieve their best profits when both are subsidized. Furthermore, farmers? profits are higher than e-retailers? in every subsidy scenario. We obtain the most effective parameters for government subsidies using ex ante and ex post strategies, extending our model by incorporating spillover effects. Most of our conclusions are consistent with intuition and propositions we began with, but it is interesting to note that farmers? best profits appear when farmers receive subsidies and e-retailers do not.},

  abstract     = {The new era requires port sectors cannot only promote economic development, but also need to achieve social harmony and ecological environment protection, which is in accordance with the initiative of ecological civilization construction proposed by the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Yet most performance-evaluated metrics related to social and environmental dimensions are qualitative not quantitative and hence not easy to be observed imprecisely, which makes it more complex to evaluate the ecological performance of port sectors. To address this issue, this paper introduces uncertainty theory to data envelopment analysis to deal with the imprecise data. Meanwhile, considering that the port industries usually reveal the characteristics of economies of scale and ignoring it would result in incomplete evaluation and wrong decision-making, this paper examines the ecological efficiency of port industries from the two perspectives with both technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Through the empirical analysis of China’s 17 port sectors, two major categories have emerged representing ecological efficiencies at different levels. That is, technically eco-efficient and eco-inefficient ports group as well as scale eco-efficient and eco-inefficient ports group. Moreover, the improvement radii of eco-inefficient port sectors are further calculated by models. The empirical implications can help policymakers to formulate and adjust policies on ecological civilization construction in China’s port industry.},

After the construction and analysis of the evolutionary process of the product quality to stochastic differential model, the optimal equilibrium solutions and subsidy ratio is solved, by using the dynamic programming method.

To overcome this drawback, this paper formulates a new reliability metric tool based on self-dual credibility measure. Firstly, we introduce credilistic safety constraint to formulate credibilistic reliability optimization model on the basis of limit-state function. Then, several theorems are provided to show that the feasible domain generated by credibilistic safety constraint can be reformulated as the equivalent convex domain under mild assumptions, which enables credibilistic safety constraint to reformulate as the equivalent reliability constraint. Finally, one numerical example on the optimal design of three-bar truss structure is provided to show the applicability of the credibilistic reliability optimization model. By using out-of-sample back-testing, these comparison results are stated on the provided reliability level and the back-testing reliability level, which evidence the effectiveness of the optimal solution achieved by the proposed model for practical structural engineering.},

Back propagation (BP) neural network performed greatly in data adaptability and fitting, it has been widely used for forecasting study in various fields. However, given the low frequency and lack of periodicity of stock market crashes, the BP neural network can hardly predict the intensively fluctuated stock prices accurately during the crashes. To resolve this issue, we introduced BP neural network into Log-periodic power law model, proposed the Log-periodic power law hybrid model based on the BP neural network. This combined approach could further capture the fluctuation trend and predict the volatility during the stock market crashes better. The experimental results showed that this hybrid model could predict the stock prices in different stock markets with a slightly increased accuracy.

One of the subsequent influences is that the transport demand for packages has increased sharply. Hence it is very necessary to propose diverse transport organization modes in accordance with the different situation in different countries. A kind of new transportation mode, multi-package multi-train pickup and delivery problem with time window (MPMT-PDPTW) is proposed in this paper. It aims to achieve express package transportation with minimum cost and maximize utilization of luggage car of a passenger train at the same time. Considering the multiple constraints, such as limited carrying capacity, fixed departing and accepting time, we define the quality of service (QoS) as the evaluation criteria for package express transportation by the passenger train. A kind of meta-heuristic algorithm, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP), is designed to make full use of the redundant capacity of railway luggage car. An example is designed according to the railway passenger train timetable released by China Railway Corporation (CRC), the assignment schemes of packages at different railway stations reveal that the new transportation mode proposed in this paper is feasible and practical in package express transportation, and also has advantages in speed comparing with the highway and in transport cost over the airline.},

  abstract     = {As a dominant method in evidential reasoning, Bayesian network has been proved powerful in discrete fields. Although Bayesian network performs reliable in continuous variables and interval estimations, it relies on discretizing continuous variables or building an approximate model to conduct, which causes information loss and accuracy reduction. In order to bridge this gap, this paper introduces two inference rules combined with four inference rules proposed by other scholars. Then we propose a concept of uncertain inference network that consists of six basic structures matching inference rules to represent relationships and logic connection among the evidence. Evidence is represented by uncertain sets that can apply to continuous variables using membership functions to represent vague concepts. Furthermore, a numeric experiment for a forensic investigation of fire incidents is given to compare the results of uncertain inference network and Bayesian network. We found three merits in the case study. First, an uncertain inference network has simpler data access for each node because Bayesian network depends on conditional probability tables while uncertain inference network only relies on membership function. Second, an uncertain inference network has a more wide application because it can perform continuous variables with certain mathematical formulas without discretizing or approximating. Third, an uncertain inference network has a more accurate result because Bayesian network gives a point estimation with a 0–1 value while uncertain inference network conducts an interval estimation with a range value.},

Therefore, based on credibility theory, we investigate the incomplete information value and fuzziness when the fuzzy information is incomplete in the fuzzy programming by employing the two-stage method. To measure the maximum size of paying for incomplete information and the importance of fuzziness, we present two optimal indices which are the expected value of incomplete information and the value of fuzzy solution, and study their theoretical properties and rationality by some numerical examples.

There are three main improved steps in the novel ant colony algorithm in 3D path planning. In the first step, a pseudo-random state transition strategy is adopted to ensure the global search ability of the algorithm. In the second step, the pheromone update and the pheromone increment calculation method are used to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm which can ensure the quality of the solution. In the end step, a security value function of the heuristic function is used to ensure the security of path. In addition, the conditional fallback method is used to ensure the global search ability of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the new improved ant colony algorithm can find a feasible three-dimensional path quickly and efficiently.},

Thus, it is of importance to study the evolution of hot topics to explore the functions of cities for meeting the increasing demands of people. In this paper, we explored the semantic analysis of hot topics and trends in urban studies from the literature, which provides a research direction for future studies. Based on articles collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science databases from 2000 to 2016, we found that the number of urban studies increased in stability during that time. Followed by England and China, USA was the largest contributor for studies in this field. Based on the keywords and abstracts of these articles, we extracted the topics of the study using a clustering method and topic model, and calculated the hot values of the topics. Finally, we obtained 15 hot topics in the field of urban studies, among which “city”, “school”, “regional economic”, and “estate” were the hottest topics that indicated the focus of the research study. An anomaly detection method was used to analyze the change trend of topics’ hot values, and we found that the hot value of these topics overall were on the rise, especially “urban education” and “urban planning” increased significantly, which indicated that they attracted an increasing amount of scholars’ attention, but the hot value of “health” and “Gis” decreased significantly recently, which suggested that research interest in these two topics is decreasing.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an option contract for emergency material reserve because of quality catastrophic change. The quality catastrophic change happens randomly and the realized number can not be observed until it happened. Thus, it is necessary to reserve some emergency material beforehand. However, the demander is not qualified to make the storage. Meanwhile, the supplier has no motivation to make storage for the demander. Thus, an option contract is proposed to encourage the supplier to make backup for the demander and share the shortage cost if the backup less than the realized option order quantity. Three models are discussed: the centralized model without option, the decentralized model without option, and the decentralized model with option. The results demonstrate that the order quantity for the first time under the centralized scenario is greater than that under the decentralized model without option. And, the order of the purchase quantity for the first time under the three scenarios depend on the parameters decided by the both players. Meanwhile, through analysing, the effective range of option fee is proved to be limited to an interval.},

It can also be applied to academic evaluation, character knowledge base construction and so on. The paper introduces a text classifier trained for the personas of expert academic classification based on support vector machine. The problem of expert academic personas is converted into text classification. First, we automatically construct text training datasets based on seed expert database from Wikipedia. Then a unified model for Chinese-English expert classification is trained after text preprocessing and vectorization. Finally, we verified the effectiveness of our method on the real dataset acquired from the Internet. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods and achieves a F1-measure of 83.5% for expert academic classification.},

The performance of tasks with different processing depth is different under different light environmental conditions. High brightness display and color matching style of night vision interface is recommended in dark environment. High brightness display is recommended in yellow light environment; In white light, medium brightness display and white interface matching style are recommended.},

  abstract     = {Mixed integer optimization is very important and complicated task in the optimization field, which widely exists in the engineering problems. In order to improve the efficiency of derivative-free algorithm when solving the mixed integer optimization problems, we propose an efficient derivative-free algorithm, which is based on the modified minimal positive base and the technique of search directions rotation. The method using the modified minimal positive base only needs at most $$n+1$$ function evaluations at every iteration, compared with the derivative-free algorithms based on the maximal 2n positive base, where n is the number of variables. Meantime, the technique of search directions rotation we proposed can overcome the disadvantage of the method based on the minimal positive base which can cause undesirable large angles between some positive base directions and large unexplored feasible domain. Accordingly the convergence to stationary points is proved. To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it with two classical algorithms on 50 benchmark problems. The results of numerical experiments show that the method can reduce the number of function evaluations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.},

This paper explores the influence of different shortcut menu sizes on users’ operation performance in the touch-screen application situations with two tilting angles $$(6.6^{\circ }\,\hbox {and}\, 18^{\circ })$$ . The results show that the tilt angles of the two display screens have no significant influence on the response time of operators and the change trend of menu size. When the shortcut menu size is less than $$2.5\times 2.5\,\hbox {cm}$$ , the operator’s response time increases significantly with the reduction of shortcut menu size. When the shortcut menu size is more than $$2.5\times 2.5\,\hbox {cm}$$ , the increase of size has no significant impact on the operator’s response time. The shortcut menu recommends sizes between $$2.0\times 2.0\,\hbox {cm}$$ and $$2.5\times 2.5\,\hbox {cm}$$ , with $$2.25\times 2.25\,\hbox {cm}$$ being a key size value.
