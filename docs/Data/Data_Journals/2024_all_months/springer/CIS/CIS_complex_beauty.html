  abstract     = {In response to the issues of low solution efficiency, poor path planning quality, and limited search completeness in narrow passage environments associated with Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), this paper proposes a Grid-based Variable Probability Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (GVP-RRT) for narrow passages. The algorithm introduced in this paper preprocesses the map through gridization to extract features of different path regions. Subsequently, it employs random growth with variable probability density based on the features of path regions using various strategies based on grid, probability, and guidance to enhance the probability of growth in narrow passages, thereby improving the completeness of the algorithm. Finally, the planned route is subjected to path re-optimization based on the triangle inequality principle. The simulation results demonstrate that the planning success rate of GVP-RRT in complex narrow channels is increased by 11.5–69.5% compared with other comparative algorithms, the average planning time is reduced by more than 50%, and the GVP-RRT has a shorter average planning path length.},

  abstract     = {Most previous few-shot action recognition works tend to process video temporal and spatial features separately, resulting in insufficient extraction of comprehensive features. In this paper, a novel hybrid attentive prototypical network (HAPN) framework for few-shot action recognition is proposed. Distinguished by its joint processing of temporal and spatial information, the HAPN framework strategically manipulates these dimensions from feature extraction to the attention module, consequently enhancing its ability to perform action recognition tasks. Our framework utilizes the R(2+1)D backbone network, coupling the extraction of integrated temporal and spatial features to ensure a comprehensive understanding of video content. Additionally, our framework introduces the novel Residual Tri-dimensional Attention (ResTriDA) mechanism, specifically designed to augment feature information across the temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. ResTriDA dynamically enhances crucial aspects of video features by amplifying significant channel-wise features for action distinction, accentuating spatial details vital for capturing the essence of actions within frames, and emphasizing temporal dynamics to capture movement over time. We further propose a prototypical attentive matching module (PAM) built on the concept of metric learning to resolve the overfitting issue common in few-shot tasks. We evaluate our HAPN framework on three classical few-shot action recognition datasets: Kinetics-100, UCF101, and HMDB51. The results indicate that our framework significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the 1-shot task, demonstrated an increase of 9.8% in accuracy on UCF101 and improvements of 3.9% on HMDB51 and 12.4% on Kinetics-100. These gains confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in leveraging limited data for precise action recognition.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the application of Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) techniques in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) has emerged as a popular and promising research direction. Currently, there are mainly two types of NCO, namely, the Constructive Neural Combinatorial Optimization (CNCO) and the Perturbative Neural Combinatorial Optimization (PNCO). The CNCO generally trains an encoder-decoder model via supervised learning to construct solutions from scratch. It exhibits high speed in construction process, however, it lacks the ability for sustained optimization due to the one-shot mapping, which bounds its potential for application. Instead, the PNCO generally trains neural network models via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to intelligently select appropriate human-designed heuristics to improve existing solutions. It can achieve high-quality solutions but at the cost of high computational demand. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose to hybrid the CNCO and PNCO by designing a hybrid framework comprising two stages, in which the CNCO is the first stage and the PNCO is the second. Specifically, in the first stage, we utilize the attention model to generate preliminary solutions for given CO instances. In the second stage, we employ DRL to intelligently select and combine appropriate algorithmic components from improvement pool, perturbation pool, and prediction pool to continuously optimize the obtained solutions. Experimental results on synthetic and real Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs) and Traveling Salesman Problems(TSPs) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework with the assistance of automated algorithm design.},

The SSET model comprises the Edge Feature Fusion Subgraph Spatial Structure Extractor (ETSE) module and the Positional Information Encoding Graph Transformer (PEGT) module. The ETSE module extracts spatial structural information by fusing edge features and generating the most-value subgraph (Mv-subgraph). The PEGT module encodes positional information based on the graph transformer, addressing the indistinguishability problem among nodes with identical features. In addition, the SSET model alleviates the burden of high computational complexity by using subgraph.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is crucial to the intelligent transportation system. However, accurate traffic prediction still faces challenges. It is difficult to extract dynamic spatial–temporal correlations of traffic flow and capture the specific traffic pattern for each sub-region. In this paper, a temporal attention recurrent graph convolutional neural network (TARGCN) is proposed to address these issues. The proposed TARGCN model fuses a node-embedded graph convolutional (Emb-GCN) layer, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer, and a temporal attention (TA) layer into a framework to exploit both dynamic spatial correlations between traffic nodes and temporal dependencies between time slices. In the Emb-GCN layer, node embedding matrix and node parameter learning techniques are employed to extract spatial correlations between traffic nodes at a fine-grained level and learn the specific traffic pattern for each node. Following this, a series of gated recurrent units are stacked as a GRU layer to capture spatial and temporal features from the traffic flow of adjacent nodes in the past few time slices simultaneously. Furthermore, an attention layer is applied in the temporal dimension to extend the receptive field of GRU. The combination of the Emb-GCN, GRU, and the TA layer facilitates the proposed framework exploiting not only the spatial–temporal dependencies but also the degree of interconnectedness between traffic nodes, which benefits the prediction a lot. Experiments on public traffic datasets PEMSD4 and PEMSD8 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, it achieves 4.62% and 5.78% on PEMS03, 3.08% and 0.37% on PEMSD4, and 5.08% and 0.28% on PEMSD8 superiority on average. Especially for long-term prediction, prediction results for the 60-min interval show the proposed method presents a more notable advantage over compared benchmarks.

  abstract     = {With the continuous accumulation of massive amounts of mobile data, point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become a vital task for location-based social networks. Deep neural networks or matrix factorization (MF) alone are challenging to effectively learn user–POI interaction functions. Moreover, the user–POI interaction matrix is sparse, and the heterogeneous characteristics of auxiliary information are underused. Therefore, we propose an innovative POI recommendation method that integrates attention-aware meta-paths based on deep neural matrix factorization (DNMF-AM). First, we develop a multi-relational heterogeneous information network of “user–POI–geographic region–POI category.” Multiple-weighted isomorphic information networks based on meta-paths are employed to obtain node-embedding vectors across different relationships. Attention networks are employed to aggregate node vectors across various relationships and serve as auxiliary information to mitigate the challenges of data sparsity. Subsequently, the internal embedding vectors of the users and POIs are extracted using feature embedding based on the user–POI interaction matrix. Second, these vectors are integrated with the embedding vectors obtained by aggregating the attention networks. Third, deep neural matrix factorization is used to learn linear and nonlinear user–POI interactions to mitigate the implicit feedback problem. This outcome is achieved using generalized matrix factorization and convolution-constrained multi-head self-attention mechanism deep neural networks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNMF-AM outperforms the optimal baseline NeuMF-CAA by 4.24% and 5.04% in terms of HR@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing micro-expressions (MEs) as subtle and transient forms of human emotional expressions is critical for accurately judging human feelings. However, recognizing MEs is challenging due to their transient and low-intensity characteristics. This study develops a lightweight shallow dual-group symmetric attention network (SDGSA) to address the limitations of existing methods in capturing the subtle features of MEs. This network takes the optical flow features as inputs, extracting ME features through a shallow network and performing finer feature segmentation in the channel dimension through a dual-group strategy. The goal is to focus on different types of facial information without disrupting facial symmetry. Moreover, this study implements a spatial symmetry attention module, focusing on extracting facial symmetry features to emphasize further the symmetric information of the left and right sides of the face. Additionally, we introduce the channel blending technique to optimize the information fusion between different channel features. Extensive experiments on SMIC, CASME II, SAMM, and 3DB-combined mainstream ME datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDGSA method outperforms the metrics of current state-of-the-art methods. As shown by ablation experimental results, the proposed dual-group symmetric attention module outperforms classical attention modules, such as the convolutional block attention module, squeeze-and-excitation, efficient channel attention, spatial group-wise enhancement, and multi-head self-attention. Importantly, SDGSA maintained excellent performance while having only 0.278 million parameters. The code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/YZY980123/SDGSA .},

This involved a comprehensive assessment that encompassed the judicious selection of sites for both stations and blood centers, coupled with the meticulous planning of delivery routes for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that orchestrate the transportation of blood. First, a model was formulated to minimize the overall cost, including transportation expenses, costs associated with the site, and other relevant costs related to blood transportation vehicles coordinated by UAVs. Subsequently, a two-stage hybrid heuristic algorithm was designed based on the distinctive characteristics of the problem at hand. Moreover, an enhanced k-means algorithm was employed to generate clustering schemes, utilizing the centroid method to address the challenge of location selection for delivery sites effectively. A genetic algorithm enhanced with adaptive operators was employed to address the challenging large-scale NP-hard problem associated with route planning in intricate urban road networks. The results indicated that, compared to the traditional blood delivery model using vehicles, the total blood transportation cost decreased by 12.65% and the overall delivery time was reduced by 37.5% with the adoption of drone-assisted delivery; ultimately, case and sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of variables including the number of blood transportation vehicles, UAVs, driver wages, and unit costs of blood transportation vehicles on the location-routing problem.},

  abstract     = {The safe and reliable operation of the pitch system is essential for the stable and efficient operation of a wind turbine (WT). The pitch fault data collected by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) often contain a wide variety of variables, leading to redundant features that interfere with the accuracy of final diagnosis results, making it difficult to meet requirements. Also, the problem of extracting only local features while ignoring global information is present in the feature extraction process using the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To address these issues, the global average correlation coefficient is proposed in this article to measure the correlation between multiple variables in SCADA data. By considering the correlation among multiple variables comprehensively, redundant features are effectively eliminated, enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a new local amplification fusion architecture network (LAFA-Net) based on multi-head attention (MHA) is introduced. An efficient local feature extraction module, designed to enhance the model’s perception of detailed features while maintaining global context information, is first introduced. LAFA-Net integrates the advantages of CNN and MHA, efficiently extracting and fusing valuable features from filtered data for both local and global aspects. Experiments on real pitch fault data demonstrate that the global average correlation coefficient effectively screens out redundant features in the dataset that negatively impact fault diagnosis results, thereby improving diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. The LAFA-Net model, capable of accurately diagnosing multiple types of pitch faults, shows a superior classification effect and accuracy compared to several advanced models, along with a faster convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Prohibited item detection is crucial for the safety of public places. Deep learning, one of the mainstream methods in prohibited item detection tasks, has shown superior performance far beyond traditional prohibited item detection methods. However, most neural network architectures in deep learning still lack sufficient local feature representation ability for overlapping and small targets, and ignore the problem of semantic conflicts caused by direct feature fusion. In this paper, we propose MFPIDet, a novel prohibited item detection neural network architecture based on improved YOLOV7 to achieve reliable prohibited item detection in complex environments. Specifically, a multi-scale attention module (MAM) backbone is proposed to filter the redundant information of target regions and further applied to enhance the local feature representation ability of overlapping objects. Here, to reduce the redundant information of target regions, a squeeze-excitation (SE) block is used to filter the background. Then, aiming at enhancing the feature expression ability of overlapping objects, a multi-scale feature extraction module (MFEM) is designed for local feature representation. In addition, to obtain richer context information, We design an adaptive fusion feature pyramid network (AF-FPN) to combine the adaptive context information fusion module (ACIFM) with the feature fusion module (FFM) to improve the neck structure of YOLOV7. The proposed method is validated on the PIDray dataset, and the tested results showed that our method obtained the highest mAP (68.7%), which is improved by 3.5% than YOLOV7 methods. Our approach provides a new design pattern for prohibited item detection in complex environments and shows the development potential of deep learning in related fields.},

  abstract     = {Vision-inertial navigation offers a promising solution for aircraft to estimate ego-motion accurately in environments devoid of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, existing approaches have limited adaptability for fixed-wing aircraft with high maneuverability and insufficient visual features, problems of low accuracy and subpar real-time arise. This paper introduces a novel vision-inertial heterogeneous data fusion methodology, aiming to enhance the navigation accuracy and computational efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft landing navigation. The visual front-end of the system extracts multi-scale infrared runway features and computes geo-reference runway image as observation. The infrared runway features are recognized efficiently and robustly by a lightweight end-to-end neural network from blurry infrared images, and the geo-reference runway is generated through projection of the runway’s prior geographical information and prior pose. The fusion back-end of the navigation system is the Covariance Feedback Control based Cubature Kalman Filter (CFC-CKF) framework, which tightly integrates visual observations and inertial measurements for zero-drift pose estimation and curbs the effect of inaccurate kinematic noise statistics. Finally, real flight experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can estimate the pose at a frequency of 100 Hz and fulfill the navigation accuracy requirements for high-speed landing of fixed-wing aircraft.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of big data, extracting meaningful knowledge from data is crucial for machine learning. The existing Swarm Learning data collaboration models face challenges such as data security, model security, high communication overhead, and model performance optimization. To address this, we propose the Swarm Mutual Learning (SML). Firstly, we introduce an Adaptive Mutual Distillation Algorithm that dynamically controls the learning intensity based on distillation weights and strength, enhancing the efficiency of knowledge extraction and transfer during mutual distillation. Secondly, we design a Global Parameter Aggregation Algorithm based on homomorphic encryption, coupled with a Dynamic Gradient Decomposition Algorithm using singular value decomposition. This allows the model to aggregate parameters in ciphertext, significantly reducing communication overhead during uploads and downloads. Finally, we validate the proposed methods on real datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness and efficiency in model updates. On the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset, the local model accuracies reached 95.02% and 55.26%, respectively, surpassing those of the comparative models. Furthermore, while ensuring the security of the aggregation process, we significantly reduced the communication overhead for uploading and downloading.},

  abstract     = {A multi-exit network is an important technique for achieving adaptive inference by dynamically allocating computational resources based on different input samples. The existing works mainly treat the final classifier as the teacher, enhancing the classification accuracy by transferring knowledge to the intermediate classifiers. However, this traditional self-distillation training strategy only utilizes the knowledge contained in the final classifier, neglecting potentially distinctive knowledge in the other classifiers. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-level collaborative self-distillation learning strategy (MLCSD) that extracts knowledge from all the classifiers. MLCSD dynamically determines the weight coefficients for each classifier’s contribution through a learning process, thus constructing more comprehensive and effective teachers tailored to each classifier. These new teachers transfer the knowledge back to each classifier through a distillation technique, thereby further improving the network’s inference efficiency. We conduct experiments on three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Compared with the baseline network that employs traditional self-distillation, our MLCSD-Net based on ResNet18 enhances the average classification accuracy by 1.18%. The experimental results demonstrate that MLCSD-Net improves the inference efficiency of adaptive inference applications, such as anytime prediction and budgeted batch classification.

However, in the field of medical image segmentation, acquiring precise labels is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Hence, the challenge of achieving a high-performance model via datasets containing noisy labels has attracted significant research interest. Some existing methods are unable to exclude samples containing noisy labels and some methods still have high requirements on datasets. To solve this problem, we propose a noisy label learning method for medical image segmentation using a mixture of high and low quality labels based on the architecture of mean teacher. Firstly, considering the teacher model’s capacity to aggregate all previously learned information following each training step, we propose to leverage a teacher model to correct noisy label adaptively during the training phase. Secondly, to enhance the model’s robustness, we propose to infuse feature perturbations into the student model. This strategy aims to bolster the model’s ability to handle variations in input data and improve its resilience to noisy labels. Finally, we simulate noisy labels by destroying labels in two medical image datasets: the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset and the 3D Left Atrium (LA) dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method demonstrates considerable effectiveness. With a noisy ratio of 0.8, compared with other methods, the mean Dice score of our proposed method is improved by 2.58% and 0.31% on ACDC and LA datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to address the issue of TDOA/FDOA measurement accuracy in complex underwater environments, which is affected by multipath effects and variations in water sound velocity induced by the challenging nature of the underwater environment. To this end, a novel cooperative localisation algorithm has been developed, integrating the attention mechanism and convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) with TDOA/FDOA and two-step weighted least squares (ImTSWLS). This algorithm is designed to enhance the accuracy of TDOA/FDOA measurements in complex underwater environments. The algorithm initially makes use of the considerable capacity of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract profound spatial and frequency domain characteristics from multimodal data. These features are of paramount importance for the characterisation of underwater signal propagation, particularly in complex environments. Subsequently, through the use of a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), the algorithm is able to effectively capture long-term dependencies in time series data. This enables a more comprehensive analysis and understanding of the changing pattern of signals over time. Furthermore, the incorporation of an attention mechanism within the algorithm enables the model to focus more on the signal features that have a significant impact on localisation, while simultaneously suppressing the interference of extraneous information. This further enhances the efficiency of identifying and utilising the key signal features. ImTSWLS is employed to resolve the position and velocity data following the acquisition of the predicted TDOA/FDOA, thereby enabling the accurate estimation of the position and velocity of the mobile radiation source. The algorithm was subjected to a series of tests in a variety of simulated underwater environments, including different sea states, target motion speeds and base station configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits a deviation of only 2.88 m/s in velocity estimation and 2.58 m in position estimation when the noise level is 20 dB. The algorithm presented in this paper demonstrates superior performance in both position and velocity estimation compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Spatial–temporal data is widely available in intelligent transportation systems, and accurately solving non-stationary of spatial–temporal regression is critical. In most traffic flow prediction research, the non-stationary solution of deep spatial–temporal regression tasks is typically formulated as a spatial–temporal graph modeling problem. However, there are several issues: (1) the coupled spatial–temporal regression approach renders it unfeasible to accurately learn the dependencies of diverse modalities; (2) the intricate stacking design of deep spatial–temporal network modules limits the interpretation and migration capability; (3) the ability to model dynamic spatial–temporal relationships is inadequate. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we propose a novel unified spatial–temporal regression framework named Generalized Spatial–Temporal Regression Graph Convolutional Transformer (GSTRGCT) that extends panel model in spatial econometrics and combines it with deep neural networks to effectively model non-stationary relationships of spatial–temporal regression. Considering the coupling of existing deep spatial–temporal networks, we introduce the tensor decomposition to explicitly decompose the panel model into a tensor product of spatial regression on the spatial hyper-plane and temporal regression on the temporal hyper-plane. On the spatial hyper-plane, we present dynamic adaptive spatial weight network (DASWNN) to capture the global and local spatial correlations. Specifically, DASWNN adopts spatial weight neural network (SWNN) to learn the semantic global spatial correlation and dynamically adjusts the local changing spatial correlation by multiplying between spatial nodes embedding. On the temporal hyper-plane, we introduce the Auto-Correlation attention mechanism to capture the period-based temporal dependence. Extensive experiments on the two real-world traffic datasets show that GSTRGCT consistently outperforms other competitive methods with an average of 62% and 59% on predictive performance.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation aims to integrate data from multiple domains and introduce information from source domains, thereby achieving good recommendations on the target domain. Recently, contrastive learning has been introduced into the cross-domain recommendations and has obtained some better results. However, most cross-domain recommendation algorithms based on contrastive learning suffer from the bias problem. In addition, the correlation between the user’s single-domain and cross-domain preferences is not considered. To address these problems, a new recommendation model is proposed for cross-domain scenarios based on intra-domain and inter-domain contrastive learning, which aims to obtain unbiased user preferences in cross-domain scenarios and improve the recommendation performance of both domains. Firstly, a network enhancement module is proposed to capture users’ complete preference by applying a graphical convolution and attentional aggregator. This module can reduce the limitations of only considering user preferences in a single domain. Then, a cross-domain infomax objective with noise contrast is presented to ensure that users’ single-domain and cross-domain preferences are correlated closely in sequential interactions. Finally, a joint training strategy is designed to improve the recommendation performances of two domains, which can achieve unbiased cross-domain recommendation results. At last, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world cross-domain scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed model in this paper achieves the best recommendation results in comparison with existing models.},

  abstract     = {Pre-trained models based on the Transformer architecture have significantly advanced research within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their superior performance and extensive applicability across multiple technological sectors. Despite these advantages, there is a significant challenge in optimizing these models for more efficient deployment. To be concrete, the existing post-training pruning frameworks of transformer models suffer from inefficiencies in the crucial stage of pruning accuracy recovery, which impacts the overall pruning efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and efficient iteration scheme with conjugate gradient in the pruning recovery stage. By constructing a series of conjugate iterative directions, this approach ensures each optimization step is orthogonal to the previous ones, which effectively reduces redundant explorations of the search space. Consequently, each iteration progresses effectively towards the global optimum, thereby significantly enhancing search efficiency. The conjugate gradient-based faster-pruner reduces the time expenditure of the pruning process while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating a high degree of solution stability and exceptional model acceleration effects. In pruning experiments conducted on the BERTBASE and DistilBERT models, the faster-pruner exhibited outstanding performance on the GLUE benchmark dataset, achieving a reduction of up to 36.27% in pruning time and a speed increase of up to 1.45× on an RTX 3090 GPU.},

Controlling the motion speed of injection molding machines is a crucial factor that influences production processes, directly affecting product quality and efficiency. This paper aims to tackle the challenge of achieving optimal tracking control of injection speed in a standard class of injection molding machines (IMMs) characterized by nonlinear dynamics. To achieve this goal, we propose a learning-based model predictive control (LMPC) scheme that incorporates Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict and model uncertainty in the injection molding process (IMP). Specifically, the scheme formulates a nonlinear tracking control problem for injection speed, utilizing a GPR-based learning residual model to capture uncertainty and provide accurate predictions. It learns the dynamics model and historical data of the IMM, automatically adjusting the injection speed according to target requirements for optimal production control. Additionally, the optimization problem is efficiently solved using a control-constrained differential dynamic programming approach. Finally, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LMPC scheme for controlling injection speed in IMP.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of urban street scenes has attracted much attention in the field of autonomous driving, which not only helps vehicles perceive the environment in real time, but also significantly improves the decision-making ability of autonomous driving systems. However, most of the current methods based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) mainly use coding the input image to a low resolution and then try to recover the high resolution, which leads to problems such as loss of spatial information, accumulation of errors, and difficulty in dealing with large-scale changes. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new semantic segmentation network (HRDLNet) for urban street scene images with high-resolution representation, which improves the accuracy of segmentation by always maintaining a high-resolution representation of the image. Specifically, we propose a feature extraction module (FHR) with high-resolution representation, which efficiently handles multi-scale targets and high-resolution image information by efficiently fusing high-resolution information and multi-scale features. Secondly, we design a multi-scale feature extraction enhancement (MFE) module, which significantly expands the sensory field of the network, thus enhancing the ability to capture correlations between image details and global contextual information. In addition, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism module (CSD), which dynamically adjusts the network to more accurately capture subtle features and rich semantic information in images. We trained and evaluated HRDLNet on the Cityscapes Dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2012 Augmented Dataset, and verified the model’s excellent performance in the field of urban streetscape image segmentation. The unique advantages of our proposed HRDLNet in the field of semantic segmentation of urban streetscapes are also verified by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Loop closure detection is a key technology for robotic navigation. Existing research primarily focuses on feature extraction from global scenes but often neglects local overhead occlusion scenes. In these local scenes, objects such as vehicles, trees, and buildings vary in height, creating a complex multi-layered structure with vertical occlusions. Current methods predominantly employ a single-level extraction strategy to construct descriptors, which fails to capture the characteristics of occluded objects. This limitation results in descriptors with restricted descriptive capabilities. This paper introduces a descriptor named Hierarchy Scan Context (HSC) to address this shortfall. HSC effectively extracts height feature information of objects at different levels in overhead occlusion scenes through hierarchical division, demonstrating enhanced descriptive capabilities. Additionally, a time series enhancement strategy is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic missed detections. In the experiments, the proposed method is validated using a self-collected dataset and the public KITTI and NCLT datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to competitive methods. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves an average maximum F1 score of 0.92 in experiments conducted on nine selected road segments with overhead occlusion.},

At present, most scholars focus on designing complex models to improve the accuracy of Re-ID, but the high complexity of the model further restricts the practical application of Re-ID algorithm. To solve the above problems, this paper designs a lightweight Self-selective Receptive Field (SRF) block instead of directly designing complex models. Specifically, the module can be plug-and-play on the general backbone network, so as to significantly improve the performance of Re-ID while effectively controlling the amount of its own parameter and calculation: (1) the SRF block encodes pedestrian targets and image contexts at different scales by constructing pyramidal convolution group and allows the module to independently select the size of the receptive field through training by means of self-adaptive weighting; (2) in order to reduce the complexity of SRF block, we introduce a &quot;channel scaling factor&quot; and design a &quot;grouped convolution operation&quot; by constraining the channels of the feature map and changing the structure of the convolution kernel respectively. Experiments on multiple datasets show that SRF Network (SRFNet) for Re-ID can achieve a good balance between performance and complexity, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness of SRF block.},

To refine the image in the latent space, we propose a latent time-travel strategy that increases the sampling timestep. Empirically, we compare Latent-SDE to the baseline of the score-based diffusion model on three widely adopted unpaired I2I tasks under two metrics. Latent-SDE achieves state-of-the-art on Cat $$\rightarrow $$ Dog and is competitive on the other two tasks.

  abstract     = {Target search using a swarm of robots is a classic research topic that poses challenges, particularly in conducting multi-target searching in unknown environments. Key challenges include high communication cost among robots, unknown positions of obstacles, and the presence of multiple targets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Robotic Flow Direction Algorithm (RFDA), building upon the modified Flow Direction Algorithm (FDA) to suit the characteristics of the robot’s motion. RFDA efficiently reduces the communication cost and navigates around unknown obstacles. The algorithm also accounts for scenarios involving isolated robots. The pipeline of the proposed RFDA method is outlined as follows: (1). Learning strategy: a neighborhood information based learning strategy is adopted to enhance the FDA’s position update formula. This allows swarm robots to systematically locate the target (the lowest height) in a stepwise manner. (2). Adaptive inertia weighting: An adaptive inertia weighting mechanism is employed to maintain diversity among robots during the search and avoid premature convergence. (3). Sink-filling process: The algorithm simulates the sink-filling process and moving to the aspect slope to escape from local optima. (4). Isolated robot scenario: The case of an isolated robot (a robot without neighbors) is considered. Global optimal information is only required when the robot is isolated or undergoing the sink-filling process, thereby reducing communication costs. We not only demonstrate the probabilistic completeness of RFDA but also validate its effectiveness by comparing it with six other competing algorithms in a simulated environment. Experiments cover various aspects such as target number, population size, and environment size. Our findings indicate that RFDA outperforms other methods in terms of the number of required iterations and the full success rate. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests further demonstrate the superiority of RFDA.},

To adaptively determine the execution order of these two stages in the early process, MSEFAS treats the optimization stage with higher validity of selected solutions as the first stage and the other as the second one. In addition, at the late phase of evolutionary search, MSEFAS introduces a third stage to efficiently handle the various characteristics of CMOPs by considering the relationship between the constrained Pareto fronts (CPF) and unconstrained Pareto fronts. We compare the proposed framework with eleven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on 56 benchmark CMOPs.

  abstract     = {In the wave of research on autonomous driving, 3D object detection from the Bird’s Eye View (BEV) perspective has emerged as a pivotal area of focus. The essence of this challenge is the effective fusion of camera and LiDAR data into the BEV. Current approaches predominantly train and predict within the front view and Cartesian coordinate system, often overlooking the inherent structural and operational differences between cameras and LiDAR sensors. This paper introduces CL-FusionBEV, an innovative 3D object detection methodology tailored for sensor data fusion in the BEV perspective. Our approach initiates with a view transformation, facilitated by an implicit learning module that transitions the camera’s perspective to the BEV space, thereby aligning the prediction module. Subsequently, to achieve modal fusion within the BEV framework, we employ voxelization to convert the LiDAR point cloud into BEV space, thereby generating LiDAR BEV spatial features. Moreover, to integrate the BEV spatial features from both camera and LiDAR, we have developed a multi-modal cross-attention mechanism and an implicit multi-modal fusion network, designed to enhance the synergy and application of dual-modal data. To counteract potential deficiencies in global reasoning and feature interaction arising from multi-modal cross-attention, we propose a BEV self-attention mechanism that facilitates comprehensive global feature operations. Our methodology has undergone rigorous evaluation on a substantial dataset within the autonomous driving domain, the nuScenes dataset. The outcomes demonstrate that our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 73.3% and a nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) of 75.5%, particularly excelling in the detection of cars and pedestrians with high accuracies of 89% and 90.7%, respectively. Additionally, CL-FusionBEV exhibits superior performance in identifying occluded and distant objects, surpassing existing comparative methods.},

These challenges restrict the capacity of the model to fully utilize the diverse semantic information of each sample, posing significant barriers to effective learning. Despite substantial scholarly efforts, many existing methods inadequately capture the depth of semantic information, focusing primarily on shallow feature extractions that fail to maintain semantic consistency. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel Deep semantic structure-preserving (SSP) model that effectively tackles both incomplete views and missing labels. SSP innovatively incorporates a graph constraint learning (GCL) scheme to ensure the preservation of semantic structure throughout the feature extraction process across different views. Additionally, the SSP integrates a pseudo-labeling self-paced learning (PSL) strategy to address the often-overlooked issue of missing labels, enhancing the classification accuracy while preserving the distribution structure of data. The SSP model creates a unified framework that synergistically employs GCL and PSL to maintain the integrity of semantic structural information during both feature extraction and classification phases. Extensive evaluations across five real datasets demonstrate that the SSP method outperforms existing approaches, including lrMMC, MVL-IV, MvEL, iMSF, iMvWL, NAIML, and DD-IMvMLC-net. It effectively mitigates the impacts of data incompleteness and enhances semantic representation fidelity.},

Because it is difficult to solve the Nash equilibrium of the Bayesian game by the traditional method, a parallel particle swarm optimization is proposed to solve the Nash equilibrium of the Bayesian game and analyze the optimal action of the defender. The simulation results show the superiority of the parallel particle swarm optimization compared with other heuristic algorithms. This algorithm is proved to be effective in finding optimal defense strategy. The influence of the detection rate and false alarm rate of nodes on the profit of defender is analyzed by simulation experiments. Simulation experiments show that the profit of defender decreases as false alarm rate increases and decreases as detection rate decreases. Using heuristic algorithm to solve Nash equilibrium of Bayesian game provides a new method for the research of attack-defense confrontation. Predicting the actions of attacker and defender through the game model can provide ideas for the defender to take active defense.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, recommendation explanation methods have received widespread attention due to their potentials to enhance user experience and streamline transactions. In scenarios where auxiliary information such as text and attributes are lacking, counterfactual explanation has emerged as a crucial technique for explaining recommendations. However, existing counterfactual explanation methods encounter two primary challenges. First, a substantial bias indeed exists in the calculation of the group impact function, leading to the inaccurate predictions as the counterfactual explanation group expands. In addition, the importance of collaborative filtering as a counterfactual explanation is overlooked, which results in lengthy, narrow, and inaccurate explanations. To address such issues, we propose a counterfactual explanation method based on Modified Group Influence Function for recommendation. In particular, via a rigorous formula derivation, we demonstrate that a simple summation of individual influence functions cannot reflect the group impact in recommendations. After that, building upon the improved influence function, we construct the counterfactual groups by iteratively incorporating the individuals from the training samples, which possess the greatest influence on the recommended results, and continuously adjusting the parameters to ensure accuracy. Finally, we expand the scope of searching for counterfactual groups by incorporating the collaborative filtering information from different users. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we employ it to explain the recommendations generated by two common recommendation models, i.e., Matrix Factorization and Neural Collaborative Filtering, on two publicly available datasets. The evaluation of the proposed counterfactual explanation method showcases its superior performance in providing counterfactual explanations. In the most significant case, our proposed method achieves a 17% lead in terms of Counterfactual precision compared to the best baseline explanation method.},

  abstract     = {The majority of existing face inpainting methods primarily focus on generating a single result that visually resembles the original image. The generation of diverse and plausible results has emerged as a new branch in image restoration, often referred to as “Pluralistic Image Completion”. However, most diversity methods simply use random latent vectors to generate multiple results, leading to uncontrollable outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel architecture known as the Reference-Guided Directional Diverse Face Inpainting Network. In this paper, instead of using a background image as reference, which is typically used in image restoration, we have used a face image, which can have many different characteristics from the original image, including but not limited to gender and age, to serve as a reference face style. Our network firstly infers the semantic information of the masked face, i.e., the face parsing map, based on the partial image and its mask, which subsequently guides and constrains directional diverse generator network. The network will learn the distribution of face images from different domains in a low-dimensional manifold space. To validate our method, we conducted extensive experiments on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset. Our method not only produces high-quality oriented diverse results but also complements the images with the style of the reference face image. Additionally, our diverse results maintain correct facial feature distribution and sizes, rather than being random. Our network has achieved SOTA results in face diverse inpainting when writing.

The continuous availability of gene expression datasets over the preceding years has made them one of the most accessible sources of genome-wide data, advancing cancer bioinformatics research and advanced prediction of cancer genomic data. To contribute to this topic, the proposed work is based on DL prediction in both convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for five classes in brain cancer using gene expression data obtained from Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa). This database is used for cancer classification and is publicly accessible on the official CuMiDa website. This paper implemented DL approaches using a One Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) followed by an RNN classifier with and without Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (BO). The accuracy of this hybrid model combination of (BO + 1D-CNN + RNN) produced the highest classification accuracy of 100% instead of the 95% for the ML model in prior work and 90% for the (1D-CNN + RNN) algorithm considered in the paper. Therefore, the classification of brain cancer gene expression according to the hybrid model (BO + 1D-CNN + RNN) provides more accurate and useful assessments for patients with different types of brain cancers. Thus, gene expression data are used to create a DL classification-based- hybrid model that will hold senior promise in the treatment of brain cancer.},

  abstract     = {High-quality printed circuit boards (PCBs) are essential components in modern electronic circuits. Nevertheless, most of the existing methods for PCB surface defect detection neglect the fact that PCB surface defects in complex backgrounds are prone to long-tailed data distributions, which in turn affects the effectiveness of defect detection. Additionally, most of the existing methods ignore the intra-scale features of defects and do not utilize auxiliary supervision strategies to improve the detection performance of the network. To tackle these issues, we propose a lightweight long-tailed data mining network (LLM-Net) for identifying PCB surface defects. Firstly, the proposed Efficient Feature Fusion Network (EFFNet) is applied to embed intra-scale feature associations and multi-scale features of defects into LLM-Net. Next, an auxiliary supervision method with a soft label assignment strategy is designed to help LLM-Net learn more accurate defect features. Finally, the issue of inadequate tail data detection is addressed by employing the devised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss Rank Mining method (BCE-LRM) to identify challenging samples. The performance of LLM-Net was evaluated on a homemade dataset of PCB surface soldering defects, and the results show that LLM-Net achieves the best accuracy of mAP@0.5 for the evaluation metric of the COCO dataset, and it has a real-time inference speed of 188 frames per second (FPS).},

Therefore, we propose a method named n-Hierarchy SEmantic Guided Attention (nHi-SEGA) that acquires abstract superclasses. This allows the model to associate with and pay attention to different levels of objects utilizing semantics and visual features embedded in the class hierarchy (e.g., house finch-bird-animal, goldfish-fish-animal, rose-flower-plant), resembling human cognition.

  abstract     = {Prompt-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for improving the performance of classification tasks by converting them into masked language modeling problems through the insertion of text templates. Despite its considerable success, applying this approach to relation extraction is challenging. Predicting the relation, often expressed as a specific word or phrase between two entities, usually requires creating mappings from these terms to an existing lexicon and introducing extra learnable parameters. This can lead to a decrease in coherence between the pre-training task and fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for prompt-tuning in relation extraction, aiming to enhance the coherence between fine-tuning and pre-training tasks. Specifically, we avoid the need for a suitable relation word by converting the relation into relational semantic keywords, which are representative phrases that encapsulate the essence of the relation. Moreover, we employ a composite loss function that optimizes the model at both token and relation levels. Our approach incorporates the masked language modeling (MLM) loss and the entity pair constraint loss for predicted tokens. For relation level optimization, we use both the cross-entropy loss and TransE. Extensive experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance in relation extraction tasks. The results show an average improvement of approximately 1.6 points in F1 metrics compared to the current state-of-the-art model. Codes are released at https://github.com/12138yx/TCohPrompt .},

Current deep learning-based OCSR methods typically use image feature extractors to extract visual features and employ encoder-decoder architectures for chemical structure recognition. However, the performance of these methods is limited by their image feature extractors and the class imbalance of elements in chemical structure representation. This paper proposes MPOCSR (multi-path optical chemical structure recognition), which introduces the multi-path Vision Transformer (MPViT) and the class-balanced (CB) loss function to address these two challenges. MPOCSR uses MPViT as an image feature extractor, combining the advantages of convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers. This strategy enables the provision of richer visual information for subsequent decoding processes. Furthermore, MPOCSR incorporates CB loss function to rebalance the loss weights among different categories. For training and validation of our method, we constructed a dataset that includes both Markush and non-Markush structures. Experimental results show that MPOCSR achieves an accuracy of 90.95% on the test set, surpassing other existing methods.},

Furthermore, a significant majority of the current methodologies exhibit sensitivity to noise. This paper introduces techniques that address the aforementioned issues from the perspective of fuzzy evidence theory. First of all, a new distance incorporating decision attributes is defined, and then a relation between fuzzy evidence theory and fuzzy $$\beta $$ covering with an anti-noise mechanism is established. In this framework, two robust feature selection algorithms for hybrid data are proposed based on fuzzy belief and fuzzy plausibility. Experiments on 10 data sets of various types show that compared with the other 6 state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms improve the anti-noise ability by at least 6% with higher average classification accuracy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithms have excellent anti-noise ability while maintaining good feature selection ability.},

  abstract     = {In air combat missions, unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) must take strategic actions to establish combat advantages, enabling effective tracking and attacking of enemy UCAVs. Currently, a lot of reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to the air combat mission of unmanned fighter aircraft. However, most algorithms can only select policies based on the current state of both sides. This leads to the inability to effectively track and attack when the enemy performs large angle maneuvering. Additionally, these algorithms cannot adapt to different situations, resulting in the unmanned fighter aircraft being at a disadvantage in some cases. To solve these problems, this paper proposes predictive air combat decision model with segmented reward allocation for air combat tracking and attacking. On the basis of the air combat environment, we propose the prediction soft actor-critic (Pre-SAC) algorithm, which combines the prediction of enemy states with the states of UCAV for model training. This enables the UCAV to predict the next move of the enemy UCAV in advance and establish a greater air combat advantage for us. Furthermore, by adopting a segmented reward allocation model and combining it with the Pre-SAC algorithm, we propose the segmented reward allocation soft actor-critic (Sra-SAC) algorithm, which solves the problem of UCAVs being unable to adapt to different situations. The results show that the prediction-based segmented reward allocation the Sra-SAC algorithm outperforms the traditional soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm in terms of overall reward, travel distance, and relative advantage.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel motion planning algorithm Bi-HS-RRT $$^\text {X}$$ , which facilitates asymptotically optimal real-time planning in continuously changing unknown environments. The algorithm swiftly determines an initial feasible path by employing the bidirectional search. When dynamic obstacles render the planned path infeasible, the bidirectional search is reactivated promptly to reconstruct the search tree in a local area, thereby significantly reducing the search planning time. Additionally, this paper adopts a hybrid heuristic sampling strategy to optimize the planned path quality and search efficiency. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is accelerated by merging local biased sampling with nominal path and global heuristic sampling in hyper-ellipsoid region. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in unknown dynamic environments, numerous comparative experiments with existing algorithms were conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed planning algorithm has significant advantages in planned path length and planning time.},

Specifically, the dropping mechanism is introduced into contrastive learning to develop Attention-guided Mask (AM) module as well as mask learning strategy, respectively. The AM module leverages the spatial and temporal attention to guide the corresponding features masking, so as to produce the masked contrastive object. The mask learning strategy enables the model to discriminate different actions even with important features masked, which makes action representation learning more discriminative. What’s more, to alleviate the strict positive constraint that would hinder representation learning, the positive-enhanced learning strategy is leveraged in the second-stage training. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that the proposed AML scheme improves the performance in self-supervised 3D action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limitations of the model itself, the performance of switched autoregressive exogenous (SARX) models will face potential threats when modeling nonlinear hybrid dynamic systems. To address this problem, a robust identification approach of the switched gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model is developed in this paper. Firstly, all submodels of the SARX model are replaced by gated recurrent unit neural networks. The obtained SGRU model has stronger nonlinear fitting ability than the SARX model. Secondly, this paper departs from the conventional Gaussian distribution assumption for noise, opting instead for a generalized Gaussian distribution. This enables the proposed model to achieve stable prediction performance under the influence of different noises. Notably, no prior assumptions are imposed on the knowledge of operating modes in the proposed switched model. Therefore, the EM algorithm is used to solve the problem of parameter estimation with hidden variables in this paper. Finally, two simulation experiments are performed. By comparing the nonlinear fitting ability of the SGRU model with the SARX model and the prediction performance of the SGRU model under different noise distributions, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified.},

  abstract     = {Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based sensors endure complex production processes that inherently include high variance. To meet rigorous client demands (such as sensitivity, offset noise, robustness against vibration, etc.). products must go through comprehensive calibration and testing procedures. All sensors undergo a standardized and sequential calibration process with a predetermined number of steps, even though some may reach the correct calibration value sooner. Moreover, the traditional sequential calibration method faces challenges due to specific operating conditions resulting from manufacturing discrepancies. This not only extends the calibration duration but also introduces rigidity and inefficiency. To tackle the issue of production variances and elongated calibration time and enhance efficiency, we provide a novel quasi-parallelized calibration framework aided by an artificial intelligence (AI) based solution. Our suggested method utilizes a supervised tree-based regression technique and statistical measures to dynamically identify and optimize the appropriate working point for each sensor. The objective is to decrease the total calibration duration while ensuring accuracy. The findings of our investigation show a time reduction of 23.8% for calibration, leading to substantial cost savings in the manufacturing process. In addition, we propose an end-to-end monitoring system to accelerate the incorporation of our framework into production. This not only guarantees the prompt execution of our solution but also enables the identification of process modifications or data irregularities, promoting a more agile and adaptable production process.},

  abstract     = {Defect detection for photovoltaic (PV) cell images is a challenging task due to the small size of the defect features and the complexity of the background characteristics. Modern detectors rely mostly on proxy learning objectives for prediction and on manual post-processing components. One-to-one set matching is a critical design for DEtection TRansformer (DETR) in order to provide end-to-end capability, so that does not need a hand-crafted Efficient Non-Maximum Suppression NMS. In order to detect PV cell defects faster and better, a technology called the PV cell Defects DEtection Transformer (PD-DETR) is proposed. To address the issue of slow convergence caused by DETR’s direct translation of image feature mapping into target detection results, we created a hybrid feature module. To achieve a balance between performance and computation, the image features are passed through a scoring network and dilated convolution, respectively, to obtain the foreground fine feature and contour high-frequency feature. The two features are then adaptively intercepted and fused. The capacity of the model to detect small-scale defects under complex background conditions is improved by the addition of high-frequency information. Furthermore, too few positive queries will be assigned to the defect target via one-to-one set matching, which will result in sparse supervision of the encoder and impair the decoder’s ability of attention learning. Consequently, we enhanced the detection effect by combining the original DETR with the one-to-many matching branch. Specifically, two Faster RCNN detection heads were added during training. To maintain the end-to-end benefits of DETR, inference is still performed using the original one-to-one set matching. Our model implements 64.7% AP on the PVEL-AD dataset.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are regarded as one of the most lethal forms of cancer, primarily due to their heterogeneity and low survival rates. To tackle the challenge posed by brain tumor diagnostic models, which typically require extensive data for training and are often confined to a single dataset, we propose a diagnostic model based on the Prewitt operator and a graph isomorphic network. Firstly, during the graph construction stage, edge information is extracted from MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images using the Prewitt filtering algorithm. Pixel points with a gray value intensity greater than 128 are designated as graph nodes, while the remaining pixel points are treated as edges of the graph. Secondly, the graph data is inputted into the GIN model for training, with model parameters optimized to enhance performance. Compared with existing work using small sample sizes, the GraphMriNet model has achieved classification accuracies of 100%, 100%, 100%, and 99.68% on the BMIBTD, CE-MRI, BTC-MRI, and FSB open datasets, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy has improved by 0.8% to 5.3% compared to existing research. In a few-shot scenario, GraphMriNet can accurately diagnose various types of brain tumors, providing crucial clinical guidance to assist doctors in making correct medical decisions.

  abstract     = {Event cameras produce asynchronous discrete outputs due to the independent response of camera pixels to changes in brightness. The asynchronous and discrete nature of event data facilitate the tracking of prolonged feature trajectories. Nonetheless, this necessitates the adaptation of feature tracking techniques to efficiently process this type of data. In addressing this challenge, we proposed a hybrid data-driven feature tracking method that utilizes data from both event cameras and frame-based cameras to track features asynchronously. It mainly includes patch initialization, patch optimization, and patch association modules. In the patch initialization module, FAST corners are detected in frame images, providing points responsive to local brightness changes. The patch association module introduces a nearest-neighbor (NN) algorithm to filter new feature points effectively. The patch optimization module assesses optimization quality for tracking quality monitoring. We evaluate the tracking accuracy and robustness of our method using public and self-collected datasets, focusing on average tracking error and feature age. In contrast to the event-based Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi tracker method, our method decreases the average tracking error ranging from 1.3 to 29.2% and boosts the feature age ranging from 9.6 to 32.1%, while ensuring the computational efficiency improvement of 1.2–7.6%. Thus, our proposed feature tracking method utilizes the unique characteristics of event cameras and traditional cameras to deliver a robust and efficient tracking system.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is to find a set of evenly distributed nondominated solutions that approximate the Pareto front (PF) of a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) or a many-objective optimization problem (MaOP). This implies that the approximated solution set obtained by MOEAs should be as close to PF as possible while remaining diverse, adhering to criteria of convergence and diversity. However, existing MOEAs exhibit an imbalance between achieving convergence and maintaining diversity in the objective space. As far as the diversity criterion is concerned, it is still a challenge to achieve an evenly distributed approximation set with different sizes for a problem with a complicated PF shape. Furthermore, Pareto dominance has its own weaknesses as the selection criterion in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. Algorithms based on Pareto criterion (PC) can suffer from problems such as slow convergence to the optimal front and inferior performance on problems with many objectives. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective bean optimization algorithm (MOBOA). Given that the selection of parent species, representing global optimal solutions, directly influences the convergence and diversity of the algorithm, MOBOA incorporates a preference order equilibrium parent species selection strategy (POEPSS). By extending the Pareto criterion with the preference order optimization criterion, the algorithm effectively enhances parent species selection pressure across multiple objectives. To balance convergence and diversity, MOBOA proposes a multi-population global search strategy explicitly maintaining an external archive during the search process. Leveraging the inherent multi-population advantages of bean optimization algorithm (BOA), the algorithm facilitates information sharing among the main population, auxiliary populations, and historical archive solution sets. Additionally, a diversity enhancement strategy is employed in the environmental selection stage, introducing the environmental selection strategy of the SPEA2 algorithm to generate a set of evenly distributed nondominated solutions. Experimental results on a series of widely used MOPs and MaOPs demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits higher effectiveness and competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Distillation has shown promising results for classifying skin lesions in dermatology images. Traditional knowledge distillation typically involves the student model passively mimicking the teacher model&#39;s knowledge. We propose utilizing AdaBoost to enable the student to actively mine the teacher&#39;s learning representation for skin lesion classification. This paradigm allows the student to determine the “granularity” in mining the teacher&#39;s knowledge. As the student&#39;s learning process progresses, it can become challenging to pinpoint specific learning difficulties, especially with potential interference from the teacher. To address this issue, we introduce a variational difficulty mining strategy to reduce the impact of such interference. This strategy involves the distillation module capturing more nuanced classification difficulties by extracting information from the node&#39;s $$l$$ th hops. By maximizing the mutual information between the teacher and student, we effectively filter out noise interference from these nuanced difficulties. Our proposed framework, Variational AdaBoost Knowledge Distillation (VAdaKD), allows the student to actively mine and leverage the teacher&#39;s knowledge for improved skin lesion classification. Our proposed method performs satisfactorily on three benchmark datasets: the Dermnet dataset, ISIC 2019 dataset, and HAM10000 dataset, respectively. Specifically, our method shows an improvement of 2–3% over the baseline on the Dermnet dataset and outperforms the best results of the other compared methods by 1%. Experimental results and visualization performance indicate that our proposed method effectively captures the learning difficulties and achieves better visualized t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding classification results.

  abstract     = {Complete area-coverage path planners are essential for robots performing tasks like cleaning, inspection, and surveying. However, they often involve complex calculations, mapping, and determining movement directions, leading to high computational or processing overheads and the risk of deadlocks. This paper proposes an approach for cleaning, i.e., by linear wiping of generic and discontinuous surfaces in hospital settings using inhouse assembled mobile dual-arm (MDA) robotic system. The proposed framework introduces key features: (a) a less resource-intensive approach for MDA positioning and cleaning surface mapping, (b) Modified Glasius Bioinspired Neural Network through use of heuristics (GBNN+H) to optimize surface linear wiping while obstacle avoidance, and traversal across discontinuous surfaces. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are highlighted in simulation with GBNN+H significantly reduces the number of steps and flight time required for complete coverage compared to existing algorithms. The proposed framework is also experimentally demonstrated in a hospital setting, paving the way for improved automation in cleaning and disinfection tasks. Overall, this work presents a generic and versatile, applicable to various surface orientations and complexities.},

Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease presents many challenges, such as excessive reliance on subjective scale scores and a lack of objective indicators in the diagnostic process. Developing efficient and convenient methods to assist doctors in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease is necessary. In this paper, we study the skeleton sequences obtained from gait videos of Parkinsonian patients for early detection of the disease. We designed a Transformer network based on feature tensor fusion to capture the subtle manifestations of Parkinson’s disease. Initially, we fully utilized the distance information between joints, converting it into a multivariate time series classification task. We then built twin towers to discover dependencies within and across sequence channels. Finally, a tensor fusion layer was employed to integrate the features from both towers. In our experiments, our model demonstrated superior performance over the current state-of-the-art algorithm, achieving an 86.8% accuracy in distinguishing Parkinsonian patients from healthy individuals using the PD-Walk dataset.},

  abstract     = {Stream data mining aims to handle the continuous and ongoing generation of data flows (e.g. weather, stock and traffic data), which often encounters concept drift as time progresses. Traditional offline algorithms struggle with learning from real-time data, making online algorithms more fitting for mining the stream data with dynamic concepts. Among families of the online learning algorithms, single pass stands out for its efficiency in processing one sample point at a time, and inspecting it only once at most. Currently, there exist online algorithms tailored for single pass over the stream data by converting the problems of classification into minimum enclosing ball. However, these methods mainly focus on expanding the ball to enclose the new data. An excessively large ball might overwrite data of the new concept, creating difficulty in triggering the model updating process. This paper proposes a new online single pass framework for stream data mining, namely Scalable Concept Drift Adaptation (SCDA), and presents three distinct online methods (SCDA-I, SCDA-II and SCDA-III) based on that framework. These methods dynamically adjust the ball by expanding or contracting when new sample points arrive, thereby effectively avoiding the issue of excessively large balls. To evaluate their performance, we conduct the experiments on 7 synthetic and 5 real-world benchmark datasets and compete with the state-of-the-arts. The experiments demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of the SCDA methods in stream data mining by comparing three aspects: predictive performance, memory usage and scalability of the ball. Among them, the SCDA-III method performs best in all these aspects.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes DFFNet, a lightweight fusion network, for fast and accurate steel surface defect detection. Firstly, a lightweight backbone network called LDD is introduced, utilizing partial convolution to reduce computational complexity and extract spatial features efficiently. Then, PANet is enhanced using the Efficient Feature-Optimized Converged Network and a Feature Enhancement Aggregation Module (FEAM) to improve feature fusion. FEAM combines the Efficient Layer Aggregation Network and reparameterization techniques to extend the receptive field for defect perception, and reduce information loss for small defects. Finally, a WIOU loss function with a dynamic non-monotonic mechanism is designed to improve defect localization in complex scenes. Evaluation results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate that the proposed DFFNet achieves competitive accuracy with lower computational complexity, with a detection speed of 101 FPS, meeting real-time performance requirements in industrial settings. Furthermore, experimental results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability of DFFNet for object detection in diverse scenarios.},

Specifically, FCA captures the dependencies between spatial pixel features and categories to achieve the aggregation of features of the same category. CRA further captures the channel relationships on the output of FCA to obtain richer contexts. Numerous experiments have shown that NANet has a lower number of parameters and computational complexity than other state-of-the-art methods, and is a lightweight model with a lower total number of floating-point operations. We evaluated the performance of NANet on three datasets: Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K, and the experimental results show that NANet obtains promising results, reaching a performance of 82.6% on the Cityscapes test set.},

Gradient-based white-box attack algorithms have been widely used to generate adversarial examples. However, most of them are designed for multi-class models, and only a few gradient-based adversarial attack algorithms specifically designed for multi-label classification models. Due to the correlation between multiple labels, the performance of these gradient-based algorithms in generating adversarial examples for multi-label classification is worthy of analyzing and evaluating comprehensively. In this paper, we first transplant five typical gradient-based adversarial attack algorithms in the multi-class environment to the multi-label environment. Secondly, we comprehensively compared the performance of these five attack algorithms and the other four existing multi-label adversarial attack algorithms by experiments on six different attack types, and evaluated the transferability of adversarial examples generated by all algorithms under two attack types. Experimental results show that, among different attack types, the majority of multi-step attack algorithms have higher attack success rates compared to one-step attack algorithms. Additionally, these gradient-based algorithms face greater difficulty in augmenting labels than in hiding them. For transfer experimental results, the adversarial examples generated by all attack algorithms exhibit weaker transferability when attacking other different models.},

  abstract     = {In the field of autonomous driving, trajectory prediction of traffic agents is an important and challenging problem. Fully capturing the complex spatio-temporal features in trajectory data is crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. This paper proposes a trajectory prediction model called multi-dimensional spatio-temporal feature fusion (MDSTF), which integrates multi-dimensional spatio-temporal features to model the trajectory information of traffic agents. In the spatial dimension, we employ graph convolutional networks (GCN) to capture the local spatial features of traffic agents, spatial attention mechanism to capture the global spatial features, and LSTM combined with spatial attention to capture the full-process spatial features of traffic agents. Subsequently, these three spatial features are fused using a gate fusion mechanism. Moreover, during the modeling of the full-process spatial features, LSTM is capable of capturing short-term temporal dependencies in the trajectory information of traffic agents. In the temporal dimension, we utilize a Transformer-based encoder to extract long-term temporal dependencies in the trajectory information of traffic agents, which are then fused with the short-term temporal dependencies captured by LSTM. Finally, we employ two temporal convolutional networks (TCN) to predict trajectories based on the fused spatio-temporal features. Experimental results on the ApolloScape trajectory dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of weighted sum of average displacement error (WSADE) and weighted sum of final displacement error (WSFDE) metrics. Compared to the best baseline model (S2TNet), our method achieves reductions of 4.37% and 6.23% respectively in these metrics.},

Firstly, a transformer fusion model is developed to incorporate a two-stream backbone network to effectively fuse the complementary characteristics between RGB and thermal images. This aims to solve the problem that the victims cannot be seen clearly due to the adverse disaster area, such as smog and heavy rain.

Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets indicate that our TFSANet achieves superior results.

Secondly, a large number of terminal devices send authentication request information to the server at the same time, which is easy to cause network signaling congestion, and the centralized calculation mode of the server will cause a large delay in the authentication process. To solve these problems, we propose an edge-assisted group authentication scheme for narrowband Internet of Things. Firstly, a lightweight encryption algorithm LCHAOSAES was used to encrypt the terminal device identity to prevent the terminal device identity information leakage. Then, the edge computing method was used to add an edge network layer to the NB-IoT system architecture to assist in completing the group authentication of massive terminal devices, and the edge assistance could realize decentralization and reduce the load of centralized processing of the server. The Burrows Abadi Needham logic verification, informal security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is robust under malicious attacks such as replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack and insider attack, and has less signaling overhead and delay.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy sets (FSs) are a flexible and powerful tool for reasoning about uncertain situations that cannot be adequately expressed by classical sets. However, these sets fall short in two areas. The first is the reliability of this tool. Z-numbers are an extension of fuzzy numbers that improve the representation of uncertainty by combining two important components: restriction and reliability. The second is the problems that need to be solved simultaneously. Complex fuzzy sets (CFSs) overcome this problem by adding a second dimension to fuzzy numbers and simultaneously adding connected elements to the solution. However, they are insufficient when it comes to problems involving these two areas. We cannot express real-life problems that need to be solved at the same time and require the reliability of the information given with any set approach given in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we propose the complex fuzzy Z-number set (CFZNS), a generalization of Z-numbers and CFS, which fills this gap. We provide the operational laws of CFZNS along with some properties. Additionally, we define two essential aggregation operators called complex fuzzy Z-number weighted averaging (CFZNWA) and complex fuzzy Z-number weighted geometric (CFZNWG) operators. Then, we present an illustrative example to demonstrate the proficiency and superiority of the proposed approach. Thus, we process multiple fuzzy expressions simultaneously and take into account the reliability of these fuzzy expressions in applications. Furthermore, we compare the results with the existing set operations to confirm the advantages and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Considering the simultaneous expression of fuzzy statements, this study can serve as a foundation for new aggregation operators and decision-making problems and can be extended to many new applications such as pattern recognition and clustering.},

  abstract     = {Self-distillation method guides the model learning via transferring knowledge of the model itself, which has shown the advantages in object segmentation. However, it has been proved that uncertain pixels with predicted probability close to 0.5 will restrict the model performance. The existing self-distillation methods cannot guide the model to enhance its learning ability for uncertain pixels, so the improvement is limited. To boost the student model’s learning ability for uncertain pixels, a novel self-distillation method is proposed. Firstly, the predicted probability in the current training sample and the ground truth label are fused to construct the teacher knowledge, as the current predicted information can express the performance of student models and represent the uncertainty of pixels more accurately. Secondly, a quadratic mapping function between the predicted probabilities of the teacher and student model is proposed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method using the mapping function can guide the model to enhance the learning ability for uncertain pixels. Finally, the essential difference of utilizing the predicted probability of the student model in self-distillation is discussed in detail. Extensive experiments were conducted on models with convolutional neural networks and Transformer architectures as the backbone networks. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the student model performance.},

  abstract     = {Although the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proved to bring promising prospects for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), the performance of the algorithm deteriorates sharply in high-dimensional objective space due to the weak selection pressure and the unregulated balance, which is caused by the increase of objective space dimension. Some current MOEAs with two-stage strategy (TS) strive to address above issues by dividing the evolutionary process into two independent stages, in which convergence and diversity are handled separately within successive generations of different stages. However, TS-MOEAs have some weaknesses, such as sensitivity to stage division, and incomplete separation of convergence and diversity. In this paper, TS/KW-MaOEA is proposed for solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), which keeps TS as the central and equips a perfect control mechanism for separated balance. More specifically, TS/KW-MaOEA can automatically adjust the balance trend and provide appropriate selection pressure for MaOPs according to the Kondratiev wave (KW) search model and the objective space dimension. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a series of experiments are carried out against seven state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms on 15 benchmark problems with up to 30 objectives. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive against peer competitors.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a robot system for hanging and removing grounding rods is designed by integrating 3D recognition technology, hand-eye self-calibration technology, and automatic operation technology. Specifically, a novel hand-eye self-calibration algorithm is proposed that only uses common objects in the actual scene, which differs from traditional robot hand-eye calibration in that it requires a dedicated calibration board to assist with offline completion. Addressing the problem that existing self-calibration methods cannot be optimized as a whole, resulting in low accuracy and instability of the solution, a multi-stage objective function optimization self-calibration algorithm is proposed. An optimization method based on the minimization of re-projection error is designed to compensate for the results, which uses an efficient Oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) feature extraction algorithm and introduces a scoring mechanism to retain more correct matching points in the feature matching stage. Experimental verifications are conducted using both public dataset and practical robot system. In the dataset experiment, our method demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing self-calibration methods. Furthermore, the practical robot platform experiment confirms the feasibility and efficacy of our approach across various wind speeds and lighting conditions.},

To tackle these challenges, we propose an innovative framework called Joint Data Augmentations for Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (JDAGCL). The proposed model first integrates two augmenters: a feature-level augmenter and an edge-level augmenter. The two augmenters learn whether to drop an edge or node to obtain optimized graph structures and enrich the information available for modeling and forecasting task. Moreover, we introduce two stage training strategy to further process the features extracted by the encoder and enhance their effectiveness for forecasting downstream task.

  abstract     = {A hybrid structure is an arrangement that makes use of many hierarchical reporting structures and is applied to algebraic structures such as groups and rings. In the discipline of abstract algebra, an ideal of a near-ring is a unique subset of its elements in ring theory. Ideals generalize specific subsets of integers, such as even numbers or multiples of three. Researchers have been using mathematical theories of fuzzy sets in ring theory to explain the uncertainties that emerge in various domains such as art and science, engineering, medical science, and in environment. By fusing soft sets and fuzzy sets, a new mathematical tool that has significant advantages in dealing with uncertain information is provided. Consequently, there is always some discrepancy between reality&#39;s haziness and its mathematical model&#39;s precision. Hence ring theory has been widely used in many researches but there is some uncertainty in converting the fuzzy sets to a hybrid structure of any algebraic structure. Many approaches were done in groups. Therefore, the Hybrid structure of fuzzy sets in near rings is introduced, in which the fuzzy ideals are converted to hybrid ideals and fuzzy maximal ideals are converted to hybrid maximal ideals. For hybridization, firstly the hybrid structure is established and then sub-near rings and near rings are also determined. Then the hybrid structure of sub-near rings and ideals is introduced. This converts the fuzzy ideals and fuzzy maximal ideals to hybrid ideals and hybrid maximal ideals. The result obtained by the proposed model efficiently solved the uncertainty problems and the effectiveness of the proposed approach shows the best class, mean, worst class, and time complexity.},

While collaborative truck-drone delivery systems have been proposed to overcome limitations such as limited battery life and payload capacity, they are not well-suited for large and heavy parcel delivery. To solve the issue, a pioneering heterogeneous multi-drone delivery system. In this system, the mother drone handles the delivery of large and heavy parcels, releasing small drones to manage the delivery of smaller and lighter parcels. To address the complexities of this multi-drone delivery system, we introduce a divide-and-conquer framework consisting of two integral phases. The first phase, the task allocation phase, generates multiple task allocation schemes, while the second phase, the single-drone route planning phase, produces high-quality routes for each individual drone. Two phases are performed in an iterative manner until the predefined stopping criteria are satisfied. In the task allocation phase, we propose a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) to facilitate task allocation among multiple drones, utilizing transfer and recombination operators to generate high-quality solutions. After obtaining the task allocation scheme, a satisfactory route of a mother drone is generated by a variable neighborhood descent algorithm (VND). A desirable route for each single small drone is produced by dynamic programming (DP).Extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating the outstanding optimization and time efficiency of the proposed two-phase optimization method by the fact that it obtains within a 4.89% gap from the optimal solution generated by CPLEX in 15.48 s for instance up to 125 nodes.},

  abstract     = {Origin-destination demand prediction is a critical task in the field of intelligent transportation systems. However, accurately modeling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies presents significant challenges, which arises from various factors, including spatial, temporal, and external influences such as geographical features, weather conditions, and traffic incidents. Moreover, capturing multi-scale dependencies of local and global spatial dependencies, as well as short and long-term temporal dependencies, further complicates the task. To address these challenges, a novel framework called the Spatial-Temporal Memory Enhanced Multi-Level Attention Network (ST-MEN) is proposed. The framework consists of several key components. Firstly, an external attention mechanism is incorporated to efficiently process external factors into the prediction process. Secondly, a dynamic spatial feature extraction module is designed that effectively captures the spatial dependencies among nodes. By incorporating two skip-connections, this module preserves the original node information while aggregating information from other nodes. Finally, a temporal feature extraction module is proposed that captures both continuous and discrete temporal dependencies using a hierarchical memory network. In addition, multi-scale features cascade fusion is incorporated to enhance the performance of the proposed model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, extensively experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the ST-MEN model achieves excellent prediction accuracy, where the maximum improvement can reach to 19.1%.},

  abstract     = {Predicting student performance is crucial for both preventing failure and enabling personalized teaching-and-learning strategies. The digitalization of educational institutions has led to the collection of extensive student learning data over the years. Current research primarily focuses on short-term data, e.g. a single year or semester. In contrast, long-term data has the potential to offer a deeper insight into student behavior, thereby increasing the accuracy of predictions. However, the direct application of long-term data in prediction models assumes consistent data distributions over time. In the real world, evolutions in course content and structure can lead to variations in feature spaces (heterogeneity) and distribution shifts across different academic years, compromising the effectiveness of prediction models. To address these challenges, we introduce the Learning Ability Self-Adaptive Algorithm (LASA), which can adapt to the evolving feature spaces and distributions encountered in long-term data. LASA comprises two primary components: Learning Ability Modeling (LAM) and Long-term Distribution Alignment (LTDA). LAM assumes that students’ responses to exercises are samples from distributions that are parameterized by their learning abilities. It then estimates these parameters from the heterogeneous student exercise response data, thereby creating a new homogeneous feature space to counteract the heterogeneity present in long-term data. Subsequently, LTDA employs multiple asymmetric transformations to align distributions of these new features across different years, thus mitigating the impact of distribution shifts on the model’s performance. With these steps, LASA can generate well-aligned features with meaningful semantics. Furthermore, we propose an interpretable prediction framework including three components, i.e. LASA, a base classifier for outcome predictions, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for elucidating the impact of specific features on student performance. Our exploration of long-term student data covers an eight-year period (2016-2023) from a face-to-face course at Tsinghua University. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging long-term data significantly enhances prediction accuracy compared to short-term data, with LASA achieving up to a 7.9% increase. Moreover, when employing long-term data, LASA outperforms state-of-the-art models, ProbSAP and SFERNN, by an average accuracy improvement of 6.8% and 6.4%, respectively. We also present interpretable insights for pedagogical interventions based on a quantitative analysis of feature impacts on student performance. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate student performance prediction in long-term data scenarios, addressing a significant gap in the literature.},

The paradigm of IC+SP is to linearly combine the IC-related metric and the shortest path. Meanwhile, a transformation from the semantic similarity of the concepts to that of the words is presented by maximizing every component of IC+SP. 13 improved IC-related metrics based on IC+SP are formed and implemented on the experimental platform HESML Lastra-Díaz (Inf Syst 66:97–118, 2017). Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients on well-accepted benchmarks for the improved metrics compare to those for the original ones to evaluate IC+SP. I introduce the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test needing no standard distribution hypothesis, while, this hypothesis is required by T-Test on the sample of small size. T-Test, as well as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, conduct on the differences of the correlative coefficients for improved and original metrics. It is expected that the improved IC-related metrics could significantly outperform their corresponding original ones, and the experimental results, including the comparisons of mean and maximum of correlation coefficients as well as the p-value and confidence interval of both tests, accomplish the anticipation in the vast majority of cases.},

  abstract     = {Sparse large-scale multiobjective problems (LSMOPs) are characterized as an NP-hard issue that undergoes a significant presence of zero-valued variables in Pareto optimal solutions. In solving sparse LSMOPs, recent studies typically employ a specialized two-layer encoding, where the low-level layer undertakes the optimization of zero variables and the high-level layer is in charge of non-zero variables. However, such an encoding usually puts the low-level layer in the first place and thus cannot achieve a balance between optimizing zero and non-zero variables. To this end, this paper proposes to build a two-way association between the two layers using a mutual preference calculation method and a two-way matching strategy. Essentially, the two-way association balances the influence of two layers on the encoded individual by relaxing the control of the low-level layer and enhancing the control of the high-level layer, thus reaching the balance between the optimizations of zero and non-zero variables. Moreover, we propose a new evolutionary algorithm equipped with the modules and compare it with several state-of-the-art algorithms on 32 benchmark problems. Extensive experiments verify its effectiveness, as the proposed modules can improve the two-layer encoding and help the algorithm achieve superior performance on sparse LSMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Chinese Named Entity Recognition (CNER) focuses on precisely identifying predefined structural categories in unstructured Chinese text. Most existing CNER models do not consider the unique glyph and pinyin features of Chinese characters, but the rich semantic features hidden behind these features have a good effect on enhancing the judgment ability of language models. At the same time, it is difficult to identify the boundaries of Chinese nested entities, and accurately identifying the boundaries of entities within nested entities is also a difficult problem to solve. We propose a CNER method based on multi-feature fusion technology and biaffine mechanism to address the above issues: In the input representation layer, integrate the glyph and pinyin features of Chinese characters together, intuitively capturing the semantics of Chinese characters. Furthermore, biaffine mechanism has been introduced to provide a comprehensive view of the input on a global scale. This mechanism effectively converts the task of entity recognition into a problem of assigning scores to spans, hence enhancing the precision of identifying entity borders. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the model, a series of experiments were done on three Chinese entity recognition datasets: Resume, MSRA, and People Daily. The experimental results show that the solid boundary can be identified more accurately, and the F1 values of 96.49%, 96.26% and 96.19% are obtained respectively, which has a better recognition effect than the baseline model.},

The objective of our research is to investigate the enhancement of the conversion process by employing a machine-learning approach. Specifically, we utilize a support vector machine (SVM) to model and evaluate the impact of different operational parameters on the resulting gas mixture. One notable feature of this study involves the incorporation of an adaptive marine predator algorithm (AMPA) into the SVM framework, aiming to enhance the predicted precision and efficiency of the model. The primary focus of this study revolves around the development of an intelligent optimization framework that surpasses conventional machine learning techniques, hence providing a more dynamic and efficient strategy for process improvement. The SVM model’s performance, as assessed against experimental benchmarks, exhibits a notable degree of predictive accuracy and substantial concurrence with observed data. This increase in performance indicates that our methodology has the potential to make a significant contribution to the enhancement of renewable catalysts in gasification processes.

One widely acknowledged approach to addressing imbalanced distributions is through oversampling, a technique that both balances the class distribution and improves the effectiveness of classification models. However, when generating synthetic data for multi-label datasets, complexities arise due to the presence of multiple-label sets, which require careful placement and labeling. We propose MLCSMOTE-FRST, an algorithm for synthetic data generation based on label-specific clustering and fuzzy rough set theory. Generation ratios and dependency samples are provided by clusters specific to each label, with a focus on the overall label distribution and the distribution within each cluster. The labels are supported by intra-cluster positive samples, determined using fuzzy rough set theory, which helps to capture the consensus label set. Experimental results on multi-label datasets using four classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of macro-F1 and micro-F1 scores.},

  abstract     = {Infrastructure networks are critical components of contemporary society, and numerous approaches have been suggested for the selection of strategies to protect these networks. However, for uncertain environments, research on attack and defense game models for infrastructure networks is limited. Therefore, after reviewing the existing approaches, a method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) theory is proposed for attack and defense games in critical infrastructure networks. First, we present the process of constructing the game model proposed in this paper, which mainly includes the formulation of the cost model, the strategies, and the method of generating IVIFS payoffs. Next, the Nash equilibria of the game are identified by a pair of nonlinear programming models based on IVIFS theory. Finally, experiments are conducted on a target scale-free network, and an investigation into the variation patterns of the Nash equilibria under different circumstances is also conducted. We provide explanations for these variation patterns by considering payoffs from the perspective of mathematical programming models. Furthermore, we find that compared to the existing attack and defense game model with crisp payoffs, the model proposed in this paper leads to superior Nash equilibria. Our work is a preliminary attempt to analyse attack and defense games for infrastructure networks based on IVIFS theory, providing a method for assessing payoffs in uncertain environments for the attacker and defender.

  abstract     = {Upper limb prostheses are commonly propelled by pneumatic artificial muscles organized in an antagonistic arrangement. Nonetheless, the control of upper limb prostheses under changing/unknown situations is difficult and necessary for a variety of real-world applications. Adaptive control, learning-based control, and robust control have been studied to deal with such challenges. However, their adaptability is insufficient for prostheses used in daily life, which are exposed to variable task levels, user motor characteristics, and prosthetic features. This paper introduces a highly adaptive controller for the first time based on Generative Adversarial Nets and proportional–integral–derivative controller (G-PID controller). G-PID controller comprises a generator for generating compensation actions to enhance PID responsiveness when controlling the unknown/changing system. Moreover, it incorporates a discriminator that receives responses from both a user-preselected reference system and the compensated changing/unknown system, and simultaneously determines the source of these responses. Through continuous updates, the compensator modifies the response of unknown/changing system to align with the reference system, thereby facilitating adaptive control. The G-PID controller’s effectiveness is evaluated through 1-degree of freedom (DoF) joint and 2-DoF shoulder prostheses in simulation experiments, and further validated in prototype experiments focusing on online learning for unknown and time-varying payload. The results demonstrate its ability to deal with diverse types of unknowns/changes, marking a significant advancement towards incorporating prostheses seamlessly into daily life.},

Learning a faithful directed acyclic graph (DAG) from a large number of complex samples of a joint distribution is currently a challenging combinatorial problem. Due to the growing volume and complexity of data, some Bayesian structure learning algorithms are ineffective and lack the necessary precision to meet the required needs. In this paper, we propose a new PCCL-CC algorithm. To ensure the accuracy of the network structure, we introduce the new ensemble weights and edge constraints setting mechanism. In this mechanism, we employ a method that estimates the interaction between network nodes from multiple perspectives and divides the learning process into multiple stages. We utilize an asymmetric weighted ensemble method and adaptively adjust the network structure. Additionally, we propose a causal discovery method that effectively utilizes the causal relationships among data samples to correct the network structure and mitigate the influence of Markov equivalence classes (MEC).

To address these challenges, a multi-scale spatial–temporal capsule network (MSCN) based on sequence encoding is proposed for bearing fault identification under nonstationary and noisy environments. A spatial–temporal sequence encoding module focuses on feature correlations at various times and positions. Dilated convolution-based multiscale capsule layer (MCaps) is designed to capture spatial–temporal features at different scales. MCaps establishes connections between various layers, enhancing the comprehension and interpretation of spatial–temporal features. Furthermore, the Bhattacharyya coefficient is introduced into the dynamic routing to compare the similarity between capsules.

  abstract     = {This study delves into the complex prioritization process for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), focusing on triaged patients at three urgency levels. Establishing a dynamic prioritization solution is challenging for resolving conflicts or trade-offs among ASD criteria. This research employs fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) theory across four methodological phases. In the first phase, the study identifies a triaged ASD dataset, considering 19 critical medical and sociodemographic criteria for the three ASD levels. The second phase introduces a new Decision Matrix (DM) designed to manage the prioritization process effectively. The third phase focuses on the new extension of Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency (FWZIC) to construct the criteria weights using Single-Valued Neutrosophic 2-tuple Linguistic (SVN2TL). The fourth phase formulates the Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) method to rank patients within each urgency level. Results from the SVN2TL-FWZIC weights offer significant insights, including the higher criteria values &quot;C12 = Laughing for no reason&quot; and &quot;C16 = Notice the sound of the bell&quot; with 0.097358 and 0.083832, indicating their significance in identifying potential ASD symptoms. The SVN2TL-FWZIC weights offer the base for prioritizing the three triage levels using MABAC, encompassing medical and behavioral dimensions. The methodology undergoes rigorous evaluation through sensitivity analysis scenarios, confirming the consistency of the prioritization results with critical analysis points. The methodology compares with three benchmark studies, using four distinct points, and achieves a remarkable 100% congruence with these prior investigations.

Traditional numerical methods suffer significant lagging error when addressing this issue.

However, these two methods exhibit inherent limitations in the resolution process, i.e. high computational complexity and low solution accuracy, respectively. Motivated by this technology gap, this paper proposes an Adaptive Coefficient Gradient Neural Dynamics (ACGND) for dynamically solving the DTI with an efficient and precise manner. Through a series of simulation experiments and validations in engineering applications, the ACGND demonstrates advantages in resolving DTI. The ACGND enhances computational efficiency by circumventing matrix inversion, thereby reducing computational complexity.

However, Healthcare data travels across an open route, i.e., the Internet, making EHR security a difficult process to do. This puts healthcare data vulnerable to cyber assaults. A possible method for protecting EHRs is blockchain technology. In this work, we develop an EHR architecture based on blockchain, which ensures all stakeholder&#39;s safety and privacy. We analyze various security architectures used for EHRs and the standard encryption system is integrated with quantum computing (QC). To safeguard the conventional traditional encrypting system against quantum assaults, we provide a hybrid signature technique that combines the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Dilithium within the anti-quantum lattice-based blind signature. Based on the difficulty of lattice problems over finite fields, Dilithium is a lattice-based signature method that is substantially safe against selected message assaults. The developed technique creates high entropy secret keys using the lattice basis delegation mechanism. The combination of ECDSA and Dilithium provides an efficient and secure signature system that is resilient to quantum attacks. The proposed scheme ensures that only authorized users with a defined role can use the database to access the data. We evaluate the efficiency of our scheme by comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art solutions in terms of transaction throughput, resource utilization, and communication cost. Results demonstrate that the developed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of efficiency and security.},

To address this problem, this paper presents a new strategy for norm evolution based on an improved crossover operator. First, this paper presents a power-set approach to improve the integrity of norm evolution. This approach can help ensure that all possible combinations of norms are considered during the analysis, providing a deeper understanding of how norms interact and evolve within a norm set. Then, to improve the efficiency of norm evolution, a trade-off between efficiency and completeness is proposed. This approach reduces the search space and improves efficiency, as not every power set combination needs to be searched; it also ensures completeness. Finally, the crossover operator in this strategy is improved based on the trade-off approach. Specifically, the triggers and expectations of one mutated norm enrich the triggers and expectations of other norms. All of these factors enrich the normative conditions through the trade-off approach. A MAS can take immediate action to adapt to new requirements or problems encountered, and quickly make normative changes and learn to respond appropriately to a new situation. The MAS is able to more clearly understand and learn about causality in the environment during norm evolution, and understand the connection between behavior and outcomes. The proposed strategy is applied to a case study of an unmanned vehicle system. The experimental results show that the trade-off approach has greater completeness and effectiveness in norm evolution. This strategy achieves a more complete and effective autonomous norm evolution. It helps the system achieve its goals better and reach better performance in terms of adaptability, helping it to function better in complex multiagent environments.},

  abstract     = {The resource-assisted processing operation involves the coupling of multi-dimensional sub-problem, which poses a challenge in scheduling system. In this study, a dimension-aware gain-sharing knowledge algorithm (DGSK) is presented to address the distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with resource-dependent processing times (DHFSP-RDPT), where the makespan is to be minimized. Firstly, by analyzing the mathematical model of the DHFSP-RDPT, four problem-specific lemmas and two novel resource reallocation rules are proposed. The DGSK begin with a high-performance initial population, which is generated by three knowledge-driven heuristics in hybrid way. Next, a discrete evolution-based search mechanism assists the DGSK to extend the search in solution space. Furthermore, a dimension-aware two-stage local search combined with meta-Lamarckian learning method is embedded to enhance the local search ability for the multidimensional problems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is measured on a series of instances based on real production data. The results demonstrate that the DGSK improves the performance by in solving DHFSP-RDPT compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

In developing countries, disease diagnosis is often time-consuming and associated with serious prognostic problems. Moreover, MRI is characterized by high noise and low resolution. This creates difficulties in automatic segmentation of the lesion region, leading to a decrease in the segmentation performance of the model. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network osteosarcoma image segmentation system based on noise reduction and super-resolution reconstruction, which is the first time to introduce super-resolution methods in the task of osteosarcoma MRI image segmentation, effectively improving the Model generalization performance. We first refined the initial osteosarcoma dataset using a Differential Activation Filter, separating those image data that had little effect on model training. At the same time, we carry out rough initial denoising of the image. Then, an improved information multi-distillation network based on adaptive cropping is proposed to reconstruct the original image and improve the resolution of the image. Finally, a high-resolution network is used to segment the image, and the segmentation boundary is optimized to provide a reference for doctors. Experimental results show that this algorithm has a stronger segmentation effect and anti-noise ability than existing methods. Code: https://github.com/GFF1228/NSRDN.},

Hence, a population state-driven surrogate-assisted differential evolution algorithm (PSSADE) is proposed for solving ECOPs-MI, in which the adaptive population update mechanism (APUM) and the collaborative framework of global and local surrogate-assisted search (CFGLS) are combined effectively. In CFGLS, a probability-driven mixed-integer mutation (PMIU) is incorporated into the classical global DE/rand/2 and local DE/best/2 for improving the diversity and potentials of candidate solutions, respectively, and the collaborative framework further integrates both the superiority of global and local mutation for the purpose of achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Moreover, the current population is adaptively reselected based on the efficient non-dominated sorting technique in APUM when the population distribution is too dense. Empirical studies on 10 benchmark problems and 2 numerical engineering cases demonstrate that the PSSADE shows a more competitive performance than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, PSSADE provides excellent performance in the design of infrared stealth material film.},

  abstract     = {Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Shooting Payoff Computation (SPC) framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players’ actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the SPC framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the applications of digital humans have become increasingly widespread. One of the most challenging core technologies is the generation of highly realistic and automated 3D facial animation that combines facial movements and speech. The single-modal 3D facial animation driven by speech typically ignores the weak correlation between speech and upper facial movements as well as head posture. In contrast, the video-driven approach can perfectly solve the posture problem while obtaining natural expressions. However, mapping 2D facial information to 3D facial information may lead to information loss, which make lip synchronization generated by video-driven methods is not as good as the speech-driven methods trained on 4D facial data. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-modal generation method that uses speech and video information to generate more natural and vivid 3D facial animation. Specifically, the lip movements related to speech are generated by speech-video information, while speech-uncorrelated postures and expressions are generated solely by video information. The speech-driven module is used to extract speech features, and its output lip animation is then used as the foundation for facial animation. The expression and pose module is used to extract temporal visual features for regressing expression and head posture parameters. We fuse speech and video features to obtain chin posture parameters related to lip movements, and use these parameters to fine-tune the lip animation generated form the speech-driven module. This paper introduces multiple consistency losses to enhance the network’s capability to generate expressions and postures. Experiments conducted on the LRS3, TCD-TIMIT and MEAD datasets show that the proposed method achieves better performance on evaluation metrics such as CER, WER, VER and VWER than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a perceptual user study show that over 77% and 70% of cases believe that this paper’s method is better than the comparative algorithms EMOCA and SPECTRE in terms of realism. In terms of lip synchronization, it received over 79% and 66% of cases support, respectively. Both evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the existing methods rarely consider these three aspects comprehensively to improve the quality of feature matching, which in turn affects the effect of 3D reconstruction. Therefore, to effectively improve the quality of 3D reconstruction, we propose a circle-based enhanced motion consistency and guided diffusion feature matching algorithm for 3D reconstruction named EMC+GD_C. Firstly, a circle-based neighborhood division method is proposed, which increases the number of initial matching points. Secondly, to improve the precision of feature point matching, on the one hand, we put forward the idea of enhancing motion consistency, reducing the mismatch of high similarity feature points by enhancing the judgment conditions of true and false matching points; on the other hand, we combine the RANSAC optimization method to filter out the outliers and further improve the precision of feature point matching. Finally, a novel guided diffusion idea combining guided matching and motion consistency is proposed, which expands the distribution range of feature point matching and improves the stability of 3D models. Experiments on 8 sets of 908 pairs of images in the public 3D reconstruction datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve better matching performance and show stronger stability in 3D reconstruction. Specifically, EMC+GD_C achieves an average improvement of 24.07% compared to SIFT-based ratio test, 9.18% to GMS and 1.94% to EMC+GD_G in feature matching precision.},

In this paper, an attempt is made to improve the network coverage by moving the locations of the nodes. A surrogate-assisted sine Phasmatodea population evolution algorithm (SASPPE) is used to evaluate the network coverage. A $$50 \times 50$$ hill simulation environment was tested for the number of nodes of 30 and 40 and radii of 3, 5 and 7, respectively. The results show that the SASPPE algorithm has the highest coverage, which can be up to 23.624% higher than the PPE algorithm, and up to 5.196% higher than the PPE algorithm, ceteris paribus. The SASPPE algorithm mixes the GSAM with LSAMs, which balances the computational cost of the algorithm and the algorithm’s ability to find optimal results. The use of hierarchical clustering enhances the stable type of the LSAMs. In addition, LSAMs are easy to fall into local optimality when they are modeled with local data, and the use of sine Phasmatodea population evolution algorithm (Sine-PPE) for searching in LSAMs alleviates the time for the algorithm to fall into local optimality. On 30D, 50D, and 100D, the proposed algorithm was tested by 7 test functions. The results show that the algorithm has significant advantages on most functions.},

To address these problems and fully utilize external knowledge, we propose a Multi-source Information Contrastive Learning Collaborative Augmented method ( $$\textbf{MCCA}$$ ), which aims to mine the potential tag preferences of users in dialogues as well as enhance the accuracy of item representation and user preference modeling. Specifically, we utilize the obtained items and their tags to construct a new knowledge graph that incorporates movie tags. We design a Multi-source Item Fusion mechanism ( $$\textbf{MIF}$$ ) to bridge the information gaps between items from different knowledge graphs and then utilize unsupervised contrastive learning to enhance the items’ representation capability after MIF. Additionally, a Multi-Tag Fusion mechanism ( $$\textbf{MTF}$$ ) is designed to combine user-perceived information (i.e., tag popularity) and keywords obtained from reviews to co-enhance user preference representations through items and tags, and to incorporate fused item and tag features into the conversation module.

This method seamlessly integrates object detection and tracking through graph neural networks, building upon the foundation of the JDE paradigm. Specifically, we construct graph structures to capture the correlation between objects in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To further tackle the frequent ID switching problem, we employ an attention mechanism to aggregate object context information within the same frame and across different frames, updating the object information via graph neural networks to derive highly distinctive appearance features. Ultimately, the obtained strongly distinguishable object appearance features serve to mitigate the issue of frequent object ID switches. In experiments conducted on the MOT17 test set, our proposed method yields promising results, achieving a 73% Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and a 73.2% ID F1 score. Furthermore, it demonstrates a substantial reduction in ID switches compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

The directly measurable feature data (such as voltage, temperature, and current) is subsequently fed into the student network for online training and computation of a hard loss. the student network’s output is then directed into the pre-trained the teacher network to compute a soft loss, thereby offering prior knowledge of degradation laws and steering the optimization process of the student network. Rigorous experiments are conducted utilizing various datasets, with the outcomes validating the superior estimation accuracy and degradation rule adherence of the model. Notably, among five different models, this model demonstrates the best performance on almost all datasets, achieving an RMSE of 0.0097 and an MAE of 0.0065 on Cell1 of the Oxford dataset. Moreover, the model also demonstrates robust performance across different usage scenarios, inclusive of multi-battery estimation. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a fine tuning method for State of Health predictions only using the first half of the data. Comparative analysis with other models underscores the competitiveness of the proposed model, showcasing its potential for broader application.},

  abstract     = {Inferring the 3D surface shape of a known template from 2D images captured by a monocular camera is a challenging problem. Due to the severely underconstrained nature of the problem, inferring shape accurately becomes particularly challenging when the template exhibits high curvature, resulting in the disappearance of feature points and significant differences between the inferred and actual deformations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a concise and innovative approach that utilizes a physical simulator incorporating the object’s material properties and deformation law. We utilize a view frustum space constructed from the contours of a monocular camera image to effectively restrict the physically-based free motion of the template. Additionally, we employ mesh denoising techniques to ensure the smoothness of the surface following deformation. To evaluate our shape inference results, we utilize a ground truth 3D point cloud generated from multiple viewpoint images. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other methods in accurately inferring deformations, particularly in scenarios where feature points are unobservable. This method carries significant practical implications across diverse domains, including virtual reality, digital modeling, and medical surgery training.},

  abstract     = {Object detection plays a vital role in remote sensing applications. Although object detection has achieved proud results in natural images, these methods are difficult to be directly applied to remote sensing images. Remote sensing images often have complex backgrounds and small objects, which results in a highly unbalanced distribution of foreground and complex background information. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-head channel and spatial trans-attention (MCSTA) module, which performs remote pixel interaction from the channel and spatial dimensions respectively to complete the attention feature capture function. It is a plug-and-play module that can be easily embedded in any other natural image object detection convolutional neural network, making it quickly applicable to remote sensing images. First, in order to reduce computational complexity and improve feature richness, we use a special linear convolution to obtain three projection features instead of the simple matrix multiplication transformation in Transformer. Second, we obtain trans-attention maps in different dimensions in a manner similar to the self-attention mechanism to capture the interrelationships of features in channels and spaces. In this process, we use a multi-head mechanism to perform parallel operations to improve speed. Furthermore, in order to avoid large-scale matrix operations, we specially designed an attention blocking mode to reduce computer memory usage and increase operation speed. Finally, we embedded the trans-attention module into YOLOv8, added a new detection head and optimized the feature fusion method, thus designing a lightweight small object detection model named TA-YOLO for remote sensing images. It has fewer parameters than the benchmark model YOLOv8, and its mAP on the PASCAL VOC and VisDrone data sets increased by 1.3% and 6.2% respectively. The experimental results prove the powerful function of the trans-attention module and the excellent performance of TA-YOLO.},

  abstract     = {The camouflaged object segmentation model (COSM) has recently gained substantial attention due to its remarkable ability to detect camouflaged objects. Nevertheless, deep vision models are widely acknowledged to be susceptible to adversarial examples, which can mislead models, causing them to make incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant concerns when deploying COSM in security-sensitive applications. Consequently, it is crucial to determine whether the foundational vision model COSM is also susceptible to such attacks. To our knowledge, our work represents the first exploration of strategies for targeting COSM with adversarial examples in the digital world. With the primary objective of reversing the predictions for both masked objects and backgrounds, we explore the adversarial robustness of COSM in full white-box and black-box settings. In addition to the primary objective of reversing the predictions for masked objects and backgrounds, our investigation reveals the potential to generate any desired mask through adversarial attacks. The experimental results indicate that COSM demonstrates weak robustness, rendering it vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. In the realm of COS, the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method exhibits superior attack capabilities compared to the fast gradient sign (FGSM) method in both white-box and black-box settings. These findings reduce the security risks in the application of COSM and pave the way for multiple applications of COSM.},

  abstract     = {In the field of deep learning, the attention mechanism, as a technology that mimics human perception and attention processes, has made remarkable achievements. The current methods combine a channel attention mechanism and a spatial attention mechanism in a parallel or cascaded manner to enhance the model representational competence, but they do not fully consider the interaction between spatial and channel information. This paper proposes a method in which a space embedded channel module and a channel embedded space module are cascaded to enhance the model’s representational competence. First, in the space embedded channel module, to enhance the representational competence of the region of interest in different spatial dimensions, the input tensor is split into horizontal and vertical branches according to spatial dimensions to alleviate the loss of position information when performing 2D pooling. To smoothly process the features and highlight the local features, four branches are obtained through global maximum and average pooling, and the features are aggregated by different pooling methods to obtain two feature tensors with different pooling methods. To enable the output horizontal and vertical feature tensors to focus on different pooling features simultaneously, the two feature tensors are segmented and dimensionally transposed according to spatial dimensions, and the features are later aggregated along the spatial direction. Then, in the channel embedded space module, for the problem of no cross-channel connection between groups in grouped convolution and for which the parameters are large, this paper uses adaptive grouped banded matrices. Based on the banded matrices utilizing the mapping relationship that exists between the number of channels and the size of the convolution kernels, the convolution kernel size is adaptively computed to achieve adaptive cross-channel interaction, enhancing the correlation between the channel dimensions while ensuring that the spatial dimensions remain unchanged. Finally, the output horizontal and vertical weights are used as attention weights. In the experiment, the attention mechanism module proposed in this paper is embedded into the MobileNetV2 and ResNet networks at different depths, and extensive experiments are conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 datasets. The results show that the method in this paper captures and utilizes the features of the input data more effectively than the other methods, significantly improving the classification accuracy. Despite the introduction of an additional computational burden (0.5 M), however, the overall performance of the model still achieves the best results when the computational overhead is comprehensively considered.},

However, previous works did not achieve a natural-language level of perception. Therefore, LP-SLAM (Language-Perceptive RGB-D SLAM) is proposed that leverages large language models (LLMs). The texts in the scene can be detected by scene text recognition (STR) and mapped as landmarks with a task-driven selection. A text error correction chain (TECC) is designed with a similarity classification method, a two-stage memory strategy, and a text clustering method. The proposed architecture is designed to deal with the mis-detection and mis-recognition cases of STR and to provide accurate text information to the framework. The proposed framework takes input images and generates a 3D map with sparse point cloud and task-related texts. Finally, a natural user interface (NUI) is designed based on the constructed map and LLM, which gives position instructions based on users’ natural queries. The experimental results validated the proposed TECC design and the overall framework.

Previous research on the AE task has not adequately leveraged syntactic information and has overlooked the issue of multi-word aspect terms in text. Current researchers tend to focus on one of the two subtasks, neglecting the connection between the AE and ASC tasks. Moreover, the problem of error propagation easily occurs between two independent subtasks when performing the complete ABSA task. To address these issues, we present a unified ABSA model based on syntactic features and interactive learning. The proposed model is called syntactic interactive learning based aspect term sentiment classification model (SIASC). To overcome the problem of extracting multi-word aspect terms, the model utilizes part-of-speech features, words features, and dependency features as textual information. Meanwhile, we designs a unified ABSA structure based on the end-to-end framework, reducing the impact of error propagation issues. Interaction learning in the model can establish a connection between the AE task and the ASC task. The information from interactive learning contributes to improving the model’s performance on the ASC task. We conducted an extensive array of experiments on the Laptop14, Restaurant14, and Twitter datasets. The experimental results show that the SIASC model achieved average accuracy of 84.11%, 86.65%, and 78.42% on the AE task, respectively.

  abstract     = {Rough fuzzy clustering algorithms have received extensive attention due to the excellent ability to handle overlapping and uncertainty of data. However, existing rough fuzzy clustering algorithms generally consider single view clustering, which neglects the clustering requirements of multiple views and results in the failure to identify diverse data structures in practical applications. In addition, rough fuzzy clustering algorithms are always sensitive to the initialized cluster centers and easily fall into local optimum. To solve the above problems, the multi-view and transfer learning are introduced into rough fuzzy clustering and a robust multi-view knowledge transfer-based rough fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (MKT-RFCCA) is proposed in this paper. First, multiple distance metrics are adopted as multiple views to effectively recognize different data structures, and thus positively contribute to clustering. Second, a novel multi-view transfer-based rough fuzzy clustering objective function is constructed by using fuzzy memberships as transfer knowledge. This objective function can fully explore and utilize the potential information between multiple views and characterize the uncertainty information. Then, combining the statistical information of color histograms, an initialized centroids selection strategy is presented for image segmentation to overcome the instability and sensitivity caused by the random distribution of the initialized cluster centers. Finally, to reduce manual intervention, a distance-based adaptive threshold determination mechanism is designed to determine the threshold parameter for dividing the lower approximation and boundary region of rough fuzzy clusters during the iteration process. Experiments on synthetic datasets, real-world datasets, and noise-contaminated Berkeley and Weizmann images show that MKT-RFCCA obtains favorable clustering results. Especially, it provides satisfactory segmentation results on images with different types of noise and preserves more specific detail information of images.},

We propose a novel method called VertiBayes to train Bayesian networks (structure and parameters) on vertically partitioned data, which can handle missing values as well as an arbitrary number of parties. For structure learning we adapted the K2 algorithm with a privacy-preserving scalar product protocol. For parameter learning, we use a two-step approach: first, we learn an intermediate model using maximum likelihood, treating missing values as a special value, then we train a model on synthetic data generated by the intermediate model using the EM algorithm. The privacy guarantees of VertiBayes are equivalent to those provided by the privacy preserving scalar product protocol used. We experimentally show VertiBayes produces models comparable to those learnt using traditional algorithms. Finally, we propose two alternative approaches to estimate the performance of the model using vertically partitioned data and we show in experiments that these give accurate estimates.},

  abstract     = {UAV vehicle detection based on convolutional neural network exits a key problem of information imbalance of different feature layers. Shallow features have spatial information that is beneficial to localization, but lack semantic information. On the contrary, deep features have semantic information that is beneficial to classification, but lack spatial information. However, accurate classification and localization for UAV vehicle detection require both shallow spatial information and high semantic information. In our work, a bi-directional information guidance network (BDIG-Net) for UAV vehicle detection is proposed, which can ensure that each feature prediction layer has abundant mid-/low-level spatial information and high-level semantic information. There are two main parts in the BDIG-Net: shallow-level spatial information guidance part and deep-level semantic information guidance part. In the shallow-level guidance part, we design a feature transform module (FTM) to supply the mid-/low-level feature information, which can guide the BDIG-Net to enhance detailed and spatial features for deep features. Furthermore, we adopt a light-weight attention module (LAM) to reduce unnecessary shallow background information, making the network more focused on small-sized vehicles. In the deep-level guidance part, we use classical feature pyramid network to supply high-level semantic information, which can guide the BDIG-Net to enhance contextual information for shallow features. Meanwhile, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to suppress redundant features and improve the discriminability of vehicles. The proposed BDIG-Net can reduce the information imbalance. The experimental results show that the BDIG-Net can achieve accurate classification and localization for UAV vehicles and realize the real-time application requirements.},

  abstract     = {Single-frame infrared small target detection is affected by the low image resolution and small target size, and is prone to the problems of small target feature loss and positional offset during continuous downsampling; at the same time, the sparse features of the small targets do not correlate well with the global-local linkage of the background features. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an efficient infrared small target detection method. First, this paper incorporates BlurPool in the feature extraction part, which reduces the loss and positional offset of small target features in the process of convolution and pooling. Second, this paper designs an interactive attention deep feature fusion module, which acquires the correlation information between the target and the background from a global perspective, and designs a compression mechanism based on deep a priori knowledge, which reduces the computational difficulty of the self-attention mechanism. Then, this paper designs the context local feature enhancement and fusion module, which uses deep semantic features to dynamically guide shallow local features to realize enhancement and fusion. Finally, this paper proposes an edge feature extraction module for shallow features, which utilizes the complete texture and location information in the shallow features to assist the network to initially locate the target position and edge shape. Numerous experiments show that the method in this paper significantly improves nIoU, F1-Measure and AUC on IRSTD-1k Datasets and NUAA-SIRST Datasets.},

  abstract     = {Previous deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have achieved impressive results, typically in symmetric and homogeneous scenarios. However, asymmetric heterogeneous scenarios are prevalent and usually harder to solve. In this paper, the main discussion is about the cooperative heterogeneous MARL problem in asymmetric heterogeneous maps of the Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenges (SMAC) environment. Recent mainstream approaches use policy-based actor-critic algorithms to solve the heterogeneous MARL problem with various individual agent policies. However, these approaches lack formal definition and further analysis of the heterogeneity problem. Therefore, a formal definition of the Local Transition Heterogeneity (LTH) problem is first given. Then, the LTH problem in SMAC environment can be studied. To comprehensively reveal and study the LTH problem, some new asymmetric heterogeneous maps in SMAC are designed. It has been observed that baseline algorithms fail to perform well in the new maps. Then, the authors propose the Grouped Individual-Global-Max (GIGM) consistency and a novel MARL algorithm, Grouped Hybrid Q-Learning (GHQ). GHQ separates agents into several groups and keeps individual parameters for each group. To enhance cooperation between groups, GHQ maximizes the mutual information between trajectories of different groups. A novel hybrid structure for value factorization in GHQ is also proposed. Finally, experiments on the original and the new maps show the fabulous performance of GHQ compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Cloud model similarity algorithm is an important part of cloud modelling theory. Most of the existing cloud model similarity algorithms suffer from poor discriminability, poor classification, unstable results, and low time efficiency. In this paper, a new similarity algorithm is proposed that considers the triangular cloud model distance and shape. First, according to the $${{D}}_{\text{T}}$$ distance formula, a new exponential closeness measure is defined, with which the distance similarity of cloud models is characterized. Then, the shape similarity is calculated according to the variance of the cloud model cloud drops. Finally, the two similarities are synthesized to define a similarity algorithm for determining the distance from the $${{D}}_{\text{T}}$$ distance formula and shape based on the triangular cloud model (DDTSTCM). In this paper, discriminability, stability, efficiency and theoretical interpretability are taken as the evaluation indices. Equipment security system capability evaluation experiment, cloud model differentiation simulation experiment and time series classification accuracy experiment are set up to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in terms of the four above aspects. The experimental results show that DDTSTCM has good differentiation and excellent classification effects. In the classification experiment for the time series, the average classification accuracy of DDTSTCM reaches 91.78%, which is at least 2.78% higher than those of the other seven commonly used algorithms. The CPU running efficiency of DDTSTCM is also extremely high, and the average CPU running time of group training is always on the order of milliseconds, which effectively reduces the time cost. Finally, a case study is conducted to analyse a risk assessment problem for China’s island microgrid industry, and the evaluation results based on DDTSTCM are in line with human cognition and have good value for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Emergent news is characterized by few labels, and news detection methods that rely on a large number of labels are difficult to apply to learned features for emerging events and are ineffective in coping with less labeled emergent news detection. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, this study first establishes a scenario for detecting breaking news, ensuring that the domain of detecting events is distinct from the domain of historical events. Secondly, we propose the Clip-GCN multimodal fake news detection model. The model utilizes the Clip pre-training model to perform joint semantic feature extraction of image-text information, with text information as the supervisory signal, which solves the problem of semantic interaction between modalities. Meanwhile, considering the domain attributes of news, the model is trained to extract inter-domain invariant features through Adversarial Neural Network ideation, and intra-domain knowledge information is utilized through graph convolutional networks (GCN) to detect emergent news. Through an extensive number of experiments on Chinese and English datasets from two major social media platforms, Weibo and Twitter, it is demonstrated that the model proposed in this paper can accurately screen multimodal emergent news on social media with an average accuracy of 88.7%. The contribution of this study lies not only in the improvement of model performance but also in the proposal of a solution for the challenges posed by limited labels and multimodal breaking news.

In this paper, we design a new semi-supervised multi-label feature selection algorithm. First, we construct an initial similarity matrix with supervised information by considering the similarity between labels, so as to learn a more ideal similarity matrix, which can better guide feature selection. By combining latent representation with semi-supervised information, a more ideal pseudo-label matrix is learned. Second, the local manifold structure of the original data space is preserved by the manifold regularization term based on the graph.

  abstract     = {Currently, many real-time semantic segmentation networks aim for heightened accuracy, inevitably leading to increased computational complexity and reduced inference speed. Therefore, striking a balance between accuracy and speed has emerged as a crucial concern in this domain. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dual-branch fusion network with multiscale atrous pyramid pooling aggregate contextual features for real-time semantic segmentation (MAFNet). The first key component, the semantics guide spatial-details module (SGSDM) not only facilitates precise boundary extraction and fine-grained classification, but also provides semantic-based feature representation, thereby enhancing support for spatial analysis and decision boundaries. The second component, the multiscale atrous pyramid pooling module (MSAPPM), is designed by combining dilation convolution with feature pyramid pooling operations at various dilation rates. This design not only expands the receptive field, but also aggregates rich contextual information more effectively. To further improve the fusion of feature information generated by the dual-branch, a bilateral fusion module (BFM) is introduced. This module employs cross-fusion by calculating weights generated by the dual-branch to balance the weight relationship between the dual branches, thereby achieving effective feature information fusion. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, experiments are conducted on a single A100 GPU. MAFNet achieves a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 77.4% at 70.9 FPS on the Cityscapes test dataset and 77.6% mIoU at 192.5 FPS on the CamVid test dataset. The experimental results conclusively demonstrated that MAFNet effectively strikes a balance between accuracy and speed.},

The black hole algorithm (BHA) is one of the popular heuristic algorithms among researchers because of its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, an improved self-adaptive logarithmic spiral path black hole algorithm (SLBHA) is proposed. SLBHA innovatively introduces a logarithmic spiral path and random vector path to BHA. At the same time, a parameter is used to control the randomness, which enhances the local exploitation ability of the algorithm. Besides, SLBHA designs a replacement mechanism to improve the global exploration ability. Finally, a self-adaptive parameter is introduced to control the replacement mechanism and maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, comparison experiments are conducted on 13 datasets creatively using the evaluation criteria including the Jaccard coefficient as well as the Folkes and Mallows index. The proposed methods are compared with the selected algorithms such as the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), compound intensified exploration firefly algorithm (CIEFA), improved black hole algorithm (IBH), etc. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms on both external criteria and quantization error of the clustering problem.},

Despite achieving satisfactory results in RGB-T crowd counting, many existing methods still face two significant limitations: (1) The oversight of the heterogeneous gap between modalities complicates the effective integration of multimodal features. (2) The absence of mining consistency hinders the full exploitation of the unique complementary strengths inherent in each modality. To this end, we present C4-MIM, a novel Consistency-constrained RGB-T Crowd Counting approach via Mutual Information Maximization. It effectively leverages multimodal information by learning the consistency between the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby enhancing the performance of cross-modal counting. Specifically, we first advocate extracting feature representations of different modalities in a shared encoder to moderate the heterogeneous gap since they obey the identical coding rules with shared parameters. Then, we intend to mine the consistent information of different modalities to better learn conducive information and improve the performance of feature representations. To this end, we formulate the complementarity of multimodality representations as a mutual information maximization regularizer to maximize the consistent information of different modalities, in which the consistency would be maximally attained before combining the multimodal information. Finally, we simply aggregate the feature representations of the different modalities and send them into a regressor to output the density maps. The proposed approach can be implemented by arbitrary backbone networks and is quite robust in the face of single modality unavailable or serious compromised. Extensively experiments have been conducted on the RGBT-CC and DroneRGBT benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the SOTA approaches.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommendation (SR) predicts the user’s future preferences based on the sequence of interactions. Recently, some methods for SR have utilized contrastive learning to incorporate self-supervised signals into SR to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Despite these achievements, they overlook the fact that users’ multi-behavior interactions in real-world scenarios (e.g., page view, favorite, add to cart, and purchase). Moreover, they disregard the temporal dependencies in users’ preferences and their influence on attribute information, leading to models that struggle to accurately capture users’ personalized preferences. Therefore, we propose a multi-behavior collaborative contrastive learning for sequential recommendation model. First, we introduce both user-side and item-side attribute information and design an attribute-weight-enhanced attention in multi-behavior interaction scenarios. It enhances the model’s ability to capture user’s multi-behavior preferences while considering the influence of attribute information. Second, in order to capture users’ fine-grained temporal preferences. We divide the interaction sequences into different time scales based on the users’ multi-behavior interaction timestamps. In addition, introduce temporal aware attention to generate temporal embeddings for different time scales and effectively integrate them with the user’s multi-behavior embeddings. Finally, we design collaborative contrastive learning, which collaboratively captures users’ multi-behavior personalized preferences from both temporal and attribute perspectives. This approach alleviates the issue of data sparsity. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the microscopic dynamics of pushing behavior within crowds can offer valuable insights into crowd patterns and interactions. By identifying instances of pushing in crowd videos, a deeper understanding of when, where, and why such behavior occurs can be achieved. This knowledge is crucial to creating more effective crowd management strategies, optimizing crowd flow, and enhancing overall crowd experiences. However, manually identifying pushing behavior at the microscopic level is challenging, and the existing automatic approaches cannot detect such microscopic behavior. Thus, this article introduces a novel automatic framework for identifying pushing in videos of crowds on a microscopic level. The framework comprises two main components: (i) feature extraction and (ii) video detection. In the feature extraction component, a new Voronoi-based method is developed for determining the local regions associated with each person in the input video. Subsequently, these regions are fed into EfficientNetV1B0 Convolutional Neural Network to extract the deep features of each person over time. In the second component, a combination of a fully connected layer with a Sigmoid activation function is employed to analyze these deep features and annotate the individuals involved in pushing within the video. The framework is trained and evaluated on a new dataset created using six real-world experiments, including their corresponding ground truths. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as well as seven baseline methods used for comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning encounters a non-stationary challenge, where agents concurrently update their policies, leading to changes in the environment. Existing approaches have tackled this challenge through communication among agents to obtain their partners’ actions, but this introduces computational complexity known as partner sample complexity. An alternative approach is to develop partner models that generate samples instead of direct communication to mitigate this complexity. However, a discrepancy arises between the real policies distribution and the policy of partner models, termed as model bias, which can significantly impact performance when heavily relying on partner models. In order to achieve a trade-off between sample complexity and performance, a novel multi-agent model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called decentralized adaptive partner modeling (DAPM) is proposed, which utilizes fictitious self play (FSP) to construct partner models and update policies. Model bias is addressed by establishing an upper bound to restrict the usage of partner models. Coupled with that, an adaptive rollout approach is introduced, enabling real agents to dynamically communicate with partner models based on their quality, ensuring that agent performance can progressively improve with partner model samples. The effectiveness of DAPM is exhibited in two multi-agent tasks, showing that DAPM outperforms existing model-free algorithms in terms of partner sample complexity and training stability. Specifically, DAPM requires 28.5% fewer communications compared to the best baseline and exhibits reduced fluctuations in the learning curve, indicating superior performance.},

The presence of constraints complicates the feasible region of the original problem and increases the difficulty of problem solving. There are not only feasible regions, but also large areas of infeasible regions in the objective space of CMOPs. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a bidirectional coevolution method with reverse search (BCRS) combined with a two-stage approach. In the first stage of evolution, constraints are ignored and the population is pushed toward promising regions. In the second stage, evolution is divided into two parts, i.e., the main population evolves toward the constrained Pareto front (CPF) within the feasible region, while the reverse population approaches the CPF from the infeasible region. Then a solution exchange strategy similar to weak cooperation is used between the two populations. The experimental results on benchmark functions and real-world problems show that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior or at least competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It demonstrates BCRS is an effective algorithm for addressing CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {The sparsity problem remains a significant bottleneck for recommendation systems. In recent years, deep matrix factorization has shown promising results in mitigating this issue. Furthermore, many works have improved the prediction accuracy of deep matrix factorization by incorporating the user’s and/or items’ auxiliary information. However, there are still two remaining drawbacks that need to be addressed. First, the initialization of latent feature representations has a substantial impact on the performance of deep matrix factorization, and most current models utilize a uniform approach to this initialization, constraining the model’s optimization potential. Secondly, many existing recommendation models lack versatility and efficiency in transferring auxiliary information from users or items to expand the feature space. This paper proposes a novel model to address the issues mentioned above. By using a semi-autoencoder, the pre-trained initialization of the latent feature representation is realized in this paper. Simultaneously, this model assimilates auxiliary information, like item attributes or rating matrices from diverse domains, to generate their latent feature representations. These representations are then transferred to the target task through subspace projection distance. With this, this model can utilize auxiliary information from various sources more efficiently and this model has better versatility. This is called deep matrix factorization via feature subspace transfer. Numerical experiments on several real-world data show the improvement of this method compared with state-of-the-art methods of introducing auxiliary information about items. Compared with the deep matrix factorization model, the proposed model can achieve 6.5% improvement at most in the mean absolute error and root mean square error.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detectors perform excellently but lack global feature extraction and cannot establish global dependencies between object pixels. Although the Transformer is able to compensate for this, it does not incorporate the advantages of convolution, which results in insufficient information being obtained about the details of local features, as well as slow speed and large computational parameters. In addition, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) lacks information interaction across layers, which can reduce the acquisition of feature context information. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a CNN-based anchor-free object detector that combines transformer global and local feature extraction (GLFT) to enhance the extraction of semantic information from images. First, the segmented channel extraction feature attention (SCEFA) module was designed to improve the extraction of local multiscale channel features from the model and enhance the discrimination of pixels in the object region. Second, the aggregated feature hybrid transformer (AFHTrans) module combined with convolution is designed to enhance the extraction of global and local feature information from the model and to establish the dependency of the pixels of distant objects. This approach compensates for the shortcomings of the FPN by means of multilayer information aggregation transmission. Compared with a transformer, these methods have obvious advantages. Finally, the feature extraction head (FE-Head) was designed to extract full-text information based on the features of different tasks. An accuracy of 47.0% and 82.76% was achieved on the COCO2017 and PASCAL VOC2007 + 2012 datasets, respectively, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method.},

This paper proposes a novel memristive synaptic circuit that is composed of four MOS transistors and one memristor (4T1M). The 4T1M synaptic circuit provides flexible control strategies to change memristance or respond to the input signal. Applying the 4T1M synaptic circuit as the cell of memristive crossbar array, based on the structure and algorithm of the back-propagation (BP) neural network, this paper proposes circuit design of the memristive crossbar-based BP neural network. By reusing the 4T1M memristive crossbar array, the computations in the forward-propagation process and back-propagation process of BP neural network are accomplished on the memristive crossbar-based circuit to accelerate the computing speed. The 4T1M memristive crossbar array can change all the cells’ memristance at a time, accordingly, the memristive crossbar-based BP neural network can realize synchronous memristance adjustment. The proposed memristive crossbar-based BP neural network is then evaluated through experiments involving XOR logic operation, iris classification, and MNIST handwritten digit recognition. The experimental results present fewer iterations or higher classification accuracies.

Based on the temporal correlation of joint current and the correlation between the current and motion state of joint, we use the LSTM and BiLSTM to regressing prediction of the current and state of joint motor first. Then, the Bayesian optimization method is used to adjust the hyperparameters of our network, which realize the analysis of the joint motor current under different motion states and improve the accuracy of the prediction of joint motion states. Finally, we design the joint current acquisition platform of industrial robot based on Hall current sensors, which can collect joint currents without contact and generate experimental dataset. Comparing with the popular intelligent methods, the results show that our Bayesian optimization framework realizes a more accurate prediction of motion state for the four-axis industrial robot on the basis of contact-less current acquisition.},

Forward and reverse distillation are the main ways to achieve anomaly detection. To design an effective model and aggregate detection results, we propose a dual-student knowledge distillation (DSKD) based on forward and reverse distillation. Taking advantage of the priority of reverse distillation to obtain high-level representation, we combine a skip connection and an attention module to build a reverse distillation student network that simultaneously focuses on high-level representation and low-level features. DSKD uses a forward distillation network as an auxiliary to allow the student network to preferentially obtain the query image. For different anomaly score maps obtained by the dual-student network, we use synthetic noise enhancement in combination with image segmentation loss to adaptively learn the weight scores of individual maps. Empirical experiments conducted on the MVTec dataset show that the proposed DSKD method achieves good performance on texture images as well as competitive results on object images compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Malaria is a potentially fatal plasmodium parasite injected by female anopheles mosquitoes that infect red blood cells and cause millions of lifelong disability worldwide yearly. However, specialists’ manual screening in clinical practice is laborious and prone to error. Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL) framework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the ensemble ML classifiers, is developed to screen malaria parasite images. The proposed Boosted-BR-STM is based on a new dilated-convolutional block-based Split Transform Merge (STM) and feature-map Squeezing–Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and boundary operations to learn the malaria parasite’s homogeneity, heterogeneity, and boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are attained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks at the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and texture variation of the parasitic pattern. Additionally, to enhance the learning capacity of Boosted-BR-STM and foster a more diverse representation of features, boosting at the final stage is achieved through TL by utilizing multipath residual learning. The proposed DBEL framework implicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides the generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the ensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination ability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature spaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML classifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms the existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using discrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework achieved Accuracy (98.50%), Sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC (0.9960), which suggests it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening.},

  abstract     = {The significance of facial anti-spoofing algorithms in enhancing the security of facial recognition systems cannot be overstated. Current approaches aim to compensate for the model’s shortcomings in capturing spatial information by leveraging spatio-temporal information from multiple frames. However, the additional branches to extract inter-frame details increases the model’s parameter count and computational workload, leading to a decrease in inference efficiency. To address this, we have developed a robust and easily deployable facial anti-spoofing algorithm. In this paper, we propose Central Difference Convolution UNet++ (UCDCN), which takes advantage of central difference convolution and improves the characterization ability of invariant details in diverse environments. Particularly, we leverage domain knowledge from image segmentation and propose a multi-level feature fusion network structure to enhance the model’s ability to capture semantic information which is beneficial for face anti-spoofing tasks. In this manner, UCDCN greatly reduces the number of model parameters as well as achieves satisfactory metrics on three popular benchmarks, i.e., Replay-Attack, Oulu-NPU and SiW.},

  abstract     = {Price prediction remains a crucial aspect of financial market research as it forms the basis for various trading strategies and portfolio management techniques. However, traditional models such as ARIMA are not effective for multi-horizon forecasting, and current deep learning approaches do not take into account the conditional heteroscedasticity of financial market time series. In this work, we introduce the similarity embedded temporal Transformer (SeTT) algorithms, which extend the state-of-the-art temporal Transformer architecture. These algorithms utilise historical trends in financial time series, as well as statistical principles, to enhance forecasting performance. We conducted a thorough analysis of various hyperparameters including learning rate, local window size, and the choice of similarity function in this extension of the study in a bid to get optimal model performance. We also experimented over an extended timeframe, which allowed us to more accurately assess the performance of the models in different market conditions and across different lengths of time. Overall, our results show that SeTT provides improved performance for financial market prediction, as it outperforms both classical financial models and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, across volatile and non-volatile extrapolation periods, with varying effects of historical volatility on the extrapolation. Despite the availability of a substantial amount of data spanning up to 13 years, optimal results were primarily attained through a historical window of 1–3 years for the extrapolation period under examination.},

  abstract     = {Mitigating the impact of class imbalance datasets on classifiers poses a challenge to the machine learning community. Conventional classifiers do not perform well as they are habitually biased toward the majority class. Among existing solutions, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) has shown great potential, aiming to improve the dataset rather than the classifier. However, SMOTE still needs improvement because of its equal oversampling to each minority instance. Based on the consensus that instances far from the borderline contribute less to classification, a refined method for oversampling borderline minority instances (OBMI) is proposed in this paper using a two-stage Tomek link-finding procedure. In the oversampling stage, the pairs of between-class instances nearest to each other are first found to form Tomek links. Then, these minority instances in Tomek links are extracted as base instances. Finally, new minority instances are generated, each of which is linearly interpolated between a base instance and one minority neighbor of the base instance. To address the overlap caused by oversampling, in the cleaning stage, Tomek links are employed again to remove the borderline instances from both classes. The OBMI is compared with ten baseline methods on 17 benchmark datasets. The results show that it performs better on most of the selected datasets in terms of the F1-score and G-mean. Statistical analysis also indicates its higher-level Friedman ranking.},

  abstract     = {Myocardial infarction (MI) poses a significant clinical challenge, necessitating expeditious and precise detection to mitigate potentially fatal outcomes. Current MI diagnosis predominantly relies on electrocardiography (ECG); however, it is fraught with limitations, including inter-observer variability and a reliance on expert interpretation. This study introduces an automated MI detection framework that capitalizes on hybrid signal processing methodologies and deterministic learning theory. The initial step involves the extraction of the Shannon energy envelope (SEE) and its derivative from a single-lead ECG. Integration of the SEE into the ECG’s phase portrait provides a means to capture the underlying nonlinear system dynamics. Subsequently, the application of fast and adaptive multivariate empirical mode decomposition (FA-MVEMD) yields discriminative features originating from the most energetically dominant intrinsic mode components (IMFs) within the SEE. Profound dissimilarities are discernible between ECG signals recorded from healthy subjects and those afflicted with MI. In the subsequent phase, deterministic learning theory, implemented through neural networks, is employed to facilitate the classification of ECG signals into two distinct groups. The method’s efficacy is meticulously evaluated using the PTB diagnostic ECG database, resulting in a noteworthy average classification accuracy of 99.21 $$\%$$ within a tenfold cross-validation framework. In summation, the findings affirm that the proposed features not only complement conventional ECG attributes but also align closely with the underlying dynamics of the ECG system, ultimately fortifying the automatic detection of MI. The imperative requirement for early and accurate MI diagnosis is addressed through our approach, offering a robust and dependable means to fulfill this pivotal clinical need.},

  abstract     = {Recently, advanced AI systems equipped with sophisticated learning algorithms have emerged, enabling the processing of extensive streaming data for online decision-making in diverse domains. However, the widespread deployment of these systems has prompted concerns regarding potential ethical issues, particularly the risk of discrimination that can adversely impact certain community groups. This issue has been proven to be challenging to address in the context of streaming data, where data distribution can change over time, including changes in the level of discrimination within the data. In addition, transparent models like decision trees are favoured in such applications because they illustrate the decision-making process. However, it is essential to keep the models compact because the explainability of large models can diminish. Existing methods usually mitigate discrimination at the cost of accuracy. Accuracy and discrimination, therefore, can be considered conflicting objectives. Current methods are still limited in controlling the trade-off between these conflicting objectives. This paper proposes a method that can incrementally learn classification models from streaming data and automatically adjust the learnt models to balance multi-objectives simultaneously. The novelty of this research is to propose a multi-objective algorithm to maximise accuracy, minimise discrimination and model size simultaneously based on swarm intelligence. Experimental results using six real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can evolve fairer and simpler classifiers while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods tailored for streaming data.},

In this paper, a novel hybrid regularization method for image restoration is proposed, which adopts both internal and external image priors into a unified framework. Specifically, a new hybrid regularization model is designed. The TV model and a deep image denoiser are inserted into the restoration model using the plug-and-play framework, protecting image details while implicitly using external information for deep denoising. Moreover, in order to make the proposed hybrid regularization operable, an adaptive parameter method is proposed to adaptively balance the TV model and learned model in iteration.

This framework takes into account the way information spreads among different entities. The proposed method involves multi-layer relations and temporal information within a sequence of social media network snapshots. It learns the temporal representations of target entities in each snapshot and predicts how the popularity of a particular entity will change in future snapshots. The proposed method is evaluated with real-world data across four popularity trend prediction tasks.

To compensate for this deficiency, we propose a new community detection method based on multi-constraint non-negative matrix factorization, named orthogonal regular sparse constraint non-negative matrix factorization (ORSNMF). Based on the network topology, the ORSNMF algorithm models the differences of the outside of the community, the similarities of the nodes inside the community, and the sparseness of the community membership matrices at the same time, which together guides the iterative learning process to better reflect the underlying information and inherent attributes of the community structure in order to improve the correct rate of dividing subgroups. An algorithm with convergence guarantee is also proposed to solve the model, and finally a large number of comparative experiments are conducted, and the results show that the algorithm has good results.},

The short-term prediction of URT OD flow has three special characteristics: data lag, data dimensionality, and data malconformation, distinguishing it from other short-term prediction tasks. It is essential to propose a novel prediction algorithm that considers the special characteristics of the URT OD flow. For this purpose, based on deep learning methods and multi-source big data, a modified spatial–temporal long short-term memory (ST-LSTM) model is established. The proposed model comprises four components: (1) a temporal feature extraction module is devised to extract time information within network-wide historical OD data; (2) a spatial correlation learning module is introduced to address the data malconformation and data dimensionality problems, which provides an interpretable spatial correlation quantization method; (3) an input control-gated mechanism is originally proposed to solve the data lag problem, which combines the processed available OD flow and real-time inflow/outflow; (4) a fusion module combines historical spatial–temporal features with real-time information to achieve accurate OD flow prediction. We also further discuss the interpretability of the model in detail. The ST-LSTM model is evaluated by sufficient experiments on two large-scale actual subway datasets from Nanjing and Beijing, and the experimental results demonstrate that it can better learn the spatial–temporal correlations and exceed the rest benchmarking methods.},

First, the pose features are extracted from the input skeleton joint point data, which used to construct the pose feature vector of each frame in time sequence; then, the inflection point frames in the sequence are determined according to the flow of momentum of each body part.

  abstract     = {The flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with parallel batch processing machine (PBM) is one of those long-standing issues that needs cutting-edge approaches. It is a recent extension of standard flexible job shop scheduling problems. Despite their wide application and prevalence in practical production, it seems that current research on these types of combinatorial optimization problems remains limited and uninvestigated. More specifically, existing research mainly concentrates on the flow shop scenarios in parallel batch machines for job shop scheduling but few literature emphasis on the flexible job shop integration in these contexts. To directly address the above mentioned problems, this paper establishes an optimization model considering parallel batch processing machines, aiming to minimize the maximum completion time in operating and production environments. The proposed solution merges variable neighborhood search with multi-population genetic algorithms, conducting a neighborhood search on the elite population to reduce the likelihood of falling into local optima. Subsequently, its applicability was evaluated in computational experiments using real production scenarios from a partnering enterprise and extended datasets. The findings from the analyses indicate that the enhanced algorithm can decrease the objective value by as much as 15% compared to other standard algorithms. Importantly, the proposed approach effectively resolves flexible job shop scheduling problems involving parallel batch processing machines.

  abstract     = {To improve cargo loading efficiency and achieve diverse needs of companies for the loading process, this paper innovatively establishes a multiple objective mixed integer programming model for the three-dimensional multiple bin-size bin packing problem (3D-MBSBPP). The model is designed to maximize container space utilization rate and cargo load balance, minimize container usage costs, and incorporates some practical constraints. On this basis, we propose a novel dynamic feedback algorithm based on spatial corner fitness (SCF_DFA) to solve this model, which consists of three stages. Specifically, Stage 1 employs a heuristic algorithm based on spatial corner fitness to optimize the search of the remaining spaces. Stage 2 employs a container type selection algorithm to dynamically adjust and optimize container types. Stage 3 uses an improved genetic algorithm to improve the quality of the solutions of the first two stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through comparative experiments on benchmark instances, and apply it to solve the real-life instances for the 3D-MBSBPP. The results show that the proposed algorithm can make the average container space utilization rate reach 85.38%, which is 1.48% higher than that of baseline method, while the loading results obtained are more balanced, indicating the advantages of the SCF_DFA in solving 3D-MBSBPP. Furthermore, we conduct ablation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of each component within the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) methods aim to improve the accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when the training set contains samples with noisy or incorrect labels, and have become popular in recent years. Existing popular LNL methods frequently regard samples with high learning difficulty (high-loss and low prediction probability) as noisy samples; however, irregular feature patterns from hard clean samples can also cause high learning difficulty, which can lead to the misclassification of hard clean samples as noisy samples. To address this insufficiency, we propose the Samples’ Learning Risk-based Learning with Noisy Labels (SLRLNL) method. Specifically, we propose to separate noisy samples from hard clean samples using samples’ learning risk, which represents samples’ influence on DNN’s accuracy . We show that samples’ learning risk is comprehensively determined by samples’ learning difficulty as well as samples’ feature similarity to other samples, and thus, compared to existing LNL methods that solely rely on the learning difficulty, our method can better separate hard clean samples from noisy samples, since the former frequently possess irregular feature patterns. Moreover, to extract more useful information from samples with irregular feature patterns (i.e., hard samples), we further propose the Relabeling-based Label Augmentation (RLA) process to prevent the memorization of hard noisy samples and better learn the hard clean samples, thus enhancing the learning for hard samples. Empirical studies show that samples’ learning risk can identify noisy samples more accurately, and the RLA process can enhance the learning for hard samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare it with popular existing LNL methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Animal-10N, Clothing1M, and Docred. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms other existing methods. The source code for SLRLNL can be found at https://github.com/yangbo1973/SLRLNL .},

Low illumination in the coal mine underground leads to difficult recognition of monitoring images and poor personnel detection accuracy. To alleviate this problem, a low illuminance image enhancement method proposed for personnel safety monitoring in underground coal mines. Specifically, the local enhancement module maps low illumination to normal illumination at pixel level preserving image details as much as possible. The transformer-based global adjustment module is applied to the locally enhanced images to avoid over-enhancement of bright areas and under-illumination of dark areas, and to prevent possible color deviations in the enhancement process. In addition, a feature similarity loss is proposed to constrain the similarity of target features to avoid the possible detrimental effect of enhancement on detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy by 7.1% on the coal mine underground personal dataset, obtaining the highest accuracy compared to several other methods. The proposed method effectively improves the visualization and detection performance of low-light images, which contributes to the personnel safety monitoring in underground coal mines.},

  abstract     = {Detecting text within medical images presents a formidable challenge in the domain of computer vision due to the intricate nature of textual backgrounds, the dense text concentration, and the possible existence of extreme aspect ratios. This paper introduces an effective and precise text detection system tailored to address these challenges. The system incorporates an optimized segmentation module, a trainable post-processing method, and leverages a vision-language pre-training model (oCLIP). Specifically, our segmentation head integrates three essential components: the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) module, which combines a residual structure and channel attention mechanism; the Efficient Feature Enhancement Module (EFEM); and the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with RSEConv (MSFM-RSE), designed specifically for multi-scale feature fusion based on RSEConv. By introducing a residual structure and channel attention mechanism into the FPN module, the convolutional layers are replaced with RSEConv layers that employ a channel attention mechanism, further augmenting the representational capacity of the feature maps. The EFEM, designed as a cascaded U-shaped module, incorporates a spatial attention mechanism to introduce multi-level information, thereby enhancing segmentation performance. Subsequently, the MSFM-RSE adeptly amalgamates features from various depths and scales of the EFEM to generate comprehensive final features tailored for segmentation purposes. Additionally, a post-processing module employs a differentiable binarization strategy, allowing the segmentation network to dynamically determine the binarization threshold. Building on the system’s improvement, we introduce a vision-language pre-training model that undergoes extensive training on various visual language understanding tasks. This pre-trained model acquires detailed visual and semantic representations, further reinforcing both the accuracy and robustness in text detection when integrated with the segmentation module. The performance of our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on medical text image datasets, demonstrating excellent results. Multiple benchmark experiments validate its superior performance in comparison to existing methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/csworkcode/VLDBNet .},

  abstract     = {Background noises are usually treated as redundant or even harmful to voice conversion. Therefore, when converting noisy speech, a pretrained module of speech separation is usually deployed to estimate clean speech prior to the conversion. However, this can lead to speech distortion due to the mismatch between the separation module and the conversion one. In this paper, a noise-robust voice conversion model is proposed, where a user can choose to retain or to remove the background sounds freely. Firstly, a speech separation module with a dual-decoder structure is proposed, where two decoders decode the denoised speech and the background sounds, respectively. A bridge module is used to capture the interactions between the denoised speech and the background sounds in parallel layers through information exchanging. Subsequently, a voice conversion module with multiple encoders to convert the estimated clean speech from the speech separation model. Finally, the speech separation and voice conversion module are jointly trained using a loss function combining cycle loss and mutual information loss, aiming to improve the decoupling efficacy among speech contents, pitch, and speaker identity. Experimental results show that the proposed model obtains significant improvements in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics compared with the existing baselines. The speech naturalness and speaker similarity of the converted speech are 3.47 and 3.43, respectively.},

As coding tasks become increasingly complex, code assistant plays a pivotal role in enhancing developer productivity, reducing errors, and facilitating a more efficient coding workflow. This assistance can manifest in various forms, including code autocompletion, error detection and correction, code generation, documentation support, and context-aware suggestions. Language models have emerged as integral components of code assistance, offering developers the capability to receive intelligent suggestions, generate code snippets, and enhance overall coding proficiency. In this paper, we propose new hybrid models for code generation by leveraging pre-trained language models BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and LUKE with the Marian Causal Language Model. Selecting these models based on their strong performance in various natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the performance of these models on two datasets CoNaLa and DJANGO and compare them to existing state-of-the-art models.

Additionally, conducting error analysis and refining the generated code. Our results show that these models, when combined with the Marian Decoder, significantly improve code generation accuracy and efficiency. Notably, the RoBERTaMarian model achieved a maximum BLEU score of 35.74 and an exact match accuracy of 13.8% on CoNaLa, while LUKE-Marian attained a BLEU score of 89.34 and an exact match accuracy of 78.50% on DJANGO.

  abstract     = {The detection of tiny defects in industrial products is important for improving the quality of industrial products and maintaining production safety. Currently, image-based defect detection methods are ineffective in detecting tiny and variously shaped defects. Therefore, this paper proposes a tiny defect detection network (TD-Net) for industrial products to improve the effectiveness of tiny defect detection. TD-Net improves the overall defect detection effect, especially the detection effect of tiny defects, by solving the problems of downsampling of tiny defects, pre-filtering of conflicting deep and shallow semantic information, and cascading fusion of multi-scale information. Specifically, this paper proposes the Defect Downsampling (DD) module to realize the defect information supplementation during the backbone downsampling process and improve the problem that the stepwise convolution easily misses the detection of tiny defects. Meanwhile, the Semantic Information Interaction Module (SIIM) is proposed, which fuses deep and shallow semantic features, and is designed to interact the fused features with shallow features to optimize the detection of tiny defects. Finally, the Scale Information Fusion Module (SIFM) is proposed to improve the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) for cascading fusion and information focus on different scale information, which enables further improvement of defect detection performance of TD-Net. Extensive experimental results on the NEU–DET data set (76.8 $$\%$$ mAP), the Peking University PCB defect data set (96.2 $$\%$$ mAP) and the GC10-DET data set (71.5 $$\%$$ mAP) show that the proposed TD-Net achieves competitive results compared with SOTA methods with the equivalent parameter quantity.},

  abstract     = {Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks is a common problem, in which neural networks lose information from previous tasks after training on new tasks. Although adopting a regularization method that preferentially retains the parameters important to the previous task to avoid catastrophic forgetting has a positive effect; existing regularization methods cause the gradient to be near zero because the loss is at the local minimum. To solve this problem, we propose a new continuous learning method with Bayesian parameter updating and weight memory (CL-BPUWM). First, a parameter updating method based on the Bayes criterion is proposed to allow the neural network to gradually obtain new knowledge. The diagonal of the Fisher information matrix is then introduced to significantly minimize computation and increase parameter updating efficiency. Second, we suggest calculating the importance weight by observing how changes in each network parameter affect the model prediction output. In the process of model parameter updating, the Fisher information matrix and the sensitivity of the network are used as the quadratic penalty terms of the loss function. Finally, we apply dropout regularization to reduce model overfitting during training and to improve model generalizability. CL-BPUWM performs very well in continuous learning for classification tasks on CIFAR-100 dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, and MNIST dataset. On CIFAR-100 dataset, it is 0.8%, 1.03% and 0.75% higher than the best performing regularization method (EWC) in three task partitions. On CIFAR-10 dataset, it is 2.25% higher than the regularization method (EWC) and 0.7% higher than the scaled method (GR). It is 0.66% higher than the regularization method (EWC) on the MNIST dataset. When the CL-BPUWM method was combined with the brain-inspired replay model under the CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 datasets, the classification accuracy was 2.35% and 5.38% higher than that of the baseline method, BI-R + SI.},

  abstract     = {Since the traditional ship stability failure probability assessment method has many input parameters and cumbersome intermediate calculation process, this paper proposes a joint multi-model machine learning prediction method based on confidence. The method calculates the confidence of each machine learning model for the current prediction result, selects the top n models among them, and takes the average of their prediction results as the output. The confidence is calculated by a method inspired by semi-supervised learning. To reduce the number of ship features that need to be input for assessment, a sensitivity analysis is used to reject irrelevant features. Eight machine learning models that have good performance and are widely used in other fields, including Radial Basis Function Neural Network, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and so on, are used as component learners in this study. The hyperparameters of each model are obtained by cross-validation and grid search. The advancedness of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with other models on a small self-built ship stability failure probability dataset. By conducting experiments that simply average the results of the component learners, it is confirmed that simple superposition different models does not necessarily improve the accuracy. At the same time, after pre-processing the input features in different ways, the comparison of the prediction performance was conducted, and the experimental results showed that the proposed method is not affected by the way the input features are preprocessed and therefore has some robustness.},

Moreover, Hamacher interaction aggregation operators are the combination of two major operators, called Hamacher aggregation operators and interaction aggregation operators, and they are used to aggregate the collection of information into one value. In this manuscript, we present the concept of Hamacher interaction operational laws for CIF sets (CIFSs). Further, we develop the CIF Hamacher interaction weighted averaging (CIFHIWA) operator, CIF Hamacher interaction ordered weighted averaging (CIFHIOWA) operator, CIF Hamacher interaction weighted geometric (CIFHIWG) operator, and CIF Hamacher interaction ordered weighted geometric (CIFHIOWG) operator. For these operators, we also discuss some basic properties, such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Additionally, we develop a MADM method based on the developed operators and apply it to solve the green supply chain management problems, which can implement environmentally friendly practices to minimize carbon emissions, resource consumption, and waste generation while promoting long-term sustainability. Finally, we verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method based on a comparative analysis between the proposed techniques and existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The existing image semantic segmentation models have low accuracy in detecting tiny targets or multi-targets at overlapping regions. This work proposes a hybrid vision transformer with unified-perceptual-parsing network (ViT-UperNet) for medical image segmentation. A self-attention mechanism is embedded in a vision transformer to extract multi-level features. The image features are extracted hierarchically from low to high dimensions using 4 groups of Transformer blocks with different numbers. Then, it uses a unified-perceptual-parsing network based on a feature pyramid network (FPN) and a pyramid pooling module (PPM) for the fusion of multi-scale contextual features and semantic segmentation. FPN can naturally use hierarchical features, and generate strong semantic information on all scales. PPM can better use the global prior knowledge to understand complex scenes, and extract features with global context information to improve segmentation results. In the training process, a scalable self-supervised learner named masked autoencoder is used for pre-training, which strengthens the visual representation ability and improves the efficiency of the feature learning. Experiments are conducted on cardiac magnetic resonance image segmentation where the left and right atrium and ventricle are selected for segmentation. The pixels accuracy is 93.85%, the Dice coefficient is 92.61% and Hausdorff distance is 11.16, which are improved compared with the other methods. The results show the superiority of Vit-UperNet in medical images segmentation, especially for the low-recognition and serious-occlusion targets.},

To meet a user’s complex requirement, we should compose multiple IoT devices (IoT services) to provide comprehensive services to the user. However, these services usually coexist, which is likely to lead to conflicts. Moreover, each user may have different kinds of needs. Suppose that in a smart home there are more than one person, a conflict may occur when they request the same service in this environment. Actually, even though they request different IoT services, among which if there exists function impact or QoS impact, a conflict could still occur. In this paper, we propose to employ high-level Petri nets to detect conflicts among IoT services. We first model the formal methods for conflict policies. Then, we present a Petri nets-based mechanism for modeling and detecting conflicts. Finally, we expand the previous model and use high-level Petri nets for handling fuzzy IoT conflict policies modeling and reasoning.

  abstract     = {Network embedding is a technique used to generate low-dimensional vectors representing each node in a network while maintaining the original topology and properties of the network. This technology enables a wide range of learning tasks, including node classification and link prediction. However, the current landscape of network embedding approaches predominantly revolves around static networks, neglecting the dynamic nature that characterizes real social networks. Dynamics at both the micro- and macrolevels are fundamental drivers of network evolution. Microlevel dynamics provide a detailed account of the network topology formation process, while macrolevel dynamics reveal the evolutionary trends of the network. Despite recent dynamic network embedding efforts, a few approaches accurately capture the evolution patterns of nodes at the microlevel or effectively preserve the crucial dynamics of both layers. Our study introduces a novel method for embedding networks, i.e., bilayer evolutionary pattern-preserving embedding for dynamic networks (Bi-DNE), that preserves the evolutionary patterns at both the micro- and macrolevels. The model utilizes strengthened triadic closure to represent the network structure formation process at the microlevel, while a dynamic equation constrains the network structure to adhere to the densification power-law evolution pattern at the macrolevel. The proposed Bi-DNE model exhibits significant performance improvements across a range of tasks, including link prediction, reconstruction, and temporal link analysis. These improvements are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments carried out on both simulated and real-world dynamic network datasets. The consistently superior results to those of the state-of-the-art methods provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of Bi-DNE in capturing complex evolutionary patterns and learning high-quality node representations. These findings validate the methodological innovations presented in this work and mark valuable progress in the emerging field of dynamic network representation learning. Further exploration demonstrates that Bi-DNE is sensitive to the analysis task parameters, leading to a more accurate representation of the natural evolution process during dynamic network embedding.},

  abstract     = {Flying Ad hoc Networks have emerged as a promising technology for number of real-time applications. However, the flexible and unstructured characteristics of these networks make them vulnerable to security threats posed by malicious nodes, such as denial of service attacks, node impersonation, and information breaches. Another major issue is the consideration of those nodes being unable to prove their trustworthiness due to factors like hardware or software failure, or by link interruptions, during the processing of detection of false nodes in the network. The existing mechanisms encompassing encryption, authentication, and intrusion detection highlight limitations to secure real-time applications and services due to the high speed of flying nodes and the absence of fixed network structures. To overcome these constraints, this research paper incorporates a novel framework for evaluating and improving the security of network by introducing an innovative cluster-based approach. Moreover, it presents a fuzzy model that dynamically estimates the trust levels of both individual nodes and clusters, by assigning weight to the parameters to address vulnerabilities. Additionally, a trust reconfiguration mechanism is further proposed to address the issue of nodes unable to substantiate their trust by providing them with additional chances based on the collective trust from previous evaluations. Further, the paper incorporates a dynamic reputation system to proficiently identify and separate malicious and selfish nodes from the network. Simulation results indicate a significant improvement in performance metrics, with a considerable reduction in delay and drop ratio by 41.46% and 36.37%, respectively, while the sufficient rise of 54.71% and 46.05% in throughput and coverage, respectively, comparing with the considered state-of-art.},

This paper presents a Multi-agent Region Protection Environment (MRPE) featuring fewer defenders, defender damages, and intruder evasion strategies targeting defenders. MRPE poses challenges for traditional protection methods due to its high nonstationarity and limited interception time window. To surmount these hurdles, we modify evolutionary reinforcement learning, giving rise to the corresponding multi-agent region protection method (MRPM). MRPM amalgamates the merits of evolutionary algorithms and deep reinforcement learning, specifically leveraging Differential Evolution (DE) and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). DE facilitates diverse sample exploration and overcomes sparse rewards, while MADDPG trains defenders and expedites the DE convergence process. Additionally, an elite selection strategy tailored for multi-agent systems is devised to enhance defender collaboration. The paper also presents ingenious designs for the fitness and reward functions to effectively drive policy optimizations.

To meet this challenge, this work develops an adaptive normal reference vector-based decomposition strategy for guiding the search process, which is able to handle various convexity and shapes of Pareto fronts. Specifically, the normal vector passing through the center of each cluster in a constructed hyperplane is adopted as the reference vector for guiding the search process. Then, a selection strategy is put forward based on the positions of solutions in the current population and the normal vectors for the environmental selection. Based on the adaptive normal vectors, the proposed algorithm can not only rapidly adapt to the changing population but also alleviate the influence of the convexity of Pareto fronts on the measurement of diversity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs consistently well on various types of multi-/many-objective problems having regular or irregular Pareto fronts. In addition, the proposed algorithm is shown to perform well in the optimization of the polyester fiber esterification process.},

This paper proposes a Temporal-aware Attention Network (TAN) that localizes context-rich proposals by enhancing the temporal representations of boundaries and proposals. Firstly, we pinpoint that obtaining precise location information of action instances needs to consider long-distance temporal contexts. To this end, we propose a Global-Aware Attention (GAA) module for boundary-level interaction. Specifically, we introduce two novel gating mechanisms into the top-down interaction structure to incorporate multi-level semantics into video features effectively. Secondly, we design an efficient task-specific Adaptive Temporal Interaction (ATI) module to learn proposal associations. TAN enhances proposal-level contextual representations in a wide range by utilizing multi-scale interaction modules. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, e.g., TAN achieves 73.43% in AR@1000 on THUMOS-14 and 69.01% in AUC on ActivityNet-1.3. Moreover, TAN significantly improves temporal action detection performance when equipped with existing action classification frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning has gained significant attention due to its groundbreaking ability to enable distributed learning while maintaining privacy constraints. However, as a consequence of data heterogeneity among decentralized devices, it inherently experiences significant learning degradation and slow convergence speed. Therefore, it is natural to employ the concept of clustering homogeneous clients into the same group, allowing only the model weights within each group to be aggregated. While most existing clustered federated learning methods employ either model gradients or inference outputs as metrics for client partitioning to group similar devices together, heterogeneity may still exist within each cluster. Moreover, there is a scarcity of research exploring the underlying reasons for determining the appropriate timing for clustering, resulting in the common practice of assigning each client to its own individual cluster, particularly in the context of highly non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage decoupling federated learning algorithm with adaptive personalization layers named FedTSDP, where client clustering is performed twice according to inference outputs and model weights, respectively. Hopkins amended sampling is adopted to determine the appropriate timing for clustering and the sampling weight of public unlabeled data. In addition, a simple yet effective approach is developed to adaptively adjust the personalization layers based on varying degrees of data skew. Experimental results show that our proposed method has reliable performance on both IID and non-IID scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the field of expensive optimization, numerous papers have proposed surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) for a few thousand or even hundreds of function evaluations. However, in reality, low-cost simulations suffice for a lot of real-world problems, in which the number of function evaluations is moderately restricted, e.g., to several thousands. In such moderately restricted scenario, SAEAs become unnecessarily time-consuming and tend to struggle with premature convergence. In addition, tuning the SAEA parameters becomes impractical under the restricted budgets of function evaluations—in some cases, inadequate configuration may degrade performance instead. In this context, this paper presents a fast and auto-tunable evolutionary algorithm for solving moderately restricted expensive optimization problems. The presented algorithm is a variant of adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithms, and is called emulation-based adaptive DE or EBADE. The primary aim of EBADE is to emulate the principle of sample-efficient optimization, such as that in SAEAs, by adaptively tuning the DE parameter configurations. Specifically, similar to Expected Improvement-based sampling, EBADE identifies parameter configurations that may produce expected-to-improve solutions, without using function evaluations. Further, EBADE incepts a multi-population mechanism and assigns a parameter configuration to each subpopulation to estimate the effectiveness of parameter configurations with multiple samples carefully. This subpopulation-based adaptation can help improve the selection accuracy of promising parameter configurations, even when using an expected-to-improve indicator with high uncertainty, by validating with respect to multiple samples. The experimental results demonstrate that EBADE outperforms modern adaptive DEs and is highly competitive compared to SAEAs with a much shorter runtime.},

Correlation operations play an important role in visual tracking. However, the correlation operation reserves a large amount of unfavorable background information. In this paper, we propose an effective feature recognizer including channel and spatial attention modules to focus on important object feature information. Thus, the representation power of the feature extraction network is improved. Further, we design a multi-scale feature fusion network. The fusion network performs feature fusion on template feature and encoded feature branches to establish connections between features at different scales. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed tracker outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers. In particular, the proposed tracker achieves an 80.4% AUC on TrackingNet and a 68.4% AUC on GOT-10k while running at a real-time speed.},

When applied to relevant benchmark datasets, the selected rules achieve low errors, with the best rules being among the top 5% of the overall rule space.

This study aims to realize a lightweight and personalized model through pruning and masking with insufficient resources and heterogeneous data. Particularly, the server first downloads the subnetwork to the client according to the mask, and client prunes the subnetwork with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), so as to remove the unimportant parameters and reduce the cost of training and communication. At the same time, mask is used to mark the pruning condition of the model. Then, the unpruned parts and masks of local models are transmitted to the server for aggregation. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed model was improved by 9.36%, and the communication cost was reduced by 1.45 times compared with state-of-the-art models.

We present a novel model for predicting academic performance in this paper. This model harnesses the power of dual graph neural networks to effectively utilize both the structural information derived from interaction activities and the attribute feature spaces of students. The proposed model uses an interaction-based graph neural network module to learn local academic performance representations from online interaction activities and an attribute-based graph neural network to learn global academic performance representations from attribute features of all students using dynamic graph convolution operations. The learned representations from local and global levels are combined in a local-to-global representation learning module to generate predicted academic performances. The empirical study results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 83.96% for predicting students who pass or fail and an accuracy of 90.18% for predicting students who pass or withdraw on a widely recognized public dataset. The ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has shown promising prospects in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Meanwhile, as an essential aspect of AIGC, image to captions has received much more attention. Recent vision-language research is developing from the bulky region visual representations based on object detectors toward more convenient and flexible grid ones. However, this kind of research typically concentrates on image understanding tasks like image classification, with less attention paid to content generation tasks. In this paper, we explore how to capitalize on the expressive features embedded in the grid visual representations for better image captioning. To this end, we present a Transformer-based image captioning model, dubbed FeiM, with two straightforward yet effective designs. We first design the feature queries that consist of a limited set of learnable vectors, which act as the local signals to capture specific visual information from global grid features. Then, taking augmented global grid features and the local feature queries as inputs, we develop a feature interaction module to query relevant visual concepts from grid features, and to enable interaction between the local signal and overall context. Finally, the refined grid visual representations and the linguistic features pass through a Transformer architecture for multi-modal fusion. With the two novel and simple designs, FeiM can fully leverage meaningful visual knowledge to improve image captioning performance. Extensive experiments are performed on the competitive MSCOCO benchmark to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the results show that FeiM yields more eminent results than existing advanced captioning models.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in imaging technologies have led to a significant increase in the adoption of stereoscopic images. However, despite this proliferation, in-depth research into the complex analysis of the visual content of these stereoscopic images is still relatively rare. The advent of stereoscopic imaging has brought a new dimension to visual content. These images offer a higher level of visual detail, making them increasingly common in a variety of fields, including medicine and industrial applications. However, exploiting the full potential of stereoscopic images requires a deeper understanding. By exploiting the capabilities of octonion moments and the power of artificial intelligence, we aim to break new ground by introducing a novel method for classifying stereoscopic images. The proposed method is divided into two key stages: The first stage involves data preprocessing, during which we strive to construct a balanced database divided into three distinct categories. In addition, we extract the stable Octonion Krawtchouk moments (SOKM) for each image, leading to a database of moment images with dimensions of 128 × 128 × 1. In the second step, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using this database, with the aim of discriminating between different categories. Standard measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves are used to assess the effectiveness of our method. These measures provide a quantitative assessment of the performance of our object classification approach for stereoscopic images.},

Our primary objectives are to minimize the maximum finish time and total energy consumption. To accomplish this, we introduce a learning-based cooperative and competitive multi-objective optimization method, which we refer to as LCCMO. We begin by presenting a multi-rule cooperative initialization approach to create a population that combines strong convergence and diversity. This diverse population forms the foundation for our optimization process. Next, we develop a multi-level cooperative global search strategy that explores effective genes within solutions from different angles and sub-problems. This approach enhances our search for optimal solutions. Moreover, we design a competition and cooperation strategy for different populations to expedite convergence. This strategy encourages the exchange of information and ideas among diverse populations, thereby accelerating our progress. We also introduce a multi-operator cooperative local search technique, which investigates elite solutions from various directions, leading to improved convergence and diversity. In addition, we integrate Q-learning into our competitive swarm optimizer to explore different regions of the objective space, enhancing the diversity of the elite archive. Q-learning guides the selection of operators within the small-size population, contributing to more efficient optimization. To evaluate the effectiveness of LCCMO, we conduct numerical experiments on 20 instances. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that LCCMO outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms. This underscores the potential of our learning and knowledge-driven evolutionary framework in enhancing performance and autonomy when it comes to solving EADHWS.},

However, its direct conversion to a scene image is difficult due to the nonlinear characteristics of its distribution. Therefore, the use of artificial neural network to reconstruct the scene from retinal spikes has become an important research area. This paper proposes the architecture of a neural network based on vector quantization, where the feature vectors of spike trains are extracted, compressed, and stored using a feature extraction and compression network. During the decoding process, the nearest neighbour search method is used to find the nearest feature vector corresponding to each feature vector in the feature map. Finally, a reconstruction network is used to decode a new feature map composed of matching feature vectors to obtain a visual scene. This paper also verifies the impact of vector quantization on the characteristics of pulse signals by comparing experiments and visualizing the characteristics before and after vector quantization. The network delivers promising performance when evaluated on different datasets, demonstrating that this research is of great significance for improving relevant applications in the fields of retinal image processing and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Extractive approaches have been the mainstream paradigm for identifying overlapping entity–relation extraction. However, limited by their inherently methodological flaws, which hardly deal with three issues: hierarchical dependent entity–relations, implicit entity–relations, and entity normalization. Recent advances have proposed an effective solution based on generative language models, which cast entity–relation extraction as a sequence-to-sequence text generation task. Inspired by the observation that humans learn by getting to the bottom of things, we propose a novel framework, namely GenRE, Generative multi-turn question answering with contrastive learning for entity–relation extraction. Specifically, a template-based question prompt generation first is designed to answer in different turns. We then formulate entity–relation extraction as a generative question answering task based on the general language model instead of span-based machine reading comprehension. Meanwhile, the contrastive learning strategy in fine-tuning is introduced to add negative samples to mitigate the exposure bias inherent in generative models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GenRE performs competitively on two public datasets and a custom dataset, highlighting its superiority in entity normalization and implicit entity–relation extraction.

Hence in the presented method, a new weight evaluation index, based on the gene-microRNA network as well as somatic mutation profile, is introduced for weighting the PPI network first. Subsequently, the vertices in the weighted PPI network are hierarchically clustered by measuring the Mahalanobis distance of their feature vectors, extracted with the graph embedding method Node2vec. Finally, a heuristic process with dropping and extracting is conducted on the gene clusters to produce a group of gene modules. Numerous experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance to four cutting-edge identification methods in most cases regarding the capability of recognizing the acknowledged cancer-related genes, generating modules having relatively high coverage and mutual exclusivity, and are significantly enriched for specific types of cancers. The majority of the genes in the identified modules are involved in cancer-related signaling pathways, or have been reported to be carcinogenic in the literature. Furthermore, many cancer related genes detected by the proposed method are actually omitted by the four comparison methods, which has been verified in the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud completion is a challenging task that involves predicting missing parts in incomplete 3D shapes. While existing strategies have shown effectiveness on point cloud datasets with regular shapes and continuous surfaces, they struggled to manage the morphologically diverse structures commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. This research proposed a new point cloud completion method, called SegCompletion, to derive complete 3D geometries from a partial shape with different structures and discontinuous surfaces. To achieve this, morphological segmentation was introduced before point cloud completion by deep hierarchical feature learning on point sets, and thus, the complex morphological structure was segmented into regular shapes and continuous surfaces. Additionally, each instance of a point cloud that belonged to the same type of feature could also be effectively identified using HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). Furthermore, the multiscale generative network achieved sophisticated patching of missing point clouds under the same geometric feature based on feature points. To compensate for the variance in the mean distances between the centers of the patches and their closest neighbors, a simple yet effective uniform loss was utilized. A number of experiments on ShapeNet and Pheno4D datasets have shown the performance of SegCompletion on public datasets. Moreover, the contribution of SegCompletion to our dataset (Cotton3D) was discussed. The experimental results demonstrated that SegCompletion performed better than existing methods reported in the literature.},

  abstract     = {As a practical and challenging task, deep learning-based methods have achieved effective results for fabric defect detection, however, most of them mainly target detection accuracy at the expense of detection speed. Therefore, we propose a fabric defect detection method called PEI-YOLOv5. First, Particle Depthwise Convolution (PDConv) is proposed to extract spatial features more efficiently while reducing redundant computations and memory access, reducing model computation and improving detection speed. Second, Enhance-BiFPN(EB) is proposed based on the structure of BiFPN to enhance the attention of spatial and channel feature maps and the fusion of information at different scales. Third, we improve the loss function and propose IN loss, which improves the problem that the original IOU loss is weak in detecting small targets while speeding up the convergence of the model. Finally, five more common types of defects were selected for training in the GuangDong TianChi fabric defect dataset, and using our proposed PEI-YOLOv5 with only 0.2 Giga Floating Point Operations (GFLOPs) increase, the mAP improved by 3.61%, reaching 87.89%. To demonstrate the versatility of PEI-YOLOv5, we additionally evaluated this in the NEU surface defect database, with the mAP of 79.37%. The performance of PEI-YOLOv 5 in these two datasets surpasses the most advanced fabric defect detection methods at present. We deployed the model to the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded development board, and the detection speed reached 31 frames per second (Fps), which can fully meet the speed requirements of real-time detection.},

  abstract     = {Identifying and preventing malicious network behavior is a challenge for establishing a secure network communication environment or system. Malicious activities in a network system can seriously threaten users’ privacy and potentially jeopardize the entire network infrastructure and functions. Furthermore, cyber-attacks have grown in complexity and number due to the ever-evolving digital landscape of computer and network devices in recent years. Analyzing network traffic using network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) has become an integral security measure in modern networks to identify malicious and suspicious activities. However, most intrusion detection datasets contain imbalance classes, making it difficult for most existing classifiers to achieve good performance. In this paper, we propose a double-layer feature extraction and feature fusion technique (CNN-GRU-FF), which uses a modified focal loss function instead of the traditional cross-entropy to handle the class imbalance problem in the IDS datasets. We use the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. From the research findings, it is evident our CNN-GRU-FF method obtains a detection rate of 98.22% and 99.68% using the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD datasets, respectively while maintaining low false alarm rates on both datasets. We compared the proposed model’s performance with seven baseline algorithms and other published methods in literature. It is evident from the performance results that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art network intrusion detection methods.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for traffic flow prediction, based on a Multi-Scale Residual Graph Convolution Network with hierarchical attention. First, we design a novel encoder–decoder with multi-independent channels to capture traffic flow information from different time scales and diverse temporal dependencies. Second, we employ a coupled graph convolution network with residual graph attention to dynamically learn the varying spatial features among and within traffic stations. Third, we utilize channel attention to fuse the multi-scale spatial–temporal dependencies and accurately predict traffic flow.

  abstract     = {Task offloading solves the problem that the computing resources of terminal devices in hospitals are limited by offloading massive radiomics-based medical image diagnosis model (RIDM) tasks to edge servers (ESs). However, sequential offloading decision-making is NP-hard. Representing the dependencies of tasks and developing collaborative computing between ESs have become challenges. In addition, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has poor sample efficiency and brittleness to hyperparameters. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed collaborative dependent task offloading strategy based on DRL (DCDO-DRL). The objective is to maximize the utility of RIDM tasks, which is a weighted sum of the delay and energy consumption generated by execution. The dependencies of the RIDM task are modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The sequence prediction of the S2S neural network is adopted to represent the offloading decision process within the DAG. Next, a distributed collaborative processing algorithm is designed on the edge layer to further improve run efficiency. Finally, the DCDO-DRL strategy follows the discrete soft actor-critic method to improve the robustness of the S2S neural network. The numerical results prove the convergence and statistical superiority of the DCDO-DRL strategy. Compared with other algorithms, the DCDO-DRL strategy improves the execution utility of the RIDM task by at least 23.07, 12.77, and 8.51% in the three scenarios.},

In this paper, a framework is proposed, named as MARL-BT, that embeds multi-agent reinforcement learning methods into behavior trees. Following the running mechanism of behavior trees, we design the way of collecting samples and the training procedure. Further, we point out a special phenomenon in MARL-BT, i.e., the unexpected interruption, and present an action masking technique to remove its harmful effect on learning performance. Finally, we make extensive experiments on the 11 versus 11 full game in Google Research Football. The introduced MARL-BT framework could get an 11.507% improvement compared to pure BT for certain scenarios. The action masking technique could greatly improve the performance of the learning method, i.e., the final reward is improved around 100% times for a sub-task.},

However, in the actual industrial environment, it is very difficult to obtain a large amount of labeled data. It will make it difficult for the fault diagnosis model to converge with limited labeled industrial data. To address this paradox, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework (M-Net) for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which only requires unlabeled industrial data. The M-Net will be pretrained using the labeled data, which can be accessed through the labs. In this stage, we propose a multi-scale feature extractor that can extract and fuse multi-scale features. This operation will generalize the features further. Then, we will align the distribution of the labeled data and unlabeled industrial data using the generator model based on multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy. This will reduce the distribution distance between the labeled data and the unlabeled industrial data. For now, the unsupervised domain adaptation problem has shifted to a semi-supervised domain adaptation problem. The results, obtained through experimental comparison, demonstrate that the M-Net can achieve an accuracy of over 99.99% with labeled data and a maximum transfer accuracy of over 99% with unlabeled industrial data.},

  abstract     = {Generating test cases is essential for discovering software bugs. However, finding bugs in multi-path loops is challenging, especially when bugs can only be exposed after a specific interleaving execution order. Furthermore, the number of paths increases exponentially when the iteration count increases. It results in running out of resources (e.g., allocated search budget) in existing algorithms for test case generation before finding program bugs. To overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of existing algorithms in finding bugs among multi-path loops, we propose a path-oriented test case generation framework to explore loop paths of bounded depth. To fulfill this task, we first present a method that groups loop paths based on their latent similarities. Then, we formulate the problem of generating test cases to cover loop paths as a many-objective optimization one. The many-objective optimization problem is designed to optimize one group of loop paths at a time. Finally, a many-objective test case generation framework is used to generate test cases for covering loop paths. In this framework, a knowledge transfer scheme is incorporated to reuse suitable archived test cases at the start of the search process for a similar group of paths. We have implemented the proposed knowledge transfer scheme with generalized differential evolution 3 (KT-GDE3) and evaluated it with benchmarks from the competition on software verification (SV-COMP16 and SV-COMP21). The experimental results show that KT-GDE3 outperforms alternative search-based test case generation algorithms in bug finding capability for multi-path loops. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge transfer scheme, our approach is compared with the variant without this scheme (called KT-GDE3-unarchived) in the benchmarks. The corresponding experimental results verify our assumption that the knowledge transfer scheme can significantly enhance the optimization process of multi-objective algorithms such as generalized differential evolution when finding bugs in multi-path loops.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, bringing high risk to numerous security-critical applications. Existing adversarial defense algorithms primarily concentrate on optimizing adversarial training strategies to improve the robustness of neural networks, but ignore that the misguided decisions are essentially made by the activation values. Besides, such conventional strategies normally result in a great decline in clean accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a novel RSA algorithm to counteract adversarial perturbations while maintaining clean accuracy. Specifically, RSA comprises three distinct modules: feature refinement, activation suppression, and alignment modules. First, the feature refinement module refines malicious activation values in the feature space. Subsequently, the feature activation suppression module mitigates redundant activation values induced by adversarial perturbations across both channel and spatial dimensions. Finally, to avoid an excessive performance drop on clean samples, RSA incorporates a consistency constraint and a knowledge distillation constraint for feature alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and three backbone networks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves consistently superior performance in both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy over the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of critical malicious drones is crucial for optimizing directed energy attacks and maximizing their effectiveness. However, current studies on critical drone identification are still in the preliminary stage and almost rely on the traditional centrality methods that do not address the distributed features of drone swarms. This leads to inaccurate identification of critical drones, resulting in the low efficiency of directed energy attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a new critical drone identification method based on the distributed features, communication intensity, and communication scale of drones. Specifically, this paper first constructs a dynamic communication prediction network (DCPN) of drone swarms based on the 3D position and interaction range, which predicts the dynamic communication between drones. Then, this paper proposes a new method called dynamic giant connected component (GCC)-based scale-intensity centrality (DGSIC) that combines the local, global, and community structure of DCPN to identify critical nodes with stronger communication capabilities. The dynamic strategy involves the iterative identification of one critical node at each step, considering the evolving network configuration and ensuring the identified node remains the most critical in the present network. Additionally, the prioritization strategy is employed to identify the nodes within the GCC, which can significantly impact the network connectivity and communication. DGSIC optimizes the attack sequence for directed energy attacks, facilitating the rapid dissolution of malicious drone swarms. Extensive experiments in four simulated networks and eight real-world networks demonstrate the superior robustness and cascading failure performance of DGSIC.},

Aimed at imaging properly, an autonomous imaging policy generated by the scheduling networks that based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. A novel reward function with relative distance variation in consideration is designed to guide the scheduling networks to obtain higher reward. A new part is introduced to the reward function to improve the performance of the networks. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed networks are verified in simulation with different imaging missions. Compared with the results of genetic algorithm (GA), Deep Q-network (DQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO), the reward obtained by the trained scheduling networks is higher than DQN and PPO in most imaging missions and is equivalent to that of GA but, the decision time of the proposed networks after training is about six orders of magnitude less than that of GA, with less than 1e−4 s. The simulation and analysis results indicate that the proposed scheduling networks have great potential in further onboard application.},

Nevertheless, addressing the issue of over-smoothing in GNNs for node representation and finding more effective ways to learn both global and local information within the graph structure, while improving model efficiency for scalability to large text sentiment corpora, remains a challenge. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Bert-based unlinked graph embedding (BUGE) model for sentiment analysis. Initially, the model constructs a comprehensive text sentiment heterogeneous graph that more effectively captures global co-occurrence information between words. Next, by using specific sampling strategies, it efficiently preserves both global and local information within the graph structure, enabling nodes to receive more feature information. During the representation learning process, BUGE relies solely on attention mechanisms, without using graph convolutions or aggregation operators, thus avoiding the over-smoothing problem associated with node aggregation. This enhances model training efficiency and reduces memory storage requirements. Extensive experimental results and evaluations demonstrate that the adopted Bert-based unlinked graph embedding method is highly effective for sentiment analysis, especially when applied to large text sentiment corpora.},

Due to their superior ability to manage uncertain situations compared to theories of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, the n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy sets have variety of applications in decision-making in daily life. To deal with ambiguity and unreliability in multi-attribute group decision-making, this study introduces a novel tool called $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy set ( $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -RPFS). The suggested $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -RPFS incorporates all of the benefits of n,m-ROFS and represents both the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the decision-makers. The presented model is a fruitful advancement of the q-rung picture fuzzy set (q-RPFS). Furthermore, numerous of its key notions, including as complement, intersection, and union are explained and illustrated with instances. In many decision-making situations, the main benefit of $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy sets is the ability to express more uncertainty than q-rung picture fuzzy sets. Then, along with their numerous features, we discover the basic set of operations for the $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy sets. Importantly, we present a novel operator, $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy weighted power average ( $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -RPFWPA) over $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy sets, and use it to multi-attribute decision-making issues for evaluating alternatives with $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -rung picture fuzzy information. Additionally, we use this operator to pinpoint the countries with the highest expat living standards and demonstrate how to choose the best option by comparing aggregate findings and applying score values. Finally, we compare the outcomes of the q-RPFEWA, SFWG, PFDWA, SFDWA, and SFWA operators to those of the $$k^{n}_{m}$$ -RPFWPA operator.},

  abstract     = {Flocking cohesion is critical for maintaining a group’s aggregation and integrity. Designing a potential function to maintain flocking cohesion unaffected by social distance is challenging due to the uncertainty of real-world conditions and environments that cause changes in agents’ social distance. Previous flocking research based on potential functions has primarily focused on agents’ same social distance and the attraction–repulsion of the potential function, ignoring another property affecting flocking cohesion: well depth, as well as the effect of changes in agents’ social distance on well depth. This paper investigates the effect of potential function well depths and agent’s social distances on the multi-agent flocking cohesion. Through the analysis, proofs, and classification of these potential functions, we have found that the potential function well depth is proportional to the flocking cohesion. Moreover, we observe that the potential function well depth varies with the agents’ social distance changes. Therefore, we design a segmentation potential function and combine it with the flocking control algorithm in this paper. It enhances flocking cohesion significantly and has good robustness to ensure the flocking cohesion is unaffected by variations in the agents’ social distance. Meanwhile, it reduces the time required for flocking formation. Subsequently, the Lyapunov theorem and the LaSalle invariance principle prove the stability and convergence of the proposed control algorithm. Finally, this paper adopts two subgroups with different potential function well depths and social distances to encounter for simulation verification. The corresponding simulation results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the flocking control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation transfers empirical knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a fully unlabeled target domain with a different distribution. A core idea of many existing approaches is to reduce the distribution divergence between domains. However, they focused only on part of the discrimination, which can be categorized into optimizing the following four objectives: reducing the intraclass distance between domains, enlarging the interclass distances between domains, reducing the intraclass distances within domains, and enlarging the interclass distances within domains. Moreover, because few methods consider multiple types of objectives, the consistency of data representations produced by different types of objectives has not yet been studied. In this paper, to address the above issues, we propose a zeroth- and first-order difference discrimination (ZFOD) approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. It first optimizes the above four objectives simultaneously. To improve the discrimination consistency of the data across the two domains, we propose a first-order difference constraint to align the interclass differences across domains. Because the proposed method needs pseudolabels for the target domain, we adopt a recent pseudolabel generation method to alleviate the negative impact of imprecise pseudolabels. We conducted an extensive comparison with nine representative conventional methods and seven remarkable deep learning-based methods on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, as a conventional approach, not only significantly outperforms the nine conventional comparison methods but is also competitive with the seven deep learning-based comparison methods. In particular, our method achieves an accuracy of 93.4% on the Office+Caltech10 dataset, which outperforms the other comparison methods. An ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed constraint in aligning the objectives.},

  abstract     = {Multi-scale representation provides an effective answer to the scale variation of objects and entities in semantic segmentation. The ability to capture long-range pixel dependency facilitates semantic segmentation. In addition, semantic segmentation necessitates the effective use of pixel-to-pixel similarity in the channel direction to enhance pixel areas. By reviewing the characteristics of earlier successful segmentation models, we discover a number of crucial elements that enhance segmentation model performance, including a robust encoder structure, multi-scale interactions, attention mechanisms, and a robust decoder structure. The attention mechanism of the asymmetric non-local neural network (ANNet) is merged with multi-scale pyramidal modules to accelerate model segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. However, ANNet does not account for the similarity between pixels in the feature map channel direction, making the segmentation accuracy unsatisfactory. As a result, we propose EMSNet, a straightforward convolutional network architecture for semantic segmentation that consists of Integration of enhanced regional module (IERM) and Multi-scale convolution module (MSCM). The IERM module generates weights using four or five-stage feature maps, then fuses the input features with the weights and uses more computation. The similarity of the channel direction feature graphs is also calculated using ANNet’s auxiliary loss function. The MSCM module can more accurately describe the interactions between various channels, capture the interdependencies between feature pixels, and capture the multi-scale context. Experiments prove that we perform well in tests using the benchmark dataset. On Cityscapes test data, we get 82.2% segmentation accuracy. The mIoU in the ADE20k and Pascal VOC datasets are, respectively, 45.58% and 85.46%.},

To deal with this issue, we propose an approach termed self-supervised anomaly detection with pixel-point random walk (P2 Random Walk), which combines data augmentation and Siamese neural networks. We develop a pixel-level data augmentation technique to enhance the randomness of generated data and establish a two-stage anomaly classification framework. The effectiveness of the P2 Random Walk method has been demonstrated on the MVTec dataset, achieving an AUROC of 96.2% and 96.3% for classification and segmentation, respectively, by using only data augmentation-based techniques. Specifically, our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in several categories, improving the AUROC for classification and segmentation by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, which demonstrates the high performance and strong academic value of our method in anomaly detection tasks.},

However, the existing consensus algorithms have some shortcomings in terms of efficiency, fault tolerance, security, and other relevant aspects, rendering them unsuitable for direct implementation in a mutual selection scenario. In this study, a system for mutual selection operations, denoted as “MuSelect Chain,&quot; is established. First, the institution information initialization method on blockchain is developed via a smart contract, ensuring the authenticity of information stored on the chain. Second, a mutual selection relationship confirmation algorithm is designed to ensure a reliable automated mutual selection process. Next, considering the characteristics of nodes participating in the network, a consensus algorithm called “Proof-of-Leadership” is proposed to ensure consistency of information stored by different nodes on the chain. Subsequently, an incentive mechanism is established with the focus on improving MuSelect Chain efficiency. Finally, a MuSelect Chain prototype is built. Simulation results prove that the proposed MuSelect Chain is secure with strong fault tolerance.},

Nevertheless, most vanilla FL algorithms, which depend on a server, encounter the problem of reliability and a high communication burden in real cases. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) that does not follow the star topology faces the challenges of weight divergence and inferior communication efficiency. In this paper, a novel DFL framework called federated incremental subgradient-proximal (FedISP) is proposed that utilizes the incremental method to perform model updates to alleviate weight divergence. In our setup, multiple clients are distributed in a ring topology and communicate in a cyclic manner, which significantly mitigates the communication load. A convergence guarantee is given under the convex condition to demonstrate the impact of the learning rate on our algorithms, which further improves the performance of FedISP. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings while illustrating the advantages of the FedISP algorithm in achieving model consensus and saving communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) enables imaging and diagnostics of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to be performed without any discomfort. Despite this, several characteristics, including efficacy, tolerance, safety, and performance, make it difficult to apply and modify widely. The use of automated WCE to collect data and perform the analysis is essential for finding anomalies. Medical specialists need a significant amount of time and expertise to examine the data generated by WCE imaging of the patient’s digestive tract. To address these challenges, several computer vision-based solutions have been designed; nevertheless, they do not achieve an acceptable level of accuracy, and more advancements are required. Thus, in this study, we proposed four multi-classification deep learning (DL) models i.e., Vgg-19 + CNN, ResNet152V2, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) + ResNet152V2, and ResNet152V2 + Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU) and applied it on different publicly available databases for diagnosing ulcerative colitis, polyps, and dyed-lifted polyps using WCE images. To our knowledge, this is the only study that uses a single DL model for the classification of three different GI diseases. We compared the classification performance of the proposed DL classifiers in terms of many parameters such as accuracy, loss, Matthew&#39;s correlation coefficient (MCC), recall, precision, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score. The results revealed that the Vgg-19 + CNN outperforms the three other proposed DL models in classifying GI diseases using WCE images. The Vgg-19 + CNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.45%. The results of four proposed DL classifiers are also compared with recent state-of-the-art classifiers and the proposed Vgg-19 + CNN model has performed better in terms of improved accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Thermal layout optimization problems are common in integrated circuit design, where a large number of electronic components are placed on the layout, and a low temperature (i.e., high efficiency) is achieved by optimizing the positions of the electronic components. The operating temperature value of the layout is obtained by measuring the temperature field from the expensive simulation. Based on this, the thermal layout optimization problem can be viewed as an expensive combinatorial optimization problem. In order to reduce the evaluation cost, surrogate models have been widely used to replace the expensive simulations in the optimization process. However, facing the discrete decision space in thermal layout problems, generic surrogate models have large prediction errors, leading to a wrong guidance of the optimization direction. In this work, the layout scheme and its temperature field are represented by images whose relation can be well approximated by a deep neural network. Therefore, we propose an online deep surrogate-assisted optimization algorithm for thermal layout optimization. First, the iterative local search is developed to explore the discrete decision space to generate new layout schemes. Then, we design a deep neural network to build an image-to-image mapping model between the layout and the temperature field as the approximated evaluation. The operating temperature of the layout can be measured by the temperature field predicted by the mapping model. Finally, a segmented fusion model management strategy is proposed to online updates the parameters of the network. The experimental results on three kinds of layout datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, especially when the required computational budget is limited.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to locate and identify objects in videos. As deep learning brings excellent performances to object detection, the tracking-by-detection (TBD) has gradually become a mainstream tracking framework. However, some drawbacks still exist in the current TBD framework: (1) inaccurate prediction of the bounding boxes would occur in the detection part, which is caused by overlooking the actual pedestrian ratio in the surveillance scene. (2) The width of the bounding boxes in the next frame might be indirectly predicted by the aspect ratio, which increases the error of width prediction in the motion prediction part. (3) Association is only performed for high-confidence detection boxes, and the low-confidence boxes caused by occlusion are discarded in the data association part, resulting in fragmentation of trajectories. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-target tracking model incorporating motion estimation and multi-stage association (MEMA). First, the aspect ratio of the ground-true bounding box is introduced to improve the fit of the detection and the ground-true bounding box, and we design the elliptical Gaussian kernel to improve the positioning accuracy of the object center point. Then, the prediction state vector of the Kalman filter is modified to predict the width and its corresponding velocity directly. It can reduce the width error of the prediction box and eliminate the velocity error of the motion estimation, which leads to a more pedestrian-friendly prediction bounding box. Finally, we propose a multi-stage association strategy to correlate different confidence boxes. Without using the appearance feature, the strategy can reduce the impact of occlusion and improve the tracking performance. On the MOT17 test set, the method proposed in this paper achieves a MOTA of 74.3% and an IDF1 of 72.4%, outperforming the current SOTA.},

Based on the researches on abnormal behavior characteristics of patients with MR, we propose an extension and supplement shift multi-scale G3D (ESS MS-G3D) network for video-based assessment of MR. Specifically, all videos are collected from clinical diagnostic scenarios and the skeleton sequence of human body is extracted from videos through an advanced pose estimation model. To solve the shortcomings of existing behavior characteristic learning methods, we present: (1) three G3D styles, enable the network to have different input forms; (2) two G3D graphs and two extension graphs, redefine and extend the graph structure of spatial–temporal nodes; (3) two learnable parameters, realize adaptive adjustment of graph structure; (4) a shift layer, enable the network to learn global features. Finally, we construct a three-branch model ESS MS-STGC, which can capture the discriminative spatial–temporal features and explore the co-occurrence relationship between spatial and temporal domains. Experiments in clinical video data set show that our proposed model has good performance in MR assessment and is superior to the existing vision-based methods. In two-classification task, our model with joint stream achieves the highest accuracy of $$94.63\%$$ in validation set and $$89.13\%$$ in test set. The results are further improved to $$96.52\%$$ and $$93.22\%$$ , respectively, by utilizing multi-stream fusion strategy. In four-classification task, our model obtains Top1 accuracy of $$78.84\%$$ and Top2 accuracy of $$91.34\%$$ in test set. The proposed method provides a new idea for clinical mental retardation assessment.},

  abstract     = {There are inconsistent tasks and insufficient training in the SAR ship detection model, which severely limit the detection performance of the model. Therefore, we propose a twin branch network and design two loss functions: regression reverse convergence loss and classification mutual learning loss. The twin branch network is a simple but effective method containing two components: twin regression network and twin classification network. Aiming at the inconsistencies between training and testing in regression branches, we propose a regression reverse convergence loss (RRC Loss) based on twin regression networks. This loss can make multiple training samples in the twin regression branch converge to the label from the opposite direction. In this way, the test distribution can be closer to the training distribution after processing. For inadequate training in classification branch, Inspired by knowledge distillation, we construct self-knowledge distillation using a twin classification network. Meanwhile, our proposed classification mutual learning loss (CML Loss) enables the twin classification network not only to conduct supervised learning based on the label but also to learn from each other. Experiments on SSDD and HRSID datasets prove that, compared with the original method, the proposed method can improve the AP by 2.7–4.9% based on different backbone networks, and the detection performance is better than other advanced algorithms.},

Firstly, some novel TSPF power Heronian mean (TSPFPHM) operators are initiated based on Aczel–Alsina operational laws. These aggregation operators (AOs) have the capacity to eliminate the impact of uncomfortable data and can simultaneously consider the relationships between any two input arguments. Secondly, some elementary properties and core cases with respect to parameters are investigated and found that some of the existing AOs are special cases of the newly initiated aggregation operators. Thirdly, based on these AOs and Aczel–Alsina operational laws a newly advanced technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based method for dealing with multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems in a T-Spherical fuzzy framework is established, where the weights of both the decision makers (DMs) and the criteria are completely unknowable.

In this paper, we establish MOSPPMTW matching emergency rescue scenarios, which simultaneously enables the supplies and rescuers to arrive at the emergency scene as soon as possible in the shortest time and at the smallest cost. To solve the complete Pareto optimal surface, we present a ripple spreading algorithm (RSA), which determines the complete Pareto frontier by performing a ripple relay race to obtain the set of Pareto optimal path solutions. The proposed RSA algorithm does not require an initial solution and iterative iterations and only needs to be run once to obtain the solution set. Furthermore, we prove the optimality and time complexity of RSA and conduct multiple sets of example simulation experiments. Compared with other algorithms, RSA performs better in terms of computational speed and solution quality. The advantage is especially more obvious in the computation of large-scale problems. It is applicable to various emergency disaster relief scenarios and can meet the requirements of fast response and timeliness.},

  abstract     = {Recent improvements in networking technologies have led to a significant shift towards distributed cloud-based services. However, adequate management of computation resources by providers is vital to maintain the costs of operations and quality of services. A robust system is needed to forecast demand and prevent excessive resource allocations. Extensive literature review suggests that the potential of recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms is not sufficiently explored and applied to cloud computing. To address this gap, this work proposes a methodology for forecasting load of cloud resources based on recurrent neural networks with and without attention layers. Utilized deep learning models are further optimized through hyperparameter tuning using a modified particle swarm optimization metaheuristic, which is also introduced in this work. To help models deal with complex non-stationary data sequences, the variational mode decomposition for decomposing complex series has also been utilized. The performance of this approach is compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on a real-world cloud-load dataset. Captured performance metrics ( $$R^2$$ , mean square error, root mean square error, and index of agreement) strongly indicate that the proposed method has great potential for accurately forecasting cloud load. Further, models optimized by the introduced metaheuristic outperformed competing approaches, which was confirmed by conducted statistical validation. In addition, the best-performing forecasting model has been subjected to SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis to determine the impact each feature has on model forecasts, which could potentially be a very useful tool for cloud providers when making decisions.},

The basic probability assignment (BPA) function in DST is used to model the assessments of experts with respect to each risk factor. Dempster’s rule of combination is adopted for fusion of assessment information from different experts. The improved pignistic probability function is proposed and used to transform the fusion result of BPA into probability function for getting more accurate decision-making result in risk analysis with FMEA. GRPM is adopted to determine the risk priority order of all the failure modes to overcome the shortcoming in traditional risk priority number in FMEA.

  abstract     = {For visual estimation of optical flow, which is crucial for various vision analyses, unsupervised learning by view synthesis has emerged as a promising alternative to supervised methods because the ground-truth flow is not readily available in many cases. However, unsupervised learning is likely to be unstable when pixel tracking is lost via occlusion and motion blur, or pixel correspondence is impaired by variations in image content and spatial structure over time. Recognizing that dynamic occlusions and object variations usually exhibit a smooth temporal transition in natural settings, we shifted our focus to model unsupervised learning optical flow from multi-frame sequences of such dynamic scenes. Specifically, we simulated various dynamic scenarios and occlusion phenomena based on Markov property, allowing the model to extract motion laws and thus gain performance in dynamic and occluded areas, which diverges from existing methods without considering temporal dynamics. In addition, we introduced a temporal dynamic model based on a well-designed spatial-temporal dual recurrent block, resulting in a lightweight model structure with fast inference speed. Assuming the temporal smoothness of optical flow, we used the prior motions of adjacent frames to supervise the occluded regions more reliably. Experiments on several optical flow benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, as the performance is comparable to several state-of-the-art methods with advantages in memory and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {The security and confidentiality of medical images are of utmost importance due to frequent issues such as leakage, theft, and tampering during transmission and storage, which seriously impact patient privacy. Traditional encryption techniques applied to entire images have proven to be ineffective in guaranteeing timely encryption and preserving the privacy of organ regions separated from the background. In response, this study proposes a specialized and efficient local image encryption algorithm for the medical field. The proposed encryption algorithm focuses on the regions of interest (ROI) within massive medical images. Initially, the Laplacian of Gaussian operator and the outer boundary tracking algorithm are employed to extract the binary image and achieve ROI edge extraction. Subsequently, the image is divided into ROI and ROB (regions outside ROI). The ROI is transformed into a row vector and rearranged using the Lorenz hyperchaotic system. The rearranged sequence is XOR with the random sequence generated by the Henon chaotic map. Next, the encrypted sequence is arranged according to the location of the ROI region and recombined with the unencrypted ROB to obtain the complete encrypted image. Finally, the least significant bit algorithm controlled by the key is used to embed binary image into the encrypted image to ensure lossless decryption of the medical images. Experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed selective encryption algorithm for massive medical images offers relatively ideal security and higher encryption efficiency. This algorithm addresses the privacy concerns and challenges faced in the medical field and contributes to the secure transmission and storage of massive medical images.},

Integrating the visual and textual information of social image can obtain accurate and comprehensive feature and improve clustering performance. However, the heterogeneous gap between tags and images makes it difficult to reasonably organize the social images. In addition, the tags are often sparse and incomplete due to personal preference and cognition differences of users. To solve these problems, we propose a novel knowledge-aware progressive clustering (KAPC) method, which employs human knowledge to guide the cross-modal clustering of social images. Firstly, we design a dual-similarity semantic expansion strategy to complement the sparse tags with human knowledge, which constructs a more complete semantic similarity matrix for tags through knowledge graphs. Secondly, we define an objective function based on information theory to bridge the heterogeneous gap, which align inter-modal cluster distribution to explore the correlation between visual and textual information. Finally, a progressive iteration method is designed to make the two modalities guide each other and obtain better performance of social image clustering. Extensive experiments on four social image datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed KAPC method.},

Inspired by RDG2 and RDG3, we design the adaptive determination threshold and further decompose relatively large-scale sub-components to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. In the optimization phase, the SEADE is adopted as the basic optimizer, where the global and the local surrogate model are constructed by generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with all historical samples and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with recent samples. Expected improvement (EI) infill sampling criterion cooperated with random search is employed to search elite solutions in the surrogate model. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we implement comprehensive experiments on CEC2013 benchmark functions compared with state-of-the-art decomposition techniques. Experimental and statistical results show that our proposed EDDG is competitive with these advanced decomposition techniques, and the introduction of SEADE can accelerate the convergence of optimization significantly.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a detailed investigation into the Multi-Depot Half-Open Time-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (MDHOTDEVRP) within the domain of urban distribution, prompted by the growing urgency to mitigate the environmental repercussions of logistics transportation. The study first surmounts the uncertainty in Electric Vehicle (EV) range arising from the dynamic nature of urban traffic networks by establishing a flexible energy consumption estimation strategy. Subsequently, a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model is formulated, aiming to minimize the total distribution costs associated with EV dispatch, vehicle travel, customer service, and charging operations. Given the unique attributes intrinsic to the model, a Two-Stage Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm (TSHACA) is developed as an effective solution approach. The algorithm leverages enhanced K-means clustering to assign customers to EVs in the first stage and employs an Improved Ant Colony Algorithm (IACA) for optimizing the distribution within each cluster in the second stage. Extensive simulations conducted on various test scenarios corroborate the economic and environmental benefits derived from the MDHOTDEVRP solution and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. The outcomes highlight TSHACA’s capability to efficiently allocate EVs from different depots, optimize vehicle routes, reduce carbon emissions, and minimize urban logistic expenditures. Consequently, this study contributes significantly to the advancement of sustainable urban logistics transportation, offering valuable insights for practitioners and policy-makers.},

  abstract     = {Light guide plate (LGP) is a key component of liquid crystal display (LCD) display systems, so its quality directly affects the display effect of LCD. However, LGPs have complex background texture, low contrast, varying defect size and numerous defect types, which makes realizing efficient and accuracy-satisfactory surface defect automatic detection of LGPS still a big challenge. Therefore, combining its optical properties, dot distribution, defect imaging characteristics and detection requirements, a surface defect detection algorithm based on LGP-YOLO for practical industrial applications is proposed in this paper. To enhance the feature extraction ability of the network without dimensionality reduction, expand the effective receptive field and reduce the interference of invalid targets, we built the receptive field module (RFM) by combining the effective channel attention network (ECA-Net) and reviewing large kernel design in CNNs (RepLKNet). For the purpose of optimizing the performance of the network in downstream tasks, enhance the network&#39;s expression ability and improve the network’s ability of detecting multi-scale targets, we construct the small detection module (SDM) by combining space-to-depth non-strided convolution (SPDConv) and omini-dimensional dynamic convolution (ODConv). Finally, an LGP defect dataset is constructed using a set of images collected from industrial sites, and a multi-round experiment is carried out to test the proposed method on the LGP detect dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed LGP-YOLO network can achieve high performance, with mAP and F1-score reaching 99.08% and 97.45% respectively, and inference speed reaching 81.15 FPS. This demonstrates that LGP-YOLO can strike a good balance between detection accuracy and inference speed, capable of meeting the requirements of high-precision and high-efficiency LGP defect detection in LGP manufacturing factories.},

  abstract     = {The design of binder proteins for specific target proteins using deep learning is a challenging task that has a wide range of applications in both designing therapeutic antibodies and creating new drugs. Machine learning-based solutions, as opposed to laboratory design, streamline the design process and enable the design of new proteins that may be required to address new and orphan diseases. Most techniques proposed in the literature necessitate either domain knowledge or some appraisal of the target protein’s 3-D structure. This paper proposes an approach for designing binder proteins based solely on the amino acid sequence of the target protein and without recourse to domain knowledge or structural information. The sequences of the binders are generated with two new transformers, namely the AppendFormer and MergeFormer architectures. Because, in general, there is more than one binder for a given target protein, these transformers employ a binding score and a prior on the sequence of the binder to obtain a unique targeted solution. Our experimental evaluation confirms the strengths of this novel approach. The performance of the models was determined with 5-fold cross-validation and clearly indicates that our architectures lead to highly accurate results. In addition, scores of up to 0.98 were achieved in terms of Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman similarity metrics, which indicates that our solutions significantly outperform a seq2seq baseline model.},

  abstract     = {During pineapple cultivation, detecting and counting the number of pineapple flowers in real time and estimating the yield are essential. Deep learning methods are more efficient in real-time performance than traditional manual detection. However, existing deep learning models are characterized by low detection speeds and cannot be applied in real time on mobile devices. This paper presents a lightweight model in which filter pruning compresses the YOLOv5 network. An adaptive batch normalization layer evaluation mechanism is introduced to the pruning process to evaluate the performance of the subnetwork. With this approach, the network with the best performance can be found quickly after pruning. Then, an efficient channel attention mechanism is added for the pruned network to constitute a new YOLOv5_E network. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv5_E network attains an accuracy of 71.7% with a mere 1.7 M parameters, a model size of 3.8 MB, and an impressive running speed of 178 frames per second. Compared to the original YOLOv5, YOLOv5_E shows a 0.9% marginal decrease in accuracy; while, the number of parameters and the model size are reduced by 75.8% and 73.8%, respectively. Moreover, the running speed of YOLOv5_E is nearly twice that of the original. Among the ten networks evaluated, YOLOv5_E boasts the fastest detection speed and ranks second in detection accuracy. Furthermore, YOLOv5_E can be integrated with StrongSORT for real-time detection and counting on mobile devices. We validated this on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX development board, where it achieved an average detection speed of 24 frames per second. The proposed YOLOv5_E network can be effectively used on agricultural equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles, providing technical support for the detection and counting of crops on mobile devices.},

  abstract     = {With consideration for the extensive resources consumption and environmental degradation being on the rise today, implementing green development strategy to pursue both socioeconomic growth and the coordinated of environment sustainability, has become an increasingly important issue in modern enterprise supply chain operations management. Hence, the appropriate green supplier selection (GSS), viewed as a core issue in green supply chain management (GSCM), requires continuous research in this field to obtain a complete perception on GSS practices. It can be regarded as a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem that involves many conflict and unmeasurable evaluation criteria. In view of the superiority of multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic term sets (MGEPLTSs) in modeling such issues on potential ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty in actual GSS practices, we propose a novel integrated MAGDM methodology for GSS problems, by integrating the BWM (best–worst method) with the VIKOR (VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje) technique under the MGEPLTSs environment. First, by introducing the multi-granularity and probabilistic linguistic term sets, the MGEPLTSs are proposed to represent and quantify the decision information of GSCM practitioners. Then, the BWM is introduced to the MGEPLTSs environment to compute the weights of decision-making panels and evaluation attributes in GSS problems, by building the fuzzy mathematical programming model, respectively. Finally, we extend a multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic VIKOR method to calculate the compromise measure of alternatives considering the group utility maximization and the individual regret minimization, thereby achieving the full ranking of alternatives. A GSS case is conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with other similar approaches are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the synchronization and control of chaotic systems while proposing a novel chaotic-based path-tracking application for mobile robots (MRs) to ensure their safety and security. In security-based applications that use MRs, such as patrol MRs, the path of the MRs must be complex enough to prevent easy prediction. Multiple chaotic systems with a chaotic switching mechanism are introduced for secure path planning. The main challenges are that the dynamics of MRs are entirely unknown. The modeled dynamics of the MRs are unreliable in practice due to a broad range of uncertainties related to the parameters, operating conditions, environmental impacts, time delays, unmodeled frictions, noisy sensors, and faulty actuators. Also, the chaotic switching of reference signals between chaotic signals imposes a high dynamic perturbation. The main novelties are as follows: (1) a strong secure path is introduced for MRs.

  abstract     = {Great progress has been made in the domain of multi-agent reinforcement learning in recent years. Most work concentrates on solving a single task by learning the cooperative behaviors of agents. However, many real-world problems are normally composed of a set of subtasks in which the execution order follows a certain procedure. Cooperative behaviors should be learned on the premise that agents are first allocated to those subtasks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for learning the dynamic allocation of agents among subtasks, as well as cooperative behaviors. We design networks corresponding to agents and subnetworks, respectively, which constitute the whole hierarchical network. For the upper layer, a novel allocation learning mechanism is devised to map an agent network to a subtask network. Each agent network could only be assigned to only one subtask network at each time step. For the lower layer, an action learning module is designed to compute appropriate actions for each agent with the allocation result. The agent networks together with the subtask networks are updated by a common reward obtained from the environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct experiments in two challenging environments, i.e., Google Research Football and SAVETHECITY. Empirical results show that our framework achieves much better performance than other recent methods.},

Existing models for STVS assessment of incomplete PMU data mostly have the disadvantages of high computational complexity and large impact from the level of data missing. This paper proposes a multi-task learning method that performs stability assessment and missing data completion in parallel. The Transformer Encoder is used as the shared feature extractor, a GRU structure is used to output complete PMU data sequences, and a BP neural network is used to output stability assessment results. The loss function used for the missing completion task considers the accuracy in both the shape and time domains. A comparison with relevant models shows that the model proposed in this paper achieves the best performance in all indicators and is minimally affected by the observation windows and the level of data loss, demonstrating good robustness.},

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to address the problem of insufficient information consideration in network embedding, which is termed multi-task-oriented adaptive dual-channel graph convolutional network (TAD-GCN). We firstly use kNN graph construction method to generate three views for each network dataset. Then, the proposed TAD-GCN contains dual-channel GCN which can extract the specific and shared embeddings from multiple views simultaneously, and attention mechanism is adopted to fuse them adaptively. In addition, we design similarity constraint and difference constraint to further enhance their semantic similarity and ensure that they capture the different information. Lastly, a multi-task learning module is introduced to solve multiple tasks simultaneously and optimize the model with its losses. The experimental results demonstrate that our model TAD-GCN not only completes multiple downstream tasks at the same time, but also achieves excellent performance compared with eight state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is one of the mainstream frameworks for brain-like computing and neuromorphic computing, which has the potential to overcome current AI challenges, for example, low-power learning dynamic processes. However, there is still a huge gap in performance between SNN and artificial neural networks (ANN) in traditional supervised learning. One solution for this problem is to propose a better spiking neuron model to improve its memory ability for temporal data. This paper proposed a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with dynamic postsynaptic potential and a layer-span connecting method for SNN trained using backpropagation. The dynamic postsynaptic potential LIF model allows the neurons dynamically release neurotransmitters in an SNN model, which mimics the activity of biological neurons. The layer-span connecting method enhances the long-distance memory ability of SNN. We also first introduced a cosh-based surrogate gradient for the backpropagation training of SNNs. We compared the SNN with cosh-based surrogate gradient (CSNN), CSNN with dynamic postsynaptic potential (Dyn-CSNN), layer-span connecting CSNN (Las-CSNN), and SNN model with all the proposed methods (DlaCSNN-BP) in three image classification and one text classification datasets. The experimental results exhibited that proposed SNN methods could outperform most of the previously proposed SNNs and ANNs in the same network structure. Among them, the proposed DlaCSNN-BP got the best classification performance. This result indicates that our proposed method can effectively improve the effect of SNN in supervised learning and reduce the gap with deep learning. This work also provides more possibilities for putting SNN into practical application.},

However, one of the biggest challenges for reinforcement learning is sample efficiency, especially for high-dimensional complex problems. Model-based reinforcement learning can solve the problem with a learned world model, but the performance is limited by the imperfect world model, so it usually has worse approximate performance than model-free reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called World Model with Trajectory Discrimination (WMTD). We learn the representation of temporal dynamics information by adding a trajectory discriminator to the world model, and then compute the weight of state value estimation based on the trajectory discriminator to optimize the policy. Specifically, we augment the trajectories to generate negative samples and train a trajectory discriminator that shares the feature extractor with the world model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the sample efficiency and achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepMind control tasks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, owing to the requirements of inference speed, most real-time semantic segmentation networks often have shallow network depth, which limits the receptive field size of the model, leading to the limited acquisition of semantic information and resulting in intraclass inconsistency and ultimately a decrease in segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the shallow network depth also restricts the feature extraction capability of the network, reducing its robustness and ability to adapt to complex scenes. To address these issues, a bilateral network with a rich semantic extractor (RSE) for real-time semantic segmentation (BRSeNet) is presented to perform real-time semantic segmentation. First, to solve the problem of insufficient semantic feature information extraction, an RSE is proposed, which includes a multiscale global semantic extraction module (MGSEM) and a semantic fusion module (SFM). The MGSEM can extract rich global semantics and expand the effective receptive field. Simultaneously, the SFM efficiently integrates multiscale local semantics with multiscale global semantics, resulting in more comprehensive semantic information for the network. Finally, based on the characteristics of detail and semantic branches, a bilateral reconstruction aggregation module is designed to reconstruct the contextual information of detail features, model the interdependencies on semantic feature channels, and enhance feature representation. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets are conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed BRSeNet achieves mean intersection over union of 74.9% and 35.7% at inference speeds of 74 and 65 frames per second, respectively, and ensures a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.},

Data collection for millions of vehicles hinders by various problems, i.e., higher cost of energy, time, space, and storage resources. Moreover, higher data traffic results in higher delays, larger throughput, excessive bottlenecks, and frequent repetition of data. To better facilitate the aforementioned challenges and to provide a solution, we have proposed a lightweight Machine Learning based data collection protocol named ML-TDG to effectively deal with higher data volumes in a real-time traffic environment capable of bringing the least burden on the network while utilizing less space, time, and energy. ML-TDG is functional based on Apache Spark, an effective data processing engine that indexes the data based on two logs, i.e., old commuters or frequent/daily commuters and second new/occasional commuters. The proposed protocol’s main idea is to utilize real-time traffic, distinguish the indexes in parallel based on two assigned logs criteria to train the network, and collect data with the least sources. For energy and time optimization, dynamic segmentation switching is introduced which is an intelligent road segments division and switching for reducing bottlenecks and replication. ML-TDG is tested and verified on Dublin, Ireland’s busiest motorway M50. ML-TDG performs the data collection, data sorting, and network training to decide the next execution altogether for better optimization every time. The experimental results verify that our proposed protocol is attaining higher performance with lower resource requirements along with rich and time-efficient sustainable data collection clusters in comparison with baseline protocols.},

However, in existing studies, the mutation strategy selection of each subpopulation during execution is fixed, resulting in poor self-adaptation of subpopulations. To solve this problem, a dynamic multi-strategy integrated differential evolution algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RLDMDE) is proposed in this paper. By employing reinforcement learning, each subpopulation can adaptively select the mutation strategy according to the current environmental state (population diversity). Based on the population state, this paper proposes an individual dynamic migration strategy to “reward” or “punish” the population to avoid wasting individual computing resources. Furthermore, this paper applies two methods of good point set and random opposition-based learning (ROBL) in the population initialization stage to improve the quality of the initial solutions. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the RLDMDE algorithm, this paper selects two benchmark function sets, CEC2013 and CEC2017, and six engineering design problems for testing. The results demonstrate that the RLDMDE algorithm has good performance and strong competitiveness in solving optimization problems.},

The proposed CCPFS combines CIVPFS and complex picture fuzzy sets (CPFS), where CPFS extends the complex intuitionistic fuzzy set by incorporating a neutral membership degree. This unique model offers an expanded range of values using degrees of membership, neutral membership, and non-membership, within the unit disk of a complex plane. Additionally, we introduce two more new ideas of internal complex cubic picture fuzzy sets (ICCPFS) and external complex cubic picture fuzzy sets (ECCPFS) to further enhance the versatility of the approach. To facilitate practical applications, complement, score, and accuracy functions are developed and defined for CCPFS. Moreover, three types of averaging aggregation operators based on complex cubic picture fuzzy sets are introduced, including complex cubic picture fuzzy weighted geometric (CCPFWG) operators, complex cubic picture fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (CCPFOWG) operator, and complex cubic picture fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric (CCPFHWG) operator. The CCPFHWG operator generalizes both CCPFWG and CCPFOWG operators, providing a comprehensive framework for aggregating complex cubic picture fuzzy data. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem is presented, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing today&#39;s complex decision structures. The utilization of complex cubic picture fuzzy sets and the corresponding aggregation operators in MCDM highlights their applicability and relevance in tackling real-world complexities.},

Diverse trajectory data is critical for high-accuracy trajectory prediction. However, the trajectory data is captured in scattered scenes, which can cause the problem of data island. Furthermore, artificial aggregation of trajectory data suffers from the risk of data leakage, ignoring the rule of privacy protection. We propose a multi-scene federated trajectory prediction (Fed-TP) method to solve the above problems. As our key contribution, a destination-oriented LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based trajectory prediction (DO-TP) network is proposed in each scene to forecast future trajectories in an encoder-decoder manner. The independent training using trajectory data in each scene can prevent data leakage and achieves high privacy security. As another key contribution, a federated learning framework is introduced to break the scene limitation by conducting distributed collaborative training. The performance of different federated learning methods is compared on public datasets, including ETH, UCY, and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). Compared with FedAvg and FedProx, FedAtt is more suitable for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better data privacy security than directly training on multiple scenes and superior prediction performance than training on a single scene.},

We first incorporate the face parsing network with fine-tuning to obtain more accurate face structure, and we present the feature adaptive denormalization (FAD) to regularize the facial structure as a condition of auxiliary to generate more harmonious and undistorted face structure. Meanwhile, to improve the generated facial texture information, we propose a new Laplace depth-wise separable convolution (LDConv) and multi-patch discriminator. Compared with existing methods, our face deblurring method could restore face structure more accurately and with more facial details. Experiments on two public face datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative indicators.},

Its applications span diverse domains, including intelligent transportation, public security, new retail, and the integration of face re-ID technology. The rapid progress in deep learning techniques, coupled with the availability of large-scale pedestrian datasets, has led to remarkable advancements in pedestrian re-ID. In this paper, we begin the study by summarising the key datasets and standard evaluation methodologies for pedestrian re-ID. Second, we look into pedestrian re-ID methods that are based on object re-ID, loss functions, research directions, weakly supervised classification, and various application scenarios. Moreover, we assess and display different re-ID approaches from deep learning perspectives. Finally, several challenges and future directions for pedestrian re-ID development are discussed.

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking is a key technology for controlling the autonomous vehicles effectively and stably to track the reference trajectory. How to handle the various constraints in trajectory tracking is very challenging. The recently proposed generalized exterior point method (GEP) shows high computational efficiency and closed-loop performance in solving the constrained trajectory tracking problem. However, the neural networks used in the GEP may suffer from the ill-conditioning issue during model training, which result in a slow or even non-converging training convergence process and the control output of the policy network being suboptimal or even severely constraint-violating. To effectively deal with the large-scale nonlinear state-wise constraints and avoid the ill-conditioning issue, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method called the actor-critic objective penalty function method (ACOPFM) for trajectory tracking in autonomous driving. We adopt an integrated decision and control (IDC)-based planning and control scheme to transform the trajectory tracking problem into MPC-based nonlinear programming problems and embed the objective penalty function method into an actor-critic solution framework. The nonlinear programming problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem and employed as a loss function for model updating of the policy network, and the ill-conditioning issue is avoided by alternately performing gradient descent and adaptively adjusting the penalty parameter. The convergence of ACOPFM is proved. The simulation results demonstrate that the ACOPFM converges to the optimal control strategy fast and steadily, and perform well under the multi-lane test scenario.},

  abstract     = {Locating tables in document images is the first step to extracting table information, and high location precision is required. The dominant approach of table detection is based on an object detection algorithm, and the detector defines the prediction task as a regression problem, which inevitably leads to positioning errors. To address this issue, this paper presents an approach called Border Line Correction (BLC) to refine the rough prediction results of the original detector through the table boundary lines extracted from the document image. Our approach transforms the regression task into a classification problem, thus avoiding the inherent regression error of the object detection algorithm. Traditional annotation methods are inadequate for table detection tasks as they fail to capture the completeness and purity of the detection results. Therefore, this study treats the correct position of a table as a tolerance region. Additionally, to overcome the limitations of existing datasets in the materials domain, we collected 1183 samples from scientific literature in the materials field and created the MatTab dataset, annotating the tables with tolerance regions. This paper use Cascade RCNN with Swin Transformer as baseline models, and BLC is utilized to optimize the detection results. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements with BLC at an IOU of 0.95 on the MatTab, ICDAR2019, and ICDAR2017 datasets. In MatTab, the percentage of correctly detected complete and pure tables increased from 72.3% to 82.1%.},

Both the data collected by UAVs and UAVs themselves are easy targets for hackers. Once a hacker has intercepted communication information or hijacked a UAV, it can cause the disclosure of information and even affect the normal flight of the UAV. In terms of authentication, existing research focuses on building peer-to-peer networks through devices that support blockchain deployments at the edge nodes to form blockchain networks. UAVs cannot run blockchains directly, so fog nodes need to be introduced to assist UAVs in achieving authentication. This paper proposes a UAV authentication solution based on the fog node-assisted blockchain. The solution incorporates smart contracts to ensure trust, along with on-chain registration and authentication for UAVs. In the design of this paper, the main use is made of fog nodes at the edge of each block. The fog nodes serve as agents to register and authenticate the UAVs in their area on the blockchain, thus enabling the authentication of UAVs in different fog node areas. In this paper, the analysis of gas consumption yields a total economic benefit cost of about $$\yen $$ 12.77, which is negligible for the safety of the UAVs. Meanwhile, the paper compares the computational overheads, and within 10 UAVs, the computational overhead of this scheme is less than 50 ms, which is significantly lower than the other two schemes.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is an extremely complex optimization task. Recently, population-based optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithm, have been adopted as search strategies for designing neural networks automatically. Various population-based NAS methods are promising in searching for high-performance neural architectures. The explosion gravitation field algorithm (EGFA) inspired by the formation process of planets is a novel population-based optimization algorithm with excellent global optimization capability and remarkable efficiency, compared with the classical population-based algorithms, such as GA and PSO. Thus, this paper attempts to develop a more efficient NAS method, called EGFA-NAS, by utilizing the work mechanisms of EGFA, which relaxes the search discrete space to a continuous one and then utilizes EGFA and gradient descent to optimize the weights of the candidate architectures in conjunction. To reduce the computational cost, a training strategy by utilizing the population mechanism of EGFA-NAS is proposed. In addition, a weight inheritance strategy for the new generated dust individuals is proposed during the explosion operation to improve performance and efficiency. The performance of EGFA-NAS is investigated in two typical micro search spaces: NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS, and compared with various kinds of state-of-the-art NAS competitors. The experimental results demonstrate that EGFA-NAS is able to match or outperform the state-of-the-art NAS methods on image classification tasks with remarkable efficiency improvement.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved excellent applications in classification or prediction tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Graph Modification Attack (GMA) and Graph Injection Attack (GIA) are commonly attack strategies. Most graph adversarial attack methods are based on GMA, which has a clear drawback: the attacker needs high privileges to modify the original graph, making it difficult to execute in practice. GIA can perform attacks without modifying the original graph. However, many GIA models fail to take care of attack invisibility, i.e., fake nodes can be easily distinguished from the original nodes. To solve the above issue, we propose an imperceptible graph injection attack, named IMGIA. Specifically, IMGIA uses the normal distribution sampling and mask learning to generate fake node features and links respectively, and then uses the homophily unnoticeability constraint to improve the camouflage of the attack. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMGIA performs better than the existing state-of-the-art GIA methods. As an example, IMGIA shows an improvement in performance with an average increase in effectiveness of 2%.},

This study proposes a data-driven evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the service constrained inventory optimization problem using historical data that generated by supply chain digital twins. The objective is to minimize the total costs while satisfying the required service level for a supply chain. The random forest algorithm is used to build surrogate models which can be used to estimate the total costs and service level in a supply chain. The surrogate models are optimized by an ensemble approach-based differential evolution algorithm which can adaptively use different search strategies to improve the performance during the computation process. A three-echelon supply chain digital twin on the geographic information system (GIS) map in real-time is used to examine the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the data-driven evolutionary algorithm can reduce the total costs and maintain the required service level.

Visual predictive models serve as a model of real-world dynamics to comprehend the interactions between the robot and objects. However, prior works in the literature have focused mainly on low-level elementary robot actions, which typically result in lengthy, inefficient, and highly complex robot manipulation. In contrast, humans usually employ top–down thinking of high-level actions rather than bottom–up stacking of low-level ones. To address this limitation, we present a novel formulation for robot manipulation that can be accomplished by pick-and-place, a commonly applied high-level robot action, through grasping. We propose a novel visual predictive model that combines an action decomposer and a video prediction network to learn the intrinsic semantic information of high-level actions. Experiments show that our model can accurately predict the object dynamics (i.e., the object movements under robot manipulation) while trained directly on observations of high-level pick-and-place actions. We also demonstrate that, together with a sampling-based planner, our model achieves a higher success rate using high-level actions on a variety of real robot manipulation tasks.},

In the algorithm, a dual chain coding scheme and a staged-hierarchical decoding approach are, respectively, designed to encode and decode each solution. Six dispatch heuristics and a dynamic adjustment method are introduced to define initial population. To balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, three effective operations are implemented: (1) two new crossover and mutation operators with collaborative mechanism are imposed on genetic algorithm; (2) an adaptive adjustment strategy is introduced to re-optimize better solutions after mutation operations, where ant colony search algorithm and modified greedy heuristic are intelligently switched; (3) a reset strategy with dynamic variable step strategy is embedded to re-generate some non-improved solutions. A Taguchi method of design of experiment is adopted to calibrate the parameter values in the presented algorithm. Comparison experiments are executed on test instances with different scale problems. Computational results show that the proposed CAGA is more effective and efficient than several well-known algorithms in solving the studied problem.},

Another important innovation is the application of maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation for the inertial measurement unit (IMU), which effectively reduces inertial bias and noise in a short time frame. By optimizing the system’s parameters, the constant-velocity model is replaced from the beginning, resulting in improved tracking efficiency. Furthermore, the system incorporates the inertial data in the loop closure thread. The IMU data are employed to determine the translation direction relative to world coordinates and utilized as a necessary condition for loop detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior real-time performance and lower CPU usage compared to the majority of other SLAM systems.},

This study integrates a dynamic DNA-coding method with an encryption model. The model is applied to gray-scale images, where using a predetermined coding rule, every two bits are DNA-encoded in the image. The proposed model generates the key by sending the image and its metadata to hash functions. Following that, the hyperchaotic system constructs three chaotic sequences using the key, and the Lorenz–Liu chaotic system generates a sequence of coding rules. Then, the image is passed to Arnold Transform, where the resulted image is diffused by applying five chaotic maps. Last, using the coding rules, it is DNA-encoded, provided with the chaotic sequences to DNA, and DNA-decoded. Twelve metrics were used to assess the proposed model on ten widely used images. Results show a promising improvement in performance, since it enhanced the security of the model.},

  abstract     = {Tourists share opinions about Points of Interest (POIs) through online posts and social media platforms. Opinion mining is a popular technique for extracting feedback from tourists who visited various places hidden in reviews, which are used in several tourist applications that generally reflect their preference towards POI. On the other hand, a trip schema is difficult for tourists because they must pick up sequential POIs in unknown areas that meet their limitations and preferences. However, most prior trip suggestion methods are suboptimal for several reasons, including that they do not consider valuable user reviews and rely exclusively on left-to-right unidirectional discovery sequence models. This study proposes a Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) POI recommendation system for calculating user similarity based on opinions and preferences. In addition, it presents a method for discovering sequential trip recommendations with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) using a deep learning method. Furthermore, this neural hybrid framework identifies a list of optimal trip candidates by combining personalized POIs with multifaceted context. Furthermore, this method employs the valuable information contained in user posts and their demographic information on social media to mitigate the well-known cold start issue. In the experimental evaluation based on two datasets, Tripadvisor and Yelp, this hybrid method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods when considering F-Score, nDCG, RMSE, and MAP.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate synthetic images including salient targets and abundant texture details. However, traditional techniques and recent deep learning-based approaches have faced challenges in preserving prominent structures and fine-grained features. In this study, we propose a lightweight infrared and visible image fusion network utilizing multi-scale attention modules and hybrid dilated convolutional blocks to preserve significant structural features and fine-grained textural details. First, we design a hybrid dilated convolutional block with different dilation rates that enable the extraction of prominent structure features by enlarging the receptive field in the fusion network. Compared with other deep learning methods, our method can obtain more high-level semantic information without piling up a large number of convolutional blocks, effectively improving the ability of feature representation. Second, distinct attention modules are designed to integrate into different layers of the network to fully exploit contextual information of the source images, and we leverage the total loss to guide the fusion process to focus on vital regions and compensate for missing information. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both visual effects and evaluation metrics. The experimental results on public datasets show that our method can improve the entropy (EN) by 4.80%, standard deviation (SD) by 3.97%, correlation coefficient (CC) by 1.86%, correlations of differences (SCD) by 9.98%, and multi-scale structural similarity (MS_SSIM) by 5.64%, respectively. In addition, experiments with the VIFB dataset further indicate that our approach outperforms other comparable models.},

  abstract     = {Overhead fisheye images can be used for person detection in intelligent monitoring systems. Unlike horizontal images, people in fisheye cameras are generally distributed in any orientation. When the object is rotated, the feature maps from convolutional neural networks have nonlinear variations and lose many orientation features. Transformer can learn the orientation relationship between features. However, a transformer cannot directly extract orientation features and the effectiveness of detecting small objects needs to be improved. In this paper, We propose a novel rotation-equivariant transformer backbone network, which combines group-equivariant convolution with swin transformer to solve these problems. In our proposed model, the rotation-equivariant feature map extracted by group-equivariant convolution contains a large number of orientation features in multiple directions. Aggregates feature in different directions to enhance the communication of orientation features before computing window self-attention. We propose the equivariant-group relation module for evaluating the similarity of the equivariant-group and calculating the aggregation weights. Our network architecture for multi-level receptive field structure can expand the local receptive field to enhance the detection of small objects. The experiments validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on fisheye image datasets MW-R, HABBOF, and CEPDOF. Compared with the swin transformer, the accuracy of our model is improved by 0.3 $$\%$$ , 0.5 $$\%$$ , and 1.3 $$\%$$ , and the accuracy of small object detection in the CEPDOF dataset is improved by 0.73 $$\%$$ .},

However, there are still some critical security attacks and vulnerabilities, including gradients leakage and interference attacks. Meanwhile, communication is another bottleneck in basic FL schemes since large-scale FL parameter transmission leads to inefficient communication, latency, and slower learning processes. To overcome these shortcomings, different communication efficiency strategies and privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques have been proposed. However, a single method can only partially resist privacy attacks. This paper presents a practical, privacy-preserving scheme combining cryptographic techniques and communication networking solutions. We implement Kafka for message distribution, the Diffie–Hellman scheme for secure server aggregation, and gradient differential privacy for interference attack prevention. The proposed approach maintains training efficiency while being able to addressing gradients leakage problems and interference attacks. Meanwhile, the implementation of Kafka and Zookeeper provides asynchronous communication and anonymous authenticated computation with role-based access controls. Finally, we prove the privacy-preserving properties of the proposed solution via security analysis and empirically demonstrate its efficiency and practicality.},

  abstract     = {Lots of real-world optimization problems are inherently constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), but the existing constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) often fail to balance convergence and diversity effectively. Therefore, a novel constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on three-stage multi-population coevolution (CMOEA-TMC) for complex CMOPs is proposed. CMOEA-TMC contains two populations, called mainPop and helpPop, which evolve with and without consideration of constraints, respectively. The proposed algorithm divides the search process into three stages. In the first stage, fast convergence is achieved by transforming the original multi-objective problems into multiple single-objective problems. Coarse-grained parallel evolution of subpopulations in mainPop and guidance information provided by helpPop can facilitate mainPop to quickly approach the Pareto front. In the second stage, the objective function of mainPop changes to the original problem. Coevolution of mainPop and helpPop by sharing offsprings can produce solutions with better diversity. In the third stage, the mining of the global optimal solutions is performed, discarding helpPop to save computational resources. For CMOEA-TMC, the combination of parallel evolution, coevolution, and staging strategy makes it easier for mainPop to converge and maintain good diversity. Experimental results on 33 benchmark CMOPs and a real-world boiler combustion optimization case show that CMOEA-TMC is more competitive than the other five advanced CMOEAs.},

Furthermore, we investigate the challenges associated with multi-criteria decision-making (MCR) using aggregation operators and the TODIM method with complex dual hesitant fuzzy (CDHF) information. Drawing inspiration from arithmetic aggregation operations, we introduce several aggregation operators for complex dual hesitant fuzzy information, including the complex dual hesitant fuzzy weighted average (CDHFWA) operator, complex dual hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted average (CDHFOWA) operator, and complex dual hesitant fuzzy hybrid average (CDHFHA) operator. We thoroughly analyze the unique characteristics of these proposed operators and use them in conjunction with the TODIM method to develop practical approaches for solving complex dual hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. To validate our approach and demonstrate its applicability, we provide a practical example of how the Russia–Ukraine war affected the global economy. Our study confirms the effectiveness of our approach and highlights how it can be used to solve real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a surge of criminal activities with cross-cryptocurrency trades have emerged in Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain platform. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods utilize the traditional machine learning with feature engineering or graph representation learning technique to capture the information in transaction network. However, these methods either ignore the timestamp information and the transaction flow direction information in transaction network or only consider single transaction network, the cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns in Ethereum are usually ignored. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-layer Temporal Transaction Anomaly Detection (MT $$^2$$ AD) model in Ethereum network with graph neural network. Specifically, for a given Ethereum token transaction network, we first extract its initial features including the structure subgraph and edge’s feature. Then, we model the temporal information in subgraph as a series of network snapshots according to the timestamp on each edge and time window. To capture the cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns, we combine the snapshots from multiple token transactions at a given timestamp, and we consider it as a new combined graph. We further use the graph convolution encoder with attention mechanism and pooling operation on this new graph to obtain the graph-level embedding, and we transform the anomaly detection on dynamic multi-layer Ethereum transaction networks as a graph classification task with these graph-level embeddings. MT $$^2$$ AD can integrate the transaction structure feature, edge’s feature and cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns into a framework to perform the anomaly detection with graph neural networks. Experiments on three real-world multi-layer transaction networks show that the proposed MT $$^2$$ AD (0.8789 Precision, 0.9375 Recall, 0.4987 FbMacro and 0.9351 FbWeighted) can achieve the best performance on most evaluation metrics in comparison with some competing approaches, and the effectiveness in consideration of multiple tokens is also demonstrated.},

Nevertheless, it often distorts or fabricates facts in the original article. To address this problem, some existing approaches attempt to evaluate or verify factual consistency, or design models to reduce factual errors. However, most of the efforts either have limited effects or result in lower rouge scores while reducing factual errors. In other words, it is challenging to promote factual consistency while maintaining the informativeness of generated summaries. Inspired by the knowledge graph embedding technique, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal knowledge guided model (CKGM) for AS, which embeds a multimodal knowledge graph (MKG) combining image entity-relationship information and textual factual information (FI) into BERT to accomplish cross-modal information interaction and knowledge expansion. The pre-training method obtains rich contextual semantic information, while the knowledge graph supplements the textual information. In addition, an entity memory embedding algorithm is further proposed to improve information fusion efficiency and model training speed. We elaborately conducted ablation experiments and evaluated our model on the Visual Genome, FewRel, MSCOCO, and CNN/DailyMail datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the FI consistency and informativeness of generated summaries.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most efficient evolution algorithms (ES) for dealing with nonlinear, complicated and difficult global optimization problems. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized in three directions: Firstly, a novel crossover rate (CR) generation scheme based on the zscore value of fitness, named fcr, is introduced. For a minimization problem, the proposed CR generation strategy always assigns a smaller CR value to individual with smaller fitness value. Therefore, the parameters of individuals with better fitness are inherited by their offspring with high probability. In the second direction, the control parameters are adjusted by unused bimodal settings in which each parameter setting is selected according to the evolution status of individual. The third direction of our work is introducing the L1 norm distance as the weights for updating the mean value of crossover rate and scale factor. Theoretically, compared with L2 norm, L1-norm is more efficient to suppress outliers in the difference vector. These modifications are first integrated with the mutation strategy of JADE, then a modified version, named JADEfcr, is proposed. In addition, to improve the optimization ability further, another variant LJADEfcr by using a linear population reduction mechanism is considered. So as to confirm and examine the performance of JADEfcr and LJADEfcr, numerical experiments are conducted on 29 optimization problems defined by CEC2017 benchmark. For JADEfcr, its experimental results are made a comparison with twelve state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparative study demonstrates that in terms of robustness, stability and solution quality, JADEfcr are better and highly competitive with these well-known algorithms. For LJADEfcr, its results are compared with JADEfcr and other nine powerful algorithms including four recent algorithms and five top algorithms on CEC2017 competition. Experimental results indicate that LJADEfcr is superior and statistically competitive with these excellent algorithms in terms of robustness, stability and the quality of the obtained solutions.},

  abstract     = {The differential evolution algorithm based on multi-population mainly improves its performance through mutation strategy and grouping mechanism. However, each sub-population plays a different role in different periods of iterative evolution. If each sub-population is assigned the same computing resources, it will waste a lot of computing resources. In order to rationally distribute computational resources, an integrated differential evolution of multi-population based on contribution degree (MDE-ctd) is put forth in this work. In MDE-ctd, the whole population is divided into three sub-populations according to different update strategies: archival, exploratory, and integrated sub-populations. MDE-ctd dynamically adjusts computing resources according to the contribution degree of each sub-population. It can effectively use computing resources and speed up convergence. In the updating process of integrated sub-populations, a mutation strategy pool and two-parameter value pools are used to maintain population diversity. The experimental results of CEC2005 and CEC2014 benchmark functions show that MDE-ctd outperforms other state-of-art differential evolution algorithms based on multi-population, especially when it deals with highly complex optimization problems.

  abstract     = {The augmented randomized complete block design (ARCBD) is widely used in plant breeding programs to screen numerous new treatments. The error variance is estimated based on the replicated control treatments run over a randomized complete block design and is used to test the new treatments that are administrated each once in the extended units of the blocks. However, one or more observations corresponding to the control treatments may be missed in experiments, making difficulties, e.g., biased estimates. An approximate common approach to deal with this problem is the imputation of the estimated value which is with some uncertainties. Moreover, in real-life experiments, there are more sources of uncertainty that cause conflict-indeterminate, vague, imprecise, and erroneous data that increases the complexity of the analysis. In this paper, an exact scheme is utilized to deal with a missing control treatment in ARCBD. To overcome the problem of indeterminacies in data, a novel neutrosophic analysis approach is proposed. Specifically, the problem of a missing value in an ARCBD for an uncertain environment is resolved analytically by considering an augmented incomplete block design in the framework of neutrosophic statistics so-called neutrosophic augmented randomized complete block design (NARCBD). In this approach, by proposing the neutrosophic model, the neutrosophic estimations as well as the mathematical neutrosophic adjusted sums of squares are derived and the analysis of variance table is provided. The new model is applied to the neutrosophic genotype data example of safflower and assessed by a simulation study. Furthermore, a code in the R software was written to analyze the data based on the proposed approach to fill the calculation gap for data analysis in NARCBD with a missing value. In light of the results observed, it can be concluded that the neutrosophic exact proposed method performs better than the classic in the presence of uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multi-objective feature selection problems are widely existing in the fields of text classification, image processing, and biological omics. Numerous features usually mean more correlation and redundancy between features, so effective features are usually sparse. SparseEA is an evolutionary algorithm for solving Large-scale Sparse Multi-objective Optimization Problems (i.e., most decision variables of the optimal solutions are zero). It determines feature Scores by calculating the fitness of individual features, which does not reflect the correlation between features well. In this manuscript, ReliefF was used to calculate the weights of features, with unimportant features being removed first. Then combine the weights calculated by ReliefF with Scores of SparseEA to guide the evolution process. Moreover, the Scores of features remain constant throughout all runs in SparseEA. Therefore, the fitness values of excellent and poor individuals in each iteration are used to update the Scores. In addition, difference operators of Differential Evolution are introduced into SparseEA to increase the diversity of solutions and help the algorithm jump out of the local optimal solution. Comparative experiments are performed on large-scale datasets selected from scikit-feature repository. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the original SparseEA and the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

General reconstruction methods for recovering the field, especially the deep learning with more parameters and better representational ability, usually require large amounts of labeled data which is unaffordable in practice. To solve the problem, this paper proposes uncertainty guided ensemble self-training (UGE-ST), using plentiful unlabeled data to improve reconstruction performance and reduce the required labeled data. A novel self-training framework with the ensemble teacher and pre-training student designed to improve the accuracy of the pseudo-label and remedy the impact of noise is first proposed. On the other hand, uncertainty guided learning is proposed to encourage the model to focus on the highly confident regions of pseudo-labels and mitigate the effects of wrong pseudo-labeling in self-training, improving the performance of the reconstruction model. Experiments including the airfoil velocity and pressure field reconstruction and the electronic components’ temperature field reconstruction indicate that our UGE-ST can save up to 90% of the data with the same accuracy as supervised learning.},

  abstract     = {Security of Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) networks has evolved as a vital issue in recent years. The IoMT networks are designed to link patients with caregivers. All reports, data, and medical signals are transferred over these networks. Hence, these networks require robust and secure access strategies for patients to send their vital data or reports. Hence, hacking of these networks may lead to harmful effects on patients. One of the vulnerable points to hacking in these networks is the access point. Access to these networks could be performed with biometrics. The popular biometric traits for this purpose are biomedical signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as they are continuously monitored and measured for patients. A common thread between all biometric authentication systems is the possibility of losing the biometric traits forever if hacking attempts manage to concur the biometric template storage. A new trend in the field of biometric authentication is to avoid the utilization of original biometrics in access control processes. A possible alternative is to use cancelable biometrics instead. Cancelable biometrics can be generated through encryption schemes or non-invertible transforms. This paper adopts both strategies in a unified framework for cancelable ECG signal recognition that can be used in the access step of IoMT networks. The proposed framework begins with applying a non-invertible transformation on the ECG signals through fuzzy logic to change the dynamic range of the signals. As this process is non-invertible in nature, it prevents the recovery of the original ECG signals from the processed versions, which is the main target of cancelable biometric systems. After that, lightweight encryption through XOR operation with user-specific patterns is implemented. Here, the high complexity of full encryption schemes that need a large processing burden is eliminated. The addition of the encryption stage enhances the security of cancelable biometric traits, allowing a hybrid nature of the proposed cancelable biometric framework through the merging of non-invertible transforms and encryption algorithms. Moreover, an FPGA hardware implementation is introduced for real implementation of the proposed ECG-based cancelable biometric recognition framework. This hardware can accompany the user to allow access of the IoMT network when requested. Experimental results show a promising performance of the proposed framework with a large Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AROC) of 99.5% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.058%.},

Second, an improved multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (IMEDA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the IMDEA, an effective initialization strategy is designed for obtaining a superior population. Then, three statistical models are constructed, which include two tasks existing in the same rescue team, the probability of first task being processed by a rescue team, and the adjacency between two tasks. Afterward, an improved sampling method based on referenced sequence is employed to efficiently generate offspring population. Three multi-objective local search methods are presented to improve the exploitation in promising areas around elite individuals. Furthermore, the parameter calibration and effectiveness of components of IMEDA are tested through experiments. Finally, the comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms demonstrates that IMEDA is a high-performing approach for the considered problem.},

  abstract     = {Mobile cable-driven parallel robots (MCDPRs) offer expanded motion capabilities and workspace compared to traditional cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) by incorporating mobile bases. However, additional mobile bases introduce more degree-of-freedom (DoF) and various constraints to make their motion planning a challenging problem. Despite several motion planning methods for MCDPRs being developed in the literature, they are only applicable to known environments, and autonomous navigation in unknown environments with obstacles remains a challenging issue. The ability to navigate autonomously is essential for MCDPRs, as it opens up possibilities for the robot to perform a broad range of tasks in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, this study proposes an online motion planning method for MCDPRs based on the pipeline of rapidly exploring random tree (RRT). The presented approach explores unknown environments efficiently to produce high-quality collision-free trajectories for MCDPRs. To ensure the optimal execution of the planned trajectories, the study introduces two indicators specifically designed for the mobile bases and the end-effector. These indicators take into account various performance metrics, including trajectory quality and kinematic performance, enabling the determination of the final following trajectory that best aligns with the desired objectives of the robot. Moreover, to effectively handle unknown environments, a vision-based system utilizing an RGB-D camera is developed, allowing for precise MCDPR localization and obstacle detection, ultimately enhancing the autonomy and adaptability of the MCDPR. Finally, the extensive simulations conducted using dynamic simulation software (CoppeliaSim) and the on-board real-world experiments with a self-built MCDPR prototype demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Evolutionary algorithm (EA) has been successfully applied to the automatic design of CNNs; however, the inherent stochastic search of EA tends to cause “experience loss” and requires very large computational resources. To deal with this problem, a maximal sparse convex surrogate model with updated empirical information is proposed in this paper to guide the evolutionary process of CNN design. This sparse convex function is transformed from a non-convex function to a maximized sparse convex function, which can better utilize the prior empirical knowledge to assist the evolutionary search. In addition, a balance strategy between computational resources and accuracy is proposed in the selection of reasonable network architectures. The proposed fully automatic design method of CNN is applied to the segmentation of steel microstructure images, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning, face forgery detection methods have also achieved remarkable progress. However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation on low-quality compressed face images. It is due to: (a) The image artifacts will be blurred in the process of image compression, resulting in the model learning insufficient artifact traces; (b) Low-quality images will introduce a lot of noise information, and minimizing the training error causes the model to absorb all correlations in the training dataset recklessly, leading to the over-fitting problem. To solve the above problems, we consider learning domain invariant representations to inscribe the correct relevance, i.e., artifacts, to improve the robustness of low-quality images. Specifically, we propose a novel face forgery detector, called DIFLD. The model has the following components: (1) a high-frequency invariant feature learning module(hf-IFLM), which effectively retrieves the blurred artifacts in low-quality compressed images; and (2) a high-dimensional feature distribution learning module(hd-FDLM), that guides the network to learn more about the consistent features of distribution. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discriminative correct artifact features in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method is more robust to image quality variations, especially in low-quality images. Our proposed method achieves a 3.67% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging dataset NeuralTextures.},

First, a discrete-time distributed optimization algorithm with fixed step size is proposed to achieve linear convergence. Second, by introducing a rotation variable into the optimization problem, the joint angular velocity of manipulator and the velocity of moving platform change more smoothly. Third, a virtual leader-follower transport strategy is used in this paper to improve the stability of the multi-robot system. In the physical experiment, the trajectory of each end-effector matches the expected trajectory, and the center trajectory of the transport object almost coincides with the virtual leader trajectory with acceptable error.

  abstract     = {The solar system boundary exploration mission has the characteristics of long flight time, high fuel consumption, complex gravity-assist sequence and strict constraints. Therefore, the number of decision variables and the search space of the transfer trajectory are very large, resulting in poor convergence and efficiency of the global search of the metaheuristic algorithm. Moreover, the existing gravity assist space pruning algorithm is no longer applicable for solar system boundary exploration. To effectively reduce the search space and improve the effect of trajectory optimization, an improved gravity assist space pruning algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a unique pruning procedure is used to effectively prune the search space, a shape of solution space box bounds combining rectangle and rhombus is adopted, and a method to automatically determine the solution space box bounds is presented. To verify the effectiveness of the improved gravity assist space pruning algorithm, the sensitivity of pruning effect to parameters is analyzed and the optimization effects of three typical metaheuristics are compared. The optimization results of 50 repeated runs of the differential evolution algorithm in the entire search space and the solution space box bounds are compared. Simulation results show that the performance of differential evolution algorithm is better than bat algorithm and firefly algorithm. And the improved pruning algorithm can increase the efficiency of subsequent optimization by more than eleven times and the convergence probability of the objective function by fifty of times. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed method for the solar system boundary exploration are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {View-invariant action recognition has been widely researched in various applications, such as visual surveillance and human–robot interaction. However, view-invariant human action recognition is challenging due to the action occlusions and information loss caused by view changes. Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of body joints and minimizing representation discrepancy between different views could be a valuable solution for view-invariant human action recognition. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Attention Network (DANet) aims to learn robust video representation for view-invariant action recognition. The DANet is composed of relation-aware spatiotemporal self-attention and spatiotemporal cross-attention modules. The relation-aware spatiotemporal self-attention module learns representative and discriminative action features. This module captures local and global long-range dependencies, as well as pairwise relations among human body parts and joints in the spatial and temporal domains. The cross-attention module learns view-invariant attention maps and generates discriminative features for semantic representations of actions in different views. We exhaustively evaluate our proposed approach on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and UESTC large-scale challenging datasets with multi-type evaluation metrics including Cross-Subject, Cross-View, Cross-Set, and Arbitrary-view. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in view-invariant action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Very recently, with the widespread research of deep learning, its achievements are increasingly evident in image inpainting tasks. However, many existing multi-stage methods fail to effectively inpainting the larger missing areas, their common drawback is that the result of each stage is easily misguided by the wrong content generated in the previous stage. To solve this issue, in this paper, a novel one-stage generative adversarial network based on the progressive decoding architecture and gradient guidance. Firstly, gradient priors are extracted at the encoder stage to be passed to the decoding branch, and multiscale attention fusion group is used to help the network understand the image features. Secondly, multiple parallel decoding branches fill and refine the missing regions by top-down passing the reconstructed priors. This progressively guided repair avoids the detrimental effects of inappropriate priors. The joint guidance of features and gradient priors helps the restoration results contain the correct structure and rich details. And the progressive guidance is achieved by our fusion strategy, combining reimage convolution and design channel coordinate attention to fuse and reweight the features of different branches. Finally, we use the multiscale fusion to merge the feature maps at different scales reconstructed by the last decoding branch and map them to the image space, which further improves the semantic plausibility of the restoration results. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the qualitative and quantitative results of our computationally efficient model are competitive with those of state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this problem, we propose a dynamic adaptive procedure based on particle swarm optimization which dynamically updates weights in every crawling step and put forward a new focused crawler, called FCPSO. In FCPSO, we utilize domain ontology for topic representation and a comprehensive priority evaluation method to evaluate the topical priority of hyperlink. Furthermore, we construct a multi-objective optimization model for hyperlink selection, in which the strategy of the non-dominant sorting with the nearest farthest candidate solution is proposed to select Pareto-optimal hyperlinks and guide the crawling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FCPSO over other strategies that it can obtain more topic-relevant webpages with less time consumption.},

To tackle this issue, we propose a many-objective evolutionary algorithm with metric-based reference vector adjustment named MBRA. To adjust RVs periodically and conditionally, we use the improvement rate of convergence degree of subproblems computed through d1 distance to reflect the whole convergence of the population. Only when the subproblems are considered convergent on the whole, are RVs allowed to be adjusted: delete the invalid RVs associated with no solutions and add new ones using the farthest solution in the subregion of the most crowded RVs for diversity. Besides, in mating selection and environmental selection, we adopt the sum of objectives and fitness-based sorting based on $$I_{\varepsilon + }$$ as the secondary principles to promote convergence, respectively. Validated through extensive experiments, MBRA is effective and competitive on many-objective optimization problems, especially for problems with irregular Pareto fronts.},

Language-based task planning methods offer practicality in receiving commands from humans in real-life scenarios and require only low-cost labeled data. However, existing methods often rely on sequence models for planning, which primarily focus on mapping language to sequences of sub-tasks while neglecting the knowledge about tasks and objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge-based task planning approach called Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN). It is devised with a novel structure that combined GCN (Kipf and Welling in International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017) and LSTM (Hochreiter and chmidhuber in Neural Comput 9 (8): 1735-1780, 1997. https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735 ) which enables it to leverage knowledge graph data and historical predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the impressive task planning success rate of $${95.7\%}$$ , surpassing the best baseline method significantly, which achieves $${78.7\%}$$ . Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of multi-task manipulation across a specific set of 20 tasks within a simulated environment. Notably, RGCN combined with pre-trained primitive tasks exhibits the highest success rate compared with state-of-art multi-task learning methods. Our method is proven to be significant for language-conditioned task planning and is qualified for instructing robots for multi-task manipulation.},

DDCSAEA creates a low-dimensional solution space by downscaling the target high-dimensional space via principal component analysis and collects promising candidates in the reduced space by collaborating a surrogate-assisted evolutionary sampling with differential mutation. An autoencoder is used to perform the feature reconstruction on the collected candidates for infill-sampling in the target high-dimensional space to sequentially refine the neighborhood landscapes of the optimal solution.

The RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications can support enhanced V2X applications for connected and automated vehicles. The design of RIS-assisted mmWave V2X communications is though not exempt of challenges as a result of fast time-varying propagation and highly dynamic vehicular networks and topologies. To address some of these challenges, we propose an attention-deep reinforcement learning jointly beamforming based on tensor decomposition for RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO system to improving the safety and traffic efficiency of cooperative automated driving. The received signal of the vehicle is decomposed into four-dimensional tensors and study the channel, frequency and time attention (CFTA) algorithm using the low order tensor characteristics of mmWave channels. This algorithm can extract the frequency and time characteristics of the channel, and obtain the millimeter wave characteristic channel between the corresponding base station (BS) and the vehicles. The problem of jointly optimization of beamforming matrix at the BS and the phase shift matrix on the RIS is constructed and solved using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Unlike traditional alternating optimization methods, the integration of DRL techniques into the optimal design of the system enables the observation of immediate rewards, learning from the environment and improving it to obtain optimal solutions to high-dimensional jointly beamforming optimization problems ultimately.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the feature selection problem for gene expression profiles. Feature selection based on fuzzy neighborhood rough sets is very important in gene expression profiles. The process of extracting key features in gene expression profiles may have two disadvantages: (1) it may generate many redundant features, thus reducing the classification accuracy, and (2) it may ignore some information. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model based on feature selection; this model adopts the nonnegative principle of fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy to evaluate the importance of a candidate feature gene. Based on the fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model, this paper proposes a new feature gene selection algorithm: the fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy (FNJE) algorithm. In the model, first, fuzzy neighborhood particles and fuzzy decision-making are combined with the uncertainty measure of joint entropy to construct a fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model. Second, the importance degree of a feature is introduced as the measurement standard of candidate feature genes to evaluate the importance of each feature. Third, the algorithm uses the importance of candidate features in selecting features to reduce the redundancy of the selected features and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, based on the UCI and gene datasets, we conduct a series of experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can select fewer feature genes and achieve higher classification accuracy. Compared with the other four algorithms, our proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy by 0.4 $$\%$$ $$-$$ 10.42 $$\%$$ and 1.16 $$\%$$ $$-$$ 15.18 $$\%$$ and can reach maximum accuracy values of 90.52 $$\%$$ and 87.02 $$\%$$ with the linear-SVM and KNN classifiers, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing highly individual-specific genomic data to understand genetic interactions in cancer development is still challenging, with significant implications for the discovery of individual biomarkers as well as personalized medicine. With the rapid development of deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed to analyze a wide range of biomolecular networks. However, many neural networks are limited to black box models, which are only capable of making predictions, and they are often challenged to provide reliable biological and clinical insights. In this research, for sample-specific networks, a novel end-to-end hierarchical graph neural network with interpretable modules is proposed, which learns structural features at multiple scales and incorporates a soft mask layer in extracting subgraphs that contribute to classification. The perturbations caused by the input graphs&#39; deductions are used to evaluate key gene clusters, and the samples are then grouped into classes to produce both sample- and stage-level explanations. Experiments on four gene expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) show that the proposed model not only rivals the advanced GNN methods in cancer staging but also identifies key gene clusters that have a great impact on classification confidence, providing potential targets for personalized medicine.},

  abstract     = {Recently, segmentation-based approaches have been proposed to tackle arbitrary-shaped text detection. The trade-off between speed and accuracy is still a challenge that hinders its deployment in practical applications. Previous methods adopt complex pipelines to improve accuracy while ignoring inference speed. Moreover, the performance of most efficient scene text detectors often suffers from weak feature extraction when equipping lightweight networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation method for efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection, termed kernel-mask knowledge distillation. Our approach equips a low computational-cost visual transformer module (VTM) and a feature adaptation layer to make full use of feature-based and response-based knowledge in distillation. More specifically, first, the text features are obtained by aggregating the multi-level information extracted in the respective backbones of the teacher and student networks. Second, the text features are respectively sent to the VTM to enhance the feature representation ability. Then, we distill the feature-based and response-based kernel knowledge of the teacher network to obtain an efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection model. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. It is worth noting that our method can achieve a competitive F-measure of 86.92% at 34.5 FPS on Total-text. Code is available at https://github.com/giganticpower/KKDnet .},

  abstract     = {Due to the barriers of finance, talent, and technology, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have faced uncertainty and risks if they fail to engage in digital transformation (DT). A good choice is for SMEs to choose solutions already on the market, provided by professional DT solutions suppliers. However, how to choose the most suitable DT solution remains a major challenge for SMEs. Thus, to help SMEs to select an appropriate DT solution, we proposed a novel, prospect theory-based evidential reasoning (ER) assessment method under a hesitant picture fuzzy linguistic sets (HPFLSs) environment. First, the novel distance measures of picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) and HPFLSs are proposed, then, based on the proposed distance measures of HPFLSs, novel, prospect theory formula are constructed. Additionally, a novel HPFLS ER method was developed to aggregate the evaluation information. Afterward, an assessment and selection decision approach for DT solutions for SMEs, based on the prospect theory-based ER of HPFLSs, was conducted. Finally, actual examples of DT solutions for SMEs to illustrate the decision-making approach were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the conclusions were summarized.},

The goal is to produce a AGV transportation solution that minimizes the total cost, including travel cost, time cost, and AGV cost. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming model is established. To improve the transportation efficiency, a dynamic calculation method is developed. In the DABC algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a median based probability selection method are used. For improving the quality of the solutions, four effective neighborhood operators are introduced. In the local search, a rule is given to save the operation time and a problem-based search operator is proposed to improve the quality of the best individual. Finally, a series of comparison experiments were implemented with the iterative greedy algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm, discrete artificial bee colony algorithm, improved harmony search, and hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm. The results show that the proposed DABC algorithm has high performance on solving the delivery and pickup problem.},

  abstract     = {Traffic volume propagating from upstream road link to downstream road link is the key parameter for designing intersection signal timing scheme. Recent works successfully used graph convolutional network (GCN) and specific time-series model to forecast traffic flow by capturing the spatial–temporal features. However, accurately predicting traffic propagation flow (tpf) is challenging, since the classical GCN model only considers the influence of adjacent road link. In complex urban road network, specific traffic propagation flow (tpf) is affected by various spatial features, such as adjacent tpf, which influences from tpf with same upstream link and tpf with same downstream link. Thus, we proposed a multi-graph learning-based model named TPP-GCN (traffic propagation prediction-graph convolutional network) in this paper to predict the traffic propagation flow in urban road network. The TPP-GCN model captures not only the temporal features but also multi-spatial features based on multi-layer convolution. We validated the model using real-world traffic flow data derived from taxi GPS data in Shenzhen, China. Finally, we compare and evaluate the proposed model with the existing models across several prediction scales.},

  abstract     = {Entity resolution, accurately identifying various representations of the same real-world entities, is a crucial part of data integration systems. While existing learning-based models can achieve good performance, the models are extremely dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. In this paper, the MixER model is proposed to alleviate these problems. The MixER utilizes our newly designed data augmentation method called EMix. The EMix can map discrete entity records to continuous latent space variables (e.g., probability distributions) and then linearly interpolate entity records in latent space to generate many augmented training samples. The matching model is further optimized based on the augmented data to strengthen its generalization capability. The MixER model achieves significant strengths in the data sensitivity experiments when training data is below 50. In robustness experiments, the MixER model presents an absolute performance advantage when the label noise exceeds 20%. In addition, ablation experiments demonstrate that the newly developed EMix can effectively improve the generalization ability of the matching model. The overall experimental results prove that the MixER model exhibited excellent data sensitivity and robustness over the current state-of-the-art methods.},
