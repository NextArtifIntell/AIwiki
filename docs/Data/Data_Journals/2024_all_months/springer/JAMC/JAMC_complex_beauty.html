  abstract     = {The main objective of this article is to study the effectiveness of wearing masks and implementing active screening and testing to contain the spread of COVID-19 during stages when the disease has already started to spread. This work innovates by focusing on the basic measures of mask use and active screening and testing, which are frequently overlooked in the literature in favor of more expensive interventions like travel bans and vaccinations. We study their effectiveness and determine the optimal way to implement them. To achieve this goal, we develop a stochastic SEIR model that includes four populations: susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals. We integrate two control functions into the model to represent mask-wearing and active screening and testing interventions. Using an adapted formulation of Pontryagin’s maximum principle suitable for the stochastic context, we aim to find the optimal approach to implementing these controls. We combine the Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM) with a special Runge–Kutta scheme for stochastic differential equations to solve the optimality system for our stochastic optimal control problem. Our study demonstrates that even when the disease has begun to spread, using both mask-wearing and active screening and testing can lead to significant reductions in the numbers of exposed and infected individuals, offering a cost-effective strategy for countries with limited resources.},

Next, by replacing the approximate signals in objective functions, using two dimensional Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule and necessary optimal conditions the main problem is converted to a system of algebraic equations, which can be solved easily. Theoretically, the convergence analysis of the proposed method is stated. Moreover, to demonstrate the efficiency of the method, three test problems solved.},

The previous studies in this area have mainly focused on cases involving small shifts, but practical scenarios may involve shifts of arbitrary sizes, both larger and smaller. Despite this, the 2D singularly perturbed elliptic differential-difference equations involving shifts of arbitrary sizes have remained unsolved. To address this challenge, a fitted operator finite difference method is developed on a special equidistant mesh that ensures the nodal point coincides with the shifts after discretization.. The scheme is rigorously analyzed to prove parameter uniform a priori error estimate in $$L_{\infty }$$ norm. To illustrate the theoretical findings, we provide numerical results and implement numerical experiments to investigate the effect of shifts on the solution.},

In addition, we find the relationship between the Sombor index and other topological indices.

This communication studies the higher-order Neighborhood Harmonic index ( $$NH_{\alpha }$$ ) and presents an alternative perspective on the correlation of the second-order Neighborhood Harmonic index ( $$NH_{2}$$ ) with the normal boiling point of straight-chain Alkanes and Octane Isomers. Based on the findings of this study, it can be observed that with an increase in the molecular weight of an straight-chain alkane, there is a concurrent elevation in both the normal boiling point and the collective involvement of $$NH_{2}$$ along all conceivable internal C–C–C routes. As all the isomers of Octane possess the same molecular weights, we first categorize the isomers into distinct groups and then establish a meaningful connection with their respective normal boiling points. In case of normal boiling point (computed using modified Frost-Kalkwarf equation), it is found that, the proposed index i.e., Second-Order Neighborhood Harmonic index has good predictive ability with a probability of $$90\%$$ for absolute relative errors of less than $$6.29\%$$ .

To solve the general problem of minimizing the weighted sum of earliness, tardiness, due date assignment cost and resource consumption cost (the weights are job-dependent weights), we propose lower and upper bounds to speed up the search process of the branch-and-bound algorithm. To solve this problem quickly and accurately, we also propose a heuristic algorithm. Computational results are tested to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.},

In this study, we initiate the concepts of strong paired domination in interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs based on perfect strong matching by using strong arcs. In the beginning, we introduce different types of strong dominating sets in interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs such as strong paired dominating set, strong connected dominating set, strong total dominating set etc. Then based on these terms, we provide several characterizations of complete interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs, complete bipartite interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs and some other types of interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs. Afterwards, we introduce the terms private strong neighbor, strong irredundant set, maximal strong irredundant set, open strong irredundant set, open private strong neighbor, private strong dominating set etc for interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs. We also produce some useful results related to some special interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs with respect to these terms. Finally, we provide the application of dominations in interval-valued picture fuzzy graphs in accessing selection criteria within certain sports networks by identifying a game that has the maximum facilities offered by the host country.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the relationship between fuzzy median graphs and blocks, which are important concepts in fuzzy graph theory, particularly in terms of connectivity. The main focus is on the fuzzy median property of a block that has at least four vertices and does not have any fuzzy bridges. The paper also examines the fuzzy median property of isomorphic images of median graphs and explores the median behavior of isometric subgraphs of a fuzzy median graph. Furthermore, the paper investigates the median property of fuzzy median graphs under graph operations. The main concern of the paper is to determine whether the union of two fuzzy median graphs retains fuzzy median behavior. The paper studies the connection between fully strong gated fuzzy graphs and fuzzy median graphs. It also explores whether the gate of an induced subgraph can also be in the median set of any triple of vertices. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel centrality measure called median centrality to identify the influential nodes in a network. The sum of the median centrality of all vertices in a fuzzy median graph will always be one.},

For the GDD setting, the due dates are assigned to the jobs according to their position in the sequence rather than their identity. Thus, assuming that due dates are numbered in non-decreasing order, the jth due date refers to the job assigned to the jth position. The learning effect is a model where completing former jobs decreases the completion time of latter jobs. The processing time is still part of the input, depending on how many jobs have already been scheduled. Allowing the option of job rejection means that not all jobs must be processed. In this case, the scheduler is penalized for each rejected job, and an input parameter bounds the total rejection cost. Two objective functions are considered with the above-mentioned settings: minimizing total tardiness and minimizing maximal tardiness. The problems are polynomially solvable when there is no option for job rejection. Otherwise, both are shown to be NP-hard, pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solutions are proposed, and numerical experiments are provided.},

To explore the rumor diffusion mechanism and efficient control strategies in multilingual online environments, a novel stochastic rumor-spreading model with the generalized nonlinear diffusion form is proposed. Firstly, we strictly prove the positive and existence uniqueness of the model solution to ensure that it corresponds to the realistic meaning. Then, the asymptotic behavior around the rumor-free equilibrium is acquired by using graph theorey and stochastic stability theory. Besides, we obtain conditions for the stationary distribution of stochastic rumor-spreading model based on the Kasminskii’s theory. Moreover, an event-triggered discontinuous feedback (ETDF) control strategy that can be applied to online networks is proposed, which initiates control only when an alert threshold is exceeded and updates the control intensity when an event-triggered condition is reached. Finally, numerical simulations verify the correctness of the theoretical results, and an actual multilingual Internet rumor case shows the applicability of the model.},

With the growing focus on carbon nanotubes, their junctions have garnered increased attention for their applications in various scientific fields. Chemical structures can be expressed in graphs, where atoms represent vertices, and the bonds between the atoms are called edges. To obtain the exact position of an atom, which is unique from all the atoms, several atoms are selected, this is called resolving set. The minimum number of atoms in the resolving set is called the metric dimension. In this paper, we have computed the metric dimension of carbon nanotube Y-junctions, assigning each atom a unique identifier to facilitate precise location. The metric dimension is constant for all the values of the 3 parameters included to develop a Y-junction. It resulted in 3 metric dimensions for the entire Y-junction. It means that whatever the order and quantity of nanotubes attached to it, the metric dimension will remain constant with number 3.},

Presently, the time complexity of existing SSSPs algorithms is at least $${O}(m + nlogn)$$ . Therefore, it is still significant to design SSSPs algorithms with higher computational efficiency. In our former works, the efficiency of computing strongly connected components (SCCs) has enhanced through utilizing rough sets theory (RST). Thus, this paper also attempts to compute SSSPs more efficiently based on RST. Firstly, the graph concept of SSSPs is analyzed in the framework of RST, to provide the theoretical basis of computing SSSPs through RST method. Secondly, k-step R-related set (one RST operator) is utilized for traversing those vertices which are reachable from the source vertex. Thirdly, a marking strategy is introduced to narrow the search scope of SSSPs, which can further promote the efficiency of computing SSSPs. Finally, based on RST and marking strategy, an algorithm named 3SP@RM is put forward for finding SSSPs of unweighted directed graphs. The comparative experiment is conducted over 14 datasets. Related results display that 3SP@RM algorithm can correctly compute SSSPs of unweighted directed graphs, and the efficiency of 3SP@RM algorithm exceeds that of two existing similar methods. Even the larger scale of dataset is, more efficiency advantage 3SP@RM algorithm has.},

Additionally, a rectangular region reduction technique is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Based on the output-space search, we propose a new branch-and-bound algorithm for tackling the GLMP or EP.

  abstract     = {In linear coding theory, self-dual cyclic codes are especially notable for their efficiency in both encoding and decoding processes. This research focuses on the enumeration of such codes over finite fields, denoted as $${\mathbb {F}}_q$$ , where $$q = 2^m$$ and m is the field size. Traditionally, investigations in this area have faced significant constraints primarily due to two factors. The first is the length of the code, n, with a focus on excluding prime factors congruent to 1 modulo 8. The second limitation pertains to the binary case, specifically when $$m = 1$$ . To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the concept of the exact power character of 2, a novel approach that offers a significant methodological advancement. By reframing the existing numerical constraints in terms of three readily computable parameters, this approach effectively sidesteps the limitations previously existing in the field. This development not only broadens the scope of possible code lengths and field sizes but also enhances the potential for practical applications of self-dual cyclic codes in various areas of information theory and communications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on the weighted alternating direction implicit method, we investigate a second-order scheme with variable steps for the two-dimensional time-fractional telegraph equation (TFTE). Firstly, we derive a coupled system of the original equation by the symmetric fractional-order reduction (SFOR) method. Then the renowned L2- $$1_\sigma $$ formula on graded meshes is employed to approximate the Caputo derivative and a weighted ADI scheme for the coupled problem is constructed. In addition, with the aid of the Grönwall inequality, the unconditional stability and convergence of the weighted ADI scheme are analyzed. Finally, the numerical experiments are shown to verify the effectiveness and correctness of theoretical results.},

By selecting the taxis coefficient and the discrete time delay as bifurcation parameters, we first derive an algorithm for calculating the third-order truncated normal form of Turing-Hopf bifurcation for this system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived algorithm, we investigate a delayed diffusive predator–prey system with taxis, fear effect, and square root functional response function. We employ stability theory and bifurcation theory to study the existence of codimension-two Turing-Hopf bifurcation and obtain the third-order truncated normal form of Turing-Hopf bifurcation using the derived algorithm. With the obtained third-order truncated normal form of Turing-Hopf bifurcation for this practical system, we can analytically determine the dynamical classifications near the Turing-Hopf bifurcation point.

  abstract     = {The problem of assessing and prioritizing various economic systems and their types from the perspective of decision-making is a complex problem, which involves the evaluation of multiple conflicting criteria in the presence of uncertainty and incomplete information. The imprecisions of fuzzy set theory and the existing decision-making (DM) approaches could not fully take into account the complexities and subtleties that are embedded in this problem. Hence, the need to create a better DM model that can handle both the bipolar and complex nature of the economy and come up with a more comprehensive and robust solution. Thus, in this manuscript, we devise a DM technique in the setting of the bipolar complex fuzzy set (BCFS). For this, we firstly investigate various generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean operators in the setting of BCFS that are bipolar complex fuzzy generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean, bipolar complex fuzzy weighted generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean, bipolar complex fuzzy generalized geometric Maclaurin symmetric mean, and bipolar complex fuzzy weighted generalized geometric Maclaurin symmetric mean operators. After that, we use a newly developed decision-making technique in the context of economic systems and find that the traditional economic system is the finest economic system. In the last, we compare the developed work with a certain number of prevailing theories to reveal the supremacy and advantages. The proposed work.},

These three different cases of given information are coupled with fifth-order linear and nonlinear differential equations, and the method proves to be effective in these cases. The outcomes of the Haar wavelet collocation technique are compared with approaches found in existing literature.

We formulate a deterministic model, which takes the form of a delay equation for the population birth rate. We also formulate an individual based stochastic model, and study the relationship between the two models. In particular the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model is compared to that of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. Since the quasi-stationary birth rate cannot be obtained explicitly, we derive a formula to approximate it. We show that the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model can be obtained as the large population limit of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. This relation suggests that the deterministic model is a good approximation of the stochastic model when the number of individuals is sufficiently large.},

This model is described as a system of coupled partial differential equations that characterize the dynamics of water motion below a pressure surface in oceanic or sea environments, which is distinguished by the fact that the vertical dimension is smaller in magnitude than the typical horizontal dimension. The modified generalized Mittag-Leffler function method is an effective and innovative analytical technique to acquire convenient approximate solutions for this fractional order model. The methodology of proposed method to solve general fractional nonlinear partial differential equations is presented. Also, the convergence of this method and estimated error analysis for the projected solutions are proved. The approximate solutions gained by our method when $$\alpha =1$$ are compared with the recognized exact solutions and outcomes of other techniques in the same conditions published in the literature, including the residual power series method, natural transform decomposition method, modified homotopy analysis transform method and new iterative method. Moreover, some two and three-dimensional graphs and tabulated data display a simulation of acquired results. Also, the influence of $$\alpha $$ on the behavior of solutions is exhibited. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the suggested method, including not requiring any linearization or perturbation and transformations, easily computable components, implemented directly to the problems, satisfactory approximate solutions and a small absolute error.},

The ABS matrix of G is the square matrix of order n whose (i, j)-entry is equal to $${\sqrt{({d_{i}+d_{j}-2})/({d_{i}+d_{j}})}}$$ if the i-th vertex and the j-th vertex of G are adjacent, and 0 otherwise. Let $$\rho _1\ge \rho _2\ge \cdots \ge \rho _{n}$$ be the eigenvalues of the ABS matrix of G. Then the ABS Estrada index of G, denoted by $$E_{ABS}(G)$$ , is defined as $$E_{ABS}(G)=\sum _{i=1}^{n}e^{\rho _i}$$ . In this paper, the chemical importance of the ABS Estrada index is investigated and it is shown that the predictive ability of ABS Estrada index is stronger than other connectivity Estrada indices (including Randić Estrada index, harmonic Estrada index and ABC Estrada index) and ABS index for octane isomers. Since chemical graphs of octane isomers are trees, we study the extremal problem of ABS Estrada index of trees, and prove that for any tree $$T_n$$ with $$n\ge 3$$ vertices, $$\begin{aligned} E_{ABS}(P_n)\le E_{ABS}(T_n)\le E_{ABS}(K_{1,n-1}) \end{aligned}$$ with equality in the left (resp., right) inequality if and only if $$T_n$$ is isomorphic to the path $$P_n$$ (resp., the star $$K_{1,n-1}$$ ).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we use direct algebra and improved generalized Riccati equation methods to investigate optical soliton solutions to the Chavy-Waddy-Kolokolnikov model for bacterial colonies. The model is effective at phototaxis, which is the generation of bacterial aggregates that move toward the light. The model’s solitary wave solutions are obtained using the direct algebra and Ricatti equation methods, which take into account the minor perturbations of the linear case as well as the regimes of pattern generation and instability. For each case, we determined the dynamic of optical soliton solutions for the model, which includes hyperbolic, periodic soliton solutions for the linear case and stationary spike-like solutions for the nonlinear case. The methods produced several types of hyperbolic, periodic, and exponential solutions for this model that were not previously specified in the literature. We also presented the 2D and 3D graphs to show the kink, bright, and dark solitary wave structures with suitable numerical values. The obtained solutions will be of great importance in chemotaxis and phototaxis bacterial adaptations.},

The Chinese government allocates significant funds annually to eradication campaigns. However, recent studies indicate that eliminating plateau pikas is detrimental to the sustainable development of the ecosystem. Therefore, we propose a ratio-dependent pulse control model. Using techniques such as Poincaré mapping and bifurcation theory, we establish the global stability of equilibrium points in the model. By applying fixed-point theorem and vector field analysis, we identify critical conditions for the orbitally asymptotic stability of order-1 and order-2 periodic solutions. Additionally, we provide criteria for the existence and stability of a predator-free periodic solution and conduct bifurcation and sensitivity analyses of relevant parameters. Finally, through numerical simulations, we validate the theorem and confirm the feasibility of the control approach. Theoretical and numerical results indicate that the population of plateau pikas can be maintained at lower levels. This offers a new control strategy for plateau pika management.},

Therefore, three coupled ordinary differential equations are incorporated in the predator–prey model with three state variables; mature predator, juvenile predator and prey. This predator–prey model is described in terms of Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio (C–F) and fractal–fractional (F–F) operators. The fractional order predator–prey dynamical model helps to describe the efficacy (usefulness, effectiveness) of memory and hereditary properties with the help of fractional operators. We have investigated the uniqueness and existence of solutions with C–F and fractal–fractional (F–F) derivatives using the fixed point postulate. This model also exhibits Ulam’s type of stability based on nonlinear functional analysis. Numerical and behavioral analyses of the non-integer predator–prey model have been carried out using phase portraits. The predator–prey system with Caputo–Fabrizio (C–F) and fractal–fractional (F–F) operators have been solved numerically via the Adams-Bashforth scheme and new predictor–corrector scheme respectively.

We employ advanced mathematical approaches to systematically prove finite-time stability, providing insights on convergence and stability within the stated interval. Using illustrative examples, we strengthen this all-encompassing examination into the complicated dynamics and stability features of fractionally ordered stochastic systems with time delays.

The proposed technique requires only one dimensional Haar wavelet approximation with a significantly smaller number of Haar coefficients to solve time-dependent partial differential equations. The presence of the NSFD scheme provides flexibility to choose different denominator functions and also provides high accuracy for large temporal step sizes.

  abstract     = {This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of second-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to examine animal avoidance behaviors, specifically emphasizing analytical and computational aspects. By using the Picard–Lindelöf and fixed-point theorems, we prove the existence of unique solutions and examine their stability according to the Ulam-Hyers criterion. We also investigate the effect of external forces and the system’s sensitivity to initial conditions. This investigation applies Euler and Runge–Kutta fourth-order (RK4) methods to a mass-spring-damper system for numerical approximation. A detailed analysis of the numerical approaches, including a rigorous evaluation of both absolute and relative errors, demonstrates the efficacy of these techniques compared to the exact solutions. This robust examination enhances the theoretical foundations and practical use of such ODEs in understanding complex behavioral patterns, showcasing the connection between theoretical understanding and real-world applications.},

The proposed method is fast and efficient due to the resulting sparse coefficient matrices. We investigate the error estimate and prove that the method is convergent. Numerical results show the high accuracy and low CPU time of proposed method and confirmed the theoretical ones.

A well-organized and valuable tool is a picture fuzzy influence graph $$\left( {PFIG} \right)$$ for managing ambiguity in practical challenges, including uncertain data, figures, facts, and discoveries. A $$PFIG$$ provides membership, non-membership, and neutral degree values of vertices, edges, and influence pairs. Using the picture fuzzy influence pairs, we can get information regarding the effect of one vertex on another vertex or edge of the same or another graph, which is a key feature as this can connect two disconnected graphs. This article represents some basic concepts such as strongest, strong, and weak picture fuzzy influence pairs, which help to propose the idea of domination in a $$PFIG$$ . Finally, we present a helpful, applicable, and practical application to control smog using the concept of domination in a $$PFIG$$ .

When it is computed in Fourier space, it can handle efficiently template translations but it cannot do so with template rotations. Including rotations requires sampling the whole space of rotations, repeating the computation of the correlation each time.This article develops an alternative mathematical theory to handle efficiently, at the same time, rotations and translations. Our proposal has a reduced computational complexity because it does not require to repeatedly sample the space of rotations. To do so, we integrate the information relative to all rotated versions of the template into a unique symmetric tensor template -which is computed only once per template-. Afterward, we demonstrate that the correlation between the image to be processed with the independent tensor components of the tensorial template contains enough information to recover template instance positions and rotations. Our proposed method has the potential to speed up conventional template matching computations by a factor of several magnitude orders for the case of 3D images.},

Towards this, we deliver an elementary proof of the fact that for a linear complementary pair of codes (C, D), where C and D are linear codes over finite non-commutative Frobenius rings, under certain conditions, the dual code $$D^\perp $$ is equivalent to C.},

As a result, governments are striving to diminish reliance on fossil fuels by promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources. This research introduces a nonlinear mathematical model that has been developed to examine the consequences of shifting the population from traditional energy sources, such as coal, oil, and gas to renewable alternatives like solar, wind, and hydropower. The concept revolves around governments encouraging the adoption of renewable energy by the public as $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ levels increase, thereby enabling a phased transition away from conventional energy sources. The population is divided into two segments: those dependent on conventional energy and those opting for green alternatives due to their understanding of the environmental impact of fossil fuels and $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ emission. Our analysis suggests that if the demand for energy from traditional sources surpasses a certain threshold, atmospheric $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ levels may begin to fluctuate periodically. To maintain $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ concentrations at a lower level, there must be a significant rate of transition from traditional to renewable energy sources within the population.},

  abstract     = {The fourth industrial revolution, in which mechanical appliances can be precisely and automatically handled, depends extensively on intelligent manufacturing. It has the potential to create more productive manufacturing facilities. Still, defects and possible mishaps in the production process affect the workflow, deplete resources, and worsen environmental effects. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic method for identifying, analyzing, and removing possible failures in products, designs, and procedures. Due to uncertainty’s multiple nature, more than one method or technique is needed to deal with such flaws or failures. Ultimately, there is a dire need to develop hybrid models to address and resolve manufacturing process failures. Many fuzzy rough MCDM techniques have been designed to deal with and quantify uncertainty when assessing failure modes; these methods often use triangular fuzzy numbers and FMEA. When modeling complex and asymmetric fuzzy sets, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers offer a more expressive and accurate alternative to the more basic and limited triangle fuzzy numbers. This study proposes a novel approach to prioritize FMEA risks by combining trapezoidal fuzzy rough numbers with VIKOR method to address ambiguity in expert opinions. Using fuzzy rough intervals rather than a single crisp value, fuzzy rough numbers are utilized to deal with ambiguous information regarding linguistic variables. Robots employed in the cabal industry can have their potential failures identified and assessed more effectively with the help of the suggested trapezoidal fuzzy rough FMEA technique.},

  abstract     = {Malaria, a lethal protozoan disease transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health concern. This study introduces a compartmental mathematical model to explore the impact of insecticide use and malaria treatment based on awareness initiatives. The model incorporates the influence of media-based awareness on the effectiveness of insecticide utilization for malaria control. Key mathematical properties, such as positivity, boundedness of solutions, feasibility, and stability of equilibria, are systematically investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that all solutions to the system are positive and bounded within a specified set of initial conditions, establishing the mathematical soundness and epidemiological relevance of the model. The basic reproduction number $$R_0$$ is determined through the next-generation matrix method. Stability analysis reveals that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when $$R_0$$ is less than one, while it becomes unstable if $$R_0$$ exceeds one. Global stability of the endemic equilibrium is established using an appropriate quadratic Lyapunov function in cases where $$R_0$$ surpasses one. We identify the most sensitive parameters of the model through normalized forward sensitivity indices. In addition, numerical simulations employing the Runge–Kutta method in Python software further validate our findings. Both analytical and numerical results collectively suggest that the integration of awareness-based insecticide usage with malaria treatment holds the potential for malaria elimination. This comprehensive approach not only contributes to the mathematical rigor of the model but also underscores its practical implications for effective malaria control strategies.},

Of particular interest are involutory MDS matrices, which facilitate the use of a single circuit for both encryption and decryption in hardware implementations. In this article, we present several characterizations of involutory MDS matrices of even order. Additionally, we introduce a new matrix form for obtaining all involutory MDS matrices of even order and compare it with other matrix forms available in the literature. We then propose a technique to systematically construct all $$4 \times 4$$ involutory MDS matrices over a finite field $$\mathbb {F}_{2^m}$$ . This method significantly reduces the search space by focusing on involutory MDS class representative matrices, leading to the generation of all such matrices within a substantially smaller set compared to considering all $$4 \times 4$$ involutory matrices. Specifically, our approach involves searching for these representative matrices within a set of cardinality $$(2^m-1)^5$$ . Through this method, we provide an explicit enumeration of the total number of $$4 \times 4$$ involutory MDS matrices over $$\mathbb {F}_{2^m}$$ for $$m=3,4,\ldots ,8$$ .},

It is occasionally necessary to deal with multi-index, uncertainty, or restriction dynamics in addition to imprecise, confusing, or insufficient situational information while modelling a wide range of real-world events. For this reason, compared to fuzzy set models, trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy set models, intuitionistic fuzzy set models are far more useful and flexible for handling this type of data. The differential equations in a generalized trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment were studied in this work. Contra-harmonic mean approaches are used in a fuzzy environment to solve the generalized trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy initial value problems (FIVPs). The generalized numerical technique is employed in many higher-order generalized intuitionistic fuzzy FIVPs, as well as circuit evaluation, mass-spring systems, steam supply management sliding value, and other practical applications in science. By comparing the numerical test application results to those obtained using exact and analytical procedures, we established that our generalized fuzzy numerical method is more efficient, consistent, and stable than existing analytical and numerical methods.},

The sustainable growth of the environment is only achieved by reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs); the present model describes the harm of GHGs to the environment and marine ecosystem. The considered model is a nonlinear system containing four differential equations (DE) illustrating the concentration of GHGs, atmospheric temperature, planktonic population, and population of fishes. In the current study, we consider the Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) fractional operator to study the present model with the help of HWCM. The operational matrix of integration (OMI) is built using Haar wavelets, which helps us to reduce the present model into a system of algebraic equations by which we can determine the unknown Haar coefficients using Newton Raphson method. To validate the effectiveness of the hired algorithm, we examined the considered system in terms of integer and fractional order. The convergence analysis is presented in the form of theorems. The numerical and graphical comparisons are made between the ND Solver solution, the RK4 solution, and the devised approach. The consequences illustrate that the scheme considered is highly organized and efficient in analyzing the nature of the present model. Numerical computations and implementations are done with the help of Mathematica software. Effects on the ecosystem due to global warming are explained in detail through Graphs and tables.},

The idea is to consider a Durrmeyer-type version of the widely studied discrete NN operators by Costarelli and Spigler (Neural Netw 44:101–106, 2013). Such operators are constructed using special density functions generated from suitable sigmoidal functions, while the reconstruction coefficients are based on a convolution between a general kernel function $$\chi $$ and the function being reconstructed, f. Here, we investigate their approximation capabilities, establishing both pointwise and uniform convergence theorems for continuous functions. We also provide quantitative estimates for the approximation order thanks to the use of the modulus of continuity of f; this turns out to be strongly influenced by the asymptotic behaviour of the sigmoidal function $$\sigma $$ . Our study also shows that the estimates we provide are, under suitable assumptions, the best possible. Finally, $$L^p$$ -approximation is also established. At the end of the paper, examples of activation functions are discussed.},

The incorporation of a ratio-dependent incidence rate provides a more intricate depiction of disease dynamics, encompassing not just the inhibitory effect of infected individuals but also the presence of susceptible individual for potential infection. Through the analysis of the model, it is discovered that when treatment capacity is limited, the infected population may survive even if the basic reproduction number is less than one. Consequently, the model displays endemicity through the coexistence of multiple steady states, and we observe a backward bifurcation. Further, a geometric approach is applied to derive the global stability of the endemic steady state. Bi-stability, Hopf bifurcation, and saddle-node bifurcation are some examples of nonlinear dynamics that are investigated. Additionally, this study also highlights the existence of Hopf bifurcation for the basic reproduction number less than one, showcasing the rare dynamics associated with ratio-dependent incidence rate function.

  abstract     = {Temporal synchronization is a relatively common ecological phenomenon in population dynamics. Examples range from annual and biennial plants to Salmon to Cicadas. In discrete-time matrix population models, competition between stages may result in synchronous cycles in which stages are temporally separated. Our work shows how spatial density-dependency dynamics can have a crucial role in population stability through synchronization in a migratory population. Migration is a diverse phenomenon and can be categorized into many forms. The most common type of migration is partial migration, in which some individuals migrate between habitats and others remain in a single habitat during their entire life. We use a discrete stage structure matrix model to investigate which density dependence mechanisms would cause a stable cyclic behavior with alternating and separated generations of juveniles, migrant, and non-migrant adults. We also studied the subsequent adaptive dynamics, which require investigating whether a mutant can invade the dynamic 2-cycle. We also found a dynamic dichotomy between the oscillating 2-cycles and positive equilibria for the partially migrating populations. Using adaptive dynamics and center manifold theory, we showed the existence of an evolutionary stable strategy. We examined how the ideal free distribution (IFD) arises in the context of a temporally separated population. We also show that the ideal free distributions for synchronous 2-cycles are evolutionary stable strategies if migrants and non-migrants experience density-dependent competition with juveniles during reproduction.},

The basic processing time, position and allotted resources are all linked to the actual processing time. We take into consideration three goal functions, which minimize the costs of earliness, tardiness, start time of window, window size, resource allocation and makespan. The aim is to find the optimal sequence and distribution of resources. Polynomial time algorithms are provided for each of the three issues. The algorithms have $$O(n^3)$$ levels of complexity, where n is the number of jobs. Special cases with the same learning rates are also considered. Polynomial time algorithms are also provided for each of the special cases. The algorithms have $$O(n\textrm{log}n)$$ levels of complexity.},

Firstly, we suggest an approach to determine a unique solution to the given model by employing methods from functional analysis and fixed-point theory. We obtain numerical solutions using the approach of Picard iteration and evaluate their stability in the context of minor perturbations. In addition, we explore the practical application of these techniques by providing two examples that highlight the thorough analysis of behavioral responses using numerical approximations. In the end, we examine the efficacy of our suggested ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for studying the avoidance learning behavior of animals. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence and error analysis of the proposed ODEs using multiple numerical techniques. This integration of theoretical and practical analysis enhances the domain of applied mathematics by providing important insights for behavioral science research.},

  abstract     = {Rapidly developing machine learning methods have stimulated research interest in computationally reconstructing differential equations (DEs) from observational data, providing insight into the underlying mechanistic models. In this paper, we propose a new neural-ODE-based method that spectrally expands the spatial dependence of solutions to learn the spatiotemporal DEs they obey. Our spectral spatiotemporal DE learning method has the advantage of not explicitly relying on spatial discretization (e.g., meshes or grids), thus allowing reconstruction of DEs that may be defined on unbounded spatial domains and that may contain long-ranged, nonlocal spatial interactions. By combining spectral methods with the neural ODE framework, our proposed spectral DE method addresses the inverse-type problem of reconstructing spatiotemporal equations in unbounded domains. Even for bounded domain problems, our spectral approach is as accurate as some of the latest machine learning approaches for learning or numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By developing a spectral framework for reconstructing both PDEs and partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs), we extend dynamical reconstruction approaches to a wider range of problems, including those in unbounded domains.},

Its importance is evident in several applications and outcomes, including social network analysis, network security, facility location and site selection, and effective routing. We introduce a novel resolvability parameter, Fault-Tolerant Mixed Metric Dimension, in this paper, and this defined as let $$R_{m,f}$$ be a set that nodes on a graph as both an edge-resolving set and a resolving set. If $$R_{m,f}$$ can uniquely represent the graph’s edges and vertices, then it is referred to as a mixed resolving set, and its all subsets cardinality is called the mixed metric dimension. If all of the graph’s vertices and edges are uniquely represented by $$R_{m,f}^{\prime },$$ and all subsets of $$R_{m,f}^{\prime }$$ with of cardinality one less than $$R_{m,f}$$ likewise have unique representations for all of the graph’s vertices and edges, then $$R_{m,f}$$ is referred to as a Fault-Tolerant Mixed Resolving Set, and If two such sets $$R_{m,f}^{1}$$ and $$R_{m,f}^{2}$$ exist such that $$R_{m,f}^{1}\cap R_{m,f}^{2}\ne 0$$ then we say that the graph has exchange property. $$R_{m,f}$$ ’s minimum cardinality is known as its fault-tolerant mixed Metric Dimension. These definitions offer a means of measuring a collection of vertices’ capacity to represent graph structures uniquely, taking fault-tolerant and resolution into account. Furthermore, a problem related to the lab’s system network is also discussed and linked with this topic in this work. Like a lab engineer is embarking on the creation of a new circular lab, intending to establish where and how many devices within it to supply internet with wire to all systems. A solution to this problem is proving this novel topic authenticity.},

It is well-known that if the gradient lies in the direction of MM by the search direction matrix, the algorithm may result in unnecessary computational errors and may likely not be convergent. Avoiding this direction will accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm theoretically and numerically. The proposed DL algorithm avoids the direction of MM and uses the inertial extrapolation and hyperplane projection steps to accelerate its convergence at every given iteration. The theoretical analysis proved that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent under some standard assumptions and has a linear convergence rate. Lastly, the numerical experiment on some test problems demonstrated that the algorithm is time-efficient and has less computational cost.},

To reduce bifurcation and chaos, we use feedback and hybrid control strategies. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the importance of the Allee effect in determining the system’s behavior.

Secondly, the bipolar fuzzy criterion matrix for each alternative is formed by interchanging the main diagonal entries of the interrelation matrix by the aggregated bipolar fuzzy numbers. Thirdly, the criterion priority index is obtained by defuzzifying the bipolar fuzzy criterion matrix using a score function for the assessment of the ordering of alternatives.

Brownian motion of calcium could be bound to different buffers like S100B, calmodulin, etc, and different organelles. Plasma membrane channels like voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase (PMCA), Orai channel could perturb the calcium concentration. To investigate the calcium interplay for intracellular signaling we have developed the two-dimensional time fractional reaction–diffusion equation. To solve this model analytically, we have used the Laplace and Fourier cosine integral transform method. By using Green’s function we obtained the compact solution in closed form with Mainardi’s function and Wright’s function. Uniqueness and existence proved the more fundamental approach to the fractional reaction–diffusion problem. The fractional Caputo approach gives better insight into this real-life problem by its nonlocal nature. Significant effects of different parameters on free calcium ions were obtained and the results are interpreted with normal and Alzheimeric cells. Non-local property and dynamical aspects are graphically presented which might provide insight into the Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) and S100B parameters.},

  abstract     = {Dengue is one of the most serious vector-borne diseases in the world. Although there is still no effective method to control this rapidly spreading disease, dengue vaccine is the best control measure for the foreseeable future. Dengue vaccine development has made great progress, but a better understanding of how vaccine-induced immune responses are related to vaccine efficacy can accelerate development and testing, and improve potential risks. In this paper, we formulate a dengue disease model with waning vaccine-induced immunity and a time delay depicting the extrinsic incubation period of mosquitoes in dengue transmission. The basic reproduction number is obtained, which is the threshold for distinguishing between the disappearance and prevalence of dengue. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global asymptotic dynamics of the system are established. By using the Pontryagin’s minimum principle with delay, we included five time-dependent controls to evaluate the impact of four different schemes on our model, which provides a theoretical basis for people to effectively prevent and control dengue disease. Finally, elasticity and sensitivity analysis are given and data fitting is conducted based on the number of weekly cases reported in Singapore in 2022. This helps one to understand the importance of vaccine-related parameters and provides some perspective on the development trend of the disease.},

In this study, we use theoretical and numerical analyses to thoroughly examine the time-fractional Burgers’ equation. Our main emphasis is on deriving time-decay estimates for solutions within a bounded domain. To determine optimal time-decay rates, we introduce a linear compact difference scheme by integrating an $$L_1$$ discretization formula for the Caputo derivative and compact difference operators with spatial derivatives. We provide a detailed analysis encompassing existence and uniqueness, and an error estimate of solutions under the $$\Vert \cdot \Vert _{\infty }$$ norm for the proposed scheme. Comprehensive numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, ensuring reliability for long-time simulations. Furthermore, numerical results are scrutinized to pinpoint the optimal time-decay rate.

The local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria have been discussed explicitly. By taking the delay as the bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf bifurcation is analyzed in four cases. Using normal form theory and center manifold theorem, direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are discussed. Numerically, the bifurcation diagrams show that both delays can destabilize the endemic equilibrium and cause Hopf bifurcation and irregular oscillations, and that stability switches can occur mainly because of the delay in human. In addition, the malaria transmission case of Nigeria is studied. Numerical analysis reveals that ignoring the waning of immunity and reinfection may underestimate the infection risk and enlarge the critical value of Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, combined with sensitivity analysis, we can see that even though vaccination is not so effective in reducing the basic reproduction number, it is efficient for controlling the disease.},

Using mathematical models, the nature of the spread of the Hepatitis B virus can be predicted. In the present paper, a hepatitis B epidemic model with a Beddington–DeAngelis type incidence rate and a constant vaccination rate is considered. Some dynamical properties of this model, such as non-negativity, boundedness character, the basic reproduction number $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ , stability nature, and the bifurcation phenomenon, are investigated. By the Bendixson theorem, it is demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. It is shown that a transcritical bifurcation phenomenon occurs when $$\mathcal {R}_0=1$$ . It is concluded that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when $$\mathcal {R}_0&gt;1$$ , by utilizing Dulac’s criteria. Also, a discrete system of difference equations is obtained by constructing a non-standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme for the continuous model. It is shown that the solutions of this discrete system are dynamically consistent for all finite step sizes. The theoretical results obtained are also supported and visualized by numerical simulations. These simulations also demonstrate that the NSFD scheme produces much more efficient results than the Euler or RK4 schemes, as shown in the theoretical results obtained.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish a fast modified $$\overline{L1}$$ finite difference method for the time fractional diffusion equation with weakly singular solution at the initial moment. First, the time fractional derivative is approximated by the modified $$\overline{L1}$$ formula on graded meshes, and the spatial derivative is approximated by the standard central difference formula on uniform meshes. Therefore, a numerical scheme for the time fractional diffusion equation is obtained. Then, the Von-Neumann stability analysis method is used to analyze the stability of the scheme, and the truncation error estimate is given. On the other hand, the time fractional derivative is nonlocal, which has historical dependency, thus, the cost of computation and memory consumption are expensive. Based on the sum-of exponentials approximation (SOE) technique, we optimize the numerical format, reduce the complex amount from $$O(M\hat{N})$$ to $$O(M N_{exp})$$ , and the amount of computation from $$O(M\hat{N}^2)$$ to $$O(M\hat{N}N_{exp})$$ , where M, $$\hat{N}$$ and $$N_{exp}$$ represent the number of spatial points, the number of temporal points, and the exponential amount, respectively.

Then, aperiodic sampling in various degrees is taken into account in the primary Lyapunov term. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that all the actual states of the multi-agent, starting from the initial state, can be bounded within a given ellipsoid set are established by designing a suitable controller. Moreover, the consensus control design is established as linear matrix inequalities, utilizing a two-sided looped functional and Wirtinger’s inequality-based discontinuous Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. Finally, the numerical section validates the applicability of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear phenomena occur in diverse fields such as science, engineering and business. Research within computational science is continuously advancing, characterized by the development of new numerical techniques or the refinement of existing ones. However, these numerical techniques may be computationally expensive, while demonstrating superior convergence rate. By considering these demanding features, this paper aimed to devise new fourth- and eight-order iterative methods for root finding. This will be accomplished by taking the linear combination of Newton–Steffensen’s method and Yu and Xu’s method to obtain fourth-order method. We employed weight function approach to achieve eighth-order method. The proposed methods supports the Kung and Traub conjecture and hence are optimal by utilizing three function evaluations for fourth-order method and four functional evaluations for eighth-order method per cycle. The convergence criteria of the proposed schemes are thoroughly covered in the two primary theorems. To demonstrate the usefulness, validity and accuracy, we explore some real-world applications in civil and chemical engineering fields. In terms of the number of iterations, absolute residual errors, errors in consecutive iterations, the preassigned tolerance, convergence speed, percentage of convergent points, mean value of iterations for methods to converge and CPU time (sec), the numerical results obtained from the test examples illustrates that our proposed methods perform better than other methods of same order. Finally, several forms of complex functions are taken into consideration under basins of attraction in order to observe the overall fractal behavior of the proposed technique and some existing methods.},

  abstract     = {One of the global problems and a number of societal challenges in the areas of social life, the economy, and international communications is COVID-19. In order to counteract the impact of sickness on society, we created a deterministic COVID-19 model in this study that uses real data to assess the impact of disease, dynamical transmission, quarantine impact, and hospitalized treatment. The model includes a generalized form of the fractal and fractional operator. This study aims to develop a fractal-fractional mathematical model suitable for the lifestyle of the Thai population facing the COVID-19 situation. The model divides the incubation period into the quarantine class and the exposed class, which later moved to the hospitalized infected class and the infected class. The fractal-fractional derivative is used to analyze the dynamics of the population in these classes, providing a more detailed understanding of the epidemic’s progression and the effectiveness of control measures. The existence and uniqueness of the solution were also determined with the Lipschitz condition and fixed point theory. With the use of simulations and functional analysis tools like Ulam-Hyers, we examine the sensitivity analysis of the fractal-fractional model with respect to each parameter effect. We develop a numerical scheme for the fractal-fractional model based on Newton polynomial for computational analysis and convergence solution to steady-state points of real data COVID-19 in Thailand. The verification of the examined fractional-order model with actual COVID-19 data for Thailand demonstrates the potential of the suggested paradigm in forecasting and comprehending the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, the fractal fractional-order derivative gives rise to a range of chaotic behaviors that show how the species has changed over place and time. Fractional-order epidemiological models may help predict and understand the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide relevant management approaches.},

To substantiate our claims, numerical experiments are provided, which highlight the exceptional efficacy of our proposed method over the traditional Taylor method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a predator–prey model with fear-induced group defense and Monod–Haldane functional response is considered. We establish a connection between fear effect and group defense by incorporating anti-predator sensitivity and emphasizing their impact on the dynamics of the model. Our analysis shows that increasing anti-predator sensitivity lowers the threshold for initiating group defense, leading to faster adoption of prey defense strategies. The preliminary results include positivity, boundedness, and persistence. We find that under certain thresholds, anti-predator sensitivity can sustain species persistence; otherwise, predators may face extinction. Changes in anti-predator sensitivity significantly influence system dynamics, notably affecting the quantity and stability of equilibrium points. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the global properties of both boundary and interior equilibrium points. Additionally, the system undergoes Transcritical, Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation by considering the anti-predator sensitivity as a bifurcation parameter and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation with respect to the prey birth rate and the anti-predator sensitivity. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings. Our study highlights the complex interplay of fear effect, group defense, and anti-predator sensitivity in predator–prey dynamics. These results may provide valuable biological insights into predator–prey interactions.},

By incorporating fully backlogged orders, the model offers a nuanced approach to addressing shortages, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of inventory dynamics. The proposed EPQ model offers flexibility and adaptability to various scenarios, providing valuable insights for inventory management strategies.

  abstract     = {A topological index, derived from the graph representation of a molecule, condenses structural information and is instrumental in predicting chemical and physical properties. An essential consideration in the investigation of topological indices is their ability to differentiate among various structures. This fact leads to the development of exponential degree-based topological indices. The central theme of this work is the exponential augmented Zagreb index (EAZ), which was observed to exhibit strong correlations with numerous properties of octanes. The EAZ index for a graph $$\Gamma $$ is defined as $$EAZ(\Gamma )= \sum \nolimits _{v_{i}v_{j} \in E(\Gamma )} F(\delta _{i},\delta _{j})$$ , where $$\delta _i$$ represents the degree of a vertex $$v_i$$ and $$F(x, y)=e^{\left( \frac{xy}{x+y-2}\right) ^{3}}$$ . We intend to establish tight bounds of EAZ with determining extremal graphs. Our systematic investigation offers maximal bicyclic graph in terms of graph order p. We also find minimal unicyclic graph when both p and girth are specified. In addition, the minimal graph for EAZ is characterized with respect to number of cut edges and p.},

  abstract     = {The article examines the topic of extended dissipative filtering design for a class of discrete-time interval type 2 fuzzy switching systems (IT2FSS). The asymptotic stability problem of IT2FSS is handled by employing an average dwell time (ADT) technique that dwells between the subsystems. The IT2FSS under discussion is represented with a time-varying delay, which enables a more precise depiction of nonlinear dynamical systems than conventional state space representation. In comparison to earlier findings, a set of piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) candidates are provided, which are fuzzy and delay-dependent functional. The Lyapunov stability theory-based suitable criterion is derived by the LKF candidates for the stability and performance evaluations of the filtering error system. Extended dissipative filtering is a technique which employs an extended performance index to analyse $$ H_{ \infty },\ L_{2} - L_{\infty }, $$ passive, and $$ (Q, S, R)-\gamma $$ dissipative filtering in a single structure. As a special case, the criteria for constant delay are also discussed. Two real-world numerical examples for both time-varying delay and constant delay demonstrate the applicability and reliability of the known theoretical findings.},

An MCDM technique based on the optimized picture fuzzy weighted geometric operator (OPFWGO) is proposed in this article. First, the drawbacks of various existing picture fuzzy-weighted geometric aggregation operators (PFWGOs) that lead to imprecise outcomes in some exceptional instances are investigated. Second, an OPFWGO is proposed to address the shortcomings of existing PFWGOs. Furthermore, the suggested OPFWGO’s properties such as idempotency, boundedness, monotonicity, and commutativity are explored. Numerical examples demonstrate that our proposed operator and corresponding MCDM approach are efficient and reasonable enough to prevent ambiguous results in exceptional instances. Finally, we applied the proposed method to rank the World Health Organization regions for air pollution control.},

We consider services for two types of customers: ordinary customers (service completed in two phases) and priority customers (service completed in one phase). Collisions only occur in the first phase of service; if the collision does not happen, the server will proceed to the second phase of service. When the server turns to an idle state, it reserves a random period before taking formal vacations. We investigate two models for this system with and without orbit constraints and numerically analyze the sensitivity of the system performance metrics to validate the results and methodology. The expected total cost function is formulated. To prevent falling into the local optimal solution too fast, we utilize the canonical particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate a bi-objective optimization problem to seek the balance of the expected total cost and the quality of service. Then, we apply the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to obtain the Pareto front. Several numerical examples are presented for illustrative purposes.},

Compared to finite-time stability, the fixed-time stability results provide a desired settling-time estimation which only depends on the system’s intrinsic parameters and has nothing to do with the initial value of the system. Then, based on the established stability results, the fixed-time synchronization of a type of neural networks with general impulsive effects is studied via using the Lyapunov function approach and some inequality techniques. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of developed theoretical results by providing three numerical examples. Compared with previous works, the impulsive gains in this paper not only can be stabilizing but also can be destabilizing, which provides wider application scope for the finite-time and fixed-time stability and synchronization studies of other impulse systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years of the literature, fixed point iteration schemes have been studied theoretically for many nonlinear problems, including differential and integral equations; however, numerically, there has been a little work on these iterative schemes for finding numerical solutions of differential equations. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new numerically efficient iterative approach based on fixed point theory and Green’s function. First, we compute a Green’s function for a wider class fourth order BVPs and express the sought solution as a fixed point of a certain integral operator. We show by Banach Contraction Principle that this new integral operator admits a unique fixed point which is the solution for a given BVP. We embed the integral operator into our iterative scheme and obtain a generalized iterative scheme. We prove the convergence of our new scheme under possible mild assumptions. Instead of stability, we prove a weak $$w^{2}$$ -stability result for our scheme which is a natural and weak notion of the stability for any given iterative scheme. To support numerically the convergence of our scheme, we provide two different examples. Using these examples, we compare the high accuracy of our new scheme with the classical approaches of the literature. As an application of our scheme, we show that the scheme can be used for finding solutions for the Bratu’s problem in a Banach space setting. At the end of the paper, we include some interesting discussion about the main results of the paper.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a family of hybrid conjugate parameters with restart procedure is proposed. In which, we design a hybrid conjugate parameter by using two hybrid techniques, and set a restart procedure in its search direction according to the conjugate parameter. Under the usual assumptions and the weak Wolfe line search, we prove its sufficient descent property and global convergence. Finally, we choose a specific algorithm from this family and use an acceleration scheme to solve the large-scale unconstrained optimization problems and image restorations. These numerical results show that our algorithm is effective.},

  abstract     = {For a graph $$G=(V,E)$$ and an assignment of black and white colors to its vertices, the zero forcing color-change rule operates as follows: if a vertex u and all of its neighbors except v are black, then v is forced to change its color to black. A proper subset S of V is called a zero forcing set if by initially assigning the black vertices to be the elements of S and repeatedly applying this rule to G, all vertices are eventually forced to change their colors to black. Otherwise, S is called a failed zero forcing set. The maximum size of a failed zero forcing set of G is called the failed zero forcing number of G and is denoted by F(G). In this paper, we study the failed zero forcing numbers of three graph families: Kneser graphs K(n, r), Johnson graphs J(n, r), and hypercube graphs $$Q_n$$ . Specifically, we prove that $$F(K(n, r))=\left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ r\end{array}}\right) -(r+2)$$ , for $$2\le r \le \frac{n-1}{2}$$ , $$F(J(n, r))=\left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ r\end{array}}\right) -(r+1)$$ , for $$1\le r \le \frac{n}{2}$$ , and $$F(Q_n)=2^n - n$$ , for $$n \ge 2$$ .},

Also, the sufficiency theorem has been derived using pseudo and quasi convexity assumptions. Finally, we have shown the application of our problem in control systems for PID controllers. For that, we have formulated a Model to find the best tuning parameters for the PID controller and solved it using MATLAB. For verification of our results, the Nyquist plot of the loop transfer function is shown, which has come out to be as per Nyquist stability criteria. Moreover, the results for two more PID controller problems with combined sensitivity have been obtained, which are not solved using the concept of H-infinity error anywhere in the literature.

Since the turning point takes place inside the domain, the problem usually exhibits a weak interior layer of cusp-type. The inclusion of parabolic boundary layers in the solution is caused by the presence of a small perturbation parameter. Two methods are designed to outperform the error estimation: the non-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin technique with an interior penalty (NIPG) and the symmetric discontinuous Galerkin method with an interior penalty (SIPG). To circumvent the layering effect in domain discretization, the traditional Shishkin mesh is used. Uniform error estimates are derived in the respective norms of order $$\mathcal {O}(N^{-1} \ln ^{3/2} N)$$ and $$\mathcal {O}(N^{-1} \ln ^{2} N)$$ for the NIPG and the SIPG methods, respectively.

  abstract     = {The column action methods of algebraic iterative techniques play a pivotal role in the image reconstruction process. These methods converge to a least squares solution of inconsistent linear systems, providing a means to conserve computational resources by limiting small updates. In this paper, we introduce an improved version of the block column iteration called the average block column iteration, designed to enhance image reconstruction from projections in computerized tomography. Unlike its predecessor, the block column iteration (Linear Algebra Appl 484:322–343, 2015), the average block column iteration obviates the necessity of computing pseudoinverses of submatrices or solving subsystems. To substantiate the efficacy of this average variant, we present convergence analyses based on both random and greedy strategies. Additionally, we investigate techniques such as constraining to mitigate computation time. Furthermore, we furnish convergence results for methodologies employing these techniques. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments and comparisons utilizing synthetic data and real image reconstruction scenarios. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.},

Different from existing studies, the two stochastic differential equations are applied to model the dynamics of nodes and links separately in this paper, where the stochastic factor considered in the dynamics of the links is novel. Furthermore, there have been many studies on the nodes synchronization in stochastic complex dynamic networks, but few studies on the links synchronization. In this paper, we give a definition of links synchronization in the mean-square sense, which is achieved by designing the suitable control scheme. The control scheme designed in this paper consists of two parts, one part is the design of controllers in the nodes and the other is the coupling term in the links. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by a simulation example of a discrete structure system.},

Without using the Lipschitz continuity of these equations, the presented method is proved to be globally convergent. Moreover, its R-linear convergence rate is attained under Lipschitz continuity and the usual assumptions.

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations are frequently employed to depict issues arising across various scientific and engineering domains. Efforts have been made to analytically solve these equations, revealing shortcomings in some widely utilized methods, including modeling deficiencies and intricate solution processes. To address these limitations, diverse analytical methods have been explored. The Ito equation, introduced in 1980, underwent development, leading to the formulation of a fifth-order Ito equation. A seventh-order integrable $$(3+1)$$ -dimensional extended modified Ito equation emerged by augmenting this equation with three additional terms. In this study, novel exact solutions for the equation, absent in existing literature, were derived using the extended hyperbolic function and modified Kudryashov methods. To scrutinize the dynamic behavior of these findings, we presented 3D, contour, and 2D visualizations of select solutions. The results showcase numerous new solutions, underscoring the reliability and efficacy of the employed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a new nonlinear compact difference scheme (NCDS) for a fourth-order nonlinear Burgers type equation (FO-NBTE) with a weakly singular kernel. The Crank–Nicolson method and product-integration rule are utilized for discretizing the time derivative and Riemann–Liouville (R–L) time fractional integral term on the graded meshes, respectively. A nonlinear operator is constructed to discretize the nonlinear convective term, while the double reduced-order method is employed to handle fourth-order spatial derivative, then the FO-NBTE is transformed into three coupled nonlinear equations. The main advantage of the proposed NCDS is that it achieves second-order convergence in time and simultaneously fourth-order convergence in space, addressing the limitation observed in Tian et al. (Comput Appl Math 41:328, 2022) where the order of spatial convergence was restricted to second-order. In addition, a series of theoretical proofs for the proposed NCDS are presented, including the existence, stability, convergence and uniqueness. Finally, two numerical examples are given which consistent with the theoretical analysis.},

Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are used specifically to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. Furthermore, a backstepping approach is used to design a neural network-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller for the system. The suggested control methodology compensates effectively for the negative impacts of actuator faults and backlash-like hysteresis. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed controller ensures that all closed-loop system signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the system output tracks the reference signal with bounded tracking error. Furthermore, a numerical example and a real-world example of a single-link manipulator demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To overcome these challenges, new methods are proposed. Furthermore, the delays and the coefficient sequences are rearranged for the purpose of achieving the best results.

In this paper, the sparse and group sparse optimization problem with a nonsmooth loss function is considered, where the sparsity and group sparsity are induced by a penalty composed of a combination of $$\ell _1$$ norm and $$\ell _{2,1}$$ norm, so it is called the sparse group Lasso (SGLasso) problem. To solve this problem, the nonsmooth loss function is smoothed first. Then, based on the smooth approximation of the loss function, a smoothing composite proximal gradient (SCPG) algorithm is proposed. It is showed that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by SCPG algorithm is a global optimal solution of the problem. Moreover, it is proved that the convergence rate of the objective function value is $$O(\frac{1}{k^{1-\sigma }})$$ where $$\sigma \in (0.5,1)$$ is a constant. Finally, numerical results illustrate that the proposed SCPG algorithm is effective and robust for sparse and group sparse optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Vaccination is widely recognized as a powerful tool in controlling the spread of diseases. However, it is important to acknowledge that some diseases are not completely preventable by vaccines, meaning that the protective effect of certain vaccines is not absolute. Additionally, the effectiveness of vaccines may diminish over time, which implies that even with completed vaccinations, there remains a potential risk of infection. Therefore, conducting comprehensive studies on how these imperfect vaccines impact the dynamics of disease transmission is crucial. In this study, we formulate and analyze a two-strain epidemic model with imperfect vaccination on complex networks. We derive the basic reproduction number and introduce the invasion reproduction numbers corresponding to each strain. Using the Lyapunov function method and LaSalle’s invariance principle, we demonstrate the global asymptotical stability of the disease-free equilibrium and dominant equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply persistence theory to verify the existence of coexistence equilibrium and the persistence of the disease. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical simulations. Through these simulations, we confirm that vaccination plays a significant role in controlling the spread of diseases, despite the imperfect efficacy of certain vaccines in specific cases. These findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to improve vaccine effectiveness and explore alternative strategies to enhance disease control measures.},

This strategy is aimed at ensuring the uniformly asymptotic stability of the controlled system while adhering to a predefined $$H_{\infty }$$ performance index. The central challenge lies in the memory characteristics of the fractional-order calculus operator, particularly in the context of delayed fractional-order systems, where preventing the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon is paramount.

Next, to determine and update the lower bound during the branching search process, we construct the linear relaxation problem of the equivalence problem by using a new relaxation technique. The global convergence of the presented algorithm is verified. Also, by analyzing the algorithmic complexity, we give a maximum estimate of iteration times of the presented algorithm.

  abstract     = {Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS) is an advance variant of fuzzy set applicable in curbing uncertainties and vagueness in complex decision making scenarios. Correlation coefficient is a measure of relationship between two variables or data with a significant importance in decision-making involving different areas of human endeavours. Several methods for calculating the correlation coefficient between FFSs have been developed and used to discuss sundry real-world problems. Albeit, these existing methods lack reliability, precision and give mispleading interpretations during real-life applications. Due to these setbacks, this work constructs a new method of Fermatean fuzzy correlation coefficient (FFCC) with practicable application potentials. This new method of FFCC is demonstrated to show accuracy, reliability, and superiority over the existing methods of FFCC through comparative studies. More so, the new method is applied to determine students’ academic performance via clustering analysis and selection process. This new method of FFCC could be used to discuss technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions and multiple attributes decision-making.},

  abstract     = {The identification of central body in directed networks is critical as it shows the areas of the network that require attention by cutting through noisy data. In network theory, the measures of centrality offer numbers or values to nodes within a graph related to their network location. Many centrality measures already exist in different network models. However, these centrality measures are generally based on membership values of edges, and there is no widely acknowledged method to assess the efficacy and reliability of these measures when dealing with incomplete and ambiguous information concurrently. Therefore, we suggest an innovative perspective where centrality measures are introduced in rough fuzzy directed (RFD) network model that is a predominant approach for dealing incomplete and ambiguous information simultaneously. Based on the connectedness of the RFD network, the in-degree centrality $$C_{id}$$ , out-degree centrality $$C_{od}$$ , in-closeness centrality $$C_{ic}$$ and out-closeness centrality $$C_{oc}$$ are defined and characterized for its bounds. Expressions for centrality measures of rough fuzzy directed path networks and rough fuzzy directed cycle networks are generalized. Finally, this conceptual structure is applied to the decision-making of effective management of water supply system and it is used to assess and compare different approaches. The traditional centrality measures are found to perform poorly on a large number of networks, indicating inherent limits for expressing the centrality of nodes in complicated networks.},

The developed methods utilize an implicit technique to solve the problem without performing inversion of the coefficient matrix at each state of the economy. The pricing of European options under the regime-switching jump-diffusion process is formulated by coupled partial integro-differential equations, whereas the pricing framework for American options is based on addressing coupled linear complementary problems. The operator splitting technique is employed along with implicit-explicit methods to solve the linear complementarity problems. Consistency and convergence results of the developed methods are theoretically established using the discrete $$\ell ^{2}$$ -norm. The accuracy and efficiency of developed methods are validated by solving the European and American options at different states of the economy under regime-switching jump-diffusion models.

In this paper, we investigate a new class of piecewise conformable fractional impulsive differential system with delay under two point inhomogeneous boundary condition. In the system, the motion laws of state variable vary at different time periods, and they interact with each other through time delay “ $$\tau $$ ” and time leading “ $$-\tau $$ ”, so as to be more realistic. By employing the well-know fixed point theorems, the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system are established. Under the conditions of ensuring the existence of the system’s solutions, we conclude further that the system has Ulam–Hyers stability and Ulam–Hyers–Rassias stability by means of nonlinear functional analysis method.

Depending on the degree of the infection, mild to severe clinical symptoms appear when the T-cell and B-cell-initiated immune responses fail to eradicate the virus particles and subsequently become compromised. Here, we propose a mathematically tractable simple model that exhibits important biological features of dengue infection. Dynamical analysis of our model explores the factors influencing viral persistence in the body over an extended period. To investigate plausible variability in viral dynamics in different hosts, we perform stochastic simulations of our model using Gillespie’s algorithm. Our simulation results recapitulate the distribution of the intrinsic incubation period, daily viral load, and the day of peak viremia. In addition, we observe that the invasion probability of the virus into the host is correlated with the initial virus population injected by the mosquito. However, considering the biting behavior of Aedes mosquitoes, a lower initial virus injection could end up increasing the epidemic potential of the virus.},

When $$b^2&lt;4a$$ , we show the existence of periodic solutions under certain conditions.

  abstract     = {The fuzzy graph theory has many applications in solving various problems in multiple fields, including networking, communications, clustering, planning, and scheduling. In this article, we introduce the fundamental set of a picture fuzzy graph (PFG) and the $$(\theta , \rho , \sigma )$$ -level graph ( $$(\theta , \rho , \sigma )$$ -LG) of a PFG, illustrating these concepts with an example. We then discuss the properties of the $$(\theta , \rho , \sigma )$$ -LGs of a PFG. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the chromatic polynomial (CP) of a PFG, providing a demonstration with an example using $$(\theta , \rho , \sigma )$$ -LGs of a PFG and exploring various properties of CP of a PFG. Furthermore, we construct an algorithm, which is executed using Matlab. This algorithm enables us to determine the number of distinct ways to colour a PFG with a specified number of colours. The application of the work presented is to answer the question: How does the picture fuzzy model propose to rectify the inefficiency in traffic signal timing where equal time is allocated to each vehicle in a flow based on vehicle count, leading to potential delays for vehicles with different characteristics, such as motorcycles and containers?},

Firstly, we prove that there is unique global positive solution to the model, and establish the stochastic boundedness of the positive solution as well. Secondly, the sufficient condition for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution is provided. Thirdly, the persistence and extinction of the populations are discussed. Finally, some numerical simulations demonstrate that the results obtained in this paper are true, moreover, the influence of white noise on the populations is revealed.},

An effective tool in this field that links a numerical value to a graph formation is the topological index. The neighborhood inverse sum indeg index stands out as a contemporary index derived from neighborhood degree considerations. Neighborhood inverse sum indeg index is a crucial graph metric that is applied in real-world applications like corporate networking and signalling on traffic. So this index is generalized in fuzzy graph. In this paper, the neighborhood inverse sum indeg index is explored for some fuzzy graphs like a tree, double star, subgraph, star, complete fuzzy graph, complete bipartite graph, etc. . We evaluate the effect of neighborhood inverse sum indeg index value when the vertex or edge is deleted from a graph. Moreover, the relationship between two isomorphic fuzzy graphs are determined. We have determined the boundedness of this index for some fuzzy graphs like $$CS(n,\alpha _1)$$ , $$K_{p_1}\vee (K_{q_1}\cup K_{r_1})$$ , etc. Also a couple of results are found. We all aware that one cause of global warming is the carbon emission. Finally we have found out the country which needs to reduce the carbon emissions by applying the concept of neighborhood inverse sum indeg index.},

Then, a pinning impulsive controller is designed to synchronize the second layer (follower-layer) network to the leader-layer network in the mean square cluster sense. Based on the stochastic impulsive analysis and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization are strictly obtained. At last, the correctness of the theoretical result is illustrated by a numerical example.

In this study, we investigated the hydrodynamic Williamson nanofluid flow over a stretchy surface with zero mass flux, Christov–Cattaneo (C–C) theory, non-linear mixed convection, and passive controls of nanomaterials. Thermophoresis and Brownian motion impressions are also taken in the present flow. The second law of thermodynamics is also used to determine the entropy generation. By using the proper similarity alterations, the PDEs (governing equations) are converted into non-linear ODEs. To crack the non-linear ODEs, the homotopy analysis method is used. There is a detailed discussion of the effects of magnetic, Weissenberg, radiation, Brownian motion, the Bejan parameter, and the entropy creation of various factors. Additionally, the heat, mass transfer rate, and skin friction are assessed. Also, compare skin friction and the Nusselt number with previous studies. The Weissenberg number and Brinkman parameter shows the opposite tendency in entropy generation and Bejan number profiles.},

This hierarchical design of optimization is suitable to model a large number of real-life applications. However, when dealing with a non linear multi-objective optimization context, new complexities arise due to conflicting objectives. In this paper, an exact method is described to solve an integer indefinite quadratic bilevel maximization problem with multiple objectives at the upper level, where the objective functions at both levels are the product of two linear functions. The algorithm suggested aims to produce a set of efficient solutions by employing a branch and cut approach. It optimizes the indefinite quadratic problem of the upper level within the feasible region of the original problem in an iterative manner. Then, it introduces the Dantzig cut technique to identify the optimal solution for the integer indefinite quadratic bilevel programming problem. Additionally, the algorithm utilizes an efficient cut that reduces the search process for obtaining the set of efficient solutions of the main problem, along with a branching constraint for the integer decision variables. The algorithm was implemented and tested on instances generated randomly, yielding positive outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The concept of interval-valued picture fuzzy sets (IVPFSs) is the most generalized form of fuzzy sets (FSs) and is proven a useful tool to manipulate complications that arise due to incomplete information more effectively. One of the most powerful feature of IVPFSs is that it allocates the membership, non membership and neutral membership values as intervals to any element of the given data. Due to this, IVPFSs play a key role to deal uncertain data with multiple attributes. In this study, we introduce the notion of interval-valued picture fuzzy hypergraphs (IVPFHGs) which is the combination of both IVPFSs and hypergraphs and provide its application in decision making. We describe several types of IVPFHGs such as partial, simple, support, support simple, elementary IVPFHGs etc. We also initiate the concepts of dual of IVPFHGs. Moreover, $$([\iota , \kappa ], [\lambda , \epsilon ], [\rho , \nu ])$$ -level cuts of IVPFHGs are also addressed. We present a comparative analysis of our newly established terms with those existing in the literature and elaborate the superiority of IVPFHGs over the other existing fuzzy hypergraphs structures. Finally, we provide an application of IVPFHGs with algorithm and flowchart towards decision making.},

Subsequently, an iterative process is proposed, wherein the exchange of information to neighboring subdomains is accomplished through the utilization of piecewise-linear interpolation. It is shown that the algorithm provides uniformly convergent numerical approximations to the solution. Our analysis utilizes some novel auxiliary problems, barrier functions, and a new maximum principle result. More importantly, we showed that only one iteration is needed for small values of the perturbation parameter.

  abstract     = {Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) is an environmental phenomenon in which the temperature during the embryonic or larval stages influences the determination of sex. It is mainly observed in teleost fish, where high water temperatures can induce a female-to-male transition. The exact mechanism by which environmental changes affect TSD is poorly understood, but cortisol, a stress hormone, is considered a potential factor. Although excessive secretion of cortisol is known to cause side effects, it can lead to a switch in sex hormones, potentially resulting in TSD. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of TSD in teleost fish. To assess the impact of stress caused by changes in water temperature on TSD, we established a mathematical model for hormonal dynamics that incorporates cortisol. First, we conducted a stability analysis to qualitatively examine the sex determination. The temperature dependence was modeled using the Eyring–Polanyi equation, and we examined corresponding hormonal changes with water temperature. Furthermore, we theoretically investigated the role of a cortisol inhibitor in preventing side effects during TSD.},

We continue analyzing an age-structured SIS model similarly by introducing the numerical total population $$p_{j}^{n}$$ to overcome the coupling. With the help of Krein–Rutman’s theorem, the numerical basic reproduction numbers $$R_{\Delta t}^{1}$$ and $$R_{\Delta t}^{2}$$ are presented, which play a decisive role in the numerical dynamical behavior of disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. Moreover, instead of the convergence of numerical solutions, it is much more interesting that the numerical basic reproduction numbers converge to the exact ones with accuracy of order 1.

In this paper, we first give some bounds for SDE index of a connected graph G with fixed size m. For two connected graphs $${\varvec{G}}_{\varvec{1}}$$ and $${\varvec{G}}_{\varvec{2}}$$ of order $${\varvec{n}}_{\varvec{1}}$$ and $${\varvec{n}}_{\varvec{2}}$$ , employing these bounds, we compute the SDE index for two classes of graph products, e.g., the Cartesian product and Corona product. As an application, we determine the structure of graphs with two non-equi-centric edges. Our theorems generalize the recent results for the extended adjacency index of a graph. Besides, this research significantly contributes to the comprehension of graph analysis techniques and offers valuable insights into the relationship between SDE and various graph properties.},

  abstract     = {A topological index is a numerical descriptor in mathematical chemistry and graph theory that quantifies a molecule’s structural properties without considering its three-dimensional arrangement. A crucial factor to consider when exploring topological indices is their capacity to distinguish between different structures. In light of this, the exponential vertex-degree-based topological index is put forward in the literature. The present work focuses on investigating the mathematical properties and application potential of the exponential augmented Zagreb index (EAZ). The EAZ index for a graph $$\Upsilon $$ is defined as $$\begin{aligned} EAZ(\Upsilon )=\sum \limits _{v_iv_j \in E(\Upsilon )}\,e^{\displaystyle {\left( \frac{{d_i\,d_j}}{d_i+d_j-2}\right) ^{3}}}, \end{aligned}$$ where $$d_i$$ represents the degree of a vertex $$v_i$$ . Crucial upper and lower bounds of EAZ for numerous classes of graphs like bipartite, unicyclic, bicyclic, chemical graph, and general graphs are derived. The bounds are computed in terms of different graph parameters including graph order, size, maximum degree, number of pendant vertices and independence number. The extremal graphs for which the bounds appear are also characterized. Moreover, the EAZ index is found to correlate well with some physico-chemical properties of octanes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes two efficient numerical schemes to deal with time-fractional integro-differential reaction-convection-diffusion equations of the Volterra type in a rectangular domain. The fractional derivative is taken in the Caputo sense of order $$ \alpha \in (0,1).$$ In order to construct the computational semi-discrete schemes, we discretize the fractional operator using finite difference techniques, namely the L1 and the L1-2, on a uniform mesh in the time direction. A composite trapezoidal rule approximates the integral part. The semi-discrete problems become a set of two-point boundary value problems (BVPs) in the spatial domain. The cubic B-spline collocation method is employed to solve the corresponding BVPs. The optimal error estimation and convergence analysis are established under suitable regularity assumptions on the initial data and the true solution of the considered model problem. It is shown in the theoretical establishment that the L1 based scheme achieves $$ (2-\alpha ) $$ order of accuracy, while the rate of convergence of the L1-2 based scheme is quadratic. Finally, a numerical experiment is performed in support of the theoretical findings.},

Consequently, we develop a stochastic infectious disease dynamical model that incorporates saturated media coverage and vaccination age. The Itô’s formula and the Lyapunov function method are applied to study the extinction behavior of the disease and the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution. The findings suggest that the media effect is delayed and cannot eliminate the disease completely. To directly control disease transmission, a combination of high-intensity noise disturbance and low vaccine wane rate is required. Furthermore, the shorter the disease incubation period, the more difficult it is to control.},

Intensive researches have and are being done to unearth effective vaccines to deal with future pandemics. In this research, we developed a deterministic model for COVID-19 driven by asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals taking into consideration the indispensable role of vaccination in combating disease transmission. The dissection of the proposed model was conferred in terms of the associated reproduction number $$R_{0}$$ , which is determined by utilizing the next-generation matrix (NGM) approach and forms the basis upon which the model’s stability analysis is established. The analysis showed that COVID-19 free equilibrium (CFE) is locally asymptotically stable for $$R_{0}1$$ . The local stability of endemic equilibrium was explored using center manifold theorem where the method utilized by Castilo-Chavez and Song was implemented and revealed that backward bifurcation was driven by the vaccine efficacy. The results revealed that increased administration levels of vaccine, increased identification and treatment of the asymptomatic and strict adherence to isolation for the symptomatic individuals would curtail COVID-19 infections from burgeoning to catastrophic levels that would overrun the capacity of health care support system.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy graphs, including their extensions such as intuitionistic fuzzy graphs and picture fuzzy graphs, find substantial applications in diverse natural and human-made systems. The exploration of various domination types in picture fuzzy graphs has become key topics in this field due to their extensive practical use. This paper describes the idea of split, non-split domination, minimum, maximum and supremum split dominating sets and minimum, maximum and supremum split domination numbers in the picture fuzzy environment. Some properties and theorems regarding split, non-split domination in picture fuzzy graphs have been presented. Classifications of strong edges are introduced and various types of domination are presented in picture fuzzy graphs. Algorithms to find the minimum split dominating set and the set of strong edges using the membership matrix of the picture fuzzy graph have been presented in this paper. A real life application regarding disaster management using split domination in picture fuzzy graphs has also been presented, which helps to manage disaster in a better way.},

Especially after the 2000s, the topic of Moore–Penrose inverse has started to attract great attention by researchers and has become a popular subject. In this paper, we investigate the Moore–Penrose inverse of the conditional matrices via convolution product formula. In order to use convolution formula effectively, we derive some useful identities by using some properties of the generalized conditional sequence. Moreover, we express the Moore–Penrose inverse of the conditional matrices in the form of block matrices.

  abstract     = {Average edge connectivity is a fundamental metric in classical and fuzzy graph theory. It is a key parameter in evaluating the reliability of a network. Fuzzy average edge connectivity more accurately describes the overall stability of links in the network by providing a more precise measure of the connectivity of the fuzzy graphs. It is particularly significant in situations where connectivity strength and dependability possess a degree of fuzziness, including communication networks with variable signal intensities or transit systems with unpredictable travel durations. In this article, we describe the types of edges in Pythagorean fuzzy graphs and the ideas of the Pythagorean fuzzy trees and cycles. We define the Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs using the concept of minimal Pythagorean fuzzy local edge cut. We provide the bounds for the Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs and strong Pythagorean fuzzy graphs. We discuss the Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity of edge-deleted Pythagorean fuzzy subgraphs of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs. Moreover, we determine the effect of the different types of edges on the Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity. We establish some results on Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity. Furthermore, we design some algorithms to compute the Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity of particular Pythagorean fuzzy graphs as complete Pythagorean fuzzy graphs and saturated Pythagorean fuzzy cycles. We provide the application of Pythagorean fuzzy average edge connectivity in human trafficking. Finally, we compare the suggested approach with an existing model to illustrate its viability and applicability.},

By transforming an existing sixth-order scheme without memory into with memory method, we elevate both the order of convergence and computational efficiency. To attain an accelerated order of convergence, we explore several distinct approximations of self-accelerated parameters, calculated based on the current and previous iterations using Hermite interpolation polynomials. Additionally, we eliminate the need for the second order derivative in the existing without memory method by employing a third-degree Hermite interpolating polynomial. Specifically, the proposed two-step method with memory enhances the R-order of convergence from 6 to 6.7015, 7, and 7.2749 without the need for additional function evaluations. The efficiency index of our method increases from 1.37 to 1.64. Notably, our proposed approach remains effective even when the derivative approaches extremely small values near the desired root or when $$f&#39;(u)$$ equals 0. We validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting numerical comparisons with several existing methods across a range of application-based problems. Finally, we employ basin of attraction plots to visualize the fractal behavior and dynamic characteristics of our proposed method in comparison to some existing methods.},

The mathematical theoretical work mainly gives the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution, provides the results related to stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, shows the dynamics of stochastic extinction and persistence in the mean, and proves the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution, which in turn provides a theoretical basis for numerical simulations. The numerical simulation work mainly reveals that the selectivity of zooplankton and nutritional of phytoplankton have a significant impact on the PP–NP–Z dynamics under random environmental fluctuation. It is worth emphasizing that the large nutritional value of preferred phytoplankton has the capacity to result in the extinction of nonpreferred phytoplankton, while the large nutritional value of nonpreferred phytoplankton may be able to initiate the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Furthermore, it should be noted that the increase of zooplankton selectivity or nutritional value of phytoplankton (preferred phytoplankton and nonpreferred phytoplankton) can cause the stationary distribution of preferred phytoplankton to shift to the left, but the stationary distribution of nonpreferred phytoplankton and zooplankton can shift to the right. These results may contribute to further understanding the complex dynamics of plankton models.},

We prove that the trace dual $${\mathscr {C}}^{Tr}$$ of an additive conjucyclic code $${\mathscr {C}}$$ is also an additive conjucyclic code. Moreover, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition of additive conjucyclic codes to be self-dual.

  abstract     = {Recently, many non-convex variational models have been developed to reduce staircase artifacts in the smooth regions of restored images. Among these models, the $$L^2$$ -norm is often used to capture high-frequency oscillation information in the image. However, this modeling method makes it difficult to separate the image structure component from the oscillation component. To address this problem, we propose a coupled non-convex hybrid regularization and weak $$H^{-1}$$ decomposition model for image denoising in this paper, which leverages non-convex TV and fractional-order TV regularizers to measure the structure and textural information of the image, respectively. Additionally, we employ weak $$H^{-1}$$ -space to model the oscillatory noisy component. By these modeling techniques, the proposed model effectively separates the high-frequency oscillation component and alleviates the staircase effect. To solve this non-convex minimization, an alternating direction method of multipliers combined with the majorization–minimization algorithm is introduced. Furthermore, we provide a detailed discussion on the convergence conditions of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our decomposition model in denoising applications. Moreover, compared with other variational models, our proposed model exhibits excellent performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index values.},

By combining these approaches, we obtain the exact solutions of initial value problems for a class of first-order and third-order nonlinear variable-coefficient ordinary differential equations. Firstly, the ETM (elastic up-order transformation method, elastic down-order transformation method) is employed to transform the nonlinear variable-coefficient ordinary differential equations into Bessel equations and Laguerre equations. Secondly, based on the general solution of the special equations and their initial value conditions, the similarity structure of the exact solution is derived using the SCM. Finally, the elastic inverse transformation is applied to obtain the similarity structure of the solution of the original nonlinear variable-coefficient ordinary differential equation, which is verified by plotting the curve of the solution. The findings reveal that the ETM expands the solvable class of variable-coefficient ordinary differential equations, and the SCM simplifies the solution process. The integration of both methods not only presents a novel approach for solving the initial value problem of nonlinear variable-coefficient ordinary differential equations but also offers new insights for the development of related computing software.},

  abstract     = {Modern networks like the internet and data grids are rapidly evolving and quickly growing in size. The investigation and study of their dynamism and stability necessitate the use of graph-theoretic approaches. Fuzzification of the network is unavoidable in order to incorporate their vast size. This paper proposes a network model, namely directed fuzzy incidence network (DFIN), suitable for dealing with networks of extraneous flows and support. It is a special kind of directed fuzzy incidence graphs that are both node and edge capacitated. Transportation networks may be most successfully assessed when they are regarded as directed fuzzy incidence networks. This study also concentrates on legal flow, saturated and unsaturated arc, arc cut, and legal flow enhancing path in a directed fuzzy incidence network. Legal flow on a directed fuzzy incidence network is defined as a function on the arc set in such a way that the legal flow of an arc never exceeds the corresponding legal incidence strength of the arc. Moreover, it holds node capacity constraint as well as flow conservation constraint. It is shown that the resultant legal flow out of the source is equal to the resultant legal flow into the sink for any legal flow defined on the directed fuzzy incidence network. Also, it is proved that the value of a legal flow can be determined using any arc cut in the directed fuzzy incidence network. The relation between the value of a legal flow and any arc cut in the directed fuzzy incidence network is established and a necessary and sufficient condition for their equality is obtained. Moreover, an equivalent condition for a legal flow to become maximum is given using enhancing paths. The ultimate goal of the work is to provide a DFIN-analog of max-flow min-cut theorem in graph theory. In addition, the paper proposes an algorithm for determining maximum legal flow in a directed fuzzy incidence network and illustrates it with an application in transport of commodities.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical ecosystems play a crucial role in our comprehension and conservation of ecology. Within these ecosystems, prey exhibits protective instincts that compel refuging behaviors to avoid predation risk. When the ratio of prey to predators falls below a threshold, prey seeks refuge. However, when prey is abundant relative to predators, these protective instincts are overridden as prey ventures out to forage. Therefore, this study develops a Filippov prey–predator model with fear effect on prey and switching of prey refuge behavior based on the ratio of prey to predators. Analytical and numerical approaches are used to address the dynamic behaviors, bifurcation sets, existence, and stability of various equilibria in this model. Additionally, the regions of sliding and crossing segments are analyzed. The bifurcation sets of pseudo-equilibrium and local and global sliding bifurcations are investigated. The numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the interplay between fear factor and other relevant parameters within the Filippov model, such as the threshold ratio and prey refuge. These investigations shed light on the influence of them in the model. The results indicate that increasing the fear factor results in a decrease in both prey and predator densities, thereby changing the behavior of the dynamics from a limit cycle oscillation to a stable state and vice versa. Notably, despite these population changes, neither species faces complete extinction.},

  abstract     = {An iterative proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for a parabolic optimal control problem is investigated in this paper. Firstly, we construct the finite element method, where piecewise linear continuous functions are used for space discretization, and the backward Euler method is used for time discretization. Secondly, we apply the POD method as a model order reduction method to reduce the computation. The different POD basis functions for the state and co-state variables are established by an iterative procedure, which takes the finite element solutions at some time instances as snapshots. A priori error estimates are derived for the state, co-state and control variables, respectively. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Let G be a connected graph. The Sombor index of a graph G is defined as $$SO(G)=\sum _{uv\in E(G)}\sqrt{d^2_{G}(u)+d^2_{G}(v)}$$ , where $$d_G(u)$$ denotes the degree of u in G. Let $${\mathscr {B}}^d_n$$ be the set of all bipartite graphs of diameter d with n vertices. In this paper, we determine the sharp upper bound on the Sombor index of $$G\in {\mathscr {B}}^d_n$$ . In addition, we propose an algorithm for searching the largest Sombor index among $${\mathscr {B}}^d_n$$ . Furthermore, the relationship between the maximal Sombor index of $$G\in {\mathscr {B}}^d_n$$ and the diameter d is established. Finally, we obtain the largest, the second-largest, the third-largest and the smallest Sombor indices of bipartite graphs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a second-order difference scheme is developed to solve two-dimensional two-sided space distributed-order fractional diffusion equation with variable coefficients. In the spatial direction, a second-order difference scheme is proposed, the distribution-order integral is discretized by the Gauss–Legendre quadrature formula and the space fractional derivative is approximated by the weighted and shifted Grünwald–Letnikov operators. In addition, the time direction is discretized into a second-order difference scheme by the Crank–Nicolson method. Therefore, the main numerical scheme is developed. Furthermore, a small perturbation is added to the main difference scheme to construct an alternating-direction implicit scheme. Also, the stability and convergence of the numerical scheme are proved. Finally, some numerical results are provided to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},
