  abstract     = {To guarantee the safety of flight operations, decision-support systems for air traffic control must be able to improve the usage of airspace capacity and handle increasing demand. This study addresses the aircraft conflict avoidance and trajectory recovery problem. The problem of finding the least deviation conflict-free aircraft trajectories that guarantee the return to a target waypoint is highly complex due to the nature of the nonlinear trajectories that are sought. We present a two-stage iterative algorithm that first solves initial conflicts by manipulating their speed and heading control and then identifying each aircraft’s optimal time to recover its trajectory towards their nominal one. We extend existing mixed-integer programming formulations by modelling speed and heading control as continuous variables while recovery time is treated as a discrete variable. We develop a novel iterative approach which shows that the trajectory recovery costs can be anticipated by inducing avoidance trajectories with higher deviation, therefore obtaining earlier recovery time within a few iterations. Numerical results on benchmark conflict resolution problems show that this approach can solve instances with up to 30 aircraft within 10 min.},

While existing research requires the non-negativity of the objective profit function, this paper considers real-world scenarios where costs may surpass revenue. Specifically, our problem can be regarded as maximizing the difference between a non-negative submodular function and a non-negative modular function under a knapsack constraint, allowing for negative differences. To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms. Firstly, we employ a twin greedy and enumeration technique to design a polynomial-time algorithm with a quarter weak approximation ratio, providing a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. Then, we incorporate a threshold decreasing technique to enhance the time complexity of the first algorithm, yielding an improved computational efficiency while maintaining a reasonable level of solution accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to study the profit maximization beyond non-negativity and to propose polynomial-time algorithms with a constant bicriteria approximation ratio.},

  abstract     = {The k-path partition problem (kPP), defined on a graph $$G=(V,E)$$ , is a well-known NP-hard problem when $$k\ge 3$$ . The goal of the kPP is to find a minimum collection of vertex-disjoint paths to cover all the vertices in G such that the number of vertices on each path is no more than k. In this paper, we give two approximation algorithms for the kPP. The first one, called Algorithm 1, uses an algorithm for the (0,1)-weighted maximum traveling salesman problem as a subroutine. When G is undirected, the approximation ratio of Algorithm 1 is $$\frac{k+12}{7} -\frac{6}{7k} $$ , which improves on the previous best-known approximation algorithm for every $$k\ge 7$$ . When G is directed, Algorithm 1 is a $$\left( \frac{k+6}{4} -\frac{3}{4k}\right) $$ -approximation algorithm, which improves the existing best available approximation algorithm for every $$k\ge 10$$ . Our second algorithm, i.e. Algorithm 2, is a local search algorithm tailored for the kPP in undirected graphs with small k. Algorithm 2 improves on the approximation ratios of the best available algorithm for every $$k=4,5,6$$ . Combined with Algorithms 1 and 2, we have improved the approximation ratio for the kPP in undirected graphs for each $$k\ge 4$$ as well as the approximation ratio for the kPP in directed graphs for each $$k\ge 10$$ . As for the negative side, we show that for any $$\epsilon &gt;0$$ it is NP-hard to approximate the kPP (with k being part of the input) within the ratio $$O(k^{1-\epsilon })$$ , which implies that Algorithm 1 is asymptotically optimal.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the vertex-traversing-constrained mixed Chinese postman problem (the VtcMCP problem), which is a further generalization of the Chinese postman problem, and this new problem has many practical applications in real life. Specifically, given a connected mixed graph $$G=(V, E\cup A; w,b)$$ with length function $$w(\cdot )$$ on edges and arcs and traversal function $$b(\cdot )$$ on vertices, we are asked to determine a tour traversing each link (i.e., either edge or arc) at least once and each vertex v at most b(v) times, the objective is to minimize the total length of such a tour, where $$n=|V|$$ is the number of vertices and $$m=|E\cup A|$$ is the number of links of G, respectively. We obtain the following four main results. (1) Given any two constants $$\beta \ge 1$$ and $$\alpha \ge 1$$ , we prove that there is no polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratios $$(1,\beta )$$ or $$(\alpha , 1)$$ for solving the VtcMCP problem, where an (h, k)-approximation algorithm for solving the VtcMCP problem is one algorithm that produces a solution with violating the vertex-traversing constraints by at most a ratio of h and with costing at most k times the optimal value; (2) We design a (3, 2)-approximation algorithm $${{\mathcal {A}}}$$ to solve the VtcMCP problem in time $$O(m^{2}\log n)$$ ; (3) We prove the fact that this algorithm $${{\mathcal {A}}}$$ in (2) is indeed an exact algorithm to optimally solve the VtcMCP problem for the case $$E=\emptyset $$ ; (4) We present an exact algorithm to optimally solve the VtcMCP problem in time $$O(m^{3})$$ for the case $$A=\emptyset $$ .},

The gas network design problem is generally modelled as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear integer programming problem (MINLP). The challenges of solving the resulting MINLP arise due to the nonlinearity and nonconvexity. In this paper, we propose a framework to study the “design variant” of the problem in which the variables are the diameter choices of the pipes, the flows, the potentials, and the states of various network components. We utilize a nested loop that includes a two-stage procedure that involves a convex reformulation of the original problem in the inner loop and an efficient enumeration scheme in the outer loop. We conduct experiments on benchmark networks to validate and analyze the performance of our framework.},

The strong convergence of our algorithms is analyzed when related parameters are properly chosen. Compared with most existing results where inertial factor must be less than 1, inertial factor can be taken 1 in our alternated inertial-type algorithm. The efficiency of our methods are illustrated by some numerical examples.},

Our focus is on problems where the reward functions can be non-monotone, and the constraint set is a general convex set. We first present the Single-sampling Non-monotone Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This algorithm only requires a single call to each reward function, and it computes the stochastic gradient to make it suitable for large-scale settings where full gradient information might not be available. We provide an analysis of the approximation ratio and regret bound of the proposed algorithm. We then propose the Bandit Online Non-monotone Frank-Wolfe algorithm to adjust for problems in the bandit setting, where each reward function returns the function value at a single point. We take advantage of smoothing approximations to reward functions to tackle the challenges posed by the bandit setting. Under mild assumptions, our proposed algorithm can reach $$\frac{1}{4} (1- \min _{x\in {\mathcal {P}}&#39;}\Vert x\Vert _\infty )$$ -approximation with regret bounded by $$O (T^{\frac{5 \min \{1, \gamma \}+5 }{6 \min \{1, \gamma \}+5}})$$ , where the positive parameter $$\gamma $$ is related to the “safety domain” $${\mathcal {P}}&#39;$$ .

  abstract     = {Nonlinear dependence on a probability measure has recently been encountered with increasing intensity in stochastic optimization. This type of dependence corresponds to many situations in applications; it can appear in problems static (one-stage), dynamic with finite (multi-stage) or infinite horizon, and single- and multi-objective ones. Moreover, the nonlinear dependence can appear not only in the objective functions but also in the constraint sets. In this paper, we will consider static one-objective problems in which the nonlinear dependence appears in the objective function and may also appear in the constraint sets. In detail, we consider “deterministic” constraint sets, whose dependence on the probability measure is nonlinear, constraint sets determined by second-order stochastic dominance, and sets given by mean-risk problems. The last mentioned instance means that the constraint set corresponds to solutions which guarantee acceptable values of both criteria. To obtain relevant assertions, we employ the stability results given by the Wasserstein metric, based on the $$ {{\mathcal {L}}}_{1} $$ norm. We mainly focus on the case in which a solution has to be obtained on the basis of the data and of investigating a relationship between the original problem and its empirical version.},

To find parameters corresponding to the optimal solution of the original problem, a system of nonlinear equations which the parameters should satisfy is studied. Then, the system is solved by a Newton-like algorithm, which needs to solve a convex programming problem in each iteration and has global linear and local superlinear/quadratic rate of convergence under some assumptions. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, our algorithm has a finite convergence, that is, the algorithm finds a solution after a finite number of iterations. The numerical results show that our method has much better performance than other reported methods for this class of problems.},

  abstract     = {Convex hull computation is a critical problem in computational geometry with a wide range of applications. Existing approaches focus on separate algorithms for calculating the convex hull of polygons and curvilinear polygons, leaving room for improvement in terms of efficiency and accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose the “Simulation of Progressively Supporting Elastic lines” (SPSEL) algorithm, which leverages the physical properties of elastic lines and their progressive support process. The SPSEL algorithm efficiently computes the convex hull of generic polygons that contain both straight and curved edges. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the SPSEL algorithm, including its terminology, overall process, and specific methods used in key algorithmic steps. Comparative tests are conducted to assess its performance, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the SPSEL algorithm compared to the Johnstone’s algorithm, specifically designed for curved convex hulls. The SPSEL algorithm exhibits efficiency and effectiveness in handling various types of generic polygons, showcasing its potential for achieving linear-time operations. Furthermore, the paper discusses the possibilities of extending the SPSEL algorithm to address the computation of convex envelopes for 3D shapes, a challenging research area with theoretical and practical implications. Overall, the SPSEL algorithm offers an advanced solution for computing convex hulls of polygons with both straight and curved edges, demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy compared to existing methods. These findings contribute to the field of computational geometry and have broad implications for applications requiring convex hull computation in diverse domains.},

In our innovative model management, we perform expensive function evaluations to identify feasible solutions that best reflect the decision maker’s preferences provided before the process. To assess the performance of our proposed algorithm, we utilize two distinct parameterless performance indicators and compare them against existing algorithms from the literature using various real-world engineering and benchmark problems. Furthermore, we assemble new algorithms to analyze the effects of the selection strategy and the model management on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The method has been developed for specific applications in wireless network communications, but its global convergence properties are shown to be superior on a more general class of functions f, namely sums of squares of absolute values of holomorphic functions. In particular, for such objective functions minima are surrounded by attraction basins, while the iterates are repelled from other types of critical points. We provide formulas for the asymptotic convergence rate and show that in the scalar case the method reduces to the well-known complex Newton method for the search of zeros of holomorphic functions. In this case, it exhibits generically fractal global convergence patterns.},

  abstract     = {Bi-quadratic programming over unit spheres is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics introduced by pioneer work of Einstein, Schrödinger, and others. It has been shown to be NP-hard; so it must be solve by efficient heuristic algorithms such as the block improvement method (BIM). This paper focuses on the maximization of bi-quadratic forms with nonnegative coefficient tensors, which leads to a rank-one approximation problem that is equivalent to computing the M-spectral radius and its corresponding eigenvectors. Specifically, we propose a tight upper bound of the M-spectral radius for nonnegative fourth-order partially symmetric (PS) tensors. This bound, serving as an improved shift parameter, significantly enhances the convergence speed of BIM while maintaining computational complexity aligned with the initial shift parameter of BIM. Moreover, we elucidate that the computation cost of such upper bound can be further simplified for certain sets and delve into the nature of these sets. Building on the insights gained from the proposed bounds, we derive the exact solutions of the M-spectral radius and its corresponding M-eigenvectors for certain classes of fourth-order PS-tensors and discuss the nature of this specific category. Lastly, as a practical application, we introduce a testable sufficient condition for the strong ellipticity in the field of solid mechanics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed results.},

This is a well-known NP-hard problem that frequently arises in various applications. We focus on two convex relaxations, namely the reformulation–linearization technique (RLT) relaxation and the SDP-RLT relaxation obtained by combining the Shor relaxation with the RLT relaxation. Both relaxations yield lower bounds on the optimal value of a quadratic program with box constraints. We show that each component of each vertex of the RLT relaxation lies in the set $$\{0,\frac{1}{2},1\}$$ . We present complete algebraic descriptions of the set of instances that admit exact RLT relaxations as well as those that admit exact SDP-RLT relaxations. We show that our descriptions can be converted into algorithms for efficiently constructing instances with (1) exact RLT relaxations, (2) inexact RLT relaxations, (3) exact SDP-RLT relaxations, and (4) exact SDP-RLT but inexact RLT relaxations. Our preliminary computational experiments illustrate that our algorithms are capable of generating computationally challenging instances for state-of-the-art solvers.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the problem of designing and building International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) taking into account some normative properties. We consider n asymmetric countries of the world, each one generating a quantity of pollutant emissions from the production of goods and services. We assume that individual emissions yield private benefits and negative externalities affecting all countries. To determine its own level of pollution, each state conducts a cost-benefit analysis. The absence of a supranational entity imposing emissions reduction makes IEAs based on voluntary participation. Examining the standard static non-cooperative game-theoretical model of coalition formation, we discover that the resulting emissions allocations might not be equitable à la Foley. It means that there might exist at least one player preferring to implement some other agent’s strategic plan instead of to play her own strategy. With the goal of studying whether equity, at least among coalesced countries, may be a criterion leading to social improvement, we introduce a new optimization rule. We require that members of an environmental coalition have to solve the maximization problem subject to the constraint imposing that they do not envy each other. Analyzing the particular case of two-player games, we get that, when countries are, in a sense, not too different from each other, our new mechanism endogenously induces social equity. By imposing a suitable total emission cap, the same results extend to all those games where our and standard solutions coexist and are different.},

In practical problems when c is unavailable, we design mPDACA and mDACA methods respectively for constrained and unconstrained settings, where novel distributed mechanisms are proposed to update the estimates of growth parameter c using only local quantities depending on local proximal operators or local gradients. We further derive theoretical guarantees and gradient computation and communication complexities for all four proposed algorithms.

We embark on our study by conducting the analysis of the optimality conditions of the sparse group optimization problem, leveraging the notion of a $$\gamma $$ -stationary point, whose linkage to local and global minimizer is established.

  abstract     = {In our paper, we consider the following general problems: check feasibility, count the number of feasible solutions, find an optimal solution, and count the number of optimal solutions in $${{\,\mathrm{\mathcal {P}}\,}}\cap {{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {Z}}\,}}^n$$ , assuming that $${{\,\mathrm{\mathcal {P}}\,}}$$ is a polyhedron, defined by systems $$A x \le b$$ or $$Ax = b,\, x \ge 0$$ with a sparse matrix A. We develop algorithms for these problems that outperform state-of-the-art ILP and counting algorithms on sparse instances with bounded elements in terms of the computational complexity. Assuming that the matrix A has bounded elements, our complexity bounds have the form $$s^{O(n)}$$ , where s is the minimum between numbers of non-zeroes in columns and rows of A, respectively. For $$s = o\bigl (\log n \bigr )$$ , this bound outperforms the state-of-the-art ILP feasibility complexity bound $$(\log n)^{O(n)}$$ , due to Reis &amp; Rothvoss (in: 2023 IEEE 64th Annual symposium on foundations of computer science (FOCS), IEEE, pp. 974–988). For $$s = \phi ^{o(\log n)}$$ , where $$\phi $$ denotes the input bit-encoding length, it outperforms the state-of-the-art ILP counting complexity bound $$\phi ^{O(n \log n)}$$ , due to Barvinok et al.

We use known and new methods to develop new exponential algorithms for Edge/Vertex Multi-Packing/Multi-Cover Problems on graphs and hypergraphs. This framework consists of many different problems, such as the Stable Multi-set, Vertex Multi-cover, Dominating Multi-set, Set Multi-cover, Multi-set Multi-cover, and Hypergraph Multi-matching problems, which are natural generalizations of the standard Stable Set, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set, Set Cover, and Maximum Matching problems.},

This paper studies randomized multiplicative updating algorithms for symmetric NTF via random projections and random samplings. For random projections, we consider two methods to generate the random matrix and analyze the computational complexity, while for random samplings the uniform sampling strategy and its variants are examined. The mixing of these two strategies is then considered. Some theoretical results are presented based on the bounds of the singular values of sub-Gaussian matrices and the fact that randomly sampling rows from an orthogonal matrix results in a well-conditioned matrix. These algorithms are easy to implement, and their efficiency is verified via test tensors from both synthetic and real datasets, such as for clustering facial images.},

In this paper, we consider unbounded CVOPs and propose an alternative solution methodology to compute or approximate the recession cone of the upper image. In particular, we relate the dual of the recession cone with the Lagrange dual of weighted sum scalarization problems whenever the dual problem can be written explicitly. Computing this set requires solving a convex (or polyhedral) projection problem. We show that this methodology can be applied to semidefinite, quadratic, and linear vector optimization problems and provide some numerical examples.},

Under mild assumptions, we establish the liminf-type convergence, lim-type convergence, and global convergence results of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is shown to reach the conclusion that the norm of the Riemannian gradient is smaller than $$\epsilon $$ within $${\mathcal {O}}(\frac{1}{\epsilon ^2})$$ iterations.

We add a Bregman distance to alleviate the difficulty of solving the nonsmooth subproblem. For the smooth subproblem, we directly perform a gradient descent step of the augmented Lagrangian function, which makes the computational cost of each iteration of our method very cheap. To our knowledge, the nonconvex ADMM with a relaxation factor $$\alpha \ne 1$$ in the literature has never been studied for the problem under consideration. Under some mild conditions, the boundedness of the generated sequence, the global convergence and the iteration complexity are established.

To solve this problem, we propose a new nonmonotone accelerated proximal gradient method with variable stepsize strategy. Note that incorporating inertial term into proximal gradient method is a simple and efficient acceleration technique, while the descent property of the proximal gradient algorithm will lost. In our algorithm, the iterates generated by inertial proximal gradient scheme are accepted when the objective function values decrease or increase appropriately; otherwise, the iteration point is generated by proximal gradient scheme, which makes the function values on a subset of iterates are decreasing. We also introduce a variable stepsize strategy, which does not need a line search or does not need to know the Lipschitz constant and makes the algorithm easy to implement. We show that the sequence of iterates generated by the algorithm converges to a critical point of the objective function. Further, under the assumption that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz inequality, we prove the convergence rates of the objective function values and the iterates. Moreover, numerical results on both convex and nonconvex problems are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method and stepsize strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an improved method for computing convex and concave relaxations of the parametric solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These are called state relaxations and are crucial for solving dynamic optimization problems to global optimality via branch-and-bound (B &amp;B). The new method improves upon an existing approach known as relaxation preserving dynamics (RPD). RPD is generally considered to be among the best available methods for computing state relaxations in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. However, it requires the solution of a hybrid dynamical system, whereas other similar methods only require the solution of a simple system of ODEs. This is problematic in the context of branch-and-bound because it leads to higher cost and reduced reliability (i.e., invalid relaxations can result if hybrid mode switches are not detected numerically). Moreover, there is no known sensitivity theory for the RPD hybrid system. This makes it impossible to compute subgradients of the RPD relaxations, which are essential for efficiently solving the associated B &amp;B lower bounding problems. To address these limitations, this paper presents a small but important modification of the RPD theory, and a corresponding modification of its numerical implementation, that crucially allows state relaxations to be computed by solving a system of ODEs rather than a hybrid system. This new RPD method is then compared to the original using two examples and shown to be more efficient, more robust, and of almost identical accuracy.},

We perform numerical experiments using the IOH profiler environment with the BBOB test function set and two difficult real-world problems. The experiments were carried out in two different but complementary ways: by measuring the performance under a fixed budget of function evaluations and by considering a fixed target value. The general conclusion is that Basin Hopping and its newly introduced population variant are almost as good as Covariance Matrix Adaptation on the synthetic benchmark functions and better than it on the two hard cluster energy minimization problems. Thus, the proposed analyses show that Basin Hopping can be considered a good candidate for global numerical optimization problems along with the more established metaheuristics, especially if one wants to obtain quick and reliable results on an unknown problem.},

The algorithm is motivated step by step beginning with a simple extension of CBO based on fixed scalarization weights. To overcome the issue of choosing the weights we propose an adaptive weight strategy in the second modeling step. The modeling process is concluded with the incorporation of a penalty strategy that avoids clusters along the Pareto front and a diffusion term that prevents collapsing swarms. Altogether the proposed K-swarm CBO algorithm is tailored for a diverse approximation of the Pareto front and, simultaneously, the efficient set of general non-convex multi-objective problems. The feasibility of the approach is justified by analytic results, including convergence proofs, and a performance comparison to the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms NSGA2 and NSGA3 as well as the recently proposed one-swarm approach for multi-objective problems involving consensus-based optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the difficulty of solving large-scale multi-dimensional knapsack instances (MKP), presenting a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. In this DRL framework, we train different agents compatible with a discrete action space for sequential decision-making while still satisfying any resource constraint of the MKP. This novel framework incorporates the decision variable values in the 2D DRL where the agent is responsible for assigning a value of 1 or 0 to each of the variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL model of its kind in which a 2D environment is formulated, and an element of the DRL solution matrix represents an item of the MKP. Our framework is configured to solve MKP instances of different dimensions and distributions. We propose a K-means approach to obtain an initial feasible solution that is used to train the DRL agent. We train four different agents in our framework and present the results comparing each of them with the CPLEX commercial solver. The results show that our agents can learn and generalize over instances with different sizes and distributions. Our DRL framework shows that it can solve medium-sized instances at least 45 times faster in CPU solution time and at least 10 times faster for large instances, with a maximum solution gap of 0.28% compared to the performance of CPLEX. Furthermore, at least 95% of the items are predicted in line with the CPLEX solution. Computations with DRL also provide a better optimality gap with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.},

A criterion-space branch-reduction-bound algorithm is then designed, which integrates some basic operations such as the two-level linear relaxation technique, rectangle branching rule and criterion-space region reduction technologies. The global convergence of the presented algorithm is proved by means of the subsequent solutions of a series of linear relaxation problems, and its maximum number of iterations is estimated on the basis of exhaustiveness of branching rule.

By applying Fenchel’s duality on the wait-and-see variables, we obtain an equivalent dual reformulation, which is a nonlinear static robust optimization problem. Using the dual formulation, we provide conditions under which the ARO problem is convex on the here-and-now decision. Furthermore, since the dual formulation contains a non-concave maximization on the uncertain parameter, we use perspective relaxation and an alternating method to handle the non-concavity. By employing the perspective relaxation, we obtain an upper bound, which we show is the same as the static relaxation of the considered problem. Moreover, invoking the alternating method, we design a new dual-based cutting plane algorithm that is able to find a reasonable lower bound for the optimal objective value of the considered nonlinear ARO model. In addition to sketching and establishing the theoretical features of the algorithms, including convergence analysis, by numerical experiments we reveal the abilities of our cutting plane algorithm in producing locally robust solutions with an acceptable optimality gap.},

We begin by investigating the convergence properties of this process, from subconvergence to R-linear convergence, with emphasis on tame objectives. Then we provide a numerically stable implementation based on truncated conjugate gradient. Applications to multidimensional scaling and regularized inversion are discussed and illustrated through numerical experiments on graph layout and X-ray tomography. In the end, quadratic MM not only offers solid guarantees of convergence and stability, but is robust to the choice of its control parameters.},

In this paper, we propose a variant of the commonly used P-formulation, called the P $$^*$$ -formulation, for the water treatment network (WTN) and the total water network (TWN) that includes water-using and water treatment units. For either type of networks, we prove that the P $$^*$$ -formulation is at least as strong as the P-formulation under mild bound consistency conditions. We also prove for either type of networks that the P $$^*$$ -formulation is at least as strong as the split-fraction based formulation (called SF-formulation) under certain bound consistency conditions. The computational study shows that the P $$^*$$ -formulation significantly outperforms the P- and the SF-formulations. For some problem instances, the P $$^*$$ -formulation is faster than the other two formulations by several orders of magnitudes.},

This results in an intuitive and generic approach that is exact, rigorous (robust to roundoff errors) and can be easily implemented in an off-the-shelf interval-based continuous solver that interleaves branching and constraint propagation. We demonstrate the validity of the approach on a numerical problem in which a categorical variable is described by a two-dimensional property space.

We call this problem a 1 + m TSHFS-LSP (two-stage hybrid flow shop, lot streaming problem), and show it to be NP-hard in general, except for the case when the sublot sizes are treated to be continuous. The novelty of our work is in obtaining closed-form expressions for optimal continuous sublot sizes that can be solved in polynomial time, for a given number of sublots. A fast linear search algorithm is also developed for determining the optimal number of sublots for the case of continuous sublot sizes. For the case when the sublot sizes are discrete, we propose a branch-and-bound-based heuristic to determine both the number of sublots and sublot sizes and demonstrate its efficacy by comparing its performance against that of a direct solution of a mixed-integer formulation of the problem by CPLEX®.},

Problems of this kind arise in many scientific applications, in particular, in finding working spaces of robots where it is necessary to determine not one but all the solutions of the system of nonlinear inequalities. Global optimization algorithms can be taken as an inspiration for developing methods for solving this problem. In this article, two new methods using two different approximations of Peano–Hilbert space-filling curves actively used in global optimization are proposed.

The perspective relaxation is often used to solve such models to optimality in a branch-and-bound context, especially in the context in which f is univariate (e.g., in Markowitz-style portfolio optimization). But such a relaxation typically requires conic solvers and are typically not compatible with general-purpose NLP software which can accommodate additional classes of constraints. This motivates the study of weaker relaxations to investigate when simpler relaxations may be adequate. Comparing the volume (i.e., Lebesgue measure) of the relaxations as means of comparing them, we lift some of the results related to univariate functions f to the multivariate case. Along the way, we survey, connect and extend relevant results on integration over a simplex, some of which we concretely employ, and others of which can be used for further exploration on our main subject.},

We consider three cases of parameterized convex programs: (1) partial convexity—functions in the convex programs are convex with respect to decision variables for fixed values of parameters, (2) joint convexity—the functions are convex with respect to both decision variables and parameters, and (3) linear programs where the parameters appear in the objective function. These new methods calculate an LD-derivative, which is a recently established useful generalized derivative concept, by constructing and solving a sequence of auxiliary linear programs. In the general partial convexity case, our new method requires that the strong Slater conditions are satisfied for the embedded convex program’s decision space, and requires that the convex program has a unique optimal solution. It is shown that these conditions are essentially less stringent than the regularity conditions required by certain established methods, and our new method is at the same time computationally preferable over these methods. In the joint convexity case, the uniqueness requirement of an optimal solution is further relaxed, and to our knowledge, there is no established method for computing generalized derivatives prior to this work. In the linear program case, both the Slater conditions and the uniqueness of an optimal solution are not required by our new method.},

  abstract     = {A new exact projective penalty method is proposed for the equivalent reduction of constrained optimization problems to nonsmooth unconstrained ones. In the method, the original objective function is extended to infeasible points by summing its value at the projection of an infeasible point on the feasible set with the distance to the projection. Beside Euclidean projections, also a pointed projection in the direction of some fixed internal feasible point can be used. The equivalence means that local and global minimums of the problems coincide. Nonconvex sets with multivalued Euclidean projections are admitted, and the objective function may be lower semicontinuous. The particular case of convex problems is included. The obtained unconstrained or box constrained problem is solved by a version of the branch and bound method combined with local optimization. In principle, any local optimizer can be used within the branch and bound scheme but in numerical experiments sequential quadratic programming method was successfully used. So the proposed exact penalty method does not assume the existence of the objective function outside the allowable area and does not require the selection of the penalty coefficient.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of configuring a power distribution network with reliability and resilience objectives by satisfying the demands of the consumers and saturating each production source as little as possible. We consider power distribution networks containing source nodes producing electricity, nodes representing electricity consumers and switches between them. Configuring this network consists in deciding the orientation of the links between the nodes of the network. The electric flow is a direct consequence of the chosen configuration and can be computed in polynomial time. It is valid if it satisfies the demand of each consumer and capacity constraints on the network. In such a case, we study the problem of determining a feasible solution that balances the loads of the sources, that is their production rates. We use three metrics to measure the quality of a solution: minimizing the maximum load, maximizing the minimum load and minimizing the difference of the maximum and the minimum loads. This defines optimization problems called respectively $$\min $$ -M, $$\max $$ -m and $$\min $$ -R. In the case where the graph of the network is a tree, it is known that the problem of building a valid configuration is polynomial. We show the three optimization variants have distinct properties regarding the theoretical complexity and the approximability. Particularly, we show that $$\min $$ -M is polynomial, that $$\max $$ -m is NP-Hard but belongs to the class FPTAS and that $$\min $$ -R is NP-Hard, cannot be approximated to within any exponential relative ratio but, for any $$\varepsilon &gt; 0$$ , there exists an algorithm for which the value of the returned solution equals the value of an optimal solution shifted by at most $$\varepsilon $$ .},

The first scheme can be viewed as an accelerated variant of Tseng’s forward-backward-forward splitting (FBFS) method, while the second one is a Nesterov’s accelerated variant of the “past” FBFS scheme, which requires only one evaluation of the Lipschitz operator and one resolvent of the multivalued mapping. Under appropriate conditions on the parameters, we theoretically prove that both algorithms achieve $$\mathcal {O}\left( 1/k\right) $$ last-iterate convergence rates on the residual norm, where k is the iteration counter. Our results can be viewed as alternatives of a recent class of Halpern-type methods for root-finding problems.

In the behavioral part, we justify the choice of the new perturbation, with the help of the main example that drives quasi-equilibrium problems: the Cournot duopoly model, which founded game theory. This requires to exhibit a new QEP reformulation of the Cournot model that will appear more intuitive and rigorous. It leads directly to the formulation of our perturbation function.

In the monotone case, the proposed algorithm can achieve $${\mathcal {O}}(1/t)$$ ergodic convergence rate in terms of the expected restricted gap function and, under the strongly generalized monotonicity condition, the proposed algorithm has a locally linear convergence rate of the Bregman distance between iterations and solutions when the sample size increases geometrically. Furthermore, we derive some results on stochastic local stability under the generalized monotonicity condition. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with some existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Many practical problems involve the optimization of computationally expensive blackbox functions. The computational cost resulting from expensive function evaluations considerably limits the number of true objective function evaluations allowed in order to find a good solution. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, in which a clustering-based local search technique is embedded into the radial basis function surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm framework to obtain sample points which might be close to the local solutions of the actual optimization problem. The algorithm generates sample points cyclically by the clustering-based local search, which takes the cluster centers of the ultimate population obtained by the differential evolution iterations applied to the surrogate model in one cycle as new sample points, and these new sample points are added into the initial population for the differential evolution iterations of the next cycle. In this way the exploration and the exploitation are better balanced during the search process. To verify the effectiveness of the present algorithm, it is compared with four state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms on 24 synthetic test problems and one application problem. Experimental results show that the present algorithm outperforms other algorithms on most synthetic test problems and the application problem.},

In a power system with abundant water resources, hydroelectric generation with high operational flexibility is a powerful tool to promote a higher penetration of wind and solar power generation. In this paper, we study the day-ahead scheduling of a thermal-hydro-wind-solar power system. The uncertainties of renewable energy generation, including uncertain natural water inflow and wind/solar power output, are taken into consideration. We explore how the operational flexibility of hydroelectric generation and the coordination of thermal-hydro power can be utilized to hedge against uncertain wind/solar power under a multistage robust optimization (MRO) framework. To address the computational issue, mixed decision rules are employed to reformulate the original MRO model with a multi-level structure into a bi-level one. Column-and-constraint generation (C &amp;CG) algorithm is extended into the MRO case to solve the bi-level model. The proposed optimization approach is tested in three real-world cases.

We introduce two kinds of vectorization functions by using the classical oriented distance function, and discuss their properties with respect to the set less order relation. By virtue of the image space analysis, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the weak s-minimal solution are established. We propose a regular weak separation function, which is utilized to construct a gap function and an error bound for the set optimization problem. Problems of uncertain multi-objective programming, shortest path and medical image registration are examined as applications of the results established in the paper.},

  abstract     = {While constrained, multiobjective optimization is generally very difficult, there is a special case in which such problems can be solved with a simple, elegant branch-and-bound algorithm. This special case is when the objective and constraint functions are Lipschitz continuous with known Lipschitz constants. Given these Lipschitz constants, one can compute lower bounds on the functions over subregions of the search space. This allows one to iteratively partition the search space into rectangles, deleting those rectangles which—based on the lower bounds—contain points that are all provably infeasible or provably dominated by previously sampled point(s). As the algorithm proceeds, the rectangles that have not been deleted provide a tight covering of the Pareto set in the input space. Unfortunately, for black-box optimization this elegant algorithm cannot be applied, as we would not know the Lipschitz constants. In this paper, we show how one can heuristically extend this branch-and-bound algorithm to the case when the problem functions are black-box using an approach similar to that used in the well-known DIRECT global optimization algorithm. We call the resulting method “simDIRECT.” Initial experience with simDIRECT on test problems suggests that it performs similar to, or better than, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms when solving problems with small numbers of variables (up to 12) and a limited number of runs (up to 600).},

In this way, the proposed algorithm is able to gradually guide the search towards the region of interest on the Pareto fronts during the solution process. We prove that the proposed algorithm obtains $$\varepsilon $$ -efficient solutions distributed among the regions of interest with respect to the given reference points.

Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a methodology used for optimization problems affected by random parameters with an uncertain probability distribution. In terms of the perturbed data, it is essential to estimate an appropriate support set for the probability distribution when formulating DRO models. In this study, we introduce two globalized distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) models that choose a core set based on data and a sample space containing the core set to balance the degree of robustness and conservatism simultaneously. The degree of conservatism can be controlled by the expected distance of random parameters from the core set. Under certain assumptions, we reformulate several GDRO models into tractable semi-definite programs. In addition, numerical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the GDRO approach and the relationship between the optimal objective values of the GDRO models and the size of the sample space and the core set.},

  abstract     = {We first provide an inner-approximation hierarchy described by a sum-of-squares (SOS) constraint for the copositive (COP) cone over a general symmetric cone. The hierarchy is a generalization of that proposed by Parrilo (Structured semidefinite programs and semialgebraic geometry methods in Robustness and optimization, Ph.D. Thesis, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 2000) for the usual COP cone (over a nonnegative orthant). We also discuss its dual. Second, we characterize the COP cone over a symmetric cone using the usual COP cone. By replacing the usual COP cone appearing in this characterization with the inner- or outer-approximation hierarchy provided by de Klerk and Pasechnik (SIAM J Optim 12(4):875–892, https://doi.org/10.1137/S1052623401383248 , 2002) or Yıldırım (Optim Methods Softw 27(1):155–173, https://doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2010.540014 , 2012), we obtain an inner- or outer-approximation hierarchy described by semidefinite but not by SOS constraints for the COP matrix cone over the direct product of a nonnegative orthant and a second-order cone. We then compare them with the existing hierarchies provided by Zuluaga et al. (SIAM J Optim 16(4):1076–1091, https://doi.org/10.1137/03060151X , 2006) and Lasserre (Math Program 144:265–276, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-013-0632-5 , 2014). Theoretical and numerical examinations imply that we can numerically increase a depth parameter, which determines an approximation accuracy, in the approximation hierarchies derived from de Klerk and Pasechnik (SIAM J Optim 12(4):875–892, https://doi.org/10.1137/S1052623401383248 , 2002) and Yıldırım (Optim Methods Softw 27(1):155–173, https://doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2010.540014 , 2012), particularly when the nonnegative orthant is small. In such a case, the approximation hierarchy derived from Yıldırım (Optim Methods Softw 27(1):155–173, https://doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2010.540014 , 2012) can yield nearly optimal values numerically.

This model is not only very flexible and scalable but can be efficiently computed in parallel. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm gPoETRBO for global optimization with large number of observations which combines trust region and gPoE models.

  abstract     = {Many papers in the field of integer linear programming (ILP, for short) are devoted to problems of the type $$\max \{c^\top x :A x = b,\, x \in {{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {Z}}\,}}^n_{\ge 0}\}$$ , where all the entries of A, b, c are integer, parameterized by the number of rows of A and $$\Vert A\Vert _{\max }$$ . This class of problems is known under the name of ILP problems in the standard form, adding the word ”bounded” if $$x \le u$$ , for some integer vector u. Recently, many new sparsity, proximity, and complexity results were obtained for bounded and unbounded ILP problems in the standard form. In this paper, we consider ILP problems in the canonical form $$\begin{aligned} \max \{c^\top x :b_l \le A x \le b_r,\, x \in {{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {Z}}\,}}^n\}, \end{aligned}$$ where $$b_l$$ and $$b_r$$ are integer vectors. We assume that the integer matrix A has the rank n, $$(n + m)$$ rows, n columns, and parameterize the problem by m and $$\Delta (A)$$ , where $$\Delta (A)$$ is the maximum of $$n \times n$$ sub-determinants of A, taken in the absolute value. We show that any ILP problem in the standard form can be polynomially reduced to some ILP problem in the canonical form, preserving m and $$\Delta (A)$$ , but the reverse reduction is not always possible. More precisely, we define the class of generalized ILP problems in the standard form, which includes an additional group constraint, and prove the equivalence to ILP problems in the canonical form. We generalize known sparsity, proximity, and complexity bounds for ILP problems in the canonical form. Additionally, sometimes, we strengthen previously known results for ILP problems in the canonical form, and, sometimes, we give shorter proofs. Finally, we consider the special cases of $$m \in \{0,1\}$$ . By this way, we give specialised sparsity, proximity, and complexity bounds for the problems on simplices, Knapsack problems and Subset-Sum problems.},

  abstract     = {DC (difference of convex functions) programming and DC algorithm (DCA) are powerful tools for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization. This field was created in 1985 by Pham Dinh Tao in its preliminary state, then the intensive research of the authors of this paper has led to decisive developments since 1993, and has now become classic and increasingly popular worldwide. For 35 years from their birthday, these theoretical and algorithmic tools have been greatly enriched, thanks to a lot of their applications, by researchers and practitioners in the world, to model and solve nonconvex programs from many fields of applied sciences. This paper is devoted to key open issues, recent advances and trends in the development of these tools to meet the growing need for nonconvex programming and global optimization. We first give an outline in foundations of DC programming and DCA which permits us to highlight the philosophy of these tools, discuss key issues, formulate open problems, and bring relevant answers. After outlining key open issues that require deeper and more appropriate investigations, we will present recent advances and ongoing works in these issues. They turn around novel solution techniques in order to improve DCA’s efficiency and scalability, a new generation of algorithms beyond the standard framework of DC programming and DCA for large-dimensional DC programs and DC learning with Big data, as well as for broader classes of nonconvex problems beyond DC programs.},

Firstly, we give the closed-form singular value shrinkage thresholding operators for several matrix-valued folded concave penalty functions. Secondly, we adopt a singular value shrinkage thresholding (SVST) algorithm for the nonconvex low-rank matrix optimization problem, and prove that the proposed SVST algorithm converges to a stationary point of the problem. Furthermore, we show that the limit point satisfies a global necessary optimality condition which can exclude too many stationary points even local minimizers in order to refine the solutions. We conduct a large number of numeric experiments to test the performance of SVST algorithm on the randomly generated low-rank matrix completion problem, the real 2D and 3D image recovery problem and the multivariate linear regression problem. Numerical results show that SVST algorithm is very competitive for low-rank matrix optimization problems in comparison with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The shadow price is, along with its close cousin, the Lagrange multiplier, one of the most important and fundamental concepts in operations research. However, the classical shadow prices have some significant drawbacks in nonconvex optimization models. First, the shadow prices are designed for the single resource, and are not applicable to explain the marginal utility when multiple resources are simultaneously changed. Moreover, in nonconvex optimization models, the Lagrange multipliers only provide the upper and lower bound of the shadow prices, which implies a practical difficulty in computing shadow prices. More importantly, the shadow prices are not continuous with respect to the variation of parameters of the optimization models, unless very strong assumptions are imposed. These drawbacks motivate us to develop a generalization of the shadow price, i.e., the directional shadow price, by using the lower and upper directional derivatives of the optimal value function. We also show that the minimum norm Lagrange multiplier is a kind of directional shadow price, which provides a tool for the computation of the directional shadow price. Moreover, we show that if the optimal solution set is lower semicontinuous with respect to the parameter, then the minimum norm Lagrange multiplier is continuous with respect to the variation of the parameter. Compared with other existing researches, the continuity of the minimum norm Lagrange multiplier holds under the weakest, to the best of our knowledge, conditions. The numerical examples support our results.},

  abstract     = {The efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm is widely used for solving expensive optimization problems, but it has been frequently criticized for its incapability of solving high-dimensional problems, i.e., problems with 100 or more variables. Extending the EGO algorithm to high dimensions encounters two major challenges: the training time of the Kriging model goes up rapidly and the difficulty of solving the infill optimization problem increases exponentially as the dimension of the problem increases. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient cooperative framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. In the proposed framework, we first randomly decompose the original high-dimensional problem into several sub-problems, and then train the Kriging model and solve the infill optimization problem for each sub-problem. Context vectors are used to link the sub-problems such that the Kriging models are trained and the infill optimization problems are solved in a cooperative way. Once all the sub-problems have been solved, we start another random decomposition again and repeat the divide-and-conquer process until the computational budget is reached. Experiment results show that the proposed cooperative approach can bring nearly linear speedup with respect to the number of sub-problems. The proposed approach also shows competitive optimization performance when compared with the standard EGO and six high-dimensional versions of EGO. This work provides an efficient and effective approach for high-dimensional expensive optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study restricted variations of the following obnoxious facility location problem in the plane: locate k new obnoxious facilities amidst n ordered demand points (existing facility sites) in the plane so that none of the existing facility sites are affected. We study this problem in two restricted settings. The obnoxious facilities are constrained to be centered on (i) a predetermined horizontal line segment $${\overline{pq}}$$ , and (ii) the boundary arc of a predetermined disk $${{\mathcal {C}}}$$ . For the problem in (i), we first give an $$(1-\epsilon )$$ -approximation algorithm that runs in $$O\left( (n+k)\log {\frac{||pq||}{2(k-1)\epsilon }}\right) $$ time, where $$\epsilon &gt;0$$ and ||pq|| is the length of $${\overline{pq}}$$ . We then propose two exact polynomial time algorithms, one based on doing binary search on all candidates and the other with the parametric search technique of Megiddo (J ACM 30:852–865, 1983); that will take $$O\left( (nk)^2 \right) $$ time and $$O\left( (n+k)^2 \right) $$ time respectively. Continuing further, using the improved parametric technique, we give an $$O(n\log {n})$$ -time algorithm for $$k=2$$ . We also show that the $$(1-\epsilon )$$ -approximation algorithm of (i) can be easily adapted to solve the problem (ii) with an extra multiplicative factor of n in the running time. Finally, we give a $$O(n^3k)$$ -time dynamic programming solution to the min-sum obnoxious facility location problem restricted to a line segment where the demand points are associated with weights, and the goal is to minimize the sum of the weights of the points covered.},

  abstract     = {One popular approach to access the importance/influence of a group of nodes in a network is based on the notion of centrality. For a given group, its group betweenness centrality is computed, first, by evaluating a ratio of shortest paths between each node pair in a network that are “covered” by at least one node in the considered group, and then summing all these ratios for all node pairs. In this paper we study the problem of finding the most influential (or central) group of nodes (of some predefined size) in a network based on the concept of betweenness centrality. One known approach to solve this problem exactly relies on using a linear mixed-integer programming (linear MIP) model. However, the size of this MIP model (with respect to the number of variables and constraints) is exponential in the worst case as it requires computing all (or almost all) shortest paths in the network. We address this limitation by considering randomized approaches that solve a single linear MIP (or a series of linear MIPs) of a much smaller size(s) by sampling a sufficiently large number of shortest paths. Some probabilistic estimates of the solution quality provided by our approaches are also discussed. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our methods in a computational study.},

It does not focus on dividing the region of interest into specific geometric shapes, but rather scatters several balls to cover it. In SCABALL, several potential optimal regions are selected at each iteration, and they are covered by smaller balls sequentially. In this way, the SCABALL ensures the everywhere dense convergence. The center points and radii of the scattered balls significantly influence the efficiency of SCABALL; therefore, the minimax designs are used in the initial and sequential stages to obtain better coverage. The SCABALL parameters, including the number of balls and their radii, were analyzed by numerical investigation. We provided the empirical choices for those parameters and found that the balls’ radii can be contracted to balance efficiency and global convergence. Numerical experiments show that the SCABALL algorithm is locally biased and robust.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a box-constrained global optimization problem for Lipschitz-continuous functions with an unknown Lipschitz constant. Motivated by the famous DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles), a new HALRECT (HALving RECTangles) algorithm is introduced. A new deterministic approach combines halving (bisection) with a new multi-point sampling scheme in contrast to trisection and midpoint sampling used in most existing DIRECT-type algorithms. A new partitioning and sampling scheme uses more comprehensive information on the objective function. Four different strategies for selecting potentially optimal hyper-rectangles are introduced to exploit the objective function’s information effectively. The original algorithm HALRECT and other introduced HALRECT variations (twelve in total) are tested and compared with the other twelve recently introduced DIRECT-type algorithms on 96 box-constrained benchmark functions from DIRECTGOLib v1.1, and 96 perturbed their versions. Extensive experimental results are advantageous compared to state-of-the-art DIRECT-type global optimization. New HALRECT approaches offer high robustness across problems of different degrees of complexity, varying from simple—uni-modal and low dimensional to complex—multi-modal and higher dimensionality.},

Existing methods mainly focus on linear errors-in-variables regression, while relatively little attention is paid for the case of multivariate responses, and how to achieve consistent estimation under corrupted covariates is still an open question. In this paper, a nonconvex error-corrected estimator is proposed for the matrix estimation problem in the multi-response errors-in-variables regression model. Statistical and computational properties for global solutions of the estimator are analysed. In the statistical aspect, the nonasymptotic recovery bound for all global solutions of the nonconvex estimator is established. In the computational aspect, the proximal gradient method is applied to solve the nonconvex optimization problem and proved to linearly converge to a near-global solution. Sufficient conditions are verified in order to obtain probabilistic consequences for specific types of measurement errors by virtue of random matrix analysis. Finally, simulation results on synthetic and real neuroimaging data demonstrate the theoretical properties and show nice consistency under high-dimensional scaling.},

  abstract     = {Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an often-used method to reduce the dimensionality of multidimensional data nonlinearly and to present the data visually. MDS minimizes some stress function which variables are coordinates of points in the projected lower-dimensional space. Recently, the so-called Geometric MDS has been developed, where the stress function and multidimensional scaling, in general, are considered from the geometric point of view. Using ideas of Geometric MDS, it is possible to construct the iterative procedure of minimization of the stress where coordinates of a separate point of the projected space are moved to the new position defined analytically. In this paper, we discover and prove the main advantage of Geometric MDS theoretically: changing the position of all the points of the projected space simultaneously (independently of each other) in the directions and with steps, defined analytically by Geometric MDS strategy for a separate point, decreases the MDS stress. Moreover, the analytical updating of coordinates of projected points in each iteration has a simple geometric interpretation. New properties of Geometric MDS have been discovered. The obtained results allow us for the future development of a class of new both sequential and parallel algorithms. Ideas for global optimization of the stress are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {We propose a general solution approach for min-max-robust counterparts of combinatorial optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives. We focus on the discrete scenario case, but our approach can be extended to other types of uncertainty sets such as polytopes or ellipsoids. Concerning the underlying certain problem, the algorithm is entirely oracle-based, i.e., our approach only requires a (primal) algorithm for solving the certain problem. It is thus particularly useful in case the certain problem is well-studied but its combinatorial structure cannot be directly exploited in a tailored robust optimization approach, or in situations where the underlying problem is only defined implicitly by a given software. The idea of our algorithm is to solve the convex relaxation of the robust problem by a simplicial decomposition approach, the main challenge being the non-differentiability of the objective function in the case of discrete or polytopal uncertainty. The resulting dual bounds are then used within a tailored branch-and-bound framework for solving the robust problem to optimality. By a computational evaluation, we show that our method outperforms straightforward linearization approaches on the robust minimum spanning tree problem. Moreover, using the Concorde solver for the certain oracle, our approach computes much better dual bounds for the robust traveling salesman problem in the same amount of time.},
